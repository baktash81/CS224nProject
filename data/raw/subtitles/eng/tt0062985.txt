1
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,996
- Hi.
- Hi, Lonny.

2
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,350
Freddie said something about driving up
to his father's farm until Monday morning.

3
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,351
Took his new wife to London
for a week.

4
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,983
Oh, it was a terrible drag.
He never stopped moving at me all night.

5
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,753
Don't you just hate wet lips?

6
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,732
Of course I brushed.

7
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,875
And I think Freddie's kid brother
who's AWOL from the Army.

8
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,714
I thought he ran away from home.

9
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,552
He got as far as the pool house.

10
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,457
Well, if it weren't for those sprinklers,
he'd never get any water on him.

11
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,026
Tim, coming home for dinner?

12
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,769
I'll fix you your pot roast.

13
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,602
Yeah.

14
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,604
Later.

15
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,924
Yeah. Listen, I should go.
Why don't you come about 12:30.

16
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,431
Okay, right, bye-bye.
See you then.

17
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,496
I won't be home for dinner.

18
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,869
- Freddie?
- Lenny.

19
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,655
Mrs. Austin?

20
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,829
Ivy, no!

21
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,691
What was that all about?

22
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,270
Oh, no. You get the car, I'll go see.
Get the car.

23
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,929
- Ivy...
- Doris.

24
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,507
Doris, what is the matter?

25
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,610
- Ivy says she's leaving.
- I am leaving.

26
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,771
- Just as soon as you get someone else.
- Frank, she can't just leave her family.

27
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,918
- Just like that?
- It's true, you have been like a family.

28
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,885
Like a family? Ivy, you are family.

29
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,856
I know what you really mean.

30
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,859
You wanna take your vacation now,
go to Florida and see your folks.

31
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,428
Well, that's fine with us.

32
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,157
No problem at all.
We'll fly you down and back.

33
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,324
Take all the time you want.
Take a week.

34
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,697
There's none of my folks left in Florida.

35
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,203
We'll send you anyplace you wanna go.

36
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,434
- Africa?
- I wanna move into the city, Mrs. Austin.

37
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,545
You have another job.

38
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,075
Judy Townsend. She came up here
last Tuesday night and stole her...

39
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,710
...right from under my nose. I'll kill her.
- It's not the Townsends.

40
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,323
Did Judy Townsend offer you a job
or didn't she?

41
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,517
- She's always offering me a job.
- I knew it. I'll kill her.

42
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,662
<i>- Listen, Ivy, if it's a question of money...
- Not money.</i>

43
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,426
I'll increase the people
for the heavy cleaning.

44
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,195
- It's not the work.
- What then?

45
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,433
- Frank.
- Just a minute.

46
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,733
- Wait in the car.
- Wait, I wanna find out...

47
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,036
I'll just be a minute.

48
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,368
All right.

49
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,914
Well, we'll work something out, Ivy.

50
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,819
You're pregnant.

51
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,081
No.

52
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:02,660
Mrs. Austin, we both have work to do.
May I?

53
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,902
You know, Ivy, nine years ago,
when we found you in Florida...

54
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:19,170
...you were an innocent,
scrawny 18-year-old...

55
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,905
...ignorant in the ways of the world.

56
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:26,984
If I'm in the city, I can get my high-school
diploma, then go on to secretarial school.

57
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,145
- You wanna be a secretary?
- Yes, ma'am.

58
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,192
Well, anyway, it took me exactly one week
to discover you were a gem.

59
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,764
And then, remember how...?
Where do you keep the clean sheets?

60
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,867
In the hall closet. I'll get them all later.

61
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,061
You remember how I went to
your grandmother and your aunt...

62
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,300
...and I asked them if they'd consider
letting you come up north with us?

63
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,445
That's the best news
they'd ever had, ma'am.

64
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,182
Ma'am.

65
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,809
You keep calling me "ma'am. "

66
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,787
And I keep meaning to tell you
to call me "Doris," like my friends.

67
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,755
Or "Mother," like Gena and Tim.

68
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,158
The fact I want to leave doesn't mean
I don't love all of you.

69
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,562
- It's just there's nothing here for me.
- Nothing?

70
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,939
I mean, you've got Mr. Austin,
Tim, Gena, your work.

71
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,940
I look ahead
and I don't see any of that.

72
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,971
Doris.

73
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,714
Doris, what is the problem?

74
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,916
- Ivy wants to leave.
- I know that. But what's the problem?

75
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,545
- If that's not a problem...
- A maid wants to leave, you get another.

76
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,248
- Dad!
- What do you mean, "Dad"?

77
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:43,691
Get three maids. Pick up the phone,
dial the employment agency.

78
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,196
You tell them to send over 82 candidates,
pick out 11 if you want.

79
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,357
- That simple?
- Yes, it's that simple.

80
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,335
- And so another little problem is solved.
- That's right.

81
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,873
Doesn't it matter to you that
she's like a member of the family?

82
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,603
Well, how do you suggest
that I express my grief?

83
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,577
Now, listen. This girl's been with us
for seven years...

84
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,443
- Nine.
- Nine years.

85
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,677
We all adore her, but if she wants to leave,
there's nothing we can do about it.

86
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,550
Ivy.

87
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,729
- Is it anything that I've done?
- Of course not, Gena.

88
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,228
Please don't make this any tougher.
It's taken me three days...

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,836
...to get up the courage as it is, girl.
- Okay, sure.

90
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,804
It's not as if I'm never gonna hear
from you again. You're gonna call me...

91
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,344
...at least five times a week, because
I got to know the latest on Freddie, Lenny...

92
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,539
...Jay, Jonathan, Bruce, Dick and Larry.

93
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,909
You forgot Peter.

94
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,990
I'm sorry, Mrs. Austin.

95
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,053
But...

96
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,829
...what if another nine years goes by,
nice and easy like the last...

97
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,994
...and I'm past 35
and I still have nothing?

98
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:04,108
Nothing? Oh, Ivy. You have a good job,
people who care for you, a good home.

99
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,475
Just a minute, Doris. Now, I don't think
Ivy's talking about any of those things.

100
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,479
It's not any of that.

101
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,676
In the city, I'll have a chance.
At least I have to try.

102
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,653
Try for what? What do you want?

103
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,122
I'm not sure.

104
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,395
I just know I haven't got it now.

105
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,337
I like this.

106
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,310
Think it's a little long, Freddie?

107
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,210
- You think it's too long?
- No.

108
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,943
Hey!

109
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,610
Come here.

110
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,522
Wiggy, would you take over for
Miss Thompson? Sandy, I'll be back.

111
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,891
Freddie, please don't grope the help.

112
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,336
- Who let you out?
- Never mind that, man. What's with Mom?

113
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,565
She's got the vapors.
Says she's not going on the Paris trip.

114
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,733
Ivy's quitting.

115
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,706
You're putting me on.

116
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,307
- Why?
- She wants to go out there.

117
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:23,147
- What's out there?
- Secretarial school. Career, love, marriage.

118
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,018
- Oh, she wants the mainstream?
- In no uncertain terms.

119
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,454
Well, we can't let her. No.

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,191
<i>I mean, if she gets out
from between me and Dad, he might...</i>

121
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,768
He might enlist me in the Army.

122
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,133
Yeah. Listen, we gotta talk about this.

123
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,733
Stop drooling.

124
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,746
Establishment-oriented chicks turn me off,
except as a social comment for my novel.

125
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,247
- I can't stand it here.
- Why don't you quit?

126
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,414
Why don't you give me
her telephone number.

127
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,583
If she wants to go to school,
she can go across the street.

128
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,990
- She insists on moving into the city.
- Why?

129
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,823
I don't know.

130
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,090
- Hi, Gena.
- Hi.

131
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,995
All right, you guys, you've all seen
Gena naked before.

132
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,575
It just occurred to me, this comes down
to the one big difference...

133
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,300
...between you and Ivy.
- Me?

134
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,707
- Yeah.
- What's color got to do with it?

135
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,542
No, no, no, no. Not color. Come here.

136
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:28,377
Wherever you go, you got 11 guys
looking to jump on you, right?

137
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,649
No. Maybe it's as simple as that.

138
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,621
Maybe all Ivy needs is some guy
to romance her a little.

139
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,489
I assume Ivy is well-taken-care-of
in that department.

140
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:41,497
No, no, no. Look, when is the last time
Ivy had a proper date?

141
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,033
- I don't know.
- See, I mean, it's easy for you.

142
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,139
Guys hang around here, they drive up
to the house, drink the old man's Scotch.

143
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,767
- You got more action than you can use.
- She goes into the city on her days off.

144
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,573
- So, what does she do there?
- I don't know.

145
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,181
- You tell her what you do?
- Yeah.

146
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,374
- She doesn't tell you what she does.
- No.

147
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,747
Then maybe she doesn't do anything.

148
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,251
Well, what can we do about it?

149
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,058
What if we line her up with a guy?

150
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,993
Like who?

151
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,599
I'm afraid my friends wouldn't qualify.

152
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,499
You're damn right.
None of them are good enough.

153
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,340
There's an idea.

154
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,379
- Not him.
- Hey, man.

155
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,744
- What?
- Hey, where are your bosses?

156
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,043
- In the office.
- What's the number there?

157
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,212
Read it off the truck, man.

158
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,362
Give me some change.

159
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,659
- What are you gonna...?
- What we need is a cat who's real safe.

160
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,962
- What are you gonna do?
- A swinger but a bum.

161
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,107
- No.
- Yeah. A cat we can control.

162
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,267
See, some guy who's gonna wine her
and dine her, man, but he won't marry her.

163
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,811
A good-looking no-goodnik.

164
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:07,314
Par-Tal Trucking? Yeah, this is Mr. Austin
of Austin Incorporated.

165
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,013
Yeah, I'd like to speak
to Mr. Parks or Mr. Talbot.

166
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,988
All you have to do, you get Ivy
here around, like, 2:30.

167
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,062
Now, it's gonna look like an accident
to her. But I'm gonna set this dude up.

168
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,599
- You can't use the business to blackmail.
- Will you just get Ivy here, please?

169
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,066
<i>Hello, Parks? Yes, this is Mr. Austin.</i>

170
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,336
<i>I was wondering if you were free
to come up here for a little late lunch.</i>

171
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,176
Hi, boss.

172
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,682
Hey!

173
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,516
Come here.

174
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,925
Hey, what's happening?

175
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,899
- Where's your father?
- No, no. He didn't phone you. I did.

176
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:39,271
Listen, anything you wanna eat,
I'll get it for you, man. Sit down.

177
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,980
What do you want?

178
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,986
- Some of that iced coffee will do.
- No, no. That's iced tea. Hey, babe.

179
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,649
Little iced tea for Mr. Parks.

180
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,021
- So how you been?
- Fine. Fine.

181
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,233
- I was fine Monday night, and I'm fine now.
- Yeah, Monday night was a gas.

182
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,134
- You're not married, are you?
- No. Why?

183
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,141
No, a nice-looking cat like you,
you're obviously not uptight for bread.

184
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,370
You're not gay, are you?

185
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,845
- No, I'm not.
- Well, you can't hardly tell these days...

186
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,418
You get me up here
for a sociological discussion?

187
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,214
- No.
- You owe me money?

188
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,558
- You know I'm strictly cash with you, man.
- Then why did you get me up here?

189
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,991
We got a maid named Ivy.

190
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,557
I want you to take her out.

191
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,359
Put that on my bill, baby.

192
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,941
While I'm here, I will talk to your father.
You ought to be put away, man.

193
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:51,215
I worked this morning until 5:30. Then
I had to be up at 8 to go to the office...

194
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,181
...because my partner, Prince Talbot,
refuses to get up.

195
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,379
Two of my drivers are sick
and half the deliveries are late.

196
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,492
What I'm trying to tell you is,
this trip wasn't necessary.

197
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,460
- You'll like her.
- What makes you think I'd be a good stud?

198
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,997
All spades are superior
at that kind of thing.

199
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,398
Sonny...

200
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,831
...why aren't you wrapping packages...

201
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,340
...instead of procuring
for colored domestics?

202
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,970
This is a very special case, man.
She wants to quit after nine years!

203
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,446
- Then let her.
- Impossible.

204
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,819
I got news for you, Charlie.
Slavery's been abolished, man.

205
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,891
- All I want you to do is meet her.
- You said you wanted me to take her out.

206
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,651
- Just meet her.
- Why me?

207
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,523
Man, you fit the bill.

208
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,029
You obviously aren't married because
you got problems of your own.

209
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,533
And besides,
you're kind of a shady character.

210
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,739
Excuse me.

211
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,306
Would you mind leaving the tip?

212
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,161
- Sir?
- Put that on my bill, baby.

213
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:21,671
Sorry, Tim, but orders from your father.
Strictly cash.

214
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,740
You're kidding.

215
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,247
Hey, forgot your change, man.

216
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,823
I got it for you.
What's your first name, by the way?

217
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,430
Jack.

218
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,998
I always think of you as "Par" of Par-Tal.

219
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,604
When you're not thinking of me
as that uppity spade with the trucks.

220
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,171
- Hey. I love you, man.
- Yeah.

221
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,036
- Why are you so hostile?
- Damned if I know.

222
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,044
By the way, how did you expect
to get me to do this?

223
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,645
By appealing to your better nature.

224
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,915
Okay.

225
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,314
Racial togetherness?

226
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,581
How about exposure?

227
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,984
- Exposure?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,962
<i>Yeah, I got a square friend of mine
who writes articles for the Daily News.</i>

229
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:26,070
And it occurred to me, you'd make
a groovy subject for a piece, man.

230
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,069
Your whole trucking operation.

231
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,911
You wouldn't do that.

232
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,546
That's a fascinating story.

233
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,480
- You're a rotten kid.
- I'm just trying to be helpful.

234
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,715
- I was a Boy Scout in my early adolescence.
- You're wasting your time.

235
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,419
There's a wild coincidence, man.
Look, there's Ivy now, with my sister, Gena.

236
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,396
Headline's "Truck Tycoon Trapped. "

237
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,202
Hey, Gena.

238
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,604
Oh, Ivy, there's Tim.

239
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,041
And I wonder who that
good-looking man is with him.

240
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:14,477
Hey, Gena! Now, it's gonna be no problem
at all to meet Ivy, man. No problem.

241
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,113
Hey, this is a surprise.

242
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,755
Yeah. I just talked Ivy
into getting some shoes.

243
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,759
I don't need shoes.

244
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,291
Gena, this is Jack Parks.
Jack, this is my sister, Gena.

245
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,956
- How do you do?
- Hello.

246
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,365
You must be that marvelous Mr. Parks
Tim's always talking about.

247
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,971
Yeah.

248
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,666
- You know, Ivy, the one with all the trucks.
- I never heard anything...

249
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,107
And this is Ivy Moore, Jack.

250
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,178
- How do you do, Miss Moore?
- Fine, I'm sure.

251
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,013
- I really don't need shoes.
- Well, I don't see how you could...

252
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,283
...do without a pair of those...

253
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,655
...imported Italian Florentine flats.

254
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,058
Well, I gotta split.

255
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,830
Listen! Why don't we go down to
the cafeteria for a bite? I'm starving.

256
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,701
- So am I.
- I just fed you lunch.

257
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,806
I have a better idea. Mr. Parks,
as long as you're in the neighborhood...

258
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,744
...come to the house for dinner.
We'd love to have you.

259
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,680
- I thought you weren't coming home.
- I changed my mind.

260
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,184
That's a great idea.
What's for dinner tonight?

261
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,414
- I told you. Pot roast.
- Groovy.

262
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,991
Jack, Ivy's pot roast
is out-of-sight, man.

263
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,862
I don't care for pot roast, man.

264
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,195
Neither do I. How about some of that
fantastic bouillabaisse of yours?

265
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,860
Whatever you want.

266
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,030
<i>Bouillabaisse takes a long time,
but with me helping...</i>

267
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,938
How is 9:00, Mr. Parks?

268
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,006
How is 9:00, Mr. Parks?

269
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,626
I have a feeling
you're gonna get run over by a truck...

270
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:10,234
...and beaten up
by a lot of colored people. Okay, babes?

271
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,775
Where to, man?

272
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,149
Get over to Northern Boulevard.
I'll be picked up in Great Neck.

273
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,189
Not in Nassau! Do we have to?

274
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,327
- The state fuzz worry me.
- A lot of things worry me, Jerry.

275
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,690
Now will you get up in the cab?

276
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,535
<i>- Yeah.
- Where's Jack?</i>

277
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,678
<i>- He's asleep again.
- Well, wake him up.</i>

278
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,574
Okay.

279
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,684
- What?
- Billy wants you.

280
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,852
He called.

281
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,227
- Good evening.
- Hi.

282
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,401
Hi. Big night tonight.

283
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,073
Hello.

284
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,672
And the winner, sir.

285
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,704
Dr. Morgan, a marker for 2 grand.

286
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,371
Numbers, dice. Big numbers!

287
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,650
Seven. The shooter loses.

288
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,811
- Having a rough night, Dr. Morgan.
- Welcome back, Jack.

289
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,547
- My marker okay?
- Yeah.

290
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,456
- Harry, give Dr. Morgan what he wants.
- Thank you, Jack.

291
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,494
He's already into us
for 5 grand from last month.

292
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,570
Yeah. What are you worried about?

293
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,500
Haven't you heard of the Morgan family?

294
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,372
Banks, Wall Street, the whole bit.

295
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,279
- He's one of those?
- No, he's not.

296
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:22,148
He's a hustling chiropractor from Yonkers,
so you don't let him get in too deep.

297
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,289
Business, man. I got problems
with that shipping department.

298
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,158
Since when did you care?

299
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,494
Hey, this dress is gonna look
fantastic on you.

300
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,866
- Wrong!
- Ivy, Ivy, Ivy.

301
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,235
- I won't wear it, and that's that!
- You're a drag, you now that?

302
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:47,708
I mean, like, how come you keep your hair
like this? Gotta be a better way.

303
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,916
- What difference does it make?
- It's nothing to me.

304
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:01,616
But what if you go to live in the big city?
You're gonna be looking to score with guys.

305
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,285
It just seems to me that you gotta be,
you know, more with the scene.

306
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,559
- Anything else wrong with me?
- I don't know. Gena?

307
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,259
Oh, if I could just have
about 20 minutes with her.

308
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:16,567
Yeah. Like, see, maybe you could
do something with her eyelashes.

309
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,074
- Oh, I could do so much with her eyes.
- Yeah.

310
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,406
- Like sex them up, you know.
- Right, right.

311
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,572
You're a fine one to talk.

312
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,717
Just look at you.

313
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,912
I agree with your father. You're a mess!

314
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,148
Go take a shower.

315
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,024
<i>Okay, pick me up in a couple...</i>

316
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,379
His car's here.

317
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:04,212
Hey, Jack, you're right on time.
Oh, wow, you're gorgeous.

318
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,520
We're delighted you could come,
Mr. Parks.

319
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,937
You'll love Ivy's cooking.

320
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,473
Excuse me.

321
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,494
Where are your folks?
I thought they'd be here.

322
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,433
They suddenly couldn't make it, man.
There's a big fire at the store.

323
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,735
Actually, it was a small fire.
It could've been big, though.

324
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,213
Minor smoke damage?

325
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,556
- How about a drink?
- I don't drink.

326
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,419
Some pot?

327
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,953
No, thanks.

328
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,095
Your folks know
you keep pot in the house?

329
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,960
Oh, I haven't got any.

330
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,068
Then why did you ask me?
Suppose I'd said yes?

331
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:28,295
Then I'd have looked around
and pretended I'd just run out.

332
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,777
You're crazy.

333
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,207
Everybody over 30 like you
think people my age are crazy.

334
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,682
That's the generation gap.

335
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:48,354
What's it called when people like you think
everyone like me turns on all the time?

336
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,289
Stupidity?

337
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,126
I'll serve them. It's my job.

338
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,874
Evening.

339
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,046
Oh, won't you have some of Ivy's
delicious canapés, Mr. Parks?

340
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,846
<i>The stuffed green olives are...</i>

341
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,955
Won't you sit down?

342
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:44,205
- Tim, why doesn't Mr. Parks have a drink?
- No, he claims he doesn't drink.

343
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,275
- Coffee?
- There should be some...

344
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,511
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it.

345
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,518
Ivy, why don't you sit down.

346
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,305
These are very good.

347
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,237
Thank you.

348
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,756
Tell me, Mr. Parks, what do you
think of the Black Power movement?

349
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,828
I think about it a lot.

350
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,999
- And do you approve of it?
- I don't talk about it.

351
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,202
- Hey, coffee.
- Oh, coffee.

352
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,071
Thank you.

353
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,518
Ivy goes to a lot of civil-rights meetings.
Don't you, Ivy?

354
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,557
Once in a while.

355
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,696
It's a place sometimes to meet people.

356
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,857
I was in an elevator once
with Ralph Bunche.

357
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,162
He stepped on my foot.

358
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,133
That can be a problem
when you don't wear shoes.

359
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,537
No, he said, "Excuse me. "

360
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,442
I've been on a lot of picket lines
and things.

361
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:27,313
In fact, last year I was even in jail once
overnight because I refused bail.

362
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:35,525
Ivy belongs to the NAACP.
Don't you, Ivy?

363
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,286
Excuse me.

364
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,292
I really have to see about the dinner.

365
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,333
Excuse me.

366
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,837
I better help. Excuse me.

367
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,944
- What's the...?
- Because he's colored...

368
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,706
...you have to talk about colored things?
- I don't.

369
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,850
Why do you make me sit in
the living room? I never do that.

370
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:04,148
This is the first time we ever had a man
like him here, Ivy. I think he likes you.

371
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,290
He doesn't like me.

372
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,357
If only you'd worn another dress.

373
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,255
- Gena!
- Ivy...

374
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:15,491
...this is a business thing for Tim.
It'll make him look good with Dad, okay?

375
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,662
Okay.

376
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,468
But I'm gonna serve the meal
the way I'm supposed to.

377
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,509
- No nonsense about that.
- Word of honor.

378
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,174
Coffee?

379
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,218
- No, thank you.
- Yes, I'll have a cup.

380
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,998
- Would you like me to change the music?
- No. It's fine.

381
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:57,306
- That was a very nice dinner.
- Thank you.

382
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,675
It isn't hard when you know how.

383
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,641
Did you learn from your mama?

384
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,179
My grandmama. She brought me up.

385
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,749
<i>I hear that you...</i>

386
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,912
I hear you wanna split from here. Why?

387
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,148
I mean, it looks like a pretty good setup.

388
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,255
Too good.

389
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,827
I don't want to die here.

390
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,988
Well, you gotta die someplace.

391
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,931
Well, isn't it better if you don't go
ignorant and alone?

392
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,398
Much better.

393
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,911
Thank you.

394
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,610
I want to go to school.
Maybe learn to be a secretary.

395
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,522
I'd like to meet people.

396
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,626
- Where are you from?
- Florida.

397
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,526
You're from the West Indies, aren't you?

398
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,759
Yes. You can still hear it?

399
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,233
A little.

400
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,963
Brandy, Jack?

401
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,572
- Bran...?
- No, thank you.

402
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,810
Cigar?

403
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,754
Your father will kill you. Those are Cubans
he smuggled from Canada.

404
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,255
He knows I smoke these all the time.

405
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,624
How do you like her?

406
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,168
She's okay. But she's not my type.

407
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,038
What, because she's a domestic?

408
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,105
The domestic.

409
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,838
You wind up married
to a girl like that.

410
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,472
<i>No, no. We don't want that, though.
See, man. No...</i>

411
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,747
- Would you like a pear with your cheese?
- I would.

412
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,629
Where do you go on a big date?

413
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,493
- Out.
- No, no. What do you do?

414
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,693
If I wanna take a chick out
and I really wanna impress her.

415
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,838
First, I'd get dressed.

416
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,736
No, no. After that, man.
I mean, like, what's your favorite food?

417
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,968
Japanese.

418
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,370
There's a lovely place
on East 53rd Street.

419
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,574
But you gotta call the day before.
Very expensive.

420
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,219
Tim, help Ivy.

421
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,321
Ivy, you're beautiful.
Listen, thanks a lot.

422
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,191
Business-wise,
things are going great for me in there.

423
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,195
Better take that pear out to Jack.

424
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,197
And tell him it's okay for Monday.

425
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,428
- What's okay for Monday night?
- He wants to take you out.

426
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,505
That's what he said.
Dinner. Show.

427
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,506
- He didn't ask me.
- Because Monday isn't your night off.

428
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,371
He figured he'd check with us.

429
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,776
I said it was fine. The folks are going
to the golf banquet.

430
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,416
- What golf banquet?
- The golf banquet.

431
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,449
You don't believe me? Ask Gena.

432
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,316
Get out there before he thinks
you don't want to go.

433
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,925
Why would he want to take me out?

434
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,426
Maybe he's looking
for a religious experience.

435
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,440
Monday night would be just fine.

436
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,039
- Monday?
- For the Japanese dinner.

437
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,544
- Folks won't be home. Inventory.
- Golf banquet.

438
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,579
Golf banquet.

439
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,414
Monday night.

440
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:35,818
You know, one good meal deserves
another. So Monday night is just fine.

441
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,169
You two are really very cute.

442
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,211
I'm really beginning to like you.

443
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,848
That's better than not liking us.

444
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,388
Like I said, man, we love you.

445
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,021
Listen, my car should be here any
minute now, but suppose I send it away?

446
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,664
Your folks aren't due back...?

447
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,800
- No, not for a couple of hours.
- Why?

448
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,768
Well, since you're so interested
in getting everybody all fixed up...

449
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:25,136
...how about me and you swinging together
and let your brother take the maid?

450
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,867
You and me? What do you mean?

451
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,535
Come on, baby,
you know what I mean.

452
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:35,380
And it doesn't matter that you don't have
any pot. I got something much better.

453
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,616
If we all let our hair down...

454
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:47,196
...we could really, really trip out.

455
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,028
No, see, I don't think
you quite understand.

456
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,468
What would you say they were, man?

457
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,114
Thank you.

458
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:14,123
- They look like aspirin.
- Yeah. They look like aspirin.

459
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,459
Could I have a glass of water, please?

460
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,156
- Oh, no trouble at all.
- Thank you.

461
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,665
They've got "B" written on them.

462
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,202
"B" is for "boffo," baby.

463
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:33,537
Two of those and we'll all be swinging
from the chandeliers naked.

464
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,440
- Tim, he means an orgy.
- Yeah.

465
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,278
See, I don't think
you quite understand.

466
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,182
I understand, man.

467
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:48,223
I know where it's at with people
like you in the suburbs.

468
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:52,795
Wife-swapping and key parties.
But that ain't nothing, baby.

469
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,158
This is where it's at.

470
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,359
The car's here!

471
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,411
Thank you.

472
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,558
Just a little headache.

473
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,425
Thank you for the dinner.

474
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:38,132
We'll meet at the restaurant at 7:00,
220 East 53rd Street.

475
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,608
- Oh, you really don't have to, you know.
- I know I don't.

476
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,938
See you.

477
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,878
Good night.

478
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:01,825
You know, I think he really does
like me a little.

479
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,932
- Well, want to help with the dishes?
- Oh, there aren't that many, Ivy.

480
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,306
Tim, what do you think?

481
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,420
Miss Moore?

482
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,502
Mr. Parks is awaiting you. Please.

483
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,221
Your shoes, please.

484
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,895
Your shoes.

485
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,808
Hello.

486
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,743
Some wild place.

487
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,917
Sit you down.

488
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,836
I ordered your sake warm, okay?

489
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,038
- Don't they speak English?
- Yes.

490
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,273
Why do you talk to them in Japanese?

491
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,845
- Maybe because I'm pretentious.
- No.

492
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,024
If you lucky enough
to know a foreign language...

493
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,659
...you should use it
as much as you can.

494
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,024
- Where'd you learn Japanese?
- In the Army.

495
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,363
Don't mind my being served first.
It's an old Japanese custom.

496
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,668
You like this kind of service, don't you?

497
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,672
Well, when you're born to it, baby.

498
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,378
Why pretend you haven't earned
what you got?

499
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,379
Do I do that?

500
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,710
- I'd think you'd be proud.
- Maybe.

501
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,158
But look at all you've done.

502
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
- What more you want?
- I don't want to get married.

503
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,830
Did I say you did?

504
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,765
I just want that established.

505
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,599
I was married. That's a bad scene.

506
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,537
- Well, I don't want to get married either.
- Yeah.

507
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,644
I don't!

508
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,207
I've scuffled for myself since I was 12...

509
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,478
...and I'm not giving that up
for no two-bit hustler.

510
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,121
I don't mean you.

511
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,781
What could you want from me?

512
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,695
What would you be giving up?

513
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,026
I don't know.

514
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,707
The right to go where I want,
do what I want.

515
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,547
Why did you come out with me...

516
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,808
...if there's nothing in it for you?

517
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,078
I'll have a good, interesting evening.

518
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,621
I'll steal an ashtray for my room.

519
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,726
That'll always remind me
what a nice dinner we had.

520
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:28,354
It doesn't matter that we never
see each other again. That happens.

521
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:34,164
Anyway, I get a nice dinner and Par-Tal
Trucking stays in good with the Austins.

522
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,863
You do make me feel
like a hustler.

523
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,236
- I don't mean to.
- Does it happen often?

524
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,939
I mean, guys taking you out
and, you know, not calling again.

525
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,182
Once in a while.

526
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,284
Those are the dues you pay
for being free, aren't they?

527
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,226
Look, I know you have
someplace else to go.

528
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,249
What's it supposed to be, a play?

529
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,615
That's a real family. They live there.

530
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,923
All the time. Day and night.
It's been going on for seven months.

531
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,523
How can I explain it?
They just live there all the time.

532
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,966
Haven't you read about it?

533
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:18,263
I mostly watch TV.
News and old movies.

534
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,202
Mama! I've got to go to the john!

535
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,951
Beautiful! Beautiful!

536
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,890
What happened?

537
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,530
They hardly ever say anything.

538
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,365
They're very alienated, you know.

539
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:48,164
It's just nice to be here
when they say something.

540
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:52,741
Just like home, except if I worked for these
people, I'd keep the place a lot neater.

541
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,140
I bet you would.

542
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,394
You've got six minutes to the 1:00.

543
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,596
I'll wait for the 3:30.

544
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,368
If I get home too early, I'll never
be able to convince Gena and Tim...

545
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,603
...that I had a wonderful time.
- 3:30?

546
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:08,046
You mean you're gonna sit here
for two and a half hours? Girl, that's crazy!

547
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,850
I did have a wonderful time.

548
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:18,060
Okay. Good night.

549
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,321
Good night.

550
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,979
You shouldn't wipe that off.
It looks lovely.

551
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,515
Besides, it doesn't matter
what people think.

552
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,051
See you.

553
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,052
Bye.

554
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

555
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,880
I'll take care of this.

556
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,082
Kept some coffee hot for you.

557
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,193
Oh, it's too late.

558
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,759
Did you have a good time?

559
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,898
Marvelous.

560
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,635
He took me to see this
weirdie family living on a stage.

561
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,102
The runaway priest still live with them?

562
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,401
- The one with the bongos?
- Yeah.

563
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,504
When I was there two weeks ago,
he was almost thrown out by the mother.

564
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,583
Don't you want some coffee?

565
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,777
See you at breakfast.

566
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,554
Ive?

567
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,719
Did he ask you out again?

568
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,191
Maybe he'll call.

569
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,014
He'd be crazy not to.

570
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,625
How are you?

571
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,000
Ace, deuce. Crap.

572
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:51,504
Down on the frontline.
Coming out again.

573
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,903
Looking for me?

574
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,509
Pass the dice.

575
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,646
Buy me a drink?

576
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,808
Your dice, ma'am.

577
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,159
Brandy, please.

578
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,624
What can I do for you?

579
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,730
When are you gonna call Ivy again?

580
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,570
<i>Listen, you...</i>

581
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,140
Why don't you just go on home?

582
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,575
- Don't blow your cool, man.
- I'm not blowing my cool, man.

583
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:34,945
When I blow my cool,
you get washed. Clear?

584
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,382
<i>Now...</i>

585
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,953
She was your family's maid,
but she doesn't want to be anymore.

586
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,527
She wants to split.
That's all there is to it.

587
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,630
No, no. Wrong, man.

588
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:53,734
I was a kid when Ivy came. I've known her
half my life. She's like a sister.

589
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,771
- I don't wanna marry your sister.
- Just take her out.

590
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,876
- You take her out.
- I've thought of it. I've thought of it.

591
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:05,447
When I was 17, we were alone one night
watching television, and I made a move.

592
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,674
She laughed. And I sprained my ankle.

593
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,446
Don't think that didn't come up
in my analysis. I can't bear rejection.

594
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,645
Something wrong?

595
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,689
This hippie-dippy little mother
is out-of-line again.

596
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,793
Oh, lay off him, man.
He did his duty!

597
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,863
- Billy, are you married?
- No. Separated.

598
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,762
Maybe you two could alternate.

599
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,262
Go home, boy.
Play with your daddy's money.

600
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:32,431
See, I could make a very loud,
indignant announcement...

601
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,737
...that these babies are loaded.

602
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,788
- Give me those dice.
- No, no, no. I would.

603
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,788
You are gonna get smashed.

604
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,298
All you have to do
is take her out once more.

605
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,026
I said, no.

606
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:06,139
Good evening, Mrs. Clark.
Having a big night?

607
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:42,370
- Harry, I'm gonna need last night's receipts.
- In a minute.

608
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:46,273
I'm sorry, we're booked for Monday,
unless you want a single tomorrow.

609
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:50,212
Yes, we can take a pair near 6:00.
Fine. You're all set. Bye-bye.

610
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:58,457
Hello, Par-Tal. Hi, Dr. Green. Sure,
a single tonight? That's no problem.

611
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:02,220
Same place?
Fine, you're set then.

612
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:04,560
Can I help you?

613
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:09,761
I'm looking for Mr. Parks' apartment.

614
00:55:09,936 --> 00:55:13,099
Honey, I'm sorry.
Jack's gotta work tonight.

615
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:20,876
- Who shall I say was calling?
- That's all right.

616
00:55:22,582 --> 00:55:24,550
Ivy Moore.

617
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:28,677
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

618
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,382
He's got a date with you.

619
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,857
- I thought he did.
- I'm sorry, my mistake.

620
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,996
Harry, take over the pickups.

621
00:55:37,163 --> 00:55:39,688
Mrs. Kling on two.
Number one, Fifth Avenue.

622
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,961
Lurleen?

623
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:43,625
Your coat.

624
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:46,601
- I think we're going out.
- No charge.

625
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:49,401
I'm Billy Talbot, Jack's partner.

626
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:54,413
- Is this the Par-Tal office?
- The best part of it.

627
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:09,219
Hey, Jack.

628
00:56:15,068 --> 00:56:17,229
The artist is Charles White.

629
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,594
- Hello.
- Hey, man. It's late. You're not dressed.

630
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:51,601
- I'm taking Miss Moore out.
- Take her with us.

631
00:56:51,771 --> 00:56:54,638
- Jack, I need you.
- What happens when I need you...

632
00:56:54,808 --> 00:56:57,834
...during the daytime operation?
- That's not my bag.

633
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:00,536
- It's my bag.
- Downstairs in 10 minutes. You too.

634
00:57:00,714 --> 00:57:03,808
- Look, man, these 20-hour days...
- Ten minutes, man!

635
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:10,387
All right, kids.
Turn off the television.

636
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:14,391
Five minutes with the fish, okay?
That's all, five minutes.

637
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:23,235
Wake up, Morris, man. You're supposed
to be vicious, baby. Come on, Morris.

638
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:27,870
- Who's been over-feeding Morris?
- He's always hungry, Jack.

639
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,305
Piranhas are supposed
to be hungry, baby.

640
00:57:30,477 --> 00:57:34,880
A well-filled piranha is just another
lazy fish, you hear?

641
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:37,917
I never saw a pet piranha before.

642
00:57:38,084 --> 00:57:43,784
Well, it's a constant reminder to me of what
it's like out there in the jungle of life.

643
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:45,584
Wake up!

644
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:54,460
<i>This house is...</i>

645
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,933
We own it. Par-Tal does, anyway.

646
00:57:58,104 --> 00:58:00,937
- Any of these children yours?
- No.

647
00:58:01,107 --> 00:58:04,668
- Got any children of your own?
- Nope.

648
00:58:09,582 --> 00:58:12,517
I'm not sure I should
even go out with you.

649
00:58:12,685 --> 00:58:14,175
Why not?

650
00:58:14,354 --> 00:58:16,345
Well, I seem to be in the way here.

651
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:19,083
Well, I didn't think I'd have
to work tonight.

652
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:22,023
What kind of work do you do
dressed like that?

653
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:23,852
You don't know?

654
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,998
Know what?

655
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,407
- I'm going to the movies.
- Wait a minute.

656
00:58:42,882 --> 00:58:44,611
Wait a minute.

657
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:49,553
Look, lady. I called you and
asked you to go out, didn't I?

658
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:52,919
- Well, I'm gonna take you out, okay?
- But you don't want to.

659
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:54,753
I want...

660
00:58:54,928 --> 00:58:58,523
Say, what kind of place is this?

661
00:58:59,399 --> 00:59:04,063
Lillian, look in on the kids and get
them into bed for me, will you?

662
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:29,888
- Hey, Pat.
- Hey, Billy.

663
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:47,044
- How many?
- Thirty-six.

664
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:23,114
Okay, Billy, move her out.

665
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:27,883
And have Eddie check in at 11:30.
I might want a pickup about 12:00.

666
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:37,954
You really didn't know
about this, did you?

667
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:41,658
I don't know if I believe
what I see even now.

668
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:45,395
- But I guess I should say I'm sorry.
- What for?

669
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:49,007
There's nothing two-bit
about your hustle.

670
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,343
Ladies and gentlemen,
the games are now open.

671
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:03,344
Place your bets, please.
Thank you.

672
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:35,983
Must be some lawbreakers abroad.

673
01:01:36,656 --> 01:01:38,351
Must be.

674
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:41,253
Banco.

675
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:52,703
- What's it mean when they say "banco"?
- I'll explain it to you later.

676
01:01:56,309 --> 01:02:01,440
Those children there in the building,
they just live there, huh?

677
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:05,744
Yes, like I said, we own the building,
their parents work for us...

678
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:08,113
...and we all live in the house, okay?

679
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:12,087
Eleven. Winner, pay the line.

680
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:19,463
- I know a little bit about dice, and I got $10.
- You're not allowed.

681
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:23,796
- Why not?
- We don't take from blood.

682
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:32,874
<i>- Yeah?
- Do you want the pickup?</i>

683
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:37,182
Well, do you or don't you?

684
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,341
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

685
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,285
Listen to old lover-boy Billy.
If you gotta think about it, don't do it.

686
01:02:43,456 --> 01:02:46,516
Tell Eddie to...

687
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:51,659
...pick me up at 12:00.
You know why?

688
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,598
I can handle her.

689
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:41,675
- Where is the...?
- It's down that hall.

690
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:43,645
- What?
- The bathroom.

691
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:46,376
I was looking for the kitchen.

692
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:53,189
You were looking for my kitchen?

693
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,790
Why were you looking for my kitchen?

694
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,200
I just wanna look at it.

695
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:05,360
Okay.

696
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:16,540
- My kitchen.
- It's a little small.

697
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:22,119
Somebody really keeps it clean.

698
01:04:22,288 --> 01:04:26,190
Lillian comes in every day,
so I can't use you.

699
01:04:35,968 --> 01:04:39,631
I'm not planning on doing
that kind of work anymore.

700
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:28,313
Leave it. I will not get a hernia
reaching for the ashtray.

701
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:31,388
You'd let me hold it
if I was Japanese.

702
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:33,388
But you're not Japanese.

703
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:36,027
- You're a 28-year-old...
- Twenty-seven.

704
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:39,562
- Colored girl looking to get married.
- Why do you keep saying that?

705
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:44,396
Because I'm a 36-year-old colored man
who's looking to stay single.

706
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:58,906
Is it true they give you baths?

707
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:02,316
- Who gives who baths?
- Japanese girls.

708
01:06:02,488 --> 01:06:05,548
I take showers twice a day.

709
01:06:05,725 --> 01:06:09,422
Generally by myself.
But it is fun to take...

710
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:13,759
...a shower with someone.
- I've never done that.

711
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:18,531
Well, you obviously have been
going around with unsanitary men.

712
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:23,107
I don't go with anybody. Why don't
you sit down and get comfortable.

713
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:35,210
I'm comfortable.

714
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:47,492
Why don't I rub your feet.

715
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,568
I can rub my own feet.

716
01:06:51,203 --> 01:06:53,831
And I would, if they hurt.

717
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:57,198
Which they don't.

718
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:16,889
Just like color TV,
the fish-tank. Or like home.

719
01:07:19,565 --> 01:07:22,500
When I was a girl, my grandmama
used to take me fishing.

720
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:24,966
Sometimes it was the only food
we ever had.

721
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:27,002
- Do you ever go home?
- No.

722
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:31,610
Well, there's a big orange-juice canning
factory where my grandmama used to live.

723
01:07:31,777 --> 01:07:34,143
Can I get you a cookie?

724
01:08:00,573 --> 01:08:02,564
I think it's time I...

725
01:08:06,345 --> 01:08:07,937
...took you home.

726
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:11,473
Oh, it's no problem.
Tomorrow's my day off.

727
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:15,984
Well, I have to work night and day.

728
01:08:16,856 --> 01:08:19,120
When you go to jail,
can I bring you cookies?

729
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:21,384
That's not funny.

730
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:24,958
Will it be funny if you get caught?

731
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:29,760
You're a reformer. I knew it.

732
01:08:29,935 --> 01:08:32,335
A holy-roller reformer.

733
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:34,439
I'm not.

734
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:40,272
I'm not anything. That's the trouble.

735
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,881
Wrong, lady.

736
01:08:48,788 --> 01:08:51,086
- You're something.
- Well, you don't want me...

737
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:53,555
...so I can't be very much.

738
01:08:53,726 --> 01:08:55,853
Suppose I did want you?

739
01:08:56,028 --> 01:08:59,259
- I wouldn't mind.
- You just throw yourself at anybody?

740
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:02,767
- Well, you're not just anybody.
- That's right.

741
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:09,273
Look, I'll call Eddie, and he can ride you
around a while before he takes you home.

742
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,672
Preserve your reputation
as a swinger.

743
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:19,183
- Why wouldn't you mind?
- Because I like you!

744
01:09:20,419 --> 01:09:22,944
That goes to show how wrong you are.
See that fish?

745
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:26,353
That piranha strikes at anything
in its way. That's me.

746
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:31,485
And with little chicks like you,
I'm murder, girl.

747
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:34,497
I mean, there are bodies strewn
all over this city.

748
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:40,606
- I'll bet there are.
- Yeah, you better believe there are.

749
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:57,811
You don't have to call anybody.
I'll take the bus.

750
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,720
Oh, no, you won't.

751
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:04,989
I'm not going through that again, seeing
you in that miserable place by yourself.

752
01:10:05,164 --> 01:10:07,223
You're not giving me guilts, baby.

753
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,025
Well, I'm not going home
in a limousine.

754
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:14,536
- All right, I'll take you home.
- I don't want you to.

755
01:10:14,707 --> 01:10:16,470
Come on.

756
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:26,882
Why'd you even bring me here?

757
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,551
Let's call it temporary insanity.

758
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:32,919
The last thing I wanna do is get
involved with someone like you.

759
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:35,959
Well, you don't have
to see me anymore.

760
01:10:36,128 --> 01:10:40,997
- What kind of talk is that?
- But I do like you.

761
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:44,200
You shouldn't like me.

762
01:10:49,108 --> 01:10:52,043
I'm no good. I'm a piranha.

763
01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:54,229
- What are you doing?
- You were asleep.

764
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,152
And I couldn't sleep.

765
01:13:19,658 --> 01:13:21,319
It's so quiet here.

766
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,648
- Do you know what?
- What?

767
01:13:52,157 --> 01:13:55,649
- There's one bobwhite at the Austins'.
- Yeah?

768
01:13:55,828 --> 01:13:58,023
Drives me crazy.

769
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:02,323
Your people are home.

770
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,603
I saw them through the window.

771
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,580
Go back to sleep.

772
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:47,605
Hey!

773
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:52,414
Let's take a shower.

774
01:14:56,688 --> 01:14:58,315
Later.

775
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:28,983
Wait for me. I'll be out soon.

776
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:36,359
Come by at about 8:30,
and I'll fix you something cold.

777
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,788
Hi.

778
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,133
Something sure smells good.

779
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:49,565
It may interest you to know
that I have a limousine waiting.

780
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:51,709
And it is because that is class.

781
01:15:51,877 --> 01:15:55,074
- Now, tell me everything.
- Later. You get back to that blender.

782
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:58,375
- Well, I'll help just as soon as I change.
- No, no, no, no.

783
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:04,079
It's still your day off. And besides,
you have someone waiting.

784
01:16:04,256 --> 01:16:06,383
Yes, ma'am.

785
01:16:16,235 --> 01:16:19,295
I give you a simple thing to do,
and you make a mess of it.

786
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,961
- Mother!
- Can't you hear him?

787
01:16:21,139 --> 01:16:23,266
- Where's his gray blazer?
- His gray blazer.

788
01:16:23,442 --> 01:16:25,239
- Hey, where's Ivy?
- Changing.

789
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,675
- Wherever Ivy put it, Frank!
- You catch the limousine bit?

790
01:16:29,348 --> 01:16:33,216
- Where are you going, Tim?
- I'm going downtown for a burger.

791
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:38,647
I am making dinner,
and you will stay and eat it.

792
01:16:38,824 --> 01:16:41,884
I can't find it anywhere.
And there's no hot water!

793
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:45,852
It was supposed to be fixed, Frank!

794
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:50,263
- She must've really made out.
- I cannot bear vulgarity!

795
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:53,063
What's going on? Did you call
the employment agency?

796
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:55,900
Why hasn't that been done?
Why are we without a maid?

797
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,201
Why are we eating here
on Ivy's night out?

798
01:16:58,377 --> 01:17:01,278
What are you trying to prove, Doris?
This is ridiculous!

799
01:17:01,446 --> 01:17:03,971
There's no ice in the bar.

800
01:17:06,785 --> 01:17:09,185
I want my gray blazer!

801
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:15,025
Ivy?

802
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:19,663
- Ivy?
- Yes?

803
01:17:20,832 --> 01:17:23,164
Mr. Austin can't find his gray blazer.

804
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:26,031
It'll be back from the cleaner's tomorrow.

805
01:17:26,838 --> 01:17:29,932
But, Ivy, there doesn't seem
to be any hot water.

806
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,668
I know. It's that starter.

807
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:35,870
- It's manual.
- Manual?

808
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:39,449
I'll fix it before I go.

809
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:43,220
Ivy?

810
01:17:43,388 --> 01:17:46,255
I've never made gravy in my life.

811
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,594
Gena knows how.

812
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:53,730
What a terrible mistake.

813
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:56,367
I'm so stupid, Ivy.

814
01:17:56,535 --> 01:18:00,369
Yes, I have such feelings of inadequacy.

815
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:04,407
So I decided, "Well, I've run
a home before. I'll do it again. "

816
01:18:04,776 --> 01:18:06,539
It's a disaster.

817
01:18:06,712 --> 01:18:10,204
- I tell you, that dinner smells good.
- No, it doesn't.

818
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:13,317
- You're just out of the habit.
- Why am I out of the habit?

819
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,113
Because I'm so used to you
doing everything for me.

820
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:19,849
I've become too dependent, Ivy,
and that's always bad.

821
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:23,222
Oh, I don't know.
Now and then you meet someone...

822
01:18:23,395 --> 01:18:26,296
...you don't mind depending on.
- Like Mr. Parks?

823
01:18:26,465 --> 01:18:28,057
Maybe.

824
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,964
You going out to dinner again
with him tonight?

825
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:36,198
Right now.

826
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:39,811
<i>Dinner and...</i>

827
01:18:40,445 --> 01:18:44,404
He wants to take me out to dinner,
but I think I'm gonna cook for him.

828
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:47,310
Then a movie and...

829
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,781
...then...

830
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:52,654
...just, you know.

831
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:55,356
Yes, I know.

832
01:18:57,162 --> 01:18:59,130
Did he ask you out tonight?

833
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:01,162
- Well, yes.
- He asked you?

834
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,527
- Yes, why?
- Well, it's simply...

835
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:07,194
...that I don't want you
to get into any trouble, Ivy.

836
01:19:07,372 --> 01:19:10,739
No danger of that.
I got those pills Gena gave me.

837
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:14,436
Pills. Pills?! Gena?

838
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:16,945
She said they were
from your prescription.

839
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:20,380
- I was talking about the gambling.
- Mother, the roast is ready...

840
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,214
- What do you know about the gambling?
- Oh, Lord.

841
01:19:23,388 --> 01:19:27,256
What did you have to threaten him with
this time to get that limousine here?

842
01:19:27,426 --> 01:19:30,395
- Mother, please!
- What do you know about the gambling?

843
01:19:33,965 --> 01:19:36,126
Well, won't somebody answer me?

844
01:19:36,368 --> 01:19:37,528
Later.

845
01:19:37,702 --> 01:19:40,193
I wanna know what you all
know about Jack Parks!

846
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:42,033
What's going on?

847
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,502
- Ivy, what's the matter?
- Ivy, it isn't Mom's fault.

848
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:48,202
- She knows only what we told her.
- I just learned.

849
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,972
- What did you learn?
- What is it?

850
01:19:50,148 --> 01:19:53,208
- Listen, Ivy...
- Do you know about that truck?

851
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:55,376
- Yes.
- Is that how you got him to do it?

852
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:58,148
- Do what?
- Mother, it was not any of your business.

853
01:19:58,323 --> 01:20:01,292
I guess it wasn't any
of my business either!

854
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,690
So that's how you did it!

855
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:07,161
Threatened to tell about the gambling
if he didn't take me out!

856
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:09,892
- He never wanted to take me out!
- What gambling?

857
01:20:10,068 --> 01:20:12,764
The worst I figured was
he wanted to stay in good.

858
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:15,668
- Ivy, you're making too much of this.
- I trusted you!

859
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:20,005
- You were supposed to be my friend!
- I am your friend.

860
01:20:20,178 --> 01:20:23,147
- You expect to make me stay here?
- That's why we did it.

861
01:20:23,315 --> 01:20:26,250
- Who did what?
- Is that so bad, that we love you enough...

862
01:20:26,418 --> 01:20:29,581
...to want you to stay?
- That's not why you want me to stay.

863
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:34,157
We'll even send you to secretarial school,
the same way we'd send Tim and Gena.

864
01:20:34,326 --> 01:20:36,760
Frank and I talked about it,
didn't we, Frank?

865
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:39,362
You can live here and go to school,
like they do.

866
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:43,900
I don't wanna be like Gena and Tim!
Milk-fed and coddled!

867
01:20:44,069 --> 01:20:47,800
I'm going to leave and live
in the city, now!

868
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:50,635
<i>- Ivy, please, will you let me explain?
- Ivy, Ivy...</i>

869
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:52,709
Ivy, I wanna know what's going on.

870
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:56,279
- Oh, Frank.
- Don't "Oh, Frank" me!

871
01:20:56,448 --> 01:21:00,111
<i>Ivy, please. I don't understand,
you know, I...</i>

872
01:21:00,552 --> 01:21:02,315
Whatever they did...

873
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:05,149
...well, maybe they meant well.

874
01:21:05,323 --> 01:21:07,223
I hope they did.

875
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:12,520
Some big joke.

876
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:16,433
My hustler boyfriend.

877
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:24,473
And my family.

878
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:26,611
Ivy, I didn't mean to.
Please, Ivy.

879
01:21:26,778 --> 01:21:32,444
Nobody has to trick anybody
into taking you out. Nobody!

880
01:21:33,051 --> 01:21:34,882
Leave her alone.

881
01:21:37,455 --> 01:21:39,980
You're all fired.

882
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:43,056
I don't want your crummy job.

883
01:21:43,228 --> 01:21:46,720
And I don't mean only from the job.
You're fired from the family.

884
01:21:46,898 --> 01:21:50,925
- You cretin! And get your hair cut!
- Don't you shout at him!

885
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:54,230
- Ready?
- No!

886
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:57,264
You can take off without me.

887
01:21:57,442 --> 01:21:59,967
Well, what am I gonna tell Jack?

888
01:22:00,946 --> 01:22:05,713
You tell him, for me, that I said
that he's a low-down...

889
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:11,618
...scroungy, lowlife,
miserable, rotten...

890
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:14,457
...West Indian!

891
01:22:14,626 --> 01:22:16,093
Sure.

892
01:22:18,663 --> 01:22:21,632
<i>Ivy, please. Ivy, just...</i>

893
01:22:28,807 --> 01:22:30,900
- Get off the phone!
- I have to call Lenny.

894
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:34,944
- Yeah, that's another cretin!
- Now, I can't let him walk into this!

895
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:41,375
Tim?

896
01:22:43,088 --> 01:22:44,817
Could I...

897
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:49,224
...borrow your old camp trunk?

898
01:22:50,128 --> 01:22:52,028
Sure, Ive.

899
01:22:53,398 --> 01:22:54,797
Thank you.

900
01:23:01,473 --> 01:23:03,202
All right.

901
01:23:05,977 --> 01:23:09,276
If that's what everybody wants...

902
01:23:09,814 --> 01:23:12,078
...that's the way it's going to be.

903
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:23,187
I don't need any maid.

904
01:23:27,365 --> 01:23:31,324
I used to run this house
before Ivy came...

905
01:23:32,203 --> 01:23:34,194
...and I can run it again.

906
01:23:42,414 --> 01:23:45,941
I don't have to go to Europe
on the buying trip.

907
01:23:48,286 --> 01:23:52,313
I don't have to work
in the store anymore.

908
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:03,491
- Where is she?
- She didn't come.

909
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:07,035
- I can see that, man, but why?
- I don't know why, man.

910
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:11,608
<i>She told me to tell you you were
a scroungy, rotten, lowlife...</i>

911
01:24:11,776 --> 01:24:14,210
I lost her after "lowlife. "

912
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:21,012
You stick close tonight.
I may need you. Use my car.

913
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:50,138
What happened, baby?

914
01:24:51,549 --> 01:24:54,484
- Turn right.
- Jersey's to the left, baby.

915
01:24:54,652 --> 01:24:56,415
We're going on Northern Boulevard.

916
01:24:56,588 --> 01:24:59,614
To Nassau again? You're crazy.

917
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:02,851
- Jerry.
- Okay.

918
01:25:44,369 --> 01:25:48,100
- I'll have Eddie pick you up.
- I won't be long. Circle around a while.

919
01:25:49,407 --> 01:25:50,897
Oh, man!

920
01:25:54,112 --> 01:25:56,876
<i>- Why are we stopped?
- We're on Long Island.</i>

921
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:58,777
<i>- Where?
- The Austin house.</i>

922
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:01,748
<i>Then he's insane. Get out of here, man.</i>

923
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,615
<i>- He wants 10 minutes.
- All right.</i>

924
01:26:03,788 --> 01:26:06,188
Give him 10 minutes,
but have Eddie pick him up.

925
01:26:06,357 --> 01:26:07,949
<i>Okay.</i>

926
01:26:21,372 --> 01:26:23,033
What do you want?

927
01:26:28,213 --> 01:26:31,182
- Where is she?
- Doris, call the police.

928
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:36,181
Ivy?

929
01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:42,659
On top of everything else,
breaking and entering.

930
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,629
Ivy?

931
01:26:50,802 --> 01:26:52,463
She's in there.

932
01:26:56,441 --> 01:26:59,001
Get away from my door!
I don't wanna see you!

933
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:03,007
Ivy, open this door,
or I'll bust it down.

934
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:06,710
All right?

935
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,546
All right!

936
01:27:13,691 --> 01:27:16,251
<i>All right, now...</i>

937
01:27:16,427 --> 01:27:17,758
- Ivy...
- I told Eddie to...

938
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:19,658
He gave me your message.

939
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:23,358
- He forgot what came after "lowlife. "
- Rotten West Indian!

940
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:26,504
- I came to take you out of here.
- No, you're not.

941
01:27:27,071 --> 01:27:29,767
My guys will pick up your stuff later.

942
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:31,898
Come on, Ivy.

943
01:27:32,076 --> 01:27:34,203
Will you come on?

944
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:37,777
Help! He's a murderer!

945
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:41,483
I'll handle this.
Why haven't the police arrived?

946
01:27:41,653 --> 01:27:43,621
- Will you let me, please?
- Tim!

947
01:27:43,788 --> 01:27:47,280
- On top of everything else, kidnapping.
- Tim.

948
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:55,355
Ivy, will you...? Now...
Stop running, girl, and listen to me!

949
01:27:55,533 --> 01:27:58,730
- What do you want from me?
- I told you, to take you out of here.

950
01:27:58,903 --> 01:28:01,394
Well, she doesn't wanna
go with you.

951
01:28:02,106 --> 01:28:04,199
When did you start to care
what she wants?

952
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,535
I care.

953
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,311
- I've always cared.
- Just a minute, Doris. Let me handle this.

954
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,348
- Par-Tal is fired. My lawyer...
- What's Par-Tal got to do with this?

955
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:16,976
Well, isn't that why you got involved
with Ivy in the first place?

956
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:20,917
Yes, that's right.
I played your miserable game.

957
01:28:21,092 --> 01:28:25,290
I allowed myself to be used because I
thought I needed you. I don't need you!

958
01:28:25,463 --> 01:28:27,226
There are other accounts.

959
01:28:27,398 --> 01:28:29,161
And she doesn't need you.

960
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:33,202
Look, you had better get used
to the idea of doing without her.

961
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:37,603
I mean, the whole world will not come
to an end because your maid wants to quit.

962
01:28:37,775 --> 01:28:43,441
You just may discover that you can survive
without one little colored girl.

963
01:28:44,048 --> 01:28:46,278
- Come on.
- I don't want to go with you!

964
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:50,478
I'm taking you into the city.
That's where you wanted to go, isn't it?

965
01:28:50,655 --> 01:28:55,149
- Well, now you get what you want.
- How does anybody know what I want?

966
01:28:55,326 --> 01:28:59,194
Nobody asks me.
People just tell me.

967
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:02,356
"Ivy, stay. " "Ivy, go. "

968
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:05,969
- Doesn't anybody say "please"?
- All right.

969
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:07,900
- Please.
- No!

970
01:29:08,706 --> 01:29:10,298
- Just a minute.
- Hold it!

971
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:13,501
- Out of my way.
- If you'll all just listen to me a second...

972
01:29:13,678 --> 01:29:15,805
...I have a solution to everything!

973
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,949
- Ivy, I think we should get married.
- Tim.

974
01:29:19,117 --> 01:29:22,609
If that's too big a move for openers,
we could live together a while.

975
01:29:22,787 --> 01:29:26,780
- We'll get a little place in the East Village.
- Tim.

976
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,119
- Okay, the West Village.
- He means it.

977
01:29:29,827 --> 01:29:31,260
<i>Ive...</i>

978
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:35,431
It makes perfect sense to me.

979
01:29:36,234 --> 01:29:38,327
You're very attractive.

980
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:42,530
And you cook great, and nobody
can say we don't know each other.

981
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:46,239
- And there just seems to be one problem.
- What might that be?

982
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:49,972
You and Mom might object to the fact
that Ivy is six years older than I am.

983
01:29:50,415 --> 01:29:51,882
Five and a half.

984
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,544
<i>Ive...</i>

985
01:29:56,621 --> 01:29:58,486
I'd get a haircut
if you asked me to.

986
01:29:59,223 --> 01:30:01,191
I'll wear regular shoes.

987
01:30:02,994 --> 01:30:05,019
I'll get a good job.

988
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:07,960
Like in advertising or something.

989
01:30:11,202 --> 01:30:12,794
Ive?

990
01:30:14,405 --> 01:30:16,896
You think it over, Ive!

991
01:30:27,585 --> 01:30:29,780
I guess she has to think it over.

992
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:05,613
How am I gonna tell him no?

993
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:09,050
He'll understand.

994
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:12,022
The age difference.

995
01:31:14,365 --> 01:31:16,993
It's not funny.

996
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:23,401
I guess it's not funny.

997
01:31:27,812 --> 01:31:29,541
Ivy.

998
01:31:35,753 --> 01:31:39,018
- Ivy, I came up here tonight...
- For yourself.

999
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:41,181
No, to apologize.

1000
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:43,554
No, you didn't.

1001
01:31:44,228 --> 01:31:47,789
You came because you feel guilty.

1002
01:31:53,204 --> 01:31:55,195
That's a part of it, I guess.

1003
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:58,638
- Isn't that all of it?
- No.

1004
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:03,770
- I want to wipe the slate clean.
- Okay.

1005
01:32:04,248 --> 01:32:06,216
So it's clean.

1006
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:13,452
I don't need you to carry my bags
and take me into New York.

1007
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:16,920
That's not what I want to do.

1008
01:32:17,094 --> 01:32:19,062
- No?
- No.

1009
01:32:20,731 --> 01:32:21,925
Last night...

1010
01:32:22,099 --> 01:32:24,192
You don't owe me anything
from last night.

1011
01:32:24,368 --> 01:32:29,965
If you don't stop being defensive, you're
liable not to hear what I'm saying, okay?

1012
01:32:30,141 --> 01:32:31,574
<i>Now...</i>

1013
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:35,004
Last night...

1014
01:32:35,947 --> 01:32:38,438
...I made a commitment.

1015
01:32:38,616 --> 01:32:41,608
- I didn't ask for...
- It's nothing you asked for.

1016
01:32:41,786 --> 01:32:46,348
It's something I felt.
It's something you can't control.

1017
01:32:46,524 --> 01:32:50,187
<i>And, listen, that can be a little scary,
especially when you...</i>

1018
01:32:50,361 --> 01:32:52,591
When you think you don't want it.

1019
01:32:56,801 --> 01:33:02,262
Up until last night,
it was all because of them.

1020
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,069
But when I asked you for a date tonight,
it was because of you.

1021
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:11,079
And tonight when I was
waiting for you...

1022
01:33:11,249 --> 01:33:16,744
...at the warehouse, I found
myself really waiting...

1023
01:33:17,388 --> 01:33:18,855
...for you.

1024
01:33:19,957 --> 01:33:21,390
See?

1025
01:33:22,793 --> 01:33:25,762
And I was thinking...

1026
01:33:26,998 --> 01:33:30,229
...about all the wonderful ways...

1027
01:33:30,868 --> 01:33:33,996
...your face looks.

1028
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:39,573
And I heard...

1029
01:33:40,478 --> 01:33:41,911
...that...

1030
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:46,680
...slurry, down-home way
you have of talking.

1031
01:33:48,653 --> 01:33:50,245
And I was...

1032
01:33:50,421 --> 01:33:54,619
...wondering what delicious kind of...

1033
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:57,522
...thing you'd be wearing.

1034
01:33:59,664 --> 01:34:01,894
And I found myself...

1035
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,031
...grinning a lot...

1036
01:34:05,202 --> 01:34:08,399
...at nothing in particular, just grinning.

1037
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:16,874
And I had it all figured out that
when you came up in the car...

1038
01:34:17,815 --> 01:34:20,613
...I would whip open the door...

1039
01:34:21,919 --> 01:34:24,888
...and scoop you up...

1040
01:34:26,157 --> 01:34:30,287
...and give you the biggest,
fattest, juiciest...

1041
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:33,396
...hello kiss you ever had.

1042
01:34:34,398 --> 01:34:36,195
Like this:

1043
01:34:41,973 --> 01:34:46,933
- Is that a hello kiss?
- It ain't no goodbye kiss.

1044
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:50,806
<i>Listen, you...</i>

1045
01:34:51,782 --> 01:34:53,773
<i>Now...</i>

1046
01:34:53,951 --> 01:34:56,215
I don't know where this
is gonna take us...

1047
01:34:56,387 --> 01:35:01,017
...but for openers at least,
it's gotta take us to New York.

1048
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:08,862
There's a man at the door
who wants to see you.

1049
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:12,002
- Time to go.
- He's really hysterical.

1050
01:35:12,903 --> 01:35:15,394
That little bag is all you'll need.

1051
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:19,766
I'm giving you your last chance.

1052
01:35:20,478 --> 01:35:22,878
My last chance to do what, man?

1053
01:35:23,047 --> 01:35:26,073
To keep your mind on business,
that's what, man.

1054
01:35:27,151 --> 01:35:29,244
Par-Tal's my business, man.

1055
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:34,414
And what is that? A taxi service
for lonely domestics?

1056
01:35:34,592 --> 01:35:37,425
I'm telling you, man,
I'm bored with your behavior.

1057
01:35:37,595 --> 01:35:40,325
And I am bored working nights
in that stupid truck.

1058
01:35:40,498 --> 01:35:42,989
And I'm bored with this
square daytime deal.

1059
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:47,126
Keeping books, making deliveries,
making out with people I don't even like...

1060
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:50,330
...like the Austins.
- What are you gonna do about it, man?

1061
01:35:51,275 --> 01:35:54,438
You like Par-Tal? You want Par-Tal?
You can have Par-Tal!

1062
01:35:54,612 --> 01:35:56,842
- I'll take it.
- You got it!

1063
01:35:57,014 --> 01:35:59,073
Just give me the nighttime deal.

1064
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:03,346
- We divvy right down the line.
- You take Par-Tal, and I take that truck.

1065
01:36:03,521 --> 01:36:07,855
- You've got a deal.
- You bet we got a deal. Shake.

1066
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:11,985
Okay.

1067
01:36:13,197 --> 01:36:16,598
- You mean that, Billy?
- Sure, I mean it.

1068
01:36:17,101 --> 01:36:20,229
The lawyers can work it out
fair and square.

1069
01:36:22,873 --> 01:36:26,741
Yeah, we should have
thought of that before.

1070
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:29,141
- Yeah, makes sense, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

1071
01:36:29,313 --> 01:36:32,009
You get what you want,
I get what I want.

1072
01:36:32,883 --> 01:36:37,047
That's Eddie with your car.
I'll take him back with me in the truck.

1073
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:39,416
I'll see you around, man.

1074
01:37:05,983 --> 01:37:07,610
Now we begin.

1075
01:37:07,785 --> 01:37:11,152
- This is really leaving.
- Yes, it is. Does it scare you?

1076
01:37:11,322 --> 01:37:15,418
- A little. How about you?
- Nothing to be afraid of.

1077
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:31,260
What are you gonna do?

1078
01:38:38,676 --> 01:38:41,907
- What? What?
- Fine mess I got you into.

1079
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:46,345
Compassion won't get me anything now,
baby. Just bail me out of here.

1080
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,911
You got it.
What else can I do for you?

1081
01:38:49,086 --> 01:38:51,680
One call to my lawyer,
one call to my lawyer.

1082
01:38:51,855 --> 01:38:54,915
How would you like a full-time,
hardworking, daytime partner?

1083
01:38:55,092 --> 01:38:59,324
<i>- You gotta get up at 7:30 every morning.
- Say hello to Mr. Early-Morning Riser.</i>

1084
01:38:59,496 --> 01:39:03,865
I think I'd like that.
Billy, you're gonna love being legitimate.

1085
01:39:04,034 --> 01:39:05,763
Sure.

1086
01:39:09,673 --> 01:39:11,732
You're not going to jail, huh?

1087
01:39:12,476 --> 01:39:16,105
Not a chance. But in case we did go to jail,
would you bring us cookies?

1088
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:19,174
- All right.
- Something else.

1089
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,784
- What?
- What have you got against West Indians?
