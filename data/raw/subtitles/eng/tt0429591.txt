1
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:54,832
Ah!

2
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,906
Ah...

3
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:11,649
Hello!

4
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:37,041
They're gonna drive us crazy.

5
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,284
Oh!

6
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,028
Look at him, Claire.

7
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,392
I'm looking
at him, Hailey.

8
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,726
Sitting up there

9
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,629
being gorgeous.

10
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,928
Looking for someone
to rescue.

11
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,333
He should so
be rescuing us.

12
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:35,529
What's wrong

13
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,367
- with this picture?
- Well, all these articles say

14
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:40,442
we've been way
too available.

15
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,033
We need to be
more coy.

16
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,271
We are so coy,

17
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,279
he barely knows we exist.

18
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,370
Okay.

19
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:47,540
Ray pop quiz.

20
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,878
Favorite song,
favorite food,

21
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,077
favorite drink?

22
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,346
Go, go, go.

23
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:55,254
Weezer's "Island in the Sun,"
um, Dr. Pepper, oranges?

24
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:56,222
Very nice.

25
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,418
I'm trying to read.

26
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,926
Fine, then the least

27
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:02,054
you can do is read me the latest
on boy-bagging technology.

28
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,998
Oh, okay, this one is called
"Fluff and Retreat."

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,227
"Fluff his ego

30
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:07,303
"then walk away.

31
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,768
"Not only is he left
wanting more,

32
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:12,433
but he's under the impression
that it's his idea."

33
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,736
Nice.

34
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,572
That's really cool.

35
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,570
Claire, do you realize

36
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,978
that summer's almost over,

37
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,812
and you haven't gone
in the water once?

38
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,977
Once would be
way too many times.

39
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,055
Mm. Excuse me.

40
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,291
Do you realize we've got
less than five days

41
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:30,654
till you
have to move?

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,057
I don't want you moving

43
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,150
halfway around the world.

44
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,321
Claire, you're such a ruiner!

45
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,561
I'd gone, like, a half hour
without thinking about it.

46
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,634
Hailey, I'm sorry, but...

47
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:39,633
Besides,

48
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:41,067
I haven't kissed Raymond yet.

49
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,104
So I'm not going anywhere.

50
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,572
Whoo!

51
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,300
Incoming.

52
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,713
Oh.

53
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,939
Hello, hottie.

54
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,015
It's Raymond.

55
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,112
Hail, did you order
a sand... witch?

56
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,452
Cecilia's back
from camp.

57
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:04,390
Don't worry. He
won't fall for yuck.

58
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,519
He's way too
smart for that.

59
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,496
Hey, Cecilia.
- Hey!

60
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,469
Whoa.

61
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,003
Did they get... bigger?

62
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:23,373
She could poke an eye out.

63
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,277
We just... we have to decode
his body language.

64
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,371
Look, it's fine.

65
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,610
I mean, if
he's into her,

66
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,482
he'll shake his hair,

67
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:32,679
stretch his arms

68
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,484
- and flex those muscles.
- Yeah?

69
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,317
Wha-What was that?

70
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,985
Fingers. That was fingers
through the hair.

71
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,087
I mean, technically,
that wasn't shaking.

72
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,063
Right?

73
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,330
Please, gods of love,
no shake,

74
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,066
no stretch,
no flex, no...

75
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,173
No!

76
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,042
You guys okay?

77
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:00,115
- Yeah, we're fine, thanks.
- Yeah, fine.

78
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,581
- Thanks.
- We're good.

79
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,411
Baby-sit much?

80
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,722
I can't take it anymore.

81
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,054
As long as he doesn't

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,525
flip his sunglasses
up and down, we're fine.

83
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:13,754
Hey, Ray, think fast!

84
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,831
Oh!

85
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:16,796
Yo...
- I can't look anymore.

86
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,797
- You...
- Sorry!

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,832
I figured you
could catch.

88
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,368
- Right.
- My bad.

89
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,767
Oh.

90
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:24,601
What? Did he flip them?

91
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:25,799
You know, it's
really sunny out.

92
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,706
- It doesn't count.
- Yeah.

93
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,711
Say something.

94
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,906
You're never gonna get a tan
wearing all those clothes.

95
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,881
Or skin cancer.

96
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,918
Please, we don't
even smoke.

97
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,282
Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,787
Such losers.

99
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,824
The perfect end
to a perfect day.

100
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,756
Claire! Hailey!

101
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,091
We need your help!

102
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,531
Hey. What?

103
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:58,630
Oh, we've decided
to fire Raymond.

104
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,571
- What?!
- What?!

105
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:00,767
Mm.

106
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,714
You should've seen your faces!

107
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,717
That is so not funny.

108
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,946
Oh, you girls-
you're too wound up.

109
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,454
Help bring in

110
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,456
the "Last Splash"
decorations, please.

111
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,786
Weatherman says
a big storm's coming.

112
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,485
We'll put them up
again after it clears.

113
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,061
Ray will still be there

114
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,824
when you're done.

115
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,558
Grandpa!

116
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,226
Supper's at
6:00, Claire.

117
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:27,700
So you'll come back
after dinner, right?

118
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,998
We can hang out
in the rec room...

119
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,096
No, I have other plans.

120
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:32,572
What?!

121
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,573
But you-you promised...

122
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:35,234
God, chillax.
Your grandma's right.

123
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:36,242
But Hailey, I'm...

124
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,939
- Sorry!
- Geez, Leonard.

125
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:46,010
"M" or "W"?

126
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:50,651
Right, nice to see you, too.

127
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,528
"W"...

128
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:00,630
He knows what you did
last summer.

129
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,616
Down!

130
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,614
Mom, I'm home!

131
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,659
Hey, kiddo!

132
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,127
Hailey, your boxes
won't pack themselves.

133
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:33,533
Don't put this off
until the movers come.

134
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,235
Come on, Moby,

135
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:41,275
don't play me like that.

136
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,242
I haven't seen you in days.

137
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,509
Hailey, you can unpack
as much as you want.

138
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,583
We're still moving.

139
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,345
Yeah.

140
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,182
How was the club?

141
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,747
And maybe I could get more
than one syllable this time?

142
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,258
- It was fine.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,521
That was three.

144
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,495
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

145
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:09,435
but... you didn't want
to leave

146
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,734
Boston, either, remember?

147
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,274
And look what happened.

148
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,776
You met Claire.

149
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:20,178
Australia could be another
amazing adventure for us, Hails.

150
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:26,048
So... how about
we start packing your room?

151
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:27,918
So how about I live here
with Claire till I'm 18?

152
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,221
How about... we go back
to fewer syllables?

153
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,919
Cool.

154
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,430
That was one.

155
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,330
A storm warning is in effect...

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,102
HAI LEY
So that's where Cecilia Banks
gets all the drama.

157
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,734
Just look at her dad.

158
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,209
Well, as you can see-whoa!

159
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:52,908
Hailey, how am I supposed

160
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,210
to face eighth grade
without you?

161
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,650
My locker is right next
to the boys' bathroom.

162
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:00,085
And I have coed PE class
by myself.

163
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,419
We have to dance with Raymond
at The Last Splash.

164
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:03,924
We'll be such
great dancers

165
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,618
that he'll realize
that he has to marry one of us.

166
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,128
And we'll be so happy

167
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:09,220
that one of us got him,

168
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:11,266
that we won't even be jealous,
you know?

169
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,629
Unless he picks you.

170
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:13,827
That wouldn't be okay.

171
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,770
- Joke.
- What if this is our last movie campout?

172
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:20,603
What if this is it?

173
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:26,938
O gods of hurricanes,
makers of thunder and lightning

174
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,517
and majestical waves...

175
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,179
useth your power to keep my mom
from moving to Australia.

176
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,950
Maketh her to see
the error of her ways,

177
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:37,423
and keepeth us
in Baybridge!

178
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,491
Ameneth.

179
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,759
You're insane.

180
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,131
That's what they tell me.

181
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,474
Ameneth.

182
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,181
Oh, my God!

183
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:01,307
The vending machine's
possessed.

184
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,852
Looks like we got free...

185
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,114
- Hailey!
...Soda?

186
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,450
Where are you?
Are you dead?!

187
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,853
- Don't die.
- I'm not dead.

188
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,186
I'm right here.
Follow my voice.

189
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,954
Oh, God!

190
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,289
Something's out there!

191
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,559
I just want you to
know that if Leonard

192
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,498
comes in here
and chops us up

193
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:20,933
into a million pieces,

194
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,437
that you were totally,
completely, and eternally

195
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,201
my best friend.

196
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,539
You're my best friend,
too.

197
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,544
And I broke
your iPod.

198
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:40,316
What are you girls
doing out here

199
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,321
- in this weather?!
- Oh!

200
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:42,448
Come on!

201
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,525
Grandma,
you scared me!

202
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,526
Let's get the two of
you tucked up in bed.

203
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:46,595
HAI LEY
Oh, Mrs. B.,

204
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:47,685
if I have nightmares
tonight,

205
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,525
I'm blaming you.

206
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,254
I'm blaming you.

207
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,336
<i>O gods of hurricanes...</i>

208
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,868
<i>O gods of hurricanes, makers</i>
<i>of thunder and lightning,</i>

209
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:15,416
<i>... please useth your powers</i>
<i>to keep my mom...</i>

210
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,754
<i>Maketh her to see</i>
<i>the error of her ways...</i>

211
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,920
<i>... and keepeth us in Baybridge!</i>

212
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,324
Oh, my God.

213
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:52,724
Come on, man.

214
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,625
- On three, ready? One, two...
- Okay, yeah.

215
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,960
Raymond's out! Come on!

216
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,294
Yeah, bring it up.

217
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,332
He's beautiful.
Okay, stay calm.

218
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,566
Come on!

219
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:09,166
I'll catch you later, man.

220
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,680
Look at this.

221
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,779
What a wreck.

222
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,790
It's Ray.
Don't look.

223
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:23,859
Get down.

224
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,188
Hello, little
freaky blue crab.

225
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:30,997
Claire, look.

226
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,293
Ray, hope you're
ready to clean.

227
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,859
Wow.

228
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:39,806
Think you'll have to
call off Last Splash?

229
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,274
- No! No, Mr. B!
- No!

230
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,208
No, no, no, no, no, Mr. B!

231
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,143
You can't- I'm sorry,
but you can't do that!

232
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,236
Mr. B.,
me and Claire

233
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,316
have been planning
for this for, like, ever.

234
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,315
It'll be all right.

235
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:52,148
Grandpa, are the pool lights
still on?

236
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,786
Claire!

237
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,826
Hold on, you're okay.

238
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,658
There's a shark
in the pool!

239
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,664
You're okay, you're okay.
Shh. I got you.

240
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:38,858
Here, somebody get
the chair!

241
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,299
Calm down.

242
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,596
- There you go.
- Here.

243
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,399
She may be in shock.
Take a deep breath.

244
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:44,404
Claire, are you all right?

245
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:45,701
She gets scared
in the water.

246
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,901
Her parents drowned.

247
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,977
You all right, honey?

248
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,909
I saw something.
It's in there,

249
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,776
and I don't know
what it was!

250
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,348
Half the ocean washed up
in there last night.

251
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:58,750
Hailey,
take Claire inside.

252
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,879
Leonard,
lock up the patio.

253
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,514
I don't want anyone else
falling in.

254
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,560
Okay, clean it, lock it. Got it.

255
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,686
That was, that
was tight, Ray.

256
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,857
Thanks, Ray.

257
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,727
- Hey...
- Come on!

258
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,238
- Hey!
- Oh, my God...

259
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,001
Raymond totally jumped
in there to save you,

260
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,339
with his actual biceps.

261
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,706
Did you feel them
around you?

262
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:24,938
Were they flexed?

263
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:26,674
Oh, God, they
must've been flexed.

264
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,409
If you had
stopped breathing!

265
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:31,213
You were, like, this close
to mouth-to-mouth.

266
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,378
There's something
in there.

267
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm serious!

268
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,953
It looked like...
I can't even say it,

269
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:39,755
but I swear, it just stared
at me with its eyes!

270
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,956
You're in shock...
from touching Raymond!

271
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:46,557
Hailey, I know what I saw.

272
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,103
Fine, then we'll
just go back

273
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:51,672
when no one is looking,
and we'll check it out.

274
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,241
No way, Hail.

275
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,708
I didn't mean to get
in the water in the first place,

276
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,335
and I'm not going
back there again.

277
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,607
Something bad
could've happened.

278
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,148
Come on, Clairedy cat.

279
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,742
Put on your big girl pants
and meet me at 9:00.

280
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,120
Be careful!

281
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:13,786
Grandpa'll be
super mad at us.

282
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:19,265
It's Leonard.

283
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,844
Come on.

284
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,330
Hey, maybe we should get
fishing poles out or something.

285
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:54,595
Shh, shh, shh. No.

286
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,897
I don't want to catch it.

287
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,472
I want to feed it.

288
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,209
Fish sticks?

289
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,978
Maybe it was an octopus.

290
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,053
With blue hair

291
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:15,885
- and a tail?
- It could've been blue seaweed

292
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:17,618
or kelp.

293
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,990
It was not an octopus,
and it wasn't kelp!

294
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,221
You want one?

295
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,388
I saw hair!

296
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,988
God!

297
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,691
Listen,

298
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,496
if you're gonna ignore
every single word I say,

299
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,934
- I can hang out alone.
- I'm not ignoring you.

300
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,532
I bet I know what it was.

301
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,807
I'm guessing...

302
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,577
it was a mermaid.

303
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,147
Mm... mm...

304
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,463
Boo.

305
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:14,240
It's a...

306
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,406
Uh, you're a...

307
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:18,885
A m...

308
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:22,218
I can see we have
to take this slowly.

309
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,316
Mer... maid.

310
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,917
Mermaid.

311
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,020
Wha?

312
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,964
Fabled marine creature,
half woman, half fish,

313
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,432
best known for sitting on
rocks,

314
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:36,299
staring into mirrors,
and obsessively combing

315
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,929
our long, beautiful hair.

316
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,508
Blah, blah, blah...

317
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,941
Wha... What is going on?

318
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:46,037
Stop shrieking

319
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,877
like a couple of gulls.

320
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,680
For shrimps,
you're awfully loud.

321
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:54,350
You speak English?

322
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:57,823
Yeah. Mermaids speak every
language known to man,

323
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,484
fish, crustacean...

324
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,358
and several varieties
of sea fowl.

325
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,090
What can you speak?

326
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:06,531
I got a C in Spanish.

327
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,499
Hmm.

328
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:08,627
Wait.

329
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,433
What if she's, like,
bad or something?

330
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,371
Why would she be bad?

331
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:17,036
She's a fictional sea creature.
They could be bad.

332
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,943
We are not fictional!

333
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,514
We're discreet. Hm.

334
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:29,213
I've never been this
close to a human before.

335
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:32,225
Yeah. Must be weird for you.

336
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,623
What?

337
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,224
Nothing.

338
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,964
You're staring at my tail.

339
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,040
Well, yeah, I was.

340
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,372
Do you... want to touch it?

341
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,174
Okay.

342
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:57,218
Aah, it's slimy!

343
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,946
Thank you.

344
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,512
I rub it with kelp and
jellyfish twice a day. Hm.

345
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,492
Wow!

346
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,998
Wow!

347
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:15,492
Please don't eat us!

348
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:18,232
The thought!

349
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,238
It's okay.

350
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,275
I just want to see
what feet feel like.

351
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,866
Give it!

352
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,742
Can you pick things up
with them?

353
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:26,780
No, but...

354
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:30,010
I can kick with them
if you don't let go!

355
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,285
Hey, get back here.

356
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,761
Mm!

357
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,129
How-how did you do that?

358
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,758
Oh, that's nothing.

359
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,234
You should see my father.

360
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,895
He can make some serious waves.

361
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,905
Like last night,
for example.

362
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,237
Your dad made those waves?

363
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,004
Yeah.

364
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,944
He's mad at me,
because I swam away from home

365
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,878
three days before
I'm supposed to get

366
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,075
married off to this merman

367
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,708
who's about as deep
as a tidal pool.

368
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:04,945
Hey!

369
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:06,645
Leonard! We have to go.

370
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,450
- He's a total psycho.
- You have to hide.

371
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:09,888
Wait! Where are you going?

372
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,619
- We'll be back tomorrow morning.
- Promise?

373
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:12,557
Promise!

374
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,719
Someone over there?

375
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:16,195
- Run!
- Don't get seen.

376
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,600
Hailey.

377
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,369
Hailey, wake up.

378
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,081
What in the world?

379
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,157
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

380
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,783
- This is bad.
- Oh, my God.

381
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:20,725
This is so bad.

382
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:22,660
Come on.

383
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,059
What have you done?!

384
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,798
I drained the pool.

385
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,199
She's not in there.

386
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,072
- But how could she just get out?
- I don't know.

387
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:38,075
Come on.

388
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,857
Oh, it's you.

389
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,087
You scared the salt out of me.

390
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,027
I thought you were that man

391
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,996
with that awful
sucking machine.

392
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,864
I just about got turned
inside out.

393
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,095
How did you get in here?

394
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,933
I used these.

395
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,664
Whoa.

396
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,011
My very own pair.

397
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:16,010
Oh, and check this out.

398
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:17,745
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

399
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,584
Wow.

400
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,679
Isn't it cute?

401
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,418
Very cute.

402
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,517
And I can sit on it.

403
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,123
Hey, we've got to get you
out of here. Come on.

404
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,095
You're going
to get seen.

405
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:31,222
You need to give
her your T-shirt.

406
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,824
No. My bathing suit
is like boy repellent.

407
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,095
What if we see Raymond?

408
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:37,194
It's your bathing suit
or her birthday suit.

409
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,567
Come on.

410
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:57,983
Oh, no.

411
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:59,060
That's not what you do.

412
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,389
- You have to...
- No.

413
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,792
- Put your arms through them.
- Put your arms through the...

414
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:02,727
- You know what I mean?
- Oh...

415
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:03,957
No...

416
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,330
No, no. Oh.

417
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,333
Wow.

418
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,960
That looks amazing.

419
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,504
I know.

420
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:23,182
I don't understand
how you can sleep on these

421
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:25,082
when they're so jumpy.

422
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,087
I could just do this all day.

423
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,157
Claire, what on earth
are you doing up there?

424
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,792
You really need to stop.

425
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:35,328
Gram's gonna be
really mad at us.

426
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,465
We're gonna get in huge trouble.

427
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,125
You worry too much.

428
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,167
I rest my case.

429
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:43,195
This is so much fun.

430
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,102
Oh! I love legs.

431
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,335
So...

432
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,536
do you get to keep them?

433
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,806
Technically, we can only have
legs when the sun's out.

434
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,541
And we have to keep them dry,

435
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,048
or at least that's
what I've heard.

436
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,278
I've never had the guts
to come out and try them.

437
00:23:58,386 --> 00:24:00,479
So this is your
first time ashore?

438
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,023
First time on land,
first time with legs.

439
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,592
Can you believe it?

440
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,024
Oh, you'd never know.

441
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,460
But I've got
to be careful.

442
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,463
Add moonlight or
water, instant tail.

443
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,055
Look what I can do. Eh!

444
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,829
Ow. Stop that.

445
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,570
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

446
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,738
Oh! Crabs!

447
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:24,072
They found me.

448
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,339
With a shell?

449
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:26,573
Mm-hmm.

450
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:29,809
Did you know you can hear
the ocean through these?

451
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,215
Yeah, but...

452
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,253
Well, it works both ways.

453
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,585
The ocean can hear you, too.

454
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:38,517
Hello? Dad?

455
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:41,653
Aquamarine! Just what do
you think you're doing?!

456
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:42,855
Daddy?

457
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,329
Shell phone.

458
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,060
Could you give me a minute?

459
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:48,796
Sure. Sorry.

460
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,098
Well, that's your plan,

461
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,263
- not mine.
- Okay.

462
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:54,672
I don't want to marry
some spoiled, rich, squid!

463
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,242
Well, you can make
all the storms you want,

464
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,041
but I'm not coming back.

465
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,242
No! No!

466
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,444
Love is not a myth,
Daddy, it's real!

467
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:06,612
You think her dad
is doing this?

468
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,586
...three days,
I'll prove it to you.

469
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,123
If you don't come back
in three days...

470
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,056
Well, if I'm wrong,
then I will honor your plans.

471
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,525
And I'll call you every night,
okay?

472
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:14,890
So calm down!

473
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,128
I have to find love.

474
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,332
We don't have it where I'm from,

475
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,136
and if I can't find it

476
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,507
in three days, I'm sunk.

477
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,636
You don't have love?

478
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:32,713
No.

479
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:34,338
My dad says it's just a myth.

480
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,144
We marry who our parents pick.

481
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,718
And my dad thinks
that I have bubbles in my brain

482
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:39,810
because I believe in love.

483
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:41,479
He says that the only way

484
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,490
I can get out of my wedding

485
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,389
is if I can prove to him
that love exists.

486
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,393
But that means
I only get three days.

487
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,225
Or else I'll be swimming
down the aisle with that...

488
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,698
... that blowfish.

489
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
But if you
don't have love,

490
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,297
how do you know it exists?

491
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:56,370
I saw it once.

492
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,905
And I want it.

493
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,998
Yeah!

494
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,078
With him.

495
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,181
Raymond?!

496
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,757
Whoo! Check it out!

497
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,449
Raymond?

498
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,426
Raymond.

499
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:33,606
Raymond is the one I love.

500
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,573
- No!
- No!

501
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,703
- No!
- No!

502
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,340
Raymond!

503
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:44,679
Raymond!

504
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:45,946
Raymond!

505
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:48,454
- Yeah?
- Hi.

506
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:49,682
Hi.

507
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:53,722
Do you love me?

508
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:57,696
Uh... no,

509
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,733
but I think you're hot.

510
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,301
You're really hot.

511
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:02,495
Come on, man.
We got to go!

512
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:03,901
The beach house
is going off!

513
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:05,734
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

514
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
Well, uh, I'll see you later.

515
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:10,675
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on!

516
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,179
Hey, man.

517
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:16,114
Drop me off at home. Can you?

518
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:21,446
He doesn't love me?

519
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,582
How can he not love me?

520
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:25,751
I need some salt.

521
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,054
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

522
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,390
He said I was hot,

523
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,760
but how would he know?

524
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,230
Do I feel hot to you?

525
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,963
- No. That is not how you...
- I think that you mistook it.

526
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,232
You have to help me get him
to fall in love with me.

527
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,568
Yeah, right!

528
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:40,971
No, no, no.
No, Raymond's way too popular.

529
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,338
You should pick someone else.

530
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:43,911
I mean, all the girls
are after him.

531
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:46,105
- Even a few boys.
- Right.

532
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,579
Fine.

533
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,650
Then you don't get your wish.

534
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,150
- Wish?!
- What?!

535
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,378
Wait, wait, what?

536
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,387
What wish?

537
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:57,686
You know, if you help a
mermaid, you get a wish.

538
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,726
Any wish
you could wish for.

539
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,455
I thought that was genies.

540
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:05,056
You... you believe in genies?

541
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:09,200
Uh... what if our wish

542
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:11,397
involves other people?

543
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,633
- Like my mom.
- Yeah.

544
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:16,074
It's a wish, any wish,

545
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:18,372
as long as it doesn't
violate the laws of nature.

546
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,412
Mm, mm, mm-hmm.

547
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:21,311
- We'll help you!
- We'll help you!

548
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,217
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

549
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:27,979
Just to let you know,

550
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,182
this is a humongous
sacrifice for us.

551
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,588
Yeah.

552
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,887
Giving up Raymond?

553
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,723
So you know him pretty well?

554
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:37,764
Oh, yeah,
we're experts on Raymond.

555
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,390
Oh, yeah,
we know him really well.

556
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,059
- We're like Ray-ologists.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,466
Good.

558
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,969
But he has to say he loves me,

559
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,972
'cause I need proof
for my dad.

560
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:48,406
Otherwise you don't
get your wish. Deal?

561
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:50,842
Deal.

562
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,072
Deal.

563
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,680
My name's Aquamarine.

564
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,946
Now, let's go find Raymond.

565
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,092
You need shoes!

566
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:10,130
Yeah, and undies!

567
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:38,317
Just stick with the pros.

568
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,951
Boys are what we live for.

569
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:41,960
- Creepy, right?
- Ugh.

570
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,257
My mom collects
this stuff.

571
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,626
What does your mom do?

572
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:45,960
Besides ruin my life?

573
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,398
She's a marine biologist.

574
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,628
Yeah, she's all scientific.

575
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:49,998
- More like horrific.
- I know.

576
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:51,867
She's dragged me all over
the country for her job.

577
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:54,168
She's been working to clean up
the water in the bay here.

578
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,334
Well, tell her thanks for me

579
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:58,036
because it tastes
about ten times better

580
00:29:58,146 --> 00:29:59,477
than it did a few years ago.

581
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:01,139
Really?

582
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:02,716
Huh.

583
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,546
Okay, first things first.

584
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,677
Uh, Aqua, what are you doing?

585
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,416
He doesn't like
this harsh light.

586
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:14,855
Moby!

587
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,089
He came out of hiding.

588
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:17,357
Wow.

589
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:19,194
Can you make boobs
come out of hiding?

590
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,359
What?

591
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,061
All right.

592
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,332
We begin where every girl
starts with her first crush.

593
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,567
We call him.

594
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:29,575
Call him? What?

595
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:30,701
What? No, I can't.

596
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,109
What am I supposed
to say to him?

597
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,237
Nothing.

598
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:34,372
We just call and hang up.

599
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:35,574
We do it all the time.

600
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:36,741
Why?

601
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,079
I don't know.
It's just what you do.

602
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,084
Yeah.

603
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,711
Okay.

604
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:45,387
Wait a minute.

605
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:47,888
It's ringing.

606
00:30:49,864 --> 00:30:50,956
Hello?

607
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,167
Oh, oh.

608
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,001
That was fantastic.

609
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,233
Let's do it again.

610
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:06,143
Okay, the next step
here is the ride-by.

611
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:07,236
Very important
in any crush.

612
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:09,873
Now remember,
you have to act casual.

613
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:13,476
Yes, like you didn't even
remember this was his street.

614
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,991
That's it.

615
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:23,324
That's Raymond's house.

616
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,930
There he is!

617
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,935
Oh, that hurts.

618
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:32,336
But this will be worth it.

619
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,542
Huh?

620
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:40,107
What the?

621
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,789
Aqua, no, that's the!

622
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:56,329
...brake!

623
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:16,450
- Aqua! Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

624
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,348
I saw him.
Did you see him?

625
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:19,511
He waved at me.

626
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:21,145
Hey, hey, hey,
are you okay?

627
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,187
Hey, Raymond.

628
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,382
Hey.

629
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:24,549
Oh, my God!

630
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,159
We didn't even remember
this was your street.

631
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,023
Yeah. All right,

632
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:32,156
let's see
what you got here.

633
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:36,627
Ah... nothing too serious.

634
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:37,966
You run it under
some cold water,

635
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:39,801
- you'll be as good as new...
- No, no, no, no!

636
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:41,033
Hey, hey, hey.

637
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,542
I wouldn't hurt you.

638
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:46,637
All right, let me at least
put a Band-Aid on it. Yeah?

639
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:49,342
Lifeguard's
always prepared, right?

640
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:53,548
Here we go.

641
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,556
This won't hurt a bit.

642
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,592
There you go.

643
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,183
Voila!

644
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,990
Thank you.

645
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:04,325
It's...

646
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:05,729
it's beautiful.

647
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,026
Eh...

648
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:13,164
So, um...
what was your name?

649
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,673
Aquamarine.

650
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:16,209
Cool name.

651
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,175
Will I see you
at the street fair today?

652
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,907
I love this song!

653
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,107
Oh, no!

654
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:25,778
Who ordered broom service?

655
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:27,548
Hi, Raymond!

656
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm here for my driving lesson.

657
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,756
Let's get you up.

658
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,159
You going to be all right?

659
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,196
Okay, cool.

660
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,560
All right, hey,
hang on one sec,

661
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:41,897
I got to grab
my keys.

662
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,836
So, um...
I'll see you later?

663
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,908
Oop. Rock. Watch out.
Watch out.

664
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:49,975
Who is she?

665
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:51,443
Cecilia.

666
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,707
She thinks she's the shiz
'cause her dad does the weather.

667
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:55,112
Her dad can
make weather?

668
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,741
No. He just reports it.

669
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,719
- Shut up! I know how to drive.
- And she's a princess?

670
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:04,349
No, no, no.
Just a royal bitch.

671
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,552
Then why are you
so intimidated?

672
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,822
Oh. Got it. Slow...

673
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,663
Whoa.

674
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:16,094
Hey, guys,

675
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:18,138
does she have something
against girl's clothes?

676
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,510
Nice hair.

677
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:25,636
Who are you?

678
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:26,714
Aquamarine.

679
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,906
She's my cousin.

680
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:29,539
Well, that's
kind of pretty.

681
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,642
Mm! For a crayon.

682
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:35,552
I was named Aquamarine after
a rare and precious gemstone,

683
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,816
whereas...

684
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:40,257
Cecilia translated
means "dim-sighted."

685
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:43,761
But your parents know
you better than I do.

686
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:44,991
Wow.

687
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:46,828
What did you just say to me?

688
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:50,631
Yep, definitely dim-sighted.

689
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,268
Oh!

690
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:03,347
There's something very fishy
about that girl.

691
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,817
<i>Cecilia Banks blew a gasket!</i>

692
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,547
Who cares about her?
What about Ray?

693
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:08,781
I mean...

694
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,292
What happened to me back there?

695
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:13,860
I was such a clam.

696
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,087
I-I couldn't think.

697
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,527
Don't worry.

698
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:18,462
Everything we've learned
about boys

699
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,399
has come from the pages
of these magazines.

700
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:22,696
Come on.

701
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,635
I can't stop thinking about him.

702
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,334
I feel so weird
and tingly.

703
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:32,237
- What?
- Look at my finger scales.

704
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,211
Oh, my.

705
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,146
They've never been
this color before.

706
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,877
They change color with my mood.

707
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,009
Whoa, weird.

708
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,815
But I don't know
what mood this is.

709
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,891
- Love...
- Love...

710
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,322
Okay, start reading.

711
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:47,986
We have a lot to cover
before we go to the street fair.

712
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:49,255
Mm-hmm.

713
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:06,207
Look at this!

714
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,576
I need some salt.

715
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,380
Number 28.

716
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,720
Come on. Focus!

717
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,500
How do you remember
all this?

718
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,202
You have to be flirty,
but demure.

719
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,470
Yeah.

720
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,512
- Devoted but not desperate.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

721
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,979
Available, but elusive?

722
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,379
And if he calls
Wednesday

723
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:43,882
for Saturday,
you have to be busy,

724
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:46,385
even though you're free?

725
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:48,819
- It's so annoying.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

726
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,483
Yet strangely addictive.

727
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:53,423
I think she's
on the brink

728
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:54,789
of a boy data
overload. Hey.

729
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,488
Let's take her out.

730
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:05,329
There he is.

731
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:08,306
- Ray! Ray! Hi!
- Shh! No!

732
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,468
Haven't you learned anything?

733
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,102
Let him see you first!

734
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,840
Sorry. I just got so excited,
I forgot.

735
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:14,846
It's okay, just...

736
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,474
Hey, how about if we do what...

737
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:20,179
what Liz D. From Skokie
suggests?

738
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,222
The "Laugh and Pass."

739
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,257
Casually walk past him...

740
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:25,552
laughing.

741
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,321
Good idea.

742
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:31,189
That was so funny!

743
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,201
Okay, look at him.

744
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,908
Look away.

745
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,909
Look at him
and play with your hair.

746
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,876
Just kind of twirl
it, twirl it.

747
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:49,148
- Arch your back. Arch your back.
- Pucker your lips

748
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,512
and flip your hair.

749
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:52,347
- Flip it, flip it. Flip it.
- Arch your back.

750
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:55,217
Don't look at him.
No, no, no. He's looking at you.

751
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:56,449
Okay,

752
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:57,717
fluff and retreat.

753
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:58,985
What?

754
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:00,993
Come on, you can do it, Ray.
Come on, Ray!

755
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:04,462
Fluff his ego
and retreat. Go.

756
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,193
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

757
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,826
Wow, Raymond,
you're good! Bye.

758
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:10,961
Wha? Uh, wha...

759
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,905
You didn't fluff enough!

760
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,532
Here you go, man.

761
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:16,541
Hey! Hey,
where you going?

762
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:17,542
- Guess she did.
- Come on!

763
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:18,703
Hey, guys,
I'll catch up with you.

764
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,644
Okay? I'm gonna
hang out with Aqua.

765
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,079
Oh, my God, he gave
her a nickname.

766
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:23,207
Hey.

767
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,716
Hi.

768
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,650
Ar! Ar! Ar!

769
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:28,381
Are you having a good time?

770
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:31,655
Yes.

771
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,351
Following you around is fun.

772
00:38:33,461 --> 00:38:35,656
Okay...

773
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,890
Um... this guy is for you.

774
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:44,097
- Thanks.
Cotton candy!

775
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:46,571
- You're welcome.
- Come and get your cotton candy.

776
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,600
MAN
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

777
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:52,905
You want one?

778
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,209
- Yeah.
- Okay.

779
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,252
Just one, please?

780
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:00,377
Thanks.

781
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,881
Mmm...

782
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:08,753
Mmm...

783
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:09,887
Hmm.

784
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:13,728
Um, I just love
eating cotton candy.

785
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:14,994
I mean, I love eating it.

786
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,093
- Right, Hail?
- Right.

787
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:18,535
It's so much fun
to eat it.

788
00:39:24,979 --> 00:39:26,071
Mmm...

789
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,705
It just vanished!

790
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:29,578
Mm-hmm.

791
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:31,810
Mmm, mmm...

792
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:37,949
Shake.

793
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,522
Stretch.

794
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,332
Flex!

795
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,266
- He likes her!
- He likes her!

796
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,933
Hey, what are those?

797
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,507
Water bikes?

798
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,269
Mm.

799
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,811
- What, you've never been
on a paddle boat before?
- Uh-uh.

800
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:00,175
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Come on.

801
00:40:00,281 --> 00:40:01,543
I'll give you
your first ride.

802
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,809
Okay.

803
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,509
Do you think she'll
be okay out there?

804
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,347
She's with Ray, isn't she?

805
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,012
I guess.

806
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:10,113
Come on.

807
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:19,229
So, um,

808
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,800
how long you in town?

809
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:22,266
Two more days.

810
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:24,166
Then my dad's
making me come home.

811
00:40:24,271 --> 00:40:27,206
If he doesn't get his way,
it's always a huge disaster.

812
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:30,243
Eh, pretty
controlling, huh?

813
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,868
You have no idea.

814
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:33,844
Yeah, I do.

815
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,381
My dad, he's all...

816
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:37,212
dead set on me starting college
next week.

817
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:39,684
But, I don't know, I want
to take a year off and travel.

818
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:41,914
I've never been
out of Florida.

819
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,582
So we've been arguing about it
all summer.

820
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,319
And he'll probably
win the argument.

821
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:47,451
He always does.

822
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,291
They just don't
get it, do they?

823
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,659
Sometimes you have
to leave home

824
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:52,823
to figure out
what you want.

825
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:54,867
Exactly.

826
00:40:56,804 --> 00:41:00,706
You know, you're not like
most girls around here.

827
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:06,436
They're so cute together.

828
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,310
Claire, how romantic is that?

829
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,108
This is nice.

830
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,719
The sun is setting!

831
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:15,982
Yeah, I know.

832
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,557
We timed it pretty well,
didn't we?

833
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,888
- I have to get back!
- What? Okay.

834
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:21,120
Uh...

835
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,990
Okay. All right.

836
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,326
- Okay, all right...
- Oh, no!

837
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:26,330
We're going
the wrong way!

838
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:27,661
We're heading
back out to sea!

839
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:29,167
There we go,
we're turning around.

840
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,363
Yeah, we're turning around,
everything's okay...

841
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:32,803
Hailey! Claire!

842
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,137
- Sunset!
- Oh, no!

843
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,470
She's gonna pop a tail!

844
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,340
- Hailey! Claire!
- Just add moonlight or water!

845
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,743
I have to get back!

846
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,679
Hey, hey...

847
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,478
Here, let's talk about
something to, um,

848
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,847
distract you, okay?

849
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:49,150
Like, um... what are you doing
tomorrow night?

850
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,520
You've probably heard
about the Last Splash?

851
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,557
- We're coming, Aqua!
- Paddle!

852
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,560
It's a...
a party type thing.

853
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:55,959
Wow, you're really
in a hurry.

854
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:57,360
It's not your fault.
I just...

855
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,193
I have to be somewhere.

856
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,824
Oh.

857
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,766
Hey, you've got
to help our friend!

858
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,167
She's really sick.
She's got...

859
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,831
- Hydrophobia! Yeah.
- Hypertension!

860
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,431
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

861
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:11,272
Come on, please.
This is serious.

862
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:12,345
Faster!

863
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,743
Hey!

864
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:14,745
Oh, no!

865
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:18,246
Come on, you're almost there.
You're almost there.

866
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:19,216
Pardon me. Excuse me.

867
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,686
- Sorry. Pardon me.
- Ow!

868
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,414
Hey!

869
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:23,547
Let's go, let's go!

870
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:24,521
Keep going!
Don't stop!

871
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,183
Bikes around the corner!

872
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,282
Run!

873
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:29,521
- I'm sorry!
- Let's go!

874
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,927
It was so much fun.

875
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:33,431
Aqua, go, go!
We gotta get you back!

876
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:40,704
I'll be right back.

877
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,605
Hey, Ray.

878
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,302
That was too close.

879
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:46,436
I need some water
to spend the night in.

880
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:47,377
How about the ocean?

881
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,880
No. No ocean-
my father would just

882
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,076
manipulate the currents
and pull me back home.

883
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,210
I know a place.

884
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:58,587
Holy mackerel!

885
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:00,853
Come on.

886
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,724
Come on, let's go.

887
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,325
- Claire, you doing this?
- Uh-uh.

888
00:43:09,436 --> 00:43:11,063
Aren't you coming?

889
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,536
I-I don't do water.

890
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,801
On the ground or in the air.

891
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:16,569
Raymond was about
to kiss you

892
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,009
with his actual lips!

893
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:21,240
Stupid sun!

894
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,315
Did Ray say anything?

895
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,441
He asked if I heard
of Last Splash.

896
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:26,143
- What?!
- What?!

897
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,652
Exactly what did he say?

898
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:29,279
Uh...

899
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,290
I can't remember.

900
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:34,657
So was it "Are you going?"
Or "Will you go with me?"

901
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,593
- Is there a difference?
- Huge.

902
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,459
- Major.
- Okay,

903
00:43:37,564 --> 00:43:40,124
well, it started with...

904
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:42,202
"What are you doing
tomorrow night?"

905
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,669
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, he was totally
asking you out

906
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:45,932
- on a date!
- He was?

907
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,132
Absolutely.

908
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,265
Yes!

909
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,108
Be careful, guys.

910
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:58,209
Thanks.

911
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,048
Sure.

912
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:07,723
Why won't Claire come with us?

913
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,227
She's not good around water.

914
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,060
- It's kind of a long story.
- Hm.

915
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,496
Wow...

916
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:20,505
I wish I could hide out here
with you.

917
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:33,284
Is this gonna be okay?

918
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:36,754
Yeah.

919
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,841
Wow.

920
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:03,372
I almost forgot.

921
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:05,213
Me, too.

922
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,046
This is nice.

923
00:45:08,155 --> 00:45:09,247
Good.

924
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,620
Are you gonna be okay in here?

925
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:14,922
Are you gonna be okay out there?

926
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:16,086
Mm?

927
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:20,428
I'll see you tomorrow...

928
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:21,694
fish butt!

929
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,396
I heard that!

930
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:26,700
I never realized how big

931
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,899
this room was.

932
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,942
Without all my
stuff in it.

933
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:32,477
I want this wish so bad, Claire.

934
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:38,308
- Claire?
- Hm?

935
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:41,047
Do you think he'll fall
in actual love with her,

936
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,214
in two days?

937
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,086
He has to.

938
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,160
I-It's her last hope.

939
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:53,029
Hailey?

940
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:55,260
- What?
- We completely forgot something.

941
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:57,894
What's Aqua gonna wear
to the Last Splash?

942
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,131
I mean, she can't

943
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,332
keep wearing your T-shirts.
No offense.

944
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:02,466
Hey, hey.

945
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,339
We'll take the first bus
into Tampa tomorrow,

946
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:05,434
and we'll go shopping.

947
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:08,115
- Wha? No. We can't!
- No, we have to.

948
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,379
Besides, I have $400 saved up
from working at the aquarium.

949
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,578
Do you know how much trouble
we'll be in?

950
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,245
Come on, Clairedy cat.

951
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,344
Hm?

952
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,767
Smile.

953
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:39,946
Hello!

954
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:43,373
What?

955
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:46,385
Why go through life
unnoticed?

956
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:56,187
- Aqua!
- This store is hideous!

957
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,026
This store is
for old people!

958
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,864
- Yeah.
- No, no.

959
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,700
This store is
kind of lame.

960
00:47:04,805 --> 00:47:06,705
- It's all used stuff.
- Oh, come on, you guys.

961
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:08,069
It's so different
from anything else

962
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:09,403
we saw at the mall.

963
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,239
Come on, just give it a chance.

964
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,309
Hey, you guys.

965
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,355
Hm, hm, hm?

966
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:27,153
It's old-fashioned,
but I think it works.

967
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:27,920
I don't know.

968
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,689
I love vintage.

969
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:32,924
Look at these sleeves!

970
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,227
Mm.

971
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,738
Ow, ow...

972
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:43,741
Sorry.

973
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,002
Okay, we've got three
hours till Last Splash,

974
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:16,803
so, uh, a quick review?

975
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,241
Dresses: Check.

976
00:48:18,345 --> 00:48:20,040
Blue highlights:
Big check.

977
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,512
Are we missing
anything?

978
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:24,675
Wait. I don't have earrings!

979
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:26,650
How could I not
have earrings?

980
00:48:26,753 --> 00:48:28,414
I have earrings.
Don't worry.

981
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:34,755
Hm. Pretty.

982
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:36,795
And... pointy?

983
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,627
What am I
supposed to do with this?

984
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:41,724
Like, stick it through my skin?

985
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,734
That's what you do.

986
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,464
Ugh!

987
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:46,732
You're so primitive.

988
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,932
I wear stick-ons.

989
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:48,973
You mean, clip-ons?

990
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:50,907
No.

991
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:53,412
You'll love these.

992
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,140
They're my favorite
aquatic accessory.

993
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:57,148
You see that buoy
out there?

994
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,241
I need you to swim out there
and find me a couple

995
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,752
of starfish about...

996
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,981
mmm, this big.

997
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,148
Live starfish?

998
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,020
That's what you wear
for earrings?

999
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:07,457
They compliment me.

1000
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,392
Seriously, Aqua,
I've got some earrings

1001
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:11,020
that'll complement
you just fine.

1002
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:14,123
No. I mean, they literally
give me compliments.

1003
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:15,758
- In my ear. They talk to me.
- Huh? Huh?

1004
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,861
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.

1005
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,940
They love
to give compliments.

1006
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,303
But it's nice

1007
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:23,876
when you need a little boost.

1008
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:24,875
Okay, guys,

1009
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:26,070
let's go.

1010
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,874
Hailey, I can't.

1011
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,380
You've got to do this.

1012
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:32,316
Do you see how far
that buoy is? No.

1013
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:35,320
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you a ride.

1014
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:52,665
No way!

1015
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,568
Wow...

1016
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:56,574
Oh!

1017
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:58,804
Hi!

1018
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,140
Hi, guys!

1019
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:02,744
Oh!

1020
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:04,146
Watch the legs, guys!

1021
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:07,317
- Claire, look at that!
- Hi!

1022
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,718
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

1023
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:11,347
Claire, you have to do this
with me.

1024
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:16,894
You go.

1025
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:18,487
Have fun.

1026
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,658
Okay. All right.

1027
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,165
Are you sure?

1028
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,904
Yeah.

1029
00:50:33,714 --> 00:50:35,909
Ah...

1030
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,924
Claire! Look at me!

1031
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:52,260
Whoo-hoo! Way to go, Hail!

1032
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:03,676
Hailey!

1033
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:06,007
Hi, guys!

1034
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:08,604
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1035
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:11,047
Don't you just...

1036
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,142
love love?

1037
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:16,287
What?

1038
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:19,017
It's just...

1039
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:21,492
you're so sure
of yourself.

1040
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:23,688
Well, I've only seen love
up close once,

1041
00:51:23,797 --> 00:51:25,890
but if you'd seen it
the way I did,

1042
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,261
you'd feel the same way.

1043
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:30,302
Why? What was it like?

1044
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:31,665
It was years ago.

1045
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,434
Not too far from here,
actually.

1046
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:36,509
We were migrating
through the bay,

1047
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,306
just like we always do
this time of year, and...

1048
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:43,610
I saw this couple out sailing
on their little blue boat,
