1
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,148
Once upon this same Earth,

2
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,484
beneath this same Sun,

3
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,070
long before you...

4
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,532
Before the ape
and the elephant as well,

5
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,910
before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,

6
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,330
before the mammoth
and the mastodon

7
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,124
in the time
of the dinosaurs.

8
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,254
Come on!

9
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,507
Now the dinosaurs
were of two kinds.

10
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,969
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees,

11
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,097
and some had sharp teeth
for eating meat,

12
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,724
and they preyed upon
the Leaf Eaters.

13
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,728
Then it happened that
the leaves began to die.

14
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,399
The mighty beasts, who
appeared to rule the Earth,

15
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,943
were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.

16
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,320
Desperate for food,

17
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,324
some of the dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,

18
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,952
searching for
the Great Valley,

19
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,621
a land still lush
and green.

20
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,666
It was a journey
toward life.

21
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,969
It was a march
of many dangers.

22
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,513
Sharpteeth
stalked the herds,

23
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,640
waiting to seize
any who strayed.

24
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,769
The Leaf Eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.

25
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,945
Ha.

26
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,031
Aah.

27
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,636
Mama.

28
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,346
Hmm.

29
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,517
Mmm.

30
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,395
Mmm.

31
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,022
Mmm.

32
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,711
Some of the young
seemed born without fear.

33
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,243
Yet...

34
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,830
Even hatching
could be dangerous.

35
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,772
One herd had only
a single baby,

36
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,775
their last hope
for the future.

37
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,823
And they called him

38
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,575
"Littlefoot."

39
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,829
Here I am.

40
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,957
Aw.

41
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,325
Don't be frightened.

42
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,452
Come out.

43
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,674
Mmm.

44
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,611
All that remained
of his herd was his mother,

45
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,696
grandmother,
and his grandfather.

46
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,074
He knew them by sight,

47
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,368
by scent,
and by their love.

48
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,538
He knew they would
be together always.

49
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,708
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.

50
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,044
Ahh.

51
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,678
Aah.

52
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,229
Beautiful Littlefoot.

53
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,573
Mother, is this
all there is to eat?

54
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,617
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.

55
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,453
The land
has been changing.

56
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,708
That is why we must walk
as far as we can each day,

57
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,003
until we reach
the Great Valley.

58
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,092
Littlefoot, quickly,
come here.

59
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,304
Look, up there.

60
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,432
A tree star.

61
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,560
It is very special.

62
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,826
A tree star.

63
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,622
It is very special.

64
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,373
It'll help you
grow strong.

65
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,458
Where we are going,

66
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,960
there are so many
of these leaves.

67
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,301
Come along.

68
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,933
The Great Valley is filled
with green food like this,

69
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,435
more than you could
ever eat,

70
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,230
and more fresh,
cool water

71
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,106
than you could
ever drink.

72
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,817
It's a wonderful,
beautiful place,

73
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,861
where we can
live happily

74
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,155
with many more
of our own kind.

75
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,783
Gee, when will
we get there?

76
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,329
The bright circle must
pass over us many times,

77
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,289
and we must
follow it each day

78
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,625
to where
it touches the ground.

79
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,381
Have you ever seen
the Great Valley?

80
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,177
No.

81
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,807
Well, how do you know
it's really there?

82
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,520
Some things you see
with your eyes,

83
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,439
others you see
with your heart.

84
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,026
I don't understand,
Mother.

85
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,863
You will, my son.

86
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,657
You will.

87
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,668
Littlefoot, don't you
wander too far.

88
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,231
Hey!

89
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,705
What are you
laughing at?

90
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,353
Littlefoot.

91
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,812
Come, Cera.

92
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,983
Three-horns never play
with Longnecks.

93
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,029
Littlefoot.

94
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,493
Three-horns never play
with Longnecks.

95
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,625
Longneck?

96
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,335
Hmm.

97
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,546
Mother,
what's a Longneck?

98
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,216
Why, that's
what we are, dear.

99
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,552
Oh. Well,
why can't I play

100
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,054
with that Three-horn?

101
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,723
We were having fun.

102
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,143
Well, we all keep
to our own kind.

103
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,979
The Three-horns,
the Spiketails,

104
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,107
the Swimmers,
the Flyers.

105
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,150
We never
do anything together.

106
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,318
Why?

107
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,488
Well, because
we're different.

108
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,865
It's always
been that way.

109
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,117
Well, why?

110
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,869
Oh, don't worry so much.

111
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,455
When we reach
the Great Valley,

112
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,582
there will be
many, many Longnecks

113
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,501
for you to play with.

114
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,380
I wish we were there now.

115
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,757
Well, it's a long way yet,

116
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,301
past the great rock
that looks like a Longneck,

117
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,595
and past the mountains
that burn.

118
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,473
Still a long way,
but we'll get there.

119
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,208
Hey, hopper,
come back!

120
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,379
Hey.

121
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,050
You again? Go away!

122
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,470
That's my hopper.

123
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,556
I... I saw him first.

124
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,808
Well, he's in my pond.

125
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,917
Over here.

126
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,252
Hey, this is fun.

127
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,976
Sharptooth!

128
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,063
Help!

129
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,606
Mother! Help!

130
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,307
Go.

131
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,816
This way.
Mm-mmm.

132
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,485
Come back.
You're going the wrong way!

133
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,158
Whoa!

134
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,183
Mother?
Run! Run!

135
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,690
Look out!

136
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,764
Help!

137
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,183
Mother!

138
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:39,975
Daddy!

139
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,981
In this time
of the clash of continents,

140
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,650
a great earthquake
split the land.

141
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,778
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.

142
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,699
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.

143
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,624
Cera!

144
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,377
Mama! Daddy!

145
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,505
Cera was on one side
of the divide,

146
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,759
her parents were
on the other.

147
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,347
Mother!

148
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,523
Mother!

149
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,535
Mother, where are you?

150
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,330
Oh.

151
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,541
Mother!

152
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,669
Mother?

153
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:50,879
Oh.

154
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,631
Please get up.

155
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,382
I'm

156
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,552
not sure I can,
Littlefoot.

157
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,221
Yes, you can.

158
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:00,972
Get up.

159
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,567
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,

160
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:16,404
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

161
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,660
I guess so, but why
do I have to know?

162
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,912
You're going
to be with me.

163
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,373
I'll be with you,

164
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,584
even if
you can't see me.

165
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,379
What do you mean
if I can't see you?

166
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,548
I can always see you.

167
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,092
Littlefoot,

168
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,970
let your heart
guide you.

169
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,764
It whispers.

170
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,433
So, listen closely.

171
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,231
Mother?

172
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,691
Mother?

173
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,843
Mmm.

174
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,303
Mmmmm.

175
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,722
Hey!

176
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,350
What's going on here?

177
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,314
What's your problem?
You're not hurt.

178
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,899
It's not fair.

179
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,568
She should
have known better.

180
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,612
That was a
Sharptooth.

181
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,114
It's all her fault.

182
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,158
All whose fault?

183
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,326
Mother's.

184
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,119
Oh...

185
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,289
I see.

186
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,916
I see.

187
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,376
Why did I wander
so far from home?

188
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,670
Oh, it's not
your fault.

189
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,465
It's not your
mother's fault.

190
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,676
Now, you pay attention
to old Rooter.

191
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,511
Yeah, but...

192
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,639
It is nobody's fault.

193
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,392
The great circle
of life has begun,

194
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,437
but, you see,

195
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,357
not all of us arrive
together at the end.

196
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,609
What'll I do?

197
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,528
I miss her so much.

198
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,197
And you'll always
miss her,

199
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,407
but she'll
always be with you

200
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,036
as long as you remember
the things she taught you.

201
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,456
In a way,
you'll never be apart,

202
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,085
for you are still
a part of each other.

203
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,836
My tummy hurts.

204
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,756
Well, that, too,
will go in time,

205
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,801
little fella.
Only in time.

206
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,705
At first,

207
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,332
Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.

208
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,043
He hardly
noticed his hunger

209
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,836
and forgot about
the Great Valley

210
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,297
and that he must
somehow reach it.

211
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,649
Littlefoot.

212
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,727
Littlefoot.

213
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,872
Dear Littlefoot,

214
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,876
do you remember the way
to the Great Valley?

215
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,630
Follow the bright circle

216
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,800
past the great rock
that looks like a Longneck

217
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,553
and past the mountains
that burn.

218
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,351
I'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.

219
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,688
Let your heart guide you.

220
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,867
Mother.

221
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,663
Mother!

222
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,586
Mother!

223
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,337
It's you!

224
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,756
Wait, Mother!

225
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,258
Wait!

226
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,527
Then Littlefoot
knew for certain

227
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,447
that he was alone,
and that though

228
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,657
the Great Valley
was far away

229
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,160
and the journey there
was perilous,

230
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,455
he would have
to find his way.

231
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,082
Or the chain of life
would be broken.

232
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,959
Cera!

233
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,550
Cera, hello.

234
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,010
What do you want?

235
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,512
Nothing. Where are you going?

236
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,140
I'm going to find
my own kind.

237
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,975
They're on
the other side.

238
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,561
Well, I've looked
all over here.

239
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,896
You can't climb up
the other side.

240
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,564
Maybe you can't.

241
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,486
Wait! I'm going
to the Great Valley.

242
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,656
We could...uh...
Help each other.

243
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,283
A Three-horn...

244
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,161
Does not need help
from a Longneck.

245
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,463
Well, at least
we wouldn't be alone.

246
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,676
Well, when I find
my sisters,

247
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,887
I won't be alone,
so go away.

248
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,099
Three-horns can
be very dangerous.

249
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,350
And they only talk

250
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,726
with other
Three-horns,

251
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,019
and they
only travel

252
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,980
with other
Three-horns.

253
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,067
Hello.

254
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,404
I said hello.

255
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,743
What is your name?

256
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,081
Maybe you
cannot talk yet.

257
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,416
Huh? Huh?

258
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,962
Don't you
know anything?

259
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,798
Longnecks
don't talk to, uh,

260
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,468
whatever you are.

261
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,388
Me? I'm a Longneck,
too. See?

262
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,807
And I have a long
tail like you.

263
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,564
All right.

264
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm not a Longneck.

265
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,945
I'm a Bigmouth,
but I am all alone.

266
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,280
I am.

267
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,494
I lost my family in
the big earthshake.

268
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,623
Um...you want
to go with me?

269
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,124
Yeah! Oh.

270
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,127
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes!

271
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,587
I do, I do!

272
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,173
All right.

273
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,341
Come on.

274
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,552
But you have to keep up.

275
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,971
I will keep up.
I will.

276
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,394
Where are we going?

277
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,229
To the Great Valley.

278
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,399
I'm not gonna stop until
I find my grandparents.

279
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,986
Uh, do you think
my family went

280
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,488
to the Great Valley, too?

281
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:01,864
Huh?

282
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:04,075
Hmm. Maybe.
My mother said

283
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,410
it's where all
the herds were going.

284
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,870
Oh, I hope.
I hope. I hope.

285
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,124
My name's Littlefoot.

286
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,959
Mine is Ducky.

287
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,419
Yep, that is
what it is.

288
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,628
Yup, yup, yup.

289
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,102
Don't step on a crack,

290
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,271
or you'll fall
and break your back.

291
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,363
My stomach is talking.

292
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,574
Mine, too.

293
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,160
Hmm. I wonder what
this tastes like.

294
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,330
The tree is talking.

295
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,499
No, it isn't.

296
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,294
You should not eat
talking trees.

297
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,378
Nope, nope, nope.

298
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,088
Oooh!

299
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,226
Who are you? Huh?

300
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,145
My name Petrie.

301
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,484
Petrie, huh?
Funny name.

302
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,028
Uh, I... I flied?

303
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,238
No.
You falled.

304
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,657
I falled? Ohh!

305
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,410
You cannot fly?

306
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,454
But how did you get
way up there?

307
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
I climb.

308
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,833
But you're a Flyer,
not a faller.

309
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,752
Hard thing to fly.

310
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,674
I guess it is.
We can't do it.

311
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,968
Nope, we cannot
do that all right.

312
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,806
Shh! Quiet.

313
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,435
Stay low.

314
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,667
Ow! Hey! Petrie!

315
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,960
Get off!

316
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,546
You got nice
flat head, Flat Head.

317
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,134
My name is not Flat Head.
My name is Littlefoot.

318
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,011
Littlefoot? Hmm.

319
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,221
Are you just going
to stay up there?

320
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,265
Yes.

321
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,558
Well, you can't.
Whoa!

322
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,727
You're tearing
my tree star.

323
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,230
It is very special.
Very.

324
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,857
His mother
gave it to him.

325
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,109
She did.

326
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,237
Ooh! Mother present
very important.

327
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,822
Oh, yes.
I keep safes.

328
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,866
Don't let
nobodies touch.

329
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,035
Yep, Petrie,

330
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,244
you keep
it safe.

331
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,746
Yup,
yup, yup.

332
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,039
Nope, nope, nope.

333
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,166
I'm not a carrier.
Get off!

334
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,503
You're a Flyer.
Now start flying.

335
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,713
But...

336
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,715
Open your wings,
Petrie!

337
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,175
Open! Open!

338
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,344
No, no!
No can do this!

339
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,845
You can fly!

340
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,847
Now open your
skinny wings!

341
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,766
Petrie, higher!

342
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,601
Higher
like a Flyer!

343
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,186
Danger!

344
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,938
Where, Petrie?

345
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,731
There! Ahead!

346
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,149
Whoa!

347
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,838
Cera! It's you!
What happened?

348
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,216
Why are you
so frightened?

349
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,427
Frightened? Me?

350
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,682
Why are you
so frightened?

351
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,309
We're not frightened. Are we?

352
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,894
Nope, nope.

353
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,313
Well, you should be.

354
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,817
I could be with
the other Three-horns,

355
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,570
but I chose to come back
to warn you.

356
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,031
I met the Sharptooth!

357
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,326
Sharptooth! Ooh!

358
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,997
Come on, Cera,
Sharptooth is dead.

359
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,666
He fell down into
the big underground.

360
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,211
And that's
where he met me.

361
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,090
Oh! Dear,
brave Cera.

362
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,884
Dear, brave Cera.

363
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,844
Yes, I am brave.

364
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,013
Sharptooth is dead!

365
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,431
My father told me

366
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,642
that Flat Heads had
very small brains.

367
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,274
I was all alone
with him in the dark,

368
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,527
just the Sharptooth
and me.

369
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,988
I could
hear him breathing.

370
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,413
I could see
his one big ugly eye

371
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,123
looking for me.

372
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,920
What did you do?

373
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,838
Huh? Huh?

374
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,508
I walked
right up to him.

375
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,636
I looked him
straight in the eye

376
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,055
and said...

377
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,351
Whoa!

378
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,905
Ducky!

379
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,076
Hello.

380
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,416
Hello?

381
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,511
You should come out.
You should. You are late.

382
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,805
Yes, you are.
Yup, yup, yup.

383
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,184
Come out!

384
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,686
You are all alone.

385
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,272
Are you not
scared? Huh?

386
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,861
We're going
to the Great Valley.

387
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,363
You could go with us.
Yes, you can.

388
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,324
Uh, you are
a Spiketail,

389
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,243
so we will
call you "Spike."

390
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,526
Ducky!

391
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,034
So, the five hungry dinosaurs

392
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,869
set off
for the Great Valley.

393
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,330
There had never been
such a herd before,

394
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,957
a Longneck,
a Three-horn,

395
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,294
a Bigmouth,
a Flyer, and a Spiketail,

396
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,004
all together,

397
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,924
all knowing that if they
lost their way,

398
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,675
they would starve

399
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,804
or find themselves
in Sharptooth's shadow.

400
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,228
Hmm.
Tree stars grow

401
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,356
where there's
lots of water.

402
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,108
If we follow
this water...

403
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,820
Hmm. No
green foods here,

404
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,656
and I still hungry.

405
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,117
I'm still
hungry, too.

406
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,122
Can you
smell something?

407
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,208
I... I...

408
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,126
I smell...
I smell...

409
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,711
I smell...

410
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,672
Hmm. Ducky.

411
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,840
You smell me?

412
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,386
I smell water.
I smell...

413
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,348
Tree stars!

414
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,142
Oh, look!
Green food!

415
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,020
The Great Valley!
I found it!

416
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,189
Cera, stop it!

417
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,649
I found it!

418
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,819
Earthshake!

419
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,779
We've got
to get out of here!

420
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,407
That way!
Come on! Come on!

421
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,242
Help!

422
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,785
Spike, hurry up!

423
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,914
Ducky, Spike,
get out of there!

424
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,639
They're eating
our food!

425
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,727
Look, look what
they're doing!

426
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,311
They're
so greedy!

427
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,563
What about me?

428
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,106
I'm still
hungry!

429
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,650
You hungry?

430
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,277
I empty all the way
to the top.

431
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:24,778
Now we at
the Great Valley

432
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,739
and still got
no green foods.

433
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:31,410
Oh, we be hungry forevers.

434
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,620
No, Petrie.
Cera was wrong.

435
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,873
This isn't
the Great Valley.

436
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,334
Oh, it is not
a great anything.

437
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,086
Nope, nope, nope.

438
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,380
Well,
we better go down

439
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,716
and see if there's
anything left.

440
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,594
Petrie, do you think you could
fly up there and...

441
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,720
No, no!

442
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,764
Petrie,
do not feel sad.

443
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,140
It is all right.

444
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,100
Many things
do not fly.

445
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,728
Rocks, trees, sticks,

446
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,772
Spike.

447
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,244
Waah!

448
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,913
Hey!
No!

449
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,874
Ducky, push Petrie
towards the branches.

450
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,584
Ohh!

451
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,963
All right, Spike,
not too fast.

452
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,342
Whoa! Okay.
Hey, not too fast.

453
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,676
Hey, not too fast!

454
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,608
You four
look so ridiculous.

455
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,467
Ducky, Petrie,
come down here!

456
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,302
We've got
green food!

457
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,722
Fly, Petrie!

458
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,893
Fly, Petrie!
Flap your wings!

459
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:29,736
I flied?

460
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,117
Come on, Cera.
We've got green food.

461
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,495
I can get
my own green food.

462
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,732
See? I can
take care of myself.

463
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,443
All by myself.

464
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,157
And I'm not
afraid to be alone!

465
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,452
I know my way to go,

466
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,288
and I'm not
afraid of Sharptooth!

467
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,293
I hope he doesn't
eat any of you.

468
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,377
Don't worry.

469
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,463
There isn't
any Sharptooth.

470
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,800
Sharptooth! Spike.

471
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,033
Mmm.

472
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,545
There isn't
any Sharptooth.

473
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Hmm.

474
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,956
Mmm. Mmm.

475
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,541
Wake up.
Wake up!

476
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,378
Wake up!

477
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,839
Hey, stop that.

478
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,382
Shh! It's Sharptooth.

479
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,259
Cera, stop it.

480
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,760
Shh!
He'll eat us.

481
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,387
He'll eat us!
Run!

482
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,264
Stop! Come back!

483
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,482
Don't look back!
Keep going!

484
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,167
Now will you
believe me?

485
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,961
I'm sorry.
We're safe now.

486
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,005
Nobody's safe with you.

487
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,926
Look, it's the rock

488
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,511
that looks like
a Longneck,

489
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,638
just like
my mother said.

490
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,223
We're going
the right way,

491
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,726
the way
to the Great Valley!

492
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,732
Littlefoot had been wrong

493
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,234
about the Sharptooth, but
the others followed him.

494
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,945
Their only hope was
to reach the Great Valley,

495
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,406
and Littlefoot alone
knew the way.

496
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,753
Come on. Get up.

497
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,547
We're going
the right way.

498
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,382
We got to keep
moving up.

499
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,176
Oh, you can't
quit now.

500
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,802
What if
the Great Valley's

501
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,222
just over the top
of these rocks?

502
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,644
Though they were
sore-stumped and tired,

503
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,646
Littlefoot urged them on.

504
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,397
He'd never seen
the Great Valley,

505
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,608
but his heart told him
that they were close.

506
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:45,403
Surely at the top,
they'd behold it finally.

507
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,212
This is
your Great Valley?

508
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,299
You're crazy.
I'm leaving.

509
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,511
Cera, we have to keep
following the bright circle.

510
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,930
I'm taking the easy way
for once.

511
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,474
But it's
the wrong way.

512
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:15,600
Who says?

513
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,018
My mother.

514
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,604
Then she was a stupid
Longneck, too.

515
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,147
Take that back.

516
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,482
Never.

517
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,650
Take it back!

518
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,943
No!

519
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,781
Spike!

520
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,908
Spike, stop!

521
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,827
Don't fall!

522
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,498
You!

523
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,086
Let go of my leg!

524
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,058
Spike.

525
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,187
Take that!

526
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,448
Huh!

527
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,664
Go on!

528
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,708
Go the wrong way.

529
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,878
We never wanted you
with us anyway.

530
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,050
Come on. We have
to keep going.

531
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:36,973
Come on.

532
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,355
Cera's way is easier.

533
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,607
I think so, too.

534
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,821
Oh, Flat Head, wait!

535
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,574
Ooh!  Ow!

536
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,326
No be angry.

537
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:57,577
Wait!

538
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,918
Cera, wait for us!

539
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,420
We're coming
with you, Cera!

540
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,590
Cera, Spike, wait!

541
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:31,945
I wish Littlefoot
was here with us now.

542
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,446
Me, too.

543
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,282
Spike.

544
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,161
Spike, do not stop.

545
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,497
We must stay together.

546
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,525
Whoa! Cera, I...

547
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,446
Whoa! Oh, Cera,
Ducky, Spike! Help!

548
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,450
Help, Cera!

549
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,995
Cera, where are you?

550
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,833
Littlefoot!

551
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,917
Ducky!

552
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,127
Help, Littlefoot!

553
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,045
Hang on!
I'm coming!

554
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,178
Littlefoot!

555
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,726
Quick, this way!

556
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,272
Petrie! Hang on, Petrie!

557
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,024
Help!

558
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,360
Ooh! Flat Head!

559
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,070
Ducky! Spike!

560
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,615
Oh, Petrie
am so happy.

561
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,742
Jump, Petrie!

562
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,454
Help, Ducky!

563
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,042
Petrie, pull!

564
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,505
Petrie.

565
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,092
Help!

566
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,552
Help!

567
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,859
Help me!
Help me! Help!

568
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,071
Woo!

569
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,041
Get away!
Get away from me!

570
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,584
Stop it!

571
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,586
Let go of me! Help!

572
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:55,797
Help!

573
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,383
Petrie, Spike, Ducky, help!

574
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,053
Cera, it is us.

575
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,153
I knew it was you
all along.

576
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,738
I knew! I did!

577
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,745
Oh, get out
of my way.

578
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,807
Cera?

579
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,977
Cera, come back! Cera!

580
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,480
Cera was still
too proud to admit that...

581
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,025
She'd gone
the wrong way.

582
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,689
Sharptooth!

583
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,401
It's Sharptooth.

584
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,823
Let's get rid of him
once and for all.

585
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,033
What'll we do?

586
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,119
Look, we'll coax him
to the deep end of the pond.

587
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,789
He can't swim
with those scrawny arms.

588
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,165
Me and Spike
will go up

589
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,376
and push that big rock
on top of his head.

590
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,044
And then he'll fall off
into the water.

591
00:54:58,587 --> 00:54:59,963
Petrie,
you whistle

592
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,798
when he's just
at the right spot

593
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,092
where the water
gets dark.

594
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,552
Now we need some bait.

595
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,721
Hmm.

596
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,850
Me? Oh, no.

597
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,519
No, no, no, no.

598
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,237
Ducky!

599
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,488
Ducky!

600
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,133
Push, Spike, push
with all your might!

601
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,312
Petrie!

602
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,320
I flying.

603
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,654
I flying!

604
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,114
I flying!

605
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,075
Help!

606
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,880
Petrie!

607
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,388
I'm coming!

608
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,102
Cera, you're back!

609
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,711
He was my friend.

610
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,631
Poor Petrie.

611
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,891
Poor, poor Petrie.

612
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,479
Petrie.

613
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,691
Stop!

614
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:09,277
You go
without Petrie?

615
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,903
Petrie.

616
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,365
Oh!

617
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,242
Petrie, you're safe!

618
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,162
Yup, yup, yup, yup,
yup, yup!

619
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,500
Littlefoot.

620
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,589
Littlefoot.

621
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,633
Mother!

622
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:37,930
Littlefoot.

623
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,435
Mother?

624
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,566
I tried to do
what you told me,

625
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,236
but it's
just too hard.

626
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,033
I'll never find
the Great Valley.

627
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,162
Mother. Mother!

628
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,122
Don't go, Mother!

629
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,582
Don't go!

630
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,052
The Great Valley.

631
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,059
Cera, Spike, Ducky,
Petrie, over here!

632
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,816
Littlefoot,
you found it!

633
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,401
Yup, yup, yup.

634
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,279
We did it.
We did it together!

635
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,115
The Great Valley

636
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,492
was all they dreamed
it would be,

637
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,663
a land of green,
of leaves, and life.

638
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,166
There were waterfalls,
grassy meadows,

639
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,295
enough tree stars
to feast on forever...

640
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,965
And grazing upon them,
their families.

641
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,345
This is our
new brother, Spike.

642
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,564
Mama, I a Flyer!

643
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,940
Yay!

644
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,739
Daddy!

645
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:00,906
Cera?

646
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:04,910
Daddy.

647
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,629
And Littlefoot

648
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,758
found his grandmother
and grandfather at last,

649
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,053
the same loving faces
he'd looked into

650
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,221
on the day of his birth.

651
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,803
Littlefoot! Come on.
I'll race you.

652
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,474
And they all grew
up together in the valley,

653
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,602
generation
upon generation,

654
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,522
each passing on
to the next

655
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,149
the tale of their
ancestors' journey

656
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,736
to the valley...
Long ago.
