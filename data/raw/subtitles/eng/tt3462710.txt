1
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,967
Says here you pressed
domestic violence charges

2
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,849
three years ago against
your alleged assailant,

3
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,846
Michael Vargas.

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,561
He was convicted and served
12 months' probation.

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,205
I'm sorry that happened to you.

6
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,328
They dated for two years.

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,561
And you were treated in
a psychiatric hospital after the incident.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,171
That was my choice.

9
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,807
But after the restraining order was up,
you tried to resume contact.

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,886
<i>You tell me, Ms. Banks,</i>

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,761
after all this why would you wanna
go back and reunite with Mr. Vargas?

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,321
No.

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,766
We downloaded the contents
of Mr. Vargas' phone.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,365
I have almost 50 pages

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,841
of Facebook messages
between you and Mr. Vargas.

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,806
These belong to you?

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,851
Yes.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,640
But you don't understand, I...

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,081
The man is dead,

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,042
found in your home,
with your face all over his phone

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,125
and your delicates found in his car.

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,401
Now you're gonna have to
help me out here.

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,650
<i>That's what we always said
this company was about, right?</i>

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,923
Taking risks, adventures,
and bringing stories to life.

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,082
Although she clearly didn't get the memo

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,289
that mindset only applies
to adventures we have together.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,605
I could not be more thrilled
for her next chapter.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,321
To Julia,

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,682
the woman who has brought
so many stories to life

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,524
<i>as our chief online editor</i>

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,001
<i>- now gets to have a life of her own...</i>
- Thank you.

32
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,087
And will be working remotely
in her pajama jeans and granny panties.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,491
To Julia. We love you.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,289
- Am I crazy?
- No.

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,488
David is amazing, all right?

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,122
And what happened with Michael
was not your fault.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,004
You are a survivor.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,205
Look, if the universe owes
anyone a solid, I think it's you.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,041
And you can always come home.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,007
- Well...
- Oh.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,288
With that ring, you're never coming home.

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,369
Well, at least you know
you can if you want to.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,521
- Oh, God.
- Don't be mad.

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,681
Got you a little something.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,569
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,370
- This better have been on sale.
- It was.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,648
- And a re-gift.
- It was a re-gift. I've worn it.

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,650
There's makeup on it.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,802
It is. It looked terrible on me.

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,804
But it's for all those UV rays
in Southern California

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,843
that'll be aging you prematurely.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,644
That's why I quit smoking.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,161
Oh, you have to eat this cake.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,845
This isn't the shitty cake
we get for the interns.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,843
- This is the real thing.
- Shh.

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,283
<i>Welcome home, Mrs. Connover.</i>

57
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,925
<i>That's not my name yet,
Mr. Connover.</i>

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,090
<i>Well, I'm just practicing.
How am I doing?</i>

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,281
Ten.

60
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,930
I love it here, this house.

61
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,963
You were born here.

62
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,122
You grew up here.

63
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,125
It's amazing.

64
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,650
Really amazing.

65
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
Well,

66
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,442
now this is our home together,
Mrs. Connover.

67
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,005
Okay.

68
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,802
- We actually have to get up now.
- Mmm-hmm.

69
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,161
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,321
Okay.

71
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,005
Yeah. 'Cause Lily's coming over.

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,525
Okay, I'm gonna get UP-

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,170
And Tessa.

74
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,845
All right. All right...

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,049
I'm up. I'm up. I'm up.

76
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,721
There.

77
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,929
Now you're perfect.

78
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,764
Just like Mommy.

79
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,761
And remember,

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,050
if you miss me, and you wanna
come home, just tell Daddy, okay?

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,521
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,890
Hi, Lily Bean.

83
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,650
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, let me get you out of there.</i>

84
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,086
<i>All right.</i>

85
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,289
Oh, you're getting so big.
Okay, grab your backpack.

86
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,646
Welcome to the neighborhood.

87
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,087
This is so nice, Tessa. Thank you.

88
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,447
You're very welcome.
I hope you'll be happy here.

89
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,602
Me, too. I think I will be.

90
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,770
Well, I've prepared
Lily's lunch for tomorrow

91
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,410
so that you don't need to bother with it.

92
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,409
- Oh, you didn't have to.
- Not a problem.

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,001
And David, please remember,
bed time 7:30.

94
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,286
No liquids after 6:00

95
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,448
<i>unless we want another accident.
Right, sweetheart?</i>

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,966
Hey, we got this.

97
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,248
- Okay Right?

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,851
Mmm-hmm.
- Good. Say bye to Mommy.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,286
Bye, sweetheart.

100
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,647
Mmm, I miss you already. See you
in a couple of days. Be good, okay?

101
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,290
Okay, Mommy.

102
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,920
Thanks.

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,929
- Say hi to Julia.
- Hi, Julia.

104
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,281
Hi, Lily.

105
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,124
What's up, Oreo?

106
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,442
<i>You ready? You got him?
Oh, my God, he's so heavy.</i>

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,806
Let's go!

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
<i>Okay, let's take your stuff upstairs.</i>

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,165
Watch your head.

110
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,966
I hope you like this blanket.

111
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,043
I bought it at the flea market
in Berkeley.

112
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,281
Ooh.

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,369
It has fleas?

114
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,531
No, silly. Ah, it's just an expression.

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,641
Daddy, where's my other blanket?

116
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Oh, Well,

117
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,165
<i>it's up in a closet,</i>

118
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,322
but how about we just try this one,
just for tonight?

119
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>Julia got it special for you, okay?</i>

120
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,088
I can get the other blanket.

121
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,526
Bye-bye.

122
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,600
Bye, babe.

123
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,969
Restraining order
against Michael Vargas

124
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,241
expired.

125
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,922
Julia, you're worthless.

126
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,050
- Hey.
- Hey. You workin'?

127
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,407
Not yet, uh, just got
a cool new submission.

128
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,247
A love story.

129
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,404
<i>Oh, that's great, Jules. Hey, listen.
Can you do me a favor?</i>

130
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,484
We're dressing bottles for three shipments
and we're way behind.

131
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,883
<i>Are you okay being alone
with Lily for dinner?</i>

132
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,804
Yeah, of course.

133
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,481
<i>Thank you. I'll see you later.</i>

134
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,925
<i>I love those colors.</i>

135
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,363
Sorry to drop in on you like this.
Tomorrow is ballet.

136
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,681
She forgot her shoes.

137
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,841
Great. Thank you.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,001
And so you know,

139
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,929
there are links on the calendar
to the Facebook group

140
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,849
so you can stay informed on activities

141
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,485
and who brings snack when.

142
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,926
I'm not on Facebook.

143
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,880
Well, you can look at David's, I suppose.

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,888
And he should really add you to
the pickup list, now that you're with us.

145
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,089
- Hi!

146
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,641
- How you doin', sweetheart?
- I'm good.

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,244
I was just getting dinner ready
on the table.

148
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,004
Okay.

149
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,683
I love you.

150
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,842
Mommy, can you stay for dinner?

151
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,321
No, Lily.

152
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
Please?

153
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,010
Sure.

154
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,845
I made plenty of food.

155
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
Thank you.

156
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,610
<i>Don't just push your food
around the plate.</i>

157
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,245
Julia's going to be very upset.

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,047
It's okay, really.

159
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,886
Cut with your knife, not your fork.

160
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,481
I don't like it.

161
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,251
I'm sorry. It might just be
a little too spicy for her.

162
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,601
Mmm.

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,409
I could get that.

164
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,927
- Do you want pasta, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

165
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,370
Do you have anything organic?

166
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,485
Yeah.

167
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,089
All right, sweetheart. Go to sleep.

168
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,323
Don't worry.

169
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,087
In no time, you will be back with Mommy.

170
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,131
Okay?

171
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,486
I love you.

172
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,084
Thanks for stopping by.

173
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,605
Thank you for letting me stay.

174
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,607
I didn't mean for this to happen.

175
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,211
It's just hard sometimes.

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,081
I get it.

177
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,411
No, you don't.

178
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,846
You couldn't possibly.

179
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,443
That's not your fault.

180
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,641
Good night, Julia.

181
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,691
Good night, Tessa.

182
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,131
David?

183
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,000
David?

184
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,648
Hey!

185
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,525
You Okay?

186
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,445
You look like you saw a ghost.

187
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,649
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

188
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,727
Hi.

189
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,326
<i>Daddy!</i>

190
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,081
Hmm.

191
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,329
I'll fix you some leftovers.

192
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,891
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

193
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,366
It's all right.

194
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,810
I'm coming, Lily.

195
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,163
Tessa only gets Lily two days
this week, you know?

196
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,770
These weeks are really hard for her.

197
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm sure that's why she came over.

198
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,685
Mmm.

199
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,724
This is great, by the way.

200
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,928
Someone else didn't think so.

201
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,925
Come here.

202
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,727
You'll get used to mac and cheese.

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,488
You'll get used to Tessa.

204
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,409
And she'll calm down.

205
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,968
She's adjusting, too.

206
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,681
I just wanna be good at this.

207
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,331
I mean, I will be good at this. I just...

208
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,243
I wish I had a more
normal childhood to draw from.

209
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,486
Hey.

210
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,167
You are not your Mom.

211
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,445
And I'm about a half a bottle of Scotch
a day away from being your Dad.

212
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,250
Thank God.

213
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,211
You just keep being you.

214
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,966
Hmm?

215
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,406
It'll all work out, I promise.

216
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,002
Well, that tastes cuddly.
Let me get a bite of that.

217
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,931
I'm just gonna have a taste. Mmm-hmm.

218
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,605
Okay, okay.

219
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,922
She woke up just moments ago.

220
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,287
- Hush.
- Let's not have nookie in the kitchen.

221
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,851
She's a heavy sleeper.

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,445
No, she's not.

223
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,810
Come here.

224
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,124
Let's go upstairs.

225
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,007
<i>I mean, I know she's Lily's mother
and of course I respect that.</i>

226
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>But it feels like</i>

227
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,130
I'm stepping into her life.

228
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,401
Whoa.

229
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,881
Jules, listen to me, okay?

230
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,401
Think about where you were
a few years ago, all right?

231
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,370
<i>That was hard.
That was life and death stuff.</i>

232
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,921
This is just life stuff, all right?

233
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,967
<i>And remember,</i>

234
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,284
your life is so much bigger than just
Prince Charming and his little princess.

235
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,210
Thank you, Al.

236
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,203
<i>And hey,
you're late on your chapter.</i>

237
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,566
<i>Get back to work, woman.</i>

238
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,000
Bye-bye!

239
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,248
It's a beautiful dress. Beautiful on you.

240
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,810
It's perfect.

241
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,761
We can lift the neckline a little here.

242
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,366
You're David Connover's girlfriend, right?

243
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,726
Yeah.

244
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,961
Small town.

245
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,284
Tess is one of my best customers.

246
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,921
Well, it's time

247
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,447
to tell Tessa and Lily
that we're getting married.

248
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,730
It's not fair to her,

249
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,484
and she needs to know.

250
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,886
Hey.

251
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,770
I agree.

252
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,571
I just wanted you to get here
and get a chance to get settled.

253
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,964
Let Lily get comfortable with you.
But, I agree. Okay?

254
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,121
Come on.

255
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,803
Orange sunsets, skies a blue...

256
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,641
California, we love you.

257
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,481
- All perfect.
- Thanks.

258
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,362
Aw. My baby girl.

259
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,642
All right, give Mommy a hug.

260
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,843
Okay, Lily Bean.

261
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,889
I love you, honey.

262
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,123
And I'm so proud of all your work.
I love seeing your classroom.

263
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,645
Thanks, Mommy. See you tomorrow.

264
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,404
All right, sweetheart. Be good.

265
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,011
- Okay.
- Okay.

266
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,446
Are you ready?

267
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,290
Bye. Thanks. Here we go.

268
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,289
<i>- Are you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

269
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,406
Nice.

270
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,604
Julia, what was your favorite?

271
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,242
Well, I really loved the noodle rainbow.

272
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,648
- I get to eat that one, right?
- No!

273
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,849
<i>- What?
- You can't eat that!</i>

274
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,371
<i>What? Wait, what?
I wanted some, too!</i>

275
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,045
<i>But it seemed yummy!</i>

276
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,201
Oh, all right.

277
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,169
<i>You ready? Okay.</i>

278
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,045
One, two, three.

279
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,120
<i>Again!</i>

280
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,244
Stop it! Stop it.

281
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,931
<i>Now, it's a small deal,
but a big leap,</i>

282
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,643
<i>and we are so proud to be
getting our little brewery</i>

283
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,002
<i>into its first franchise deal.</i>

284
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,447
Whoo!

285
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,361
<i>Miguel, thanks for
signing on to this with me.</i>

286
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,844
<i>And to his lovely wife,
Sarah, our lawyer...</i>

287
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,081
<i>I still can't pay you.</i>

288
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,327
<i>A lot of you guys here saw me
through a rough time</i>

289
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,284
<i>when my Dad got sick and passed away</i>

290
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,848
<i>and that's what made me realize
that this is where I belong.</i>

291
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,050
<i>And to those of you who thought
I was crazy for quitting Merrill Lynch</i>

292
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,449
<i>and brewing beer in my garage, well,</i>

293
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,926
<i>you were wrong.</i>

294
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,329
<i>Here's to chasing dreams, guys.</i>

295
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,326
<i>I sure as hell feel like
mine are coming true.</i>

296
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,926
<i>Cheers!</i>

297
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,841
Thanks, man.

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,001
Hold this.

299
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,288
Overdressed as usual.

300
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,487
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

301
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,166
<i>I just wanted to say a few words.</i>

302
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,206
<i>I've known David a long time.
Since Stanford.</i>

303
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,602
<i>A very long time.</i>

304
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,969
<i>I always knew you were destined
for great things.</i>

305
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,848
<i>I just thought it would be on Wall Street.
Not Main Street.</i>

306
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,131
<i>I'll be the first to admit...</i>

307
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,569
<i>I wasn't thrilled with picking up
our family, packing, and moving</i>

308
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,884
<i>and changing our lives
so you could chase this crazy dream.</i>

309
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,646
<i>But I did.</i>

310
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,726
<i>I may not have always agreed
with your choices, David,</i>

311
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,042
<i>but I always believed in you.</i>

312
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,521
<i>So here's to our brewery!
The best in the West.</i>

313
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,604
Watch. She won't even take a sip.
Too many calories.

314
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,451
Wanna dance?

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,931
Mmm.

316
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,041
I'm leaving, too.

317
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,043
- Bye. I'll call you tomorrow.
- You look so beautiful.

318
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,281
Bye.

319
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,361
Hi.

320
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,120
Can I get you anything?

321
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,329
Aren't you sweet?

322
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,170
No. I'm good. Thank you.

323
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,446
You should go now.

324
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,045
Go! Now!

325
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,761
<i>Nothing?</i>

326
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,684
No, I can't find it anywhere.

327
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,168
Well, it's not downstairs.
Maybe you left it in the car.

328
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,130
No, I checked every inch of the car.

329
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
Will you call it again?

330
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,001
Yeah.

331
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,923
12/02/81.

332
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,726
1-2-8-1.

333
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,168
1-2-0-2.

334
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,401
8-1.

335
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,201
Tessa, what is it?

336
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,723
David, I've been thinking.

337
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,721
How well do you really know Julia?

338
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,840
Don't you think this is
moving a little fast?

339
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,003
No, I don't.

340
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,969
And to be clear,

341
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,531
I'm not asking your permission, Tessa.

342
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,920
I know.

343
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,805
It's just...

344
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,205
She could be anybody.

345
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,200
She's not just anybody. In fact,

346
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,491
um...

347
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,882
I have some news.

348
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,448
Julia and I

349
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,443
are getting married.

350
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,050
That's wonderful.

351
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,170
I'm happy for you.

352
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,727
Thank you. I appreciate it.

353
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,565
I'm just worried about Lily.

354
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,246
Yeah, I understand.
And she's doing great with Lily.

355
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,646
And she's trying really hard.

356
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,883
I know. I see that she's trying.

357
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,644
But she has no idea how to parent.

358
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,725
Lily has a rash now
from some old blanket.

359
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,609
She has no idea what to feed a child.

360
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,764
I had to come over the other day
to get Lily to eat and put her to bed.

361
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,764
And Lily told me she heard her scream
in the middle of the night.

362
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,165
We're all figuring it out.

363
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,560
Come on.

364
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,131
I'm sorry, David.

365
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,524
I'm sorry that we even
have to be talking about this.

366
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,086
Huh.

367
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,007
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't regret...

368
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,525
Tessa,

369
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,247
goodbye,

370
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,801
Hey!

371
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,525
Look what I found.

372
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,326
Great! Where was it?

373
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,323
In the car. Under the seat.

374
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,165
Okay, I looked there.

375
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,890
I'ma go make a sandwich.
You want anything?

376
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,405
<i>Yes, please.</i>

377
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,370
And, babe,

378
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,124
set up your phone tracker app, please.

379
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,486
Mmm-hmm.

380
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,681
Hello?

381
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,006
Hello?

382
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,124
Of all the days to drop you off late.

383
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,045
And your hair is a mess.

384
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,601
Julia should never have
sent you home like this.

385
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,525
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

386
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,969
Do you miss when Mommy and Daddy
lived together?

387
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,164
When I was really little?

388
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,049
You weren't that little.

389
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,570
I don't remember.

390
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,803
She's here! Lovey's here!

391
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,611
Let me finish your hair.
Lovey can wait a moment.

392
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,401
Oh, you didn't bake the scones?

393
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,164
They're from Colfax Cafe, Mother.

394
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,129
Your favorite.

395
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,801
You're dragging your knife.

396
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,648
<i>And the silver needs polishing.</i>

397
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,163
I understand
that your father is getting married.

398
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,606
Uh-huh.

399
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,001
Well, I'm sure Daddy's girlfriend
is a very nice person.

400
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,681
Do you like her?

401
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,600
I guess so.

402
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,125
She has long brown hair.

403
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,327
On.

404
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,211
- I made you a bracelet, Lovey! Wanna see?
- Not now.

405
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,045
Oh, she can show me if she wants.

406
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,881
You look tired.

407
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,889
I'm not.

408
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,809
I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.

409
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,644
A good dermatologist is your best friend

410
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,121
and it is time for you
to pull yourself together

411
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,560
and get a new David.

412
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,644
For your sake, and for Lily's.

413
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,086
I need some time.

414
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,881
Time doesn't exist at your age.

415
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,091
David has moved on and so should you.

416
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,242
Maybe I'll get a job.

417
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,842
I do have a degree, you know.

418
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,927
It's not easy, all this change.

419
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,844
Maybe you should have
thought of that before you...

420
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,365
Mother.

421
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,609
Not again, please.

422
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,560
I tried so hard to
cement things with David.

423
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,611
I told you, having his baby would work.

424
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,684
And Lily was living, breathing,
perfect cement.

425
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,730
Then you ruined it.

426
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,284
There's no going back.

427
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,091
I just want you to be happy.

428
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,766
I don't want you to be alone.

429
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,164
<i>Okay, Lovey.</i>

430
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,641
<i>Yay!</i>

431
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,481
<i>Okay!</i>

432
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,449
You're ready for the runway. I love it!

433
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,241
That's it. Chin up. Shoulders back.
That's my girl.

434
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,162
<i>It's nice to see David so happy.</i>

435
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,560
It's also really nice to come over here

436
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,444
and not feel like
I'm walking on eggshells.

437
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,404
- That bad, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,127
Well, things didn't actually work out
for Tess the way she wanted.

439
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,169
In more ways than one.

440
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,367
What do you mean?

441
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,364
Well, at first we thought
Tessa was amazing.

442
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,844
Star at Stanford, super charming,
so together,

443
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,446
all the big firms
were recruiting her, too.

444
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,329
<i>But then she changed,</i>

445
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,371
got possessive, turned into Gollum
and David was her precious.

446
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,601
Oh, wow.

447
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,969
<i>We were thrilled when
David finally broke up with her.</i>

448
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,363
Then, turns out she was pregnant.

449
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,010
That's perfect, right?

450
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,491
<i>So, she and her mother,</i>

451
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,484
Cruella Chanel,
moved with David to New York.

452
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,729
'Cause you know David,
he did the right thing.

453
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,561
And then she had to watch him
leave it all behind for the brewery.

454
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,721
Bingo.

455
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,409
<i>We go to the Brew Pub
in San Francisco,</i>

456
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,406
walk in, and I just, I just see her
sitting across the restaurant,

457
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,846
talking to her crazy friend...

458
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,166
And... I got it, I got it.

459
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,731
I got it.

460
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,881
Okay.

461
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,082
I know what happened.
He bailed on me.

462
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,246
I wouldn't say bail
as left you in charge.

463
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,884
Hello.

464
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,488
Who is this?

465
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,771
So I just walked over.
I don't know what came over me

466
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,161
and I just said,
"I'm not leaving here until...

467
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,850
"Until I meet you. I'm sorry."

468
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,446
And, uh... Huh. Who was it?

469
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,886
Ali. I'll call her back later.

470
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,087
Oh, see?

471
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,284
Crazy friend, Ali again.
Anyway, uh, I don't know what...

472
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,163
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Just saw a man leaving.

473
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,647
It was a delivery.

474
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,484
Tessa, why are you here?

475
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,851
At our house?

476
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,168
David's jury summons came to me.

477
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,846
He did live there for years.

478
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,328
It's not always all about you, Julia.

479
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,490
If you're going to be a parent,
especially to my daughter,

480
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,961
I'd like you to learn that lesson. Fast.

481
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,684
You're sure they're not
from David Connover?

482
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,565
And what do you mean there's no record
of who sent the arrangement?

483
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,051
How is that possible?

484
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,361
<i>The order was done anonymously.</i>

485
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,681
<i>I'm not sure where it's coming from.</i>

486
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,808
- Okay.
<i>- Sorry about that.</i>

487
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,889
- Thank you.
<i>- Have a nice day.</i>

488
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,684
<i>Jules! We're home.</i>

489
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,565
Hi, Julia.

490
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,444
No! Go to sleep!

491
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,967
Well, maybe it's because
the restraining order is up

492
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,610
<i>and I can't renew it.</i>

493
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,446
But I just feel like it's him
making these calls.

494
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,482
Take a deep breath, all right?
No one knows where you live.

495
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,486
<i>You're not on Facebook or Twitter.
You basically don't exist.</i>

496
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,365
<i>And this has happened before.</i>

497
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,806
Remember when we were up in Big Sur

498
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,803
and you thought he was following us
in that truck?

499
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,849
- Yeah, but...
<i>- Or you thought you saw him at the window,</i>

500
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,520
<i>but it was really just David.</i>

501
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,970
You're right.

502
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,369
You still haven't told David
what happened to you, huh?

503
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,211
It's gonna be
really hard to tell him, Ali.

504
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,365
Really hard.

505
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,724
I don't want him to see me like that.

506
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,843
I don't want it to change anything.

507
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,369
Hey, what about calling that doctor

508
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,891
<i>that you liked so much at The Meadows?</i>

509
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,121
No.

510
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,405
I'm okay.

511
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,649
He'll love me no matter what, right?

512
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,201
There is nothing not to love.

513
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,408
<i>I love you and I don't even like people.</i>

514
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,841
<i>Jules?</i>

515
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,850
I gotta go.

516
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,685
I love you, too.

517
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,887
Hey.

518
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,201
<i>Hey.</i>

519
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,362
Sorry, I just couldn't sleep.

520
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,522
Well, is everything okay?

521
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,201
Yeah.

522
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,407
<i>Come on.</i>

523
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,161
Hmm.

524
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,771
Well, just go with a little black dress.
You've got one. It's perfect.

525
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,161
- Okay.
- And I love these earrings. Use these.

526
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,441
<i>- These are nice.
- Thank you.</i>

527
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,364
<i>Look, I think you got
the whole look. You'll be fine.</i>

528
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,005
- I think so.
- I wouldn't, uh...

529
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,601
Hi, Julia.

530
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,361
Hi, Tessa.

531
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,965
<i>I'll see you.</i>

532
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,329
Just finished a board meeting
at Lily's school.

533
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,324
I'm never quite sure what to do
with the alone time.

534
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,529
Yeah. These days, me, too.

535
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,329
- Listen, Julia. I...
- No, about yesterday...

536
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,130
No, no. I came by unannounced. It was...

537
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,123
No, I shouldn't have talked
to you like that.

538
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,964
I know I can come on a bit strong.

539
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,485
No.

540
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,970
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

541
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,327
Forgiven. It happens.

542
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,525
Thanks, Tessa.

543
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,241
Can I buy you lunch?

544
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,241
Yeah.

545
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,926
Good.

546
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,481
Good.

547
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,404
Yeah, this town really
is its own little world, isn't it?

548
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,368
Yeah. I forgot how hard it is
to move to a new place.

549
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,726
Tell me about it.

550
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,928
It was hard for me to move here, too.

551
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,004
And now it seems like
you've been here forever.

552
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,207
It took a while.

553
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,601
Then everything fell apart.

554
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,205
Or I tore it apart.

555
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,606
Either way.

556
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,444
I assume David told you.

557
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,284
It was my affair that ended everything.

558
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,323
Oh. Um...

559
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,161
Yes.

560
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,771
Affair is too strong a word for it.

561
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,764
It was really only twice.
I was just so frustrated and isolated.

562
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,883
David was consumed with work.

563
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,805
Always home late.
He barely even knew I existed.

564
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,610
I mean, everything you just said.

565
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,367
You don't know anybody, you're lonely.

566
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,771
Your whole life is in flux, but he's
having a completely different experience.

567
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,565
You have far more going on.

568
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,291
I only had David and Lily.

569
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,809
She's so sweet, by the way.

570
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,484
She is. Thank you.

571
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,244
- Thank you, Val.
- Thank you.

572
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,650
Mmm.

573
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,006
Julia,

574
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,568
can I confess something?

575
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,610
Sure. Yes.

576
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,088
I was...
I was really very scared to meet you.

577
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,164
- Me?
- Yes! It's intimidating.

578
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,164
This glamorous life in the city.
You're an editor

579
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,164
and gorgeous and talented
and effortlessly beautiful.

580
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,971
Thank you.
That's very lovely of you to say,

581
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,363
and I was terrified to meet you.

582
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,531
I mean, obviously because
of Lily and everything,

583
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,648
but then on top of that, you're perfect.

584
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,365
All the time.

585
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,330
Thank you. You're gonna do great here.

586
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,125
And your connection with David, it's...

587
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,163
You talk, you laugh.

588
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,604
What? You didn't?

589
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,166
Not really.

590
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,685
Come on.

591
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,884
We always loved each other. Of course.

592
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,884
But ours was a more physical thing.

593
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,962
We always had incredible chemistry.

594
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,363
David was insatiable.
It eclipsed everything.

595
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,289
Frankly, it was a little exhausting.

596
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,684
A different position every night.

597
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,205
Public places.

598
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,043
It's like we just could not
get away from each other.

599
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,567
But I'm sure I don't have
to tell you how he is.

600
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,881
Yeah. He's amazing.

601
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,885
You know there was a time when I thought

602
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,367
we were on the road
to getting back together.

603
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,561
We even went to therapy.

604
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,207
But then he met you.

605
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,408
We'll always be close.

606
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,684
You can't get any closer
than having a child together.

607
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,207
The infinite bond
of our gorgeous little girl.

608
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,446
Oh, I keep forgetting.
Let me see the ring.

609
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,249
Oh. Um...

610
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,001
It's getting cleaned.

611
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,245
Yeah, it was David's grandmother's ring.

612
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,920
Oh.

613
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,764
Well, next time.
I really actually have to get going.

614
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,450
I'm buying Lily a new horse.

615
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,127
Upgrading from the pony she usually rides.
She's really excited.

616
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,521
I bet.

617
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,763
I'm really glad that we did this.
It was nice.

618
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,810
I'll see you soon.

619
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,331
We're certified organic.

620
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,766
I'm hungry.

621
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,844
Me, too. We're gonna wait
till we get to Daddy's booth

622
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,162
and then we're gonna have lunch
with him, okay?

623
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,685
This is probably him.

624
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,010
Who is this?

625
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,928
Who is this?

626
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,051
Come on.

627
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,691
Lily?

628
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,090
But I couldn't stop.

629
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,364
Lily?

630
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,161
Lily!

631
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,041
Hey!

632
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,365
What happened? Where's Lily?

633
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,249
I don't know. She just ran off.

634
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,925
Okay, how long ago did you lose her?

635
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,567
Just now. A few minutes ago, maybe.
I don't know.

636
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,926
David, shit, I'm sorry.

637
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,162
I'm gonna get security.
You just keep looking, okay?

638
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,321
<i>Okay.</i>

639
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,561
Guys, hold down the fort.
I'll be right back.

640
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,761
You got it.

641
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,206
Lily!

642
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,766
Lily?

643
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,801
Okay.

644
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,160
Okay.

645
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,441
Lily!

646
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,281
Lily!

647
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,771
Lily!

648
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,930
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

649
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,601
I'm sorry.

650
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,811
<i>Just wandering around by herself,
and I saw her talking to some guy</i>

651
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,811
that she said knows Julia.

652
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,769
<i>David, listen, this is
completely unacceptable.</i>

653
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,287
<i>This is total negligence on her part.
I can't have it.</i>

654
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,441
Yeah, I got it.

655
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,682
I understand how it looks.
It was an accident.

656
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,842
It could have happened to any of us.
You know how she...

657
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,767
Tessa said that she found Lily

658
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,327
<i>talking to some guy
she'd never met before.</i>

659
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,361
<i>What guv'?</i>

660
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,842
I don't know. All right, she seemed
to think that you knew him.

661
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,321
She did? What did she say?

662
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,446
I just wanna know if it's true.

663
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,369
If what is true?
I don't know who she's talking about!

664
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,727
Where's your ring, Julia?

665
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,328
<i>How come you haven't been wearing it?</i>

666
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,246
Nowhere.

667
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,765
I took it off to take a bath the other day

668
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,161
and I thought I knew
where I placed it. But...

669
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,368
<i>It's gotta be in the house, though.</i>

670
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,090
So, I've been looking for it.

671
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,528
Why would you tell Tessa
that it's being cleaned then?

672
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,251
I don't know! I...

673
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,370
Why did she bring it up?

674
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,206
Who sent you flowers?

675
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,250
I don't know.

676
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,807
I called to find out and ask and...

677
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,883
It must have been a mistake.

678
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,206
Look“.

679
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,529
I get that
you're going through a rough time,

680
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,847
that, uh, it's an adjustment period
or whatever.

681
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,570
Maybe you even feel lost.

682
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,721
Okay, I...

683
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,486
I don't feel... Who said I feel lost?

684
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,650
Did Tessa say that I feel lost?

685
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,928
Because I don't feel lost.

686
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,003
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the ring.

687
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,731
I'm sorry about today.

688
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,331
Tessa said she's not comfortable
having Lily in the house.

689
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,726
What?

690
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,005
She doesn't want you alone with Lily.

691
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,926
David, that's ridiculous.

692
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,287
Yeah, I know. I know, it's...

693
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,447
I gotta let this blow over for a few days.

694
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,365
I can't have her spiral
and open up the custody stuff.

695
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,568
She's fucking with me.

696
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,245
Julia, listen to me.

697
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,441
Oh, my God.

698
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,409
Tessa may be wound a little tight.

699
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,404
Nobody knows that better than me.
Trust me, but...

700
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,965
She is the mother of my daughter.

701
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,761
She loves Lily more than anything

702
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,890
and she found her wandering
in a parking lot.

703
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,611
Okay? That is where this is coming from.

704
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,484
I know.

705
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,564
I'll try harder.

706
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,165
I'll just try harder.

707
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,129
Yeah, I know you will.

708
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,606
I know.

709
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,761
Listen, I got some work to do.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

710
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,962
I'll be back up in a bit.

711
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,966
Lily,

712
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,606
<i>you see, the horse knows</i>

713
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,330
that you are not in control.

714
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,927
If you act afraid, she has every right
to think that she's in charge.

715
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,805
So, sit back. Find your seat.

716
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,328
Take a deep breath.

717
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,171
I drove a long way out here, my darling.

718
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,481
Hi, Lily.

719
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,521
Hi!

720
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,007
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

721
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,321
Where's David?

722
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,124
David got stuck at work.
He'll be waiting for us at home.

723
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,365
I hope so.

724
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,281
So, how's it going?

725
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,170
<i>She's a beauty.</i>

726
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,530
I'm scared.

727
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,281
Luv,

728
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,689
you're just getting used
to riding a new horse. You're fine.

729
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,960
I don't wanna ride her.

730
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,727
You're not getting off this horse.

731
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,165
She doesn't seem to feel safe.

732
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,846
I'm sorry, who asked you?

733
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,171
She's safer here
than she is alone with you.

734
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,006
You're ready?

735
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,970
Lily, relax.

736
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,006
<i>Okay?</i>

737
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,041
Come on, Lily. It's Daddy's day.

738
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,247
We're leaving.

739
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,844
It's okay.

740
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,801
Lily.

741
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,327
Don't you get off this horse.
What are you...

742
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,490
David's gonna hear about this.

743
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,801
I'm sure.

744
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,524
That was beneath you.

745
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,605
I'm gonna be in trouble.

746
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,400
Me, too.

747
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,121
Lily,

748
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,247
I know what it's like to love someone
who isn't always nice to you.

749
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,651
<i>My Dad had a way of making me feel
like everything was my fault.</i>

750
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,162
But I want you to know that you are
a very, very special little girl.

751
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,641
And you didn't do anything wrong.

752
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,361
Okay?

753
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,690
Who was the man you were talking to
at the market the other day?

754
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,521
What man?

755
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,086
Never mind.

756
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,284
- Yeah, well, technically it was our day.
- Yes.

757
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,966
Technically, it is my day. But...

758
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,607
I can't find that damn watch you got me.

759
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,489
Maybe I just stay here tonight.

760
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,846
<i>You know?</i>

761
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,690
<i>You could just cancel the babysitter...</i>

762
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,126
<i>I can stay with Lily.</i>

763
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,361
No.

764
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,886
You should be at this dinner with me.

765
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,930
All my principal investors
are gonna be there.

766
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,281
Okay?

767
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,801
Okay.

768
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,802
<i>But if it wasn't for you guys
here at this table,</i>

769
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,531
<i>Copper Mountain Brewery wouldn't be here.</i>

770
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,205
<i>So, from Miguel and I,</i>

771
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,364
thank you very much and cheers.

772
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,320
- Cheers!
- To Copper Mountain. Yes. Cheers.

773
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,606
Congratulations.

774
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,801
Exactly right.

775
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,200
Oh, no, you should!

776
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,727
We had a three to four plan
that we were...

777
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,446
Really proud of David.

778
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,206
He and Miguel had a really
impressive return on investment,

779
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,362
considering the size of their operation.

780
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,889
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- That's unbelievable.

781
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,765
That's right!

782
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,970
When I first came back
from New York,

783
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,282
it was kind of a culture shock.

784
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,524
What we had was more physical.

785
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,920
He's insatiable.

786
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,604
<i>Public places.</i>

787
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,483
<i>We couldn't get away from each other.</i>

788
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,841
<i>I'm so happy that all of you
could come tonight.</i>

789
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,610
<i>I just really appreciate it.</i>

790
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,125
<i>Well, we won't tell anybody
you said that.</i>

791
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,520
<i>Excuse me for a moment.</i>

792
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,364
- Of course.
- Thanks.

793
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,370
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

794
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,805
You wanna try some of this one?

795
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,204
Maybe I should go out first.

796
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,283
Yeah. Okay.

797
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,161
You wanna help me?

798
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,646
Guess I'll see you outside.

799
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,410
Yeah. Okay.

800
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,089
And do you think it was a good idea
not to listen to Mommy?

801
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,641
- No.
- Are you sorry?

802
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,087
Yes.

803
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,926
You only get one mother, Lily.

804
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,401
I only want

805
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,450
what is best for us.
Don't ever forget that.

806
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,322
Now if Julia insists on sending you home
with such tangled hair...

807
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,285
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

808
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,920
we're going to have to
fix the problem once and for all.

809
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,961
You need me.

810
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,567
I just spoke with David.
He's moments away.

811
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,561
Hi, Lily.

812
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,281
Lily-

813
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,803
Lily Connover, you get back here
and say a proper goodbye to me.

814
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,001
What happened?

815
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,004
- There are lessons to be learned.
- That's some sort of punishment?

816
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,083
No. It's a reality.
I couldn't keep up with your knots.

817
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,410
She thinks that's because of me?

818
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,245
Why are you doing this?

819
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,767
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

820
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,685
Okay, this is really difficult
for everyone.

821
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,763
But it doesn't have to
actually be this hard.

822
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,163
I'm not doing anything, Julia.

823
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,443
I am simply living my life with my family.

824
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,329
If you're having a hard time,

825
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,970
I suggest you look in the mirror.

826
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,284
No. I know exactly what it is
that you are trying to do.

827
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,444
And I am not gonna let you put Lily
in the middle of this anymore.

828
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,440
Are you threatening me?

829
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,883
Yes. I'm fucking threatening you.

830
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,520
And if you keep this up,
you will regret it.

831
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,803
<i>Lily Bean, I'm home!
Where are ya?</i>

832
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,007
You're hurting me.

833
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,491
- And you're scaring me.
- Fine.

834
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,489
Why are you hurting me? Stop it, Julia!

835
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,123
Stay away from me!

836
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,566
Tessa!

837
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,527
Oh, my God.

838
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,484
Are you okay?

839
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,688
- Stay away from me.
- Tessa!

840
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,804
Tessa, what happened?

841
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,485
I don't know.

842
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,010
She just got so angry.

843
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,241
What?

844
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,201
Julia...

845
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,328
- I didn't!
<i>- I don't know. Maybe it's my fault.</i>

846
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,051
I'm just trying to protect our child.

847
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,842
David, please, just take us home.

848
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,240
Mommy!

849
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,046
It's okay, sweetheart. I'm okay.

850
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,645
<i>No, you need to go to the doctor.
Come on.</i>

851
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,329
Hey. Hey, Mommy's gonna be okay.

852
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,084
<i>Okay. You ready?</i>

853
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,844
Okay, nice and slow. Ready?

854
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,685
Okay, take it easy.
There you go, there you go.

855
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,401
All right, let's go. All right.

856
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,207
Okay, take it easy. Just nice and slow.

857
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,526
Come on, Lily.

858
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,401
Okay.

859
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,206
Okay.

860
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,770
All right, easy.

861
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,408
<i>When I saw what she did to Lily,</i>

862
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,244
yeah, I did, I got angry.

863
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,085
I got in her face, I grabbed her arm,

864
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,765
but I did not push her.

865
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,129
And I think she might have
slipped on purpose.

866
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,770
Yeah, maybe the truth lies
somewhere in between.

867
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,370
Why would you believe the person
who gave up on you instead of me?

868
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,121
What does that mean?

869
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,765
Tessa told me that she had an affair.

870
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,809
And you never told me that.

871
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,051
Listen...

872
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,560
Because it's not why I left her.

873
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,127
I wanted to leave Tessa years before that.

874
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,601
I stayed because of Lily.

875
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,446
The affair...

876
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,803
The affair just confirmed things.

877
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,601
She said that you guys were trying to
get back together when you met me.

878
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,802
<i>And that you were taking couples therapy.</i>

879
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,246
Never

880
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,968
Never. Never were we trying to reconcile.

881
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,761
I've no idea why she would say
something like that.

882
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,807
Because she's fucking crazy, David.
Why can't you see that?

883
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,969
I left her.

884
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,171
I left her, okay?

885
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,809
And I am sitting here, across from you,

886
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,650
and I wanna marry you

887
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,202
and I really don't wanna spend
the rest of my life

888
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,681
playing "she said, she said."

889
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,164
Julia, I am tired of all of this.

890
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,446
I'm done with crazy.

891
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,124
It's not good for us

892
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,169
and it is not good for Lily.

893
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,521
Then I need you to tell her that.

894
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,009
Please talk to her.

895
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:11,690
When I get back, I'll talk to her
about what she did to Lily.

896
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,043
And we'll talk more about this, too,
in a couple days.

897
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,926
Thank you.

898
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,484
Oh, my God, Jules, it's so late.
Are you okay?

899
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,886
<i>Ali, I need your help.</i>

900
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,561
<i>I need you to come here right away.</i>

901
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,726
<i>Done. Um...</i>

902
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,844
<i>I'll be on the first flight out
in the morning.</i>

903
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,161
<i>All right.</i>

904
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,441
Okay, I broke this up into
school records and health records.

905
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,366
Okay.

906
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,851
Thank you, Jamal.

907
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,570
I can't believe he found all this for me.

908
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,451
Yeah. It turns out keeping
a convicted criminal hacker on payroll

909
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,204
actually comes in pretty handy.

910
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,771
There's more printing.

911
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,763
All I could find was like,

912
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,362
sorority princess,
perfect, perfect, perfect...

913
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,525
"Tessa Manning, request to seal
juvenile court record of a minor"?

914
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,564
Okay, well there's gotta be
criminal records then.

915
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,284
- "Child Services psychiatric report."
- Whoa.

916
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,769
"Tessa Manning, age 16,

917
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,082
"when her father left her mother
and moved in with his secretary,

918
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,605
<i>"Tessa became destabilized,</i>

919
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,243
"exhibiting obsessive, negative
and occasional violent behaviors."

920
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,083
She set fire to their house.

921
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,931
To whose house?

922
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,602
Uh, the father's house,
while they were still inside.

923
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,762
Holy shit. Did they die?

924
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,406
- No, no, no. It says no one was hurt.
- Oh.

925
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,130
"Father did not press charges.

926
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,806
"Mother, Helen Manning,

01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,406
"psychiatric care and family therapy."

928
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,126
Okay. Um...

929
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,288
I feel like I've been pretty cool
about this whole thing.

930
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,126
Like, you wanted to move down here,
I said, "Go for it. YOLO."

931
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,649
He's got a weird ex? Who doesn't, right?
I'm someone's weird ex.

932
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,288
But psycho Barbie setting fire to houses
with people inside, that's...

933
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,128
This is where I draw the line.
We should go home.

934
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,482
You can come home with me tonight,
I can't let you stay here.

935
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,005
No, AI.

936
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,522
I finally have proof,
and I need to show this to David.

937
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,966
Okay, she is dangerous

938
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,124
and she needs to stay away
from all of us from now on.

939
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,648
She can't pretend like
I'm the one that's crazy anymore.

940
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,284
Enough is enough.

941
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,526
Okay.

942
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,406
David?

943
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,841
Are you home early?

944
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,330
Hey, baby.

945
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,886
You look great.

946
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,045
My husband's coming.

947
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,406
Where are you going?

948
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,566
He's coming home any minute now.

949
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,371
Okay. We'll hurry then. It's okay.

950
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,890
Let go of me, Michael.

951
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,246
Okay.

952
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,365
Yeah, if you...

953
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,883
If you go now,
I won't call the police, okay?

954
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,451
- Help!
- Hey!

955
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,406
The police?

956
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,409
What kind of sick fucking game is this?

957
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,965
You asked me to come.

958
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,483
Oh, my God, she sent you here!

959
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,247
No more games.

960
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,331
Calm down. I'll let you go now.

961
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,562
- I'm calm!
- All right? All right.

962
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,129
I'm sorry.

963
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,448
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

964
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,449
All right? What the fuck?

965
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,250
It's all right.

966
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,801
Okay.

967
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,450
Fuck!

968
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,041
Help, you gotta help me.

969
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,561
You gotta help me.

970
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,520
You've handled this very poorly.

971
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,006
Who the fuck are you?

972
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,051
No, no, no! Argh!

973
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,889
It was you.

974
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,042
You did this. You...

975
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,161
<i>I haven't done any of this.</i>

976
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,801
Tessa Connover, um,

977
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,767
she was the one behind all of this.

978
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,244
Your fiancé's ex-wife sets up
a fake Facebook account,

979
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,131
lures your abusive ex here

980
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,408
<i>and then kills him for no reason?</i>

981
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,767
You see what this looks like, right?

982
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,165
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just...

983
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,810
It's okay.

984
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,249
I was ashamed.

985
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,607
You know, I just...

986
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,490
I never wanted you to see me like this.

987
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,649
- Hey. Hey.
- Or think of me like this.

988
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,371
You know, like you're always saying
how strong I am.

989
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,521
You are.

990
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,921
I wanted you to always
think of me like that.

991
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,327
I'm not that person anymore.

992
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,042
I'm not that person anymore.

993
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,647
I just never wanted you to see me
like this or think of me like this.

994
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,326
- I don't want you to pity me, you know.
- Shh.

995
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,691
I thought maybe you wouldn't
want me anymore.

996
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,291
Come here.

997
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,166
Listen to me.

998
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,361
Nothing matters but you and I.

999
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,043
We're gonna be okay.

1000
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,681
Promise?

1001
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,645
I wanna put this behind us. I promise.

1002
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,685
You trust me?

1003
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,361
Okay.

1004
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,526
I love you so much.

1005
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,809
Mr. Connover?

1006
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,571
- Detective Pope still needs to see you.
- But...

1007
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,328
Seems the, uh, meeting
which she initiated went away.

1008
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,642
Look at the last page.

1009
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,925
You recognize this?

1010
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,050
Yeah. It's my watch.

1011
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,367
I just don't understand
how any of this can be happening.

1012
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,931
That doesn't make sense.

1013
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,003
We'll check out the story
and get to the truth.

1014
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,129
I still have a few questions to ask her.

1015
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,729
Go see your kid.
You have a lot to deal with.

1016
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,604
I couldn't have killed him.

1017
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,290
Did I hit something in his leg?

1018
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,251
Miss Banks, the guy was stabbed
in his heart.

1019
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,761
He didn't stand a chance.

1020
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:15,967
The DA called.

1021
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,920
Since the evidence is circumstantial,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

1022
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,764
But the investigation is ongoing.

1023
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,968
You're required to stay
within a 10-mile radius

1024
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,929
and your phone stays here as evidence.

1025
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,120
Where is my fiancé?

1026
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,130
He's waiting for me.

1027
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,481
I'm sorry,

1028
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,643
I had to show him the file.

1029
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,331
He went home to be with his daughter.

1030
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,848
David. You're home.

1031
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,650
- I need to see Lily.
- Of course.

1032
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,609
You're her father.

1033
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,731
<i>Hey, it's David.
Leave a message.</i>

1034
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,601
David.

1035
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,930
Oh, my God.

1036
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,562
It should've been mine.

1037
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,051
She didn't even know your grandmother.

1038
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,524
- Julia was right.
- No.

1039
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,366
No, no, no. This is not my fault.

1040
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,562
This is her fault.

1041
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,442
You should never have brought her here.

1042
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,045
I made one mistake.

1043
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,289
And you took everything away from me.

1044
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,601
Stop.

1045
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,885
And gave it all to her!

1046
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,321
Right in front of me!

1047
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,243
This is my life, David. It's mine!

1048
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,481
Tessa!

1049
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,526
I'm gonna get you help.

1050
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,367
And I'm taking Lily home.

1051
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,283
This is your home.

1052
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,485
David?

1053
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,046
I'll take care of you.

1054
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,205
It's okay.

1055
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,047
David. David.

1056
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,886
David?

1057
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,566
Lily...

1058
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,561
Okay.

1059
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,290
I'll be right back, I promise.

1060
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,481
Lily-

1061
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,210
I'm gonna carry you to my car.

1062
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,809
And I want you to stay there,

1063
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,328
go back to sleep with your Blankie
and Mr. Weasel. Can you do that?

1064
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,969
- Okay.
- Okay.

1065
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,248
- Then can we go to our house?
- Yes.

1066
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,921
Then we can go back to our house.

1067
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,286
All right.

1068
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,205
<i>911 emergency.</i>

1069
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,244
We have to get David help.

1070
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,242
He's hurt, Tessa.

1071
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,485
This is my house!

1072
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,089
You're right. It's your house.

1073
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,411
You're a joke.

1074
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,960
You can't do anything right,
can you, Julia?

1075
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,604
Even Michael.

1076
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,082
After everything he did to you,
you just let him get away.

1077
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,730
Again.

1078
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,245
You're pathetic.

1079
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,243
How do you expect to be a mother

1080
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,807
when you can't even
take care of yourself?

1081
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,689
You're worthless, Julia.

1082
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,848
You will always be worthless.

1083
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,007
No.

1084
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,720
Not this time.

1085
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,521
You will never have what's mine!

1086
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,008
You will never have David!

1087
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,208
It's not about him!

1088
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,486
It's never been about him
and you know it!

1089
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,767
He left you two years ago!

1090
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,766
I want my life.

1091
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,600
Not yours.

1092
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,806
David.

1093
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,007
Help me, David.

1094
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,441
Stop.

1095
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,805
Stop. Stop.

1096
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,765
Tessa.

1097
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,322
Look at yourself. See.

1098
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,290
You're doing this, but you can stop.

1099
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,202
Please stop.

1100
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,526
Why do you always ruin everything?

1101
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,368
Stay back. Stay back.

1102
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,726
Julia, please.

1103
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:37,881
Don't...

1104
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,769
Don't let Lily
remember me like this.

1105
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,286
David.

1106
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,801
David.

1107
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,090
Oh, my God.

1108
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:13,081
Hey.

1109
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,243
- Hey.
- Julia.

1110
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,683
I'm so sorry.

1111
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,722
I'm sorry.

1112
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,603
Please forgive me.

1113
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,127
We're okay. We're gonna be okay.

1114
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,407
I'm gonna make this up to you.

1115
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,203
I promise.

1116
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,364
I love you, Julia.

1117
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,322
I love you, too.

1118
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,044
Leave that clear for the ME.

1119
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,362
And we'll do everything
we can for you.

1120
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,925
I'm very sorry.

1121
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,771
I'll, uh, see you at the hospital.

1122
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,725
Miss Banks?

1123
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,449
Julia!

1124
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,367
Hey.
Hey.

1125
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,568
- How's it going?
- Are you guys gonna head straight...

1126
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,127
Ali.

1127
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,806
Hi, um, Lily. Hi, good morning.

1128
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,121
Om

1129
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,001
Can you, uh, touch my nose?

1130
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,766
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Connover.

1131
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:01,811
Hello!

1132
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,650
Hi, Humphrey, hi, hello.

1133
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,770
I'm gonna pet you later
'cause I need coffee desperately.

1134
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,207
I am very hungover from the wedding.

1135
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,249
Hi.

1136
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,526
I think your front doorbell's broken.

1137
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,603
Yeah, well, that and about
10,000 other things.

1138
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,603
The longest to-do list in history.

1139
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,128
I love this house.
And my room and San Francisco.

1140
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,762
- They have the best donuts ever.
- Yeah.

1141
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1142
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:27,764
No. Thank you for your gift, by the way.

1143
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,206
You're welcome.

1144
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,846
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

1145
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,651
It's probably another
scary urban squirrel.

1146
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,331
Humphrey, there's nobody here. Look.

1147
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,128
<i>Hello, Julia.</i>

1148
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,803
I'm here to see my granddaughter.

1149
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,326
She's here! Lovey's here!

1150
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,561
Oh.

1151
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,403
My darling girl.

1152
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,445
You're here.

1153
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,925
Yes.

1154
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,882
I'm here.

1155
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,001
English - SDH
