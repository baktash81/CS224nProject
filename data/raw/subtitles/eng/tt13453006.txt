Hey, Lexi. It's me, Mikey.

25
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:33,818
Mikey.

26
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:36,575
No, no. Don't hang up.

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,316
I got a big fucking surprise for you.

28
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,911
Who is it?

29
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:47,765
-House cleaning?
-Hey, surprise!

30
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,234
-Hey.
-Hey, Lil.

31
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,519
Oh my shit.

32
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,434
Nice to see you too.

33
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,062
How have you been?

34
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:57,240
I am okay.

35
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,787
It's me. Mikey.

36
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:00,740
Remember me?

37
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:02,708
I know. What are you doing here for?

38
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:06,147
I just came to see Lexi
and I came to see you, of course.

39
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,205
Both of you guys,
but is Lexi here right now?

40
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:09,705
Lexi!

41
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:10,684
Thank you.

42
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,592
You won't believe who's here.

43
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,404
Oh my gosh.

44
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:17,781
Oh my, shit.

45
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,460
Surprise.

46
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,650
Oh my God.
What the-- What are you doing here?

47
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,630
Oh, it's good to see you too.

48
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:24,826
Why are you here?

49
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:28,131
-Where do I begin? Let me--
-No, you are not coming in this house.

50
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,264
-All beat up.
-That's right.

51
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:31,640
-What the fuck--
-All right.

52
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,080
All right. Well--

53
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,145
-I'll tell you what's--
-Why are you here?

54
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,327
-Yeah.
-Oh, well--

55
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:38,458
Why are you here?

56
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,738
Ma, can you give me a--

57
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:42,223
Lil, I just wanted to come in
and hang for a couple of days.

58
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,512
No, you are not coming in here.

59
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:47,308
Mom, can you--
can you just go inside?

60
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,402
What the fuck, Mikey?

61
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,269
I know, I know this is unexpected.

62
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,167
Oh, nothing with you is unexpected.

63
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:57,225
I still got that sass.

64
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,526
Look, I don't know what you want

65
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,290
but I can't help you.

66
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,320
So it doesn't matter
how or why you're here.

67
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,712
Go away!

68
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:09,610
Hey, Lil.

69
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:11,369
Ma.

70
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:12,460
Goddammit!

71
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,875
I don't wanna be here.
All right? This is embarrassing.

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,564
-I don't want you here either.
-You think I wanna show up like this?

73
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,742
I got my ass fucking kicked.
I just need a place to crash.

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,059
-Why can't you hear, just let me--
-What does it look like? A hotel?

75
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:22,050
Really? It's like that?

76
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,075
Can you get off the property please?

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,845
-What are you gonna fucking do? Really?
-You want me to call the cops?

78
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,195
-I'll call the cops.
-No. Don't--

79
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,311
I'm calling the cops.
Ten, nine, eight, seven. Faster.

80
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,645
I'm technically off the property.

81
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,790
So you can't call the cops
cause I'm on public land.

82
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,434
-Respecting your boundaries.
-Can you keep it down?

83
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,370
Can you come over here, so I don't
have to project my voice, please?

84
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:45,839
Fuck.

85
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,765
Seriously. I just need a place to crash
for a couple of days. What's the big deal?

86
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,955
Mikey, go fuck yourself.

87
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,175
Oh. You don't even know
what I've been through.

88
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,765
Look at my fucking face.

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,500
I just was on the bus for two days.

90
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:00,205
I had to walk here
from the bus station--

91
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,728
Why don't you stay with your mama?

92
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,763
My mom's in a nursing home in Lubbock.

93
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,635
A care home. I can't sleep there.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,135
Mikey.
What do you want?

95
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,630
-My God.
-What do you want?

96
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:10,914
I just fucking told you.

97
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,345
I just need to crash for a couple of days.

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,815
-What? You want money, right? Here.
-No, I don't-- fucking money.

99
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,208
I got 22 fucking dollars.

100
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:21,090
Here. Come and get it. I can't come
on your property. Come get your money.

101
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,115
You should have called.

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,901
If I would have called
you would have said no.

103
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:28,145
I'm still saying no.
So you fucked yourself back in it.

104
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,583
-Oh, please, come on, you know me.
-Damn straight, I do.

105
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:33,888
You know me and you know I wouldn't be
literally begging

106
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,092
if I had somewhere to go.

107
00:05:35,177 --> 00:05:36,357
And if you don't let me in,

108
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm gonna sleep in Tarpey fucking
park tonight. Is that what you want?

109
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,035
You said you're never gonna
step a foot in Texas again.

110
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,702
And then the world fucked me.
What can I say?

111
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,384
-Peek-a-boo.
-Ma.

112
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,370
See your mom's saying, let him in,
let him in and take a shower.

113
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,902
And the dog's like, oh, he's a good man.
I can tell by his nice energy.

114
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,017
Please let me take a fucking shower.

115
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,100
This shit got out of fucking control.

116
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,435
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.

117
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,384
The place turned into a fucking
trap house right under my nose.

118
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,943
Fucking Spiegler sends me
some scraggly bitch from Ohio

119
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,673
that he promised would be chill.

120
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:33,194
Her first night in the house, she gets
in a fight, knocks this fucking bitch out.

121
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:34,500
Crack, right in front of me.

122
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:35,795
It was like, holy shit.

123
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,335
So anyway, she bounced, now I got to fill
the room so I don't lose the month.

124
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,278
And her friend comes and stays there and
just gets high the whole fucking time.

125
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:43,964
Why didn't you just kick the bitch out?

126
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,075
I had seven hoes in there letting
MS-13 deal drugs the whole time.

127
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,409
Lil, MS-13 is a gang
you don't want to fuck with.

128
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:51,210
You're good. Okay.
Do you need any coffee?

129
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,214
All right, sorry.

130
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,027
So anyway, long story short,

131
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,526
I ended up hiding out in my room

132
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,570
because these dudes
were straight fucking killers

133
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:00,878
and I didn't wanna fucking get killed,
so I played video games the whole time.

134
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,215
-Remember the house in Chatsworth?
-Uh-huh.

135
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,659
Well, th-- this place was like maybe
five times bigger, beautiful house.

136
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,947
I had a two year lease with an option
to buy it at the end of the lease. Right?

137
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:13,950
Well, as usual shit got fucking crazy.
I snapped.

138
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:16,775
I got up in one of those cholos spaces.
Cause I'm not a little bitch.

139
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,315
I came this fucking close
to getting shot, this fucking close.

140
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,720
So then I had to crash with Kennedy.

141
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,315
Do you remember Kennedy?

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,245
Remember?

143
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,320
Do you remember Kennedy?

144
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,048
Anyway, I had to crash at
Kennedy's for like three weeks

145
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,548
until he kicked my ass out cause
someone left his back door open

146
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,505
and his cute little cat got out
and got killed

147
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:33,432
and it wasn't me.

148
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,130
It was some dumb cunt that
he fucked the night before.

149
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,140
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
swear, but I don't do that.

150
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,330
Like everyone blame me like,
oh Mikey, he's the bad guy.

151
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,385
It's like, whatever. It's bullshit.

152
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,575
So anyway, I had to crash at his place.

153
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,862
He kicks me out.

154
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,205
For like three nights
I slept on a fucking street.

155
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,225
I slept in an alleyway.

156
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,860
I used my shoes as a goddamn pillow.
It's fucking bullshit.

157
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:52,356
My neck was so sore.
I got beat up.

158
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,904
That's how this, all this happened,

159
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,925
two homeless fuckers
beat the shit out of me.

160
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,222
They took everything except
my phone and my wallet.

161
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,727
And the only reason they didn't get that
as the cops showed up and arrested my ass.

162
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,610
Why'd you get arrested?

163
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:05,972
I have a feeling there's a
whole lot more to this story.

164
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:07,085
Yeah. I'm sure there is.

165
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,205
W-- what? It doesn't even matter.
Look, guys, this could be fun.

166
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,587
This could be cool.
I got a plan.

167
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,639
While I was on the bus
I thought about this.

168
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,865
I gave it some serious thought. Lil,
you know, I'm not a free loader, right?

169
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,379
-While I'm here--
-How long?

170
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:21,239
-How long, what?
-How long do you plan on staying?

171
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:23,825
Well, I mean, that's up to you
and Lexi, of course, but look,

172
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,692
I saw some hiring signs on the way in.
I'll go downtown tomorrow

173
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:27,545
and I'll get a job that pays cash.

174
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,263
I'll teach fucking karate if I have to.

175
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,550
I just got my green belt, okay? And I'll
make cash, and I'll help out around here.

176
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,055
You need a man around the house.

177
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,861
Can't you already see
shit's falling apart?

178
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,685
I can help out with all that shit, right?

179
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,804
I want at least 200 a week.

180
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,158
Thank you Lil.
You're not going to regret this.

181
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,745
Seriously. Thank you
so much for trusting me.

182
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:46,728
I'm gonna--

183
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,962
Let's give it a couple of days
and see how it goes.

184
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:52,132
Yeah. Whatever you're comfortable with.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

185
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:55,739
I'm here to help and look, before long,
it'll be like, we're still married.

186
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,140
We are still married.

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,144
Oh my God.
The backyard is a mess, see?

188
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,461
You need a guy around you.
Dude, there's a dragon fly.

189
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,205
<i>Find out when, when she
called you now you traveled.</i>

190
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,376
<i>-Yeah. I was in Florida.
-How many days later?</i>

191
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:16,901
<i>This was about three days.</i>

192
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:19,104
<i>So she called you and
said they were in a high speed--</i>

193
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:22,050
<i>She say I was in a high
speed chase with Dante.</i>

194
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,494
-Morning.
<i>-Who was chasing?</i>

195
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,325
<i>-She was chasing him.</i>
-Morning.

196
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,154
<i>He was in the car.</i>

197
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,140
<i>She pulled up.</i>

198
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,381
<i>-Somebody told her where they were.</i>
-I love this show.

199
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,904
I watch it every day so get used to it.

200
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:39,904
<i>And from what I was told, they were
doing like a 80 down the main street.</i>

201
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,374
<i>She's trying to catch him.</i>

202
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,059
<i>And he hit a pole, a fence pole.</i>

203
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,845
<i>What do you say happened?</i>

204
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,205
<i>I was coming back from the airport,
dropping her off as she stated.</i>

205
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,401
<i>And when I was at the stop sign</i>

206
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:55,314
<i>I had the right way to go, now, this car
just came straight through the stop sign.</i>

207
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,466
<i>They ran a stop sign</i>

208
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,526
<i>and T-boned the car almost like</i>

209
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,034
<i>-they hit the front of the car.
-Was this your baby mother in another car?</i>

210
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,551
<i>-No.
-When she calls you and she tells you,</i>

211
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,090
<i>because I believe that conversation
happened. Do you call him?</i>

212
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,305
<i>-Yes.
-And what does he say?</i>

213
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,310
<i>He like, man, you know that crazy girl.</i>

214
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,830
<i>It's not my fault. She crazy.</i>

215
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:16,620
<i>I was trying to, he was in fear
for his safety is what he told me.</i>

216
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:18,151
<i>-Is that what you said?
-No.</i>

217
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,602
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

218
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:24,074
<i>Sir, you have a $500 counterclaim
for emotional distress.</i>

219
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,445
<i>I cannot wait to hear this.</i>

220
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:29,312
Hey, Lil, I'm going to borrow
some of your ground beef, okay?

221
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,531
Okay.

222
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:35,789
Hey, Lexi.

223
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,266
-Hello?
-Yeah.

224
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,235
I'm not looking too presentable

225
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,335
so I'm gonna let this thing go down
before I go on this interview.

226
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,085
So few more days. Okay? All right?

227
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,130
Sure.

228
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,420
All right. Thank you.

229
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,614
<i>It was before she
started getting to my bed.</i>

230
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,974
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

231
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,559
<i>So that's what your counterclaim is about.
She has caused you emotional distress.</i>

232
00:10:57,644 --> 00:11:01,211
<i>Not baby mama number
one, two, three or four but her.</i>

233
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,208
<i>-All of them do.
-Okay.</i>

234
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,825
<i>They all run together.</i>

235
00:11:06,443 --> 00:11:08,280
<i>Your-- your counter claim
is dismissed, sir.</i>

236
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,474
Judgment in this case paying $2902.

237
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,403
Not even one man shirt?

238
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,625
Beggars can't be choosers, Mikey.

239
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,175
Your last job listed is over 17 years ago.

240
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,651
That's quite a gap in employment.

241
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,901
You know, I've, I've worked almost
every day for the last 17 years.

242
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,400
It's just, I've been self-employed.

243
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:07,685
-What line of work?
-Oh, mostly entertainment.

244
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,862
I've been living in Los Angeles.

245
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:12,109
That's why I have the 323 area code
right there in case you were wondering,

246
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:15,095
but yeah, film, television,
music, entrepreneurship.

247
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,225
Okay. So why are you
interested in working here?

248
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,781
-Well, I'm living here now.
-Okay.

249
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,212
We were estranged for a while.
I'll be honest, but you know,

250
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,868
we're both from here and you know,
now that we're back living here,

251
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,515
we decided to, to make a run of it.

252
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,649
Well, we do require some experience or
previous training in the service industry

253
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,480
and at least one reference.

254
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,653
Yeah, that's going to be tricky.

255
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,873
But I did work for Cicis pizza
in '99 to 2000.

256
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,693
I think that branch
that I worked for closed,

257
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,575
I put it on there, but yeah, you
could contact corporate if you like.

258
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,244
Look, if you, if you were
incarcerated, that's okay.

259
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,543
I just need something
from your parole officer.

260
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,884
-Look, I'm gonna to be straight with you.
-All right. I need that.

261
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,379
Okay. All right. Look, I'll just be honest
with you. You don't recognize me, do you?

262
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,070
I'm an adult film actor.

263
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:01,984
Excuse me.

264
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:04,079
A porn star.
Um, I'm a porn star.

265
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,800
I know, I've been working in the adult
entertainment industry since 2001.

266
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,978
-And you know, even though--
-Did you say porn?

267
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:15,115
Hey. No, that was fun.

268
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,956
-I'm sure was.
-Yeah. All the la--

269
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,165
Why don't you just Google me?
Look up Mikey Saber.

270
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,325
Mikey--
Saber, S-A-B-E-R-XXX.

271
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,429
Go ahead. Search it.

272
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,394
Unbelievable.

273
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,854
Yeah, that's what they say.

274
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:33,320
Yeah, just pull down. Yep. That's
me right there. Younger me, but--

275
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,835
-Oh, that certainly is you.
-Yeah.

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,155
2000 movies, six awards, 13
nominations in hall of fame did that.

277
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,144
Now I want to start fresh and really
start a new chapter, a new life with,

278
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:48,777
with you and your company, ma'am.

279
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:53,494
I'd really like to help you, but, um,
my management,they would not permit this.

280
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,571
I'm sorry, but you are just simply

281
00:13:57,908 --> 00:13:59,760
overqualified for this job.

282
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,490
I'm just not sure our customers would
be comfortable with you waiting on them.

283
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:09,275
They may have seen one of your movies.

284
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,477
But later on when you get home,
Google Mikey Saber XXX.

285
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,454
And you'll see what I'm talking about.
There's some good shit.

286
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:15,786
Okay.
Yeah, I'll do that.

287
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,578
-Thanks.
-Thanks man. Take care now.

288
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,530
Nobody's hiring.

289
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:29,680
At least get your assistance check.

290
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,526
Well, I may be able to get you paced
up from Brazzers or New Sensations,

291
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,778
but I had a falling out with one of
the guys over there. It's a long story.

292
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,721
Okay. But you need to be a
Texas resident to get benefits.

293
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,510
I Know. I'm residing here.
I moved back in with my wife last week.

294
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:49,515
In order to be a resident you need
to reside here for at least 180 days.

295
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,775
So why don't you come back when you
can provide me with a Texas state ID

296
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,540
and a copy of your marriage license. Okay?

297
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,420
Yes, ma'am.
-Also, I'm a little confused.

298
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:01,655
Is your last name Davis or Saber?

299
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,138
Morning, Lil.

300
00:15:16,153 --> 00:15:17,114
Good morning.

301
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,925
<i>This has been a test
of the emergency warning system.</i>

Ernesto.

304
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,504
Me, Mikey from high school.

305
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:30,144
Mikey?

306
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:33,455
Oh, huh, Mikey. Okay. Okay.

307
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,918
Is your mom here?

308
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:36,601
Yeah. She's here.

309
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:38,827
Can I please speak with her really quick?

310
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,753
Yeah. She's out in the back.

311
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,188
-Whoa-- whoa, out back.
-That way?

312
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:45,304
-Yeah. Out back.
-Okay.

313
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,062
Thanks. Big dog.

314
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,859
He's a retarded.

315
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,230
Don't worry about it.
You know the boy is slow.

316
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,950
That's why his head is so big.
Don't talk about the boy.

317
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:05,926
I don't need him.

318
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,236
I'm just telling you to calm down.
I'mma check his ass.

319
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,509
Pardon me. Leondria.

320
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:11,901
Hey, it's me. Mikey.

321
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:14,118
Mikey.

322
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:15,993
Remember me?

323
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,089
It's okay.
It's been forever.

324
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:21,375
It's Lil's son-in-law, Mikey.

325
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:25,661
-Mikey.
-Yeah. It's good to see you, ma'am.

326
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,810
-What the hell are you doing around here?
-Yeah. I'm back in town.

327
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,145
It's so good to see you again, ma'am.
You look great.

328
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,316
-Hey, I'm Mikey.
-My daughter, June.

329
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,300
Oh shit, June.

330
00:17:38,385 --> 00:17:39,520
I haven't seen you since--

331
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,560
Last time I saw you
you were up to my knee.

332
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,017
You've grown up. Big girl now.

333
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,329
So why are you back, Mr. Hollywood?

334
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:51,943
Oh, oh, well--

335
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,880
Me and the old lady
trying to give it another go.

336
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:56,020
Oh really?

337
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:58,809
So you telling me Lil
letting you stay there?

338
00:17:58,894 --> 00:17:59,801
Well, yeah, yeah.

339
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:03,764
I mean, you know, I'm--  I'm helping out
and chipping in around the house--

340
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,680
which is why I'm here.

341
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:10,480
Uh, so I was wondering maybe
I can move some bud for you?

342
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:11,894
Like I did back in the day.

343
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:19,360
Speaking of back in the day
you sound brand new.

344
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,720
Oh, the accent. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:24,899
I had to lose it for the biz ma'am

346
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:27,721
but y'all know
I'm still a Texas boy at heart.

347
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:31,300
-You helping Lil with the rent?
-Of course.

348
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:33,730
But, uh, I'm kind of
cash poor at the moment.

349
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:35,627
Do you think you could
put me on front street?

350
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,990
Let's start with an ounce.

351
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,180
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.

352
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,130
-Hey, June.
-Hey, darling.

353
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,238
-How are you doing?
-I'm good. How are you doing?

354
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,770
You ladies have a nice day.

355
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,247
You too, Mikey.

356
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:56,792
-All right, girl.
-Anyway, girl, so--

357
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,980
-Yeah.
-What do you think of that?

358
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,839
Yeah. So I kinda changed the--

359
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:01,862
I like the color.

360
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:11,079
I bet you any goddamn week
his ass gon' smoke that shit itself.

361
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:12,995
Well, I'm glad I gave
him some Reggie bush.

362
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,786
That's what I'm talking about.
You are smart, baby girl.

363
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,846
Pipe, and those baggies

364
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,846
and let me get Dutch masters.

365
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,907
Wait. No, no. Yeah.

366
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:24,726
Those those papers right there.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm a patriotic boy.

367
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:46,085
<i>We must break free from the
petty politics of the past.</i>

368
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,217
<i>America is a nation of
believers, dreamers and strikers</i>

369
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:57,526
<i>that is being lead by a group
of sanctions, critics and cynics.</i>

370
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:09,250
You weren't bullshit.

371
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:10,557
I don't bullshit.

372
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:14,471
Just please don't give me that "nickel
for a shit" again. I won't get repeaters.

373
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,200
It's not "nickel for a shit", son.

374
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:18,367
Much better.

375
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:21,899
Ladies.

376
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:25,977
-Hey, Leo.
-Hey June.

377
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:27,782
How are you doing?
How is it going?

378
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,538
-How are you?
-Good.

379
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:33,147
Okay. Okay.

380
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,098
Yes.

381
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,489
Got 'em.

382
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:58,141
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hey, are you doing today, honey?

383
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,422
Doing good. You got men's clothes?
My size.

384
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,999
I got a few over here hanging out.

385
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:06,240
I like this.
You think this is a good color on me?

386
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,920
Oh, absolutely.

387
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:11,130
Look at that. You have a
fitting room or I just gotta risk it?

388
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,575
Yeah, I think this shirt
would look real nice on you, hon.

389
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,471
If I buy all those clothes,
throw this in for a dollar.

390
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,418
-Okay?
-Alright. Deal.

391
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,000
-Sold.
-Sold.

392
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,760
As a a token of my appreciation,

393
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:31,867
step up from your
restaurant ashtrays, and okay.

394
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:33,790
This doesn't change anything.

395
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,343
But I do like it.

396
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:55,571
Damn. Dope ride.

397
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:58,932
Uh, yeah, man. Can I help you?

398
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,720
Wow. I'm next door.

399
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,098
I'm living next door.

400
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:04,990
Oh yeah?

401
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,082
Wait a second.

402
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:08,559
Shit.

403
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:10,210
You're Mikey.

404
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,380
Yeah.

405
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,745
Yeah man. It's-- it's me, man.
It's me, Lonnie.

406
00:22:14,975 --> 00:22:15,850
Do I know you?

407
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,885
Well, I mean, kinda--

408
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,304
I mean, I live here obviously and uh,

409
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,440
No, Lexi, man.
Lexi used to babysit me all the time.

410
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:27,735
Oh yeah.

411
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,810
Yeah. My parents came home one night.
Y'all were humping in their bedroom.

412
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,790
You jumped out the window naked.

413
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,795
They called the cops
on you and everything.

414
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,355
Yup. Yup. Now I remember.

415
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,975
Oh shit.
Your mother hates me.

416
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:42,635
Well, I mean she hated you, man.
Yeah, she died.

417
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:45,148
Damn. Sorry to hear that.

418
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:46,515
No, man, It's good, man.

419
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,310
I mean, it happened over a year ago.

420
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:50,803
Bladder cancer, shit's a motherfucker.

421
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,609
Oh shit. That sucks.

422
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:56,440
But hey, we should hang out sometime,
take a spin in this bad boy.

423
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,915
Oh yeah, man.
What are you even doing back here?

424
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,110
Oh, it's a long story, but do you think
you could take me downtown tomorrow?

425
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,100
We could catch up.

426
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:05,710
Yeah, dude, I would love to.
I got nothing else to do.

427
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:06,935
Hell yeah. Thanks bro.

428
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:10,768
Uh-- Hey, let's just get you some
shoes on this bitch. You're good to go.

429
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:12,819
-Yeah man. I can't wait.
-All right.

430
00:23:12,904 --> 00:23:14,225
And welcome back, dude.

431
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,786
Fucking Mikey man. Shit.

432
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,513
Fucking Mikey.

433
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,965
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

434
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,683
Hey, great life choice guys. Seriously.

435
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:58,085
Her doctor cut her pain meds
in half you fucking asshole.

436
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,203
Yeah. Right.

437
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,476
Oh, this is a pimp mobile
if I ever rode in one, Lonnie.

438
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,220
Man, I'm not gonna lie to you, Mikey.

439
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:09,190
I never thought I'd see you
back in Texas city, bro.

440
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,499
Yeah, me neither.

441
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,325
God, I remember when y'all left, man.

442
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,179
Y'all were like celebrities,
you know.

443
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:18,854
Fucking two porn stars,
the couple.

444
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:20,249
Yeah, that's cool.

445
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,303
Oh, dude, they used to show
Lexis fucking videos

446
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:25,690
at every one
of the highest school parties.

447
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:28,952
And I got to brag man,
because she was my neighbor.

448
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:30,415
And babysitter.

449
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,825
Yeah, man, and babysitter, man.

450
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:36,012
I got 800 almost 900 subscribers
on my Pornhub channel

451
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,485
and I got one of the highest
ratings and that's not just male talent.

452
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,445
That's overall.

453
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,090
I got an 81% positive click rate.

454
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:44,784
I was at this coffee shop in the valley.

455
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,761
And these people are like,
oh shit, that's Mike Saber.

456
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,291
Right here, bro, go right.

457
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,580
Yeah, bro.

458
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,795
They recognized me.
They're like, oh, that's Mikey Saber.

459
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,930
And they took a picture of me,
tag me on Instagram.

460
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:58,179
And next thing you know,
I had a hundred new followers.

461
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,720
-A hundred followers?
-Yup.

462
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:02,694
I don't even have a hundred followers.

463
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,539
Well, if you stick with me
I'll get your followers up, baby.

464
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,035
Jenna Haze, man.

465
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,950
-Huh?
-Jenna Haze, man.

466
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:10,456
Oh, yeah. Jenna. Yeah.

467
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,513
I did at least three scenes with her, man.

468
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:15,258
She is a nasty bitch.
Let me tell ya.

469
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,653
<i>Make it rain on that ass.
You wanna see that, cash right here.</i>

470
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,807
If you'd like to see what's in-between,
come on, throw some more green.

471
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,406
Right here, all night long.

472
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:26,694
She ran my bill up to 1500 bucks.

473
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:28,698
It's like who you calling improv, bitch.

474
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:29,924
Fuck if I know.

475
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,966
Shit. Yeah but she is
a beautiful girl, man.

476
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:33,920
I can't hear you.

477
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,255
I said, yeah, but she's
a beautiful girl, man.

478
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,293
Yeah, she's fucking banging, bro.
She's banging.

479
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,755
Oh, God, speaking of banging--

480
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,254
I need a minute.

481
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:51,405
All that green right there--

482
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,052
<i>If you love pussy, well, hey, don't be shy
get on top side, right here right now.</i>

483
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,460
Tell your girls there's
more where that came from.

484
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:35,740
Hey. Whatchu doing?

485
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,505
I'm watching TV.

486
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,622
No way. What are you watching?

487
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,871
-None of your business.
-I love that show.

488
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,231
Oh my God.

489
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,013
Hey, you uh--

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,895
You wanna hang out and stuff?

491
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,520
Do I want to hang out and stuff?

492
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:52,683
Yeah.

493
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:55,833
Do you wanna hook-up?

494
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:58,442
Do I wanna hook-up?

495
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:01,981
Do-- Do you wanna fuck?

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,825
Are you serious right now, Mikey?

497
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,707
I'm serious, keep it down. Your mom-- Shh.

498
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,449
Come on.

499
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,113
Okay. Hurry.

500
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:32,147
Can I get a drag?

501
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,842
Go on.

502
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:38,716
Your body looks good.
You've been working out?

503
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,513
-What?
-So we're done here.

504
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,592
Wait, you mean--
What-- I can't sleep here?

505
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:50,693
-No.
-Really?

506
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,037
Come back to the sofa.

507
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,505
Come on now.

508
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:56,207
Jesus. Oh my God.

509
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:19,585
That was fun.

510
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,010
-Sophie, I fucked your mom last night.
-Oh my God. Can you keep it down?

511
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:32,807
Oh. Stop. You love it.

512
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,736
Don't think this is going
to become a regular thing.

513
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,025
Think you can cut the lawn today?

514
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:19,795
That's it. That's why I'm back,
I'm back in town.

515
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,006
You seen me before,
don't act like you ain't seen me.

516
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:23,194
She's acting now.

517
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,605
You know what, in high school,
I beat this guy's ass like 25 years ago.

518
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,570
We had a misunderstanding on
the basketball game.

519
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:38,244
♪ Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you. ♪

520
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:39,307
♪ Happy-- ♪

521
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:46,060
Ma, we just want to say happy birthday.
And we hope you'd have many more.

522
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,560
Thank you, honey.

523
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:55,220
I guess you can set it down.
Thank you all for coming out.

524
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:18,551
Gina-- Gina Valentine.

525
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,379
-Gina, Melissa.
-Yeah.

526
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:22,510
Yeah, man.
You were in a bunch of her scenes.

527
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:24,511
She was in a bunch of
my scenes technically,

528
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:26,252
but yeah, that was my girl after Lexi.

529
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:29,980
Bitch goes and marry some rich
software dork she met in Vegas.

530
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:31,055
I think they have a kid.

531
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,800
They live in Salt Lake or something.

532
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:34,115
Boring fucking life.

533
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,855
-Wow.
-Yeah.

534
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,309
Who do you think discovered her?

535
00:30:37,394 --> 00:30:39,700
I got her signed a Renegade.
I taught her the pole.

536
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:42,519
I dealt with a crazy drugged
out ass for a year man.

537
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,340
Soon as the bitches' head gets big,
they betray you.

538
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:48,970
It's what happened with Lexi, you know.

539
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,595
-Really? Lexi?
-Yeah.

540
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,308
Jules Jordan bought her
out from under me for 10 grand

541
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,510
the first chance he got, that fucker.

542
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,159
Wait, he bought her?

543
00:30:57,244 --> 00:31:00,268
Yeah. He paid her 10 grand to betray me
but the jokes on Jules though,

544
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:02,385
she went from doing Roxies to smoking tar

545
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,869
the minute I wasn't there
to straighten her ass out.

546
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:08,109
And we were together for five
years, five fucking years.

547
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:10,270
She won two AVNs under my watch.

548
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:11,329
She leaves me.

549
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,579
Bitch gets shot out in nine months.
Couldn't book shit.

550
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,953
And then she goes and moves in with mommy
exactly one year

551
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:17,968
after she left me high and dry.

552
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:20,122
-Shit.
-Yeah. Shit is right.

553
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,262
Hey, is Whiskers in Galveston still open?

554
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:32,470
You're not leaving that
dirty glass in the sink.

555
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,661
No, sir.

556
00:31:33,746 --> 00:31:34,879
Okay.

557
00:31:34,964 --> 00:31:36,161
Clean it up.

558
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,280
That's right.

559
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:45,670
We all do ours.

560
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:46,958
Okay.

561
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:48,700
Wait, where do you think you are going?

562
00:31:48,785 --> 00:31:49,680
What about the others?

563
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:50,913
Those are yours too.

564
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:53,248
The last three houses I lived in,
they had dishwashers.

565
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm not doing the dishes.
I don't do that shit.

566
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:57,305
You do not live here. This is my kitchen.

567
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,629
If you can't follow the rules,
out, out, out.

568
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:02,143
I'm tired of you talking to me
like a little kid. Hey, Lexi.

569
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:03,855
Don't you disrespect your mother-in-law.

570
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,030
Your mom's starting shit with me,
can you please inform her I'm not a Dick?

571
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:09,545
-Why would I lie to my mother?
-Oh, you too, huh?

572
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,075
Really? You're just going
to turn on me like that.

573
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,942
After every-- I've been
mowing the fucking lawn.

574
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:14,699
-Oh my God, you've been mowing the lawn.
-What? What?

575
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:17,096
-Yeah. I've been mowing the lawn. What?
-Jesus Christ, Mikey.

576
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,754
--dirty dishes in the sink.

577
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,315
But you haven't given me a dime.

578
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:22,344
I know but I'm gonna pay you guys and look

579
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:24,579
I've been walking the dog,
I'm providing protection.

580
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:26,343
She's an outside dog.
She doesn't need walking man.

581
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,870
We don't need security.
Do we need a security guard, ma?

582
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,700
I didn't know that we
hired a security guard.

583
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,340
Yeah, you got me.
You're safe now because I'm here.

584
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:35,650
You've been drinking on my insurance.

585
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:37,720
Listen, I'm trying to get a job.

586
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,875
I've been looking for
a job the whole time.

587
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,140
I want you outta here now.

588
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,819
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.
Listen. Listen.

589
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,966
-I know I said I'd help out with the rent.
-You did.

590
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,539
- You did.
-Let me finish.

591
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:50,560
I know I said I'd help out with the rent.
So I'm not gonna help out with the rent.

592
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:51,849
Well get the fuck out then.

593
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:54,152
I'm gonna pay the whole goddamn thing.

594
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:57,434
Now you're talking.

595
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,460
August is on Mikey motherfucker. Yeah.

596
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,800
Look how your eyes light up
like a little Christmas tree.

597
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:03,697
-The whole month.
-You love this shit.

598
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,810
-Yes. The whole month.
-Okay.

599
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:07,270
So let's go get some
fucking doughnuts on me

600
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,218
cause I take care of shit around here

601
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,293
and whatever fucking doughnuts
you want. Let's go.

602
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:14,074
I just wanted you guys
taken care of, okay?

603
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,830
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

604
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,240
My favourite place.

605
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,400
I know, Lil, you love this place.

606
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:20,628
Yes.

607
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:23,339
I might have one, but I don't know.
I'll have-- I'll sneak a peek.

608
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:25,065
You think it's too late
for me to get coffee?

609
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,225
You can have one when ever you want.

610
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,650
I just don't think it's gonna be
the best coffee in the world.

611
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,576
But hey, look I even got the door.

612
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,911
I got the door.
I got the door.

613
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:33,810
Thank you.

614
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:34,725
Here we are.

615
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,498
-Good evening.
-Hello.

616
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:36,888
Hello.

617
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,675
Whatever these ladies want.

618
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,720
I want Doughnut Holes and Jericho doughnut
and a cappuccino.

619
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,487
There you go. Make it a
large-- give her extra large cup--

620
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:47,225
What do you want? For here?

621
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,785
Do you want it here?

622
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,356
What, we're just going to go?

623
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,736
We're gonna eat on the road?

624
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,310
Give her the largest
cappuccino that you got

625
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,085
-and whatever drink she wants.
-I want a small coffee.

626
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,172
Give her a large.
Now's the time to get a large.

627
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,880
Yeah. A large coffee, man,
with lots of cream.

628
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,495
Sure.

629
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,740
A little bit sugar.

630
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:03,112
What are the doughnuts you want?

631
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:04,835
I'm gonna have--

632
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,928
I want a pink--
Yeah, pink Sparkle, please.

633
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,927
Give her the Pink Sparkle,
whatever she wants.

634
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,513
Oh. Can I get a Chocolate too?
Can I get a Chocolate? Thank you.

635
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:13,388
Whatever they want. Okay?

636
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:15,652
-Doughnut holes, please.
-Yeah. Get the Doughnut Holes.

637
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,400
This is the day to get
everything you want.

638
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:19,325
This is the day that the Lord helped me.

639
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,040
It's what money buys here.

640
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,575
Look at that. Huh?
We got the holes. You good?

641
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,670
Is that enough for you guys?
You should get it now while we're here.

642
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:27,785
Cause this is it. All right?

643
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:29,554
There you go.
Is that one yours?

644
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,750
Okay.
That's the cappuccino.

645
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,284
This one-- that's the biggest one they got.

646
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,115
I don't know
what more do you want me to do?

647
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,095
-All right, guys, go ahead and sit down.
-Thank you so much.

648
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,280
I'll grab this. How much is that?

649
00:34:38,365 --> 00:34:39,420
$6.32.

650
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,998
Six-thirty-two.

651
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,520
Can I get some napkins, please?

652
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:48,481
Alrighty.

653
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,325
And there's your change.

654
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,848
Thank you kindly.

655
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,971
I'm gonna save the
Pink Sprinkle, this one, for last.

656
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:12,135
This one, I don't know
what to do with.

657
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,330
I don't know what to do--

658
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,282
I don't know what to do with it, ma.

659
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,135
All right. I'll have one.
Just tear me half.

660
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,075
Eat the part that doesn't have--

661
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,613
I don't want the color one, just give me
half of one of the doughnut balls.

662
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:23,110
-The holes.
-Half of a doughnut ball?

663
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:24,973
I don't understand why it's a hole--

664
00:35:25,058 --> 00:35:26,755
Well, the hole's in the middle--

665
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,445
That's what, where it came out of.

666
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,199
Fine. Okay. That makes sense.

667
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,290
Now this doughnut doesn't
have enough sprinkles on.

668
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,289
-See that?
-Hey, guys, can we wrap this up?

669
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:37,840
-We've got to get outta here.
-Okay.

670
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:38,933
Excuse me. What?

671
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:43,930
No, ma, I am eating-- I'm gonna savor
every goddamn sparkle on this doughnut.

672
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,199
Keep it down.

673
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:46,620
She doesn't care.

674
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:48,378
I know, but it's rude.
We just came in.

675
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,120
I don't know why he's walking so fast.

676
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:53,165
Just hurry up.

677
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,925
There must be a fire somewhere.

678
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,090
At the bar.

679
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:59,807
-Come on. We're full of doughnut.
-Okay. Come on.

680
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:00,909
I gotta pee.

681
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,800
Stop acting. You get so dramatic.

682
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:07,031
-What-- are you training for a marathon?
-Lil, will you tell your daughter to--

683
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:09,179
Is this the Olympics?
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

684
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:10,810
Are we going to fire?

685
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,713
Fire. What do you mean? We're going home.

686
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:16,330
-How far?
-I can't run in this shoes, Mikey.

687
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,369
I don't wanna throw up in my kitchen.

688
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:21,117
Oh, shit. I forgot. I forgot cigarettes.

689
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:22,196
Oh, I got a pack.

690
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,743
And I forgot rolling papers,
I will be right back.

691
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:25,673
-What?
-Yup.

692
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:26,696
All right.

693
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:37,118
DONUT HOLE

694
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:29,362
Dallas Police Sergeant,
Georgia Rhonda is the president

695
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,865
<i>of the national Latino Law
Enforcement Organization</i>

696
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,260
<i>Greater Dallas.</i>

697
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:37,875
<i>And also works on recruiting
for the Dallas Police Department.</i>

698
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,750
<i>In the weeks after--</i>

699
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:47,735
<i>467 people applied to join
the Dallas police department.</i>

700
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,275
<i>That's nearly a 250%
increase in applicants.</i>

701
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,546
Hello.

702
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:38,190
-Hi.
-May I help you.

703
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:42,837
Hi. Yeah. Uh, the ginger
that works here, she works Tuesdays, no?

704
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,750
-Ginger?
-The red hair girl.

705
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,647
-Raylee.
-Raylee. Yeah.

706
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:49,920
I call her a ginger, but Raylee.
Yeah. Raylee.

707
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:50,999
Are you a friend of her?

708
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:53,610
Very good friends with her.
I just wanted to come say hi. Yeah.

709
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:56,825
I always get Tuesdays
and Wednesdays mixed up. So--

710
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,490
Yeah, she does not work Tuesdays.

711
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:02,023
Okay. Yeah.
I'll just give her a call or a text.

712
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,904
-But, but she does work Wednesdays, right?
-Yeah.

713
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:11,457
-She works Wednesday.
-Okay. Thought so. Yeah.

714
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:14,069
-Do you want a doughnut?
-Uh, how much?

715
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:31,375
-Top of the morning to you.
-Good morning, sir. What can I grab you?

716
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,970
Oh, it's Mikey. Not sir.
I'm not that old.

717
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:36,226
-Right, pleased to meet you, Mikey.
-What's your name?

718
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:37,375
Raylee.

719
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,319
Raylee, it's a beautiful name.

720
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,884
What do you recommend?

721
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:42,174
Depends on what you like.

722
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:44,305
Um, custard one is good.

723
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,774
Jelly is sweet.

724
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,294
Glazed is a favorite.

725
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:49,585
Is that your favorite?

726
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,924
Oh, I might have to try that one.

727
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:54,985
Uh, what did the doughnuts
do on their first date?

728
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,118
I beg your pardon?

729
00:39:56,203 --> 00:39:57,924
What did the doughnut
do in their first date?

730
00:39:58,009 --> 00:39:58,855
I don't know.

731
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,087
They glazed into each others eyes.

732
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,535
-That's so stupid.
-Yeah.

733
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,863
I can't believe I haven't heard that one.

734
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:06,614
But I wrote it.
You couldn't have heard.

735
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:09,069
I kind of write doughnut
jokes on the side.

736
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:11,214
It's one of my many talents.

737
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah. But I'm thinking, I don't know

738
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:16,555
maybe I'll just go with the chocolate
and got to get some milk with--

739
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,895
Oh, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna need a minute.

740
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,901
-Thank you, buddy.
-Hi. What can I grab you?

741
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,790
I would like a large coffee, please.

742
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,814
Uh, one Hazel Cream and
two chocolate donuts.

743
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,230
Help yourself to the cream.
And what can I get for you, sir?

744
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:35,432
I'll get a coffee, black.
Filled doughnut, and that'll be it.

745
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,924
Sweet. Can I share the same bag?

746
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:38,260
Yes. Yes.

747
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,971
Good to conserve.

748
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:43,650
Your coffee is coming right after--

749
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,134
-Good morning.
-What's the damage?

750
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,714
Uh, $6.32.

751
00:40:50,799 --> 00:40:52,282
-There you go.
-A $10.

752
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,235
Hey, miss Phan,
can I get some help out here?

753
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,174
-There's your tip.
-Thank you.

754
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:07,725
Next customer please.

755
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,118
Hey, when do things
slow down around here?

756
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,163
-Oh, excuse me.
-What time does it wind down?

757
00:41:12,248 --> 00:41:14,305
We are slammed until like two-ish.

758
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,327
I'll see you at two.

759
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,017
Okay.

760
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:19,006
I'm sorry about that.
Uh, what would you like?

761
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:40,639
I'm back. Just like I promised.

762
00:41:40,723 --> 00:41:41,929
I'm a man of my word.

763
00:41:42,014 --> 00:41:44,139
So in the future,
you can always rely on me.

764
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,285
Back to tell more doughnut jokes.

765
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,936
No, that was actually
the only doughnut joke I had

766
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:51,719
and it took me a very long time
to write that one. That's all I got.

767
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:53,445
-Why? Do you have any?
-Actually I do.

768
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,162
Um, what do you call a Jamaican doughnut?

769
00:41:59,569 --> 00:42:01,520
Hmm. I like where this is going.

770
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,219
Give me a minute. Uh, Jamaican Doughnut.

771
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,995
I'm stumped.

772
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,374
Cinna-mon.

773
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,525
I got to go.

774
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,531
That was really,
that hurt my feelings.

775
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,824
That was terrible.

776
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,223
That's okay. I forgive you.

777
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,182
So Raylee I'm thinking--

778
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,377
Call me Strawberry.

779
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,114
Call you what?

780
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,699
-Strawberry.
-Strawberry?

781
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,183
-Everybody calls me that.
-You're kidding.

782
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,895
Okay. How old are you?

783
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,708
-Who is asking?
-Me.

784
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:30,911
-Why?
-Come on.

785
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,006
I'm old enough.

786
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:34,060
For what?

787
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:38,474
Oh God, I'll be 18 in three weeks. Okay?

788
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:41,489
I know what you're too old for me.

789
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,725
Anyway, Strawberry.

790
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,435
Can't believe that's your name.

791
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,205
I don't know which doughnut to get.

792
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,404
I need your help.

793
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:52,915
I really liked the look of those
doughnut holes and those, you know,

794
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,364
do you frost to do the sprinkles?
Do you do those? Who makes them?

795
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,585
I do the sprinkles and I fill the cream.

796
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,741
-You fill the cream?
-Yeah.

797
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:02,844
I just want the ones that you make.
I want the ones that you cream filled.

798
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:05,077
Does that sound--
I don't wanna get you in trouble.

799
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,480
I'm thinking maybe a chocolate round
or maybe I'll get a strawberry filled.

800
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:13,648
No pun intended.
Actually I do.

801
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:15,677
I don't think she likes me very much.

802
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,809
I don't think she likes anyone very much.

803
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:19,229
Yeah. She's a mean boss.

804
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,401
Anyway, okay.
So yes, I've decided. Chocolate round.

805
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,880
Okay.

806
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:27,426
But you want chocolate sprinkles,

807
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,515
chocolate cake,
chocolate Bavarian cream?

808
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,140
There's all those different chocolates?

809
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:36,099
Oh no. Now I got to stay here for a few
more hours and decide. Son of a bitch.

810
00:43:36,184 --> 00:43:37,928
Are you trying to keep me here?

811
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:39,669
Cause I'll sit in the corner
and contemplate this for a while

812
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:42,109
until you get off.
What time do you get off?

813
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,047
It feels so fucking good.

814
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:45,090
Oh shit.

815
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,301
Fucking, bitch. Yeah.
Do you like that?

816
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:50,894
You like that big dick inside of you.

817
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,262
Not bad. Huh?

818
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:56,559
Not bad at all.

819
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,789
I didn't even have to take
one of my magic pills.

820
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,465
I didn't know you're using.

821
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:06,910
Yeah.

822
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:10,504
You remember how hard it is
to keep it right on set all day.

823
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:11,668
Yeah.

824
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:15,270
Remember when
Christina Roseanne was broken?

825
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:16,957
I do. I do.

826
00:44:17,042 --> 00:44:18,841
I surprised it even works at all.

827
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,652
I wish it was.

828
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,058
Oh yeah.

829
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:29,420
Love the exterior decorating, sir.

830
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:30,659
It's looking spiffy.

831
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,284
All right, dad, we'll be back around five.

832
00:44:45,026 --> 00:44:46,698
Do you think he remembered me?

833
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,605
Man, ever since my mom died,

834
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,346
all he cares about
is keeping his place immaculate.

835
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,275
Matter of fact,

836
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,322
I've been screwed out of male
performer of the year,

837
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:59,695
literally five times,
but you know what?

838
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,094
I don't say shit. It's all good.
I'm a team player.

839
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,429
Almost every single girl I did a scene
with started fucking me off camera. Right?

840
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:06,764
But the agents hate that shit.

841
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:08,035
What do they expect?

842
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,675
You know, it's like,
girl comes by my model house.

843
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,074
They see my hall of fame
trophy on the medal piece.

844
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,594
They're like, oh my God,
he's famous for fucking.

845
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:17,574
Wait, you said your model house?

846
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:19,555
I had three model houses, bro.

847
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,096
And the last one, Ooh,
that was a Savage ass house

848
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,802
until I started letting agents
book bottom bitches in there.

849
00:45:25,886 --> 00:45:27,004
Bottom bitches?

850
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,277
Bottom bitches are technically
the best of the hookers.

851
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:30,655
But they're still the hookers.

852
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,131
And that's what they started saying
to me, it was the fucking hookers.

853
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,430
And that's when everything went to shit,

854
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:36,929
cause see, once a porn
chick gets a hooker mentality

855
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:39,890
they become a fucking nightmare,
a real pain in my ass.

856
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:41,997
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

857
00:45:42,082 --> 00:45:44,089
Dude, I forgot how hot
Gulf Coast bitches are.

858
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,472
I saw this girl over by the
doughnut shop at the Refinery.

859
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,011
She works there, smoking hot,
gorgeous drop dead gorgeous

860
00:45:49,096 --> 00:45:51,715
and get this, 17 years old.

861
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,879
Legal as an eagle.

862
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:54,890
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

863
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,311
Hey man. See that
strip of land over there.

864
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:02,324
Yeah.

865
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,964
That was the Texas
killing fields, brother.

866
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,065
-Strawberry.
-Yeah?

867
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,585
-You blaze, right?
-Why? You a cop?

868
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,838
Let's go smoke one.

869
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,651
Hey Miss Phan, can I take my Ten.

870
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:36,889
So what'd you do in LA?

871
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:38,380
I've been in entertainment.

872
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:41,355
I knew it.
You have that Hollywood vibe.

873
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:43,926
-Yeah. You dig?
-Yeah.

874
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,930
So what'd you do in entertainment?

875
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:49,445
Manager slash agent.

876
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:51,445
-Like for actors?
-Yeah.

877
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,590
That weed is good. Right?

878
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:56,101
Do you or your friends want any?
I could get a whole bunch more.

879
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:57,092
No problem.

880
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:03,513
So you live in Hollywood managing actors.

881
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:08,050
But you're in Texas City
riding a bike, selling weed

882
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:09,520
and hitting on high-schoolers?

883
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,176
Well, my Camaro's in LA, you know,

884
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:14,075
I wasn't going to drive
all the way to Texas.

885
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,643
It's like a three-day drive.

886
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,435
All right. Look, I'm here
taking care of my mom, all right?

887
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,838
She's not doing too well.

888
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:24,820
I'm sorry.

889
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:25,877
It's all right.

890
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,900
You're a good son for
being there for your mom.

891
00:47:28,985 --> 00:47:30,096
I am.

892
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,420
By the way, who smokes joints anymore?

893
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,880
That's so old man--

894
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:39,280
That was fun.
We should do that again sometime.

895
00:47:39,365 --> 00:47:40,995
Yeah. I'll smoke your weed anytime.

896
00:47:42,785 --> 00:47:46,840
Hey, by the way, you can move all your
shit on the hard hats from the refinery.

897
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:49,770
I see them at the end of their
shift and they want to kill themselves.

898
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,598
See you later, alligator.

899
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:53,975
In a while, crocodile.

900
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,296
-Oh shit.
-Oh my gosh.

901
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:17,398
I'm sorry.

902
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:18,913
Sorry, Lil.

903
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:20,359
Oh, man.

904
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:23,845
I'm sorry.

905
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,472
I thought you found my couch comfy.

906
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:27,727
Oh, I do. I just-- I sleep out natural.

907
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,390
Cut the shit.

908
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:30,361
My bad.

909
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,265
Mikey, all seriousness.

910
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,115
I appreciate you taking care of bills.

911
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,403
That way it keeps Lexi
from being on the Craigslist.

912
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,770
Do you understand what I'm saying?

913
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:52,705
I under-- yeah.

914
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,554
So I need to know, are you in or out?

915
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,727
If you're in, I welcome you here.

916
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:01,840
All right. Hey--

917
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:04,765
If you're out, don't let
the door hit you in the ass.

918
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,495
-I'm in. I'm in.
-Okay, fine.

919
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,869
I'm paying the fucking rent.

920
00:49:07,954 --> 00:49:10,525
So tell me please,
this is about my baby.

921
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,235
I don't want her getting hurt anymore.

922
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,355
I don't want her doing clients anymore.

923
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,790
It's too dangerous.

924
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,735
I never know when she's coming home.

925
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,250
So it's up to you.

926
00:49:23,095 --> 00:49:25,751
I'm in, okay? I'm in.

927
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,975
-Okay, good.
-I'm here.

928
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,329
-Alright?
-Good.

929
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,579
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

930
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,825
Anything else?

931
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:38,938
Am I good to go?

932
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:40,585
Yes.

933
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,051
As long as I don't see your junk anymore.

934
00:49:43,136 --> 00:49:44,135
Deal.

935
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:46,236
Your mom's still a trip.

936
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:47,931
I know.

937
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,752
In a good way.

938
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:54,072
She is a piece of work.

939
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,420
That smoke, that second one from the left.
Is that new?

940
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:05,055
Has that always been there?

941
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,428
That's always been there.

942
00:50:08,311 --> 00:50:10,076
Lil calls that one old smoky.

943
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,014
It's my ex's truck.

944
00:50:23,297 --> 00:50:24,891
Get up two years ago.

945
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:27,907
Still handsome.

946
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,463
Just needs new wheels.

947
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,465
Well, I know you guys get tested,
which is why I've got this synthetic piss.

948
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,400
I'll throw it in free with an ounce,
other than that at 10 bucks a pop.

949
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,345
I got you if you guys ever need it.

950
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,751
You know, I don't want you guys getting
fired and shit.

951
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:54,867
Don't drink it.

952
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,795
I mean, unless you're
into that kind of shit.

953
00:50:58,149 --> 00:50:59,540
-Goodnight, Miss Phan.
-Goodnight.

954
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:00,532
Goodnight.

955
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:03,805
See you later, Alligator.

956
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:05,575
Do you want a ride home?

957
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,578
No, I'm good.

958
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:07,765
Throw it in the back.

959
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,102
Uh, yeah?

960
00:51:10,187 --> 00:51:11,319
Yeah, throw it in the back.

961
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:12,263
Okay.

962
00:51:16,248 --> 00:51:17,935
-Which way?
-Go left here.

963
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,662
We're getting close.

964
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,935
I really appreciate you
driving me home.

965
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:27,616
It's a nice area, huh?

966
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,795
Just wanted to buy my mom
something nice to retire.

967
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,233
That's real sweet of you.

968
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,178
All right. Yeah. It's right up here.

969
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,420
Yep. Right there. There it is.

970
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:42,625
Maybe would-- can you turn it down?

971
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,995
Cause you know, I don't
want to wake up my mom.

972
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,803
-Well, this is fancy.
-Yeah, it's nice.

973
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,806
I'd invite you in, but like I said,

974
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:54,744
you know, my mom's feeling sick and
she don't take too kindly to strangers.

975
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,385
She's just not all there
up there right now.

976
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,971
No.
Yeah, probably not a good idea anyway.

977
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:01,885
Yeah, so thanks for the ride.

978
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,075
Anytime, I work on Wednesday.

979
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,155
Oh, well, I'll see you Wednesday.

980
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,285
-Okay.
-Okay.

981
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,665
Look, I'm just glad
weed is still illegal in Texas.

982
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:46,285
You guys have no idea how hard
it is to move flower in Cali right now.

983
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,269
I mean, yeah. You know, I'm selling
it to the bitches at my model house

984
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:52,033
but besides that felons and illegals.

985
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,596
Don't mess with big oil.

986
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,725
TCPD kids, they sent him Valero, gosh.

987
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,264
It goes without saying, but you know,

988
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:05,300
keeping it on the deo has been
secret to my success all these years.

989
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:08,600
How do you think I stayed out of prison?
How do you think I've never got shot?

990
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,060
Mom, where is the hot sauce?

991
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,043
Where the hell it always been.

992
00:53:13,071 --> 00:53:14,694
No hot sauce, mom. I don't see it.

993
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:16,849
Did you look in your bedroom?
You were eating pizza--

994
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:18,920
Oh my God, mom, I don't--
Where's the hot sauce?

995
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:19,975
Why would he take it in his room?

996
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,285
You laughing, but you
were eating pizza there.

997
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:25,375
Mom, I've checked everywhere in
the kitchen. Where's the hot sauce?

998
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,350
Hey man. What are you looking at?
This ain't got nothing to do with you.

999
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,342
The world would collapse without me.

1000
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,217
Did you check under your bed?

1001
00:53:36,302 --> 00:53:37,276
Hey, yo--

1002
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,145
So heard you do porn or something?

1003
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:40,510
Five AVNs.

1004
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:43,125
What-- that's an STD?

1005
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,292
No, no, no.

1006
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:46,179
It's the, uh, it's the adult film awards.

1007
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,184
It's like the academy
awards for what I do.

1008
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,835
-Oh, okay, man. That's what's up?
-Yeah.

1009
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,694
Best oral three years in a row.

1010
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:54,521
-Best oral?
-Yep.

1011
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:58,444
Just one question--
Ain't that about getting head?

1012
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:01,349
I mean, you know, something like that.

1013
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,245
So then what that gotta do with you?

1014
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,599
It's not like you're the one
doing any work or anything.

1015
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,897
I'm not doing the work?

1016
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:11,415
Sister,
let me tell you something.

1017
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,735
Hey man, don't call me sister.

1018
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,745
Oh, my bad, June, right? It's June?

1019
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:15,761
Alright, June. Look,

1020
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,010
if I won three years in a row

1021
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:20,345
with three different girls, the chances it
of being the girl, pretty limited.

1022
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,320
Think about it.

1023
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:24,758
No, seriously, look, I'm the one guiding
the girl in the scene.

1024
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:26,775
Essentially, I'm face fucking here.

1025
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,005
Pardon my language.

1026
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,214
So, you know, the female
really has nothing to do with it.

1027
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:33,824
You know, I'm the one that's holding
her head for like 15 or 20 minutes

1028
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:34,929
while I'm force fucking her.

1029
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:36,555
So how is that about her exactly?

1030
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,170
-I got it, man.
-No, seriously look.

1031
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:39,484
It's about the shit I say.

1032
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,949
The way I hold their face
towards the camera while she spits

1033
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:45,344
and drools all over herself and I
pinched her nose and make her gag.

1034
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,274
-It's all techniques.
-I said, I got it.

1035
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,388
Thank you.

1036
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:29,769
Thanks, dude.

1037
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,415
Man, this place is off the chain.

1038
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,570
Thank you so much for hooking this up.

1039
00:55:36,655 --> 00:55:37,919
My pleasure.

1040
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,054
So tell me more about LA.

1041
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:44,825
Maybe you should find out for yourself.

1042
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,559
You think I have the money to go?

1043
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,535
You got a truck.

1044
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,535
-You could go anytime you want.
-That's my momma's truck.

1045
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,565
She just lets me use it.
Cause she works from home.

1046
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,935
Well, when I left Texas city
I didn't have a dime.

1047
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,745
I just said to myself, Mikey, one
day, you're going to own this town.

1048
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,418
I just went for it. You know?

1049
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,640
What is he doing behind the counter?

1050
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,464
He's gonna help me with my SAT prep.

1051
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,839
No free donuts.

1052
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,644
Thank you.

1053
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:24,409
So you were saying something about
just going for it.

1054
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,261
Are you trying to get fired?

1055
00:56:29,346 --> 00:56:31,089
I'm trying to get hired.

1056
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,220
Are you going to help me
score high on the SATs?

1057
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:41,621
Yeah. You get 600 points
just for signing your name, you know?

1058
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:43,503
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

1059
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,625
-Hi, what can I get for you today?
-Hey, sweetie, can I get a two--

1060
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,330
two chocolate covered doughnuts
and a medium coffee?

1061
00:56:51,415 --> 00:56:52,417
All right.

1062
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,486
Good afternoon, sir.

1063
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,096
You're crazy. You know that?

1064
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:04,940
You could have just
waited till now, you know?

1065
00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:06,893
Where is the fun in that?

1066
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:13,593
Come here.

1067
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:36,262
Yo, Lonnie.

1068
00:57:37,347 --> 00:57:38,394
Wait up.

1069
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,625
What's up, man?

1070
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,195
What up, Big dog?
Where are you going?

1071
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,468
Man, some errands.
I got to go to the mall, stuff like that.

1072
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,782
Cool. I'm rolling with you.

1073
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:51,005
Just warning, man.
I'm gonna be gone all day.

1074
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,296
Just, so--

1075
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:53,701
If you don't wanna go, I mean--

1076
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:56,169
Whatever. I just gotta get
the fuck out of here. Let's go.

1077
00:57:56,254 --> 00:57:57,430
She's smoking hot.

1078
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,960
She made the first move.

1079
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:01,570
She's got no dad and here's the kicker.

1080
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:04,241
She lets me sell weed to
the hardhats at her work.

1081
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:06,772
I mean does it get any better than this?

1082
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:11,260
I didn't know you served.

1083
00:58:11,345 --> 00:58:13,904
Uh, oh yeah. Yeah, I did, man.

1084
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:17,560
Thank you for your service.

1085
00:58:17,645 --> 00:58:19,373
Yeah, man. No problem,

1086
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:27,250
Man, this place ain't changed
much in 15 years, Lonnie.

1087
00:58:27,335 --> 00:58:28,505
Yeah, I know for real, man.

1088
00:58:28,595 --> 00:58:29,680
Hey, um--

1089
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,814
I think I'm gonna be hanging
out over here for a while. Okay?

1090
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:34,821
Okay. Yeah. I'll meet you
back here in 30. All right?

1091
00:58:34,906 --> 00:58:35,740
-30 minutes?
-Yeah.

1092
00:58:35,825 --> 00:58:37,000
All right. Sounds good.

1093
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:06,227
Oh, come on, it's--

1094
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:12,922
So what's this one then?

1095
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,513
Uh, that's the one I got when
I was in Afghanistan and uh,

1096
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:18,490
that's from my three tours in Iraq.

1097
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:21,303
Bullshit. You're not even
wearing the proper infantry uniform.

1098
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:23,879
Well, yeah, of course I am.

1099
00:59:27,785 --> 00:59:30,470
What's the army uniform regulation,
the code?

1100
00:59:31,222 --> 00:59:35,120
Uh, to do my best, to do my duty
and to serve my country?

1101
00:59:36,065 --> 00:59:38,331
You sure it's not AR 670-1.

1102
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:43,870
Uh, you guys know-- there's a lot
of different codes in the military.

1103
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,150
Stolen valor right here, folks.

1104
00:59:46,235 --> 00:59:47,645
This man is not a veteran.

1105
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,570
He's a fake and a fraud.

1106
00:59:49,655 --> 00:59:51,310
Give me those back. Those are mine.

1107
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:52,480
We'll take your jacket off.

1108
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:54,549
This is bullshit.
What do I have to do to convince y'all--

1109
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:56,525
Take it off or I'm gonna
fucking kick your ass.

1110
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:03,837
Hey, man.

1111
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,045
Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.

1112
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,434
Wait, what?

1113
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,565
Really? I would think someone in your
position would know what that means.

1114
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,665
Oh shit. Yeah, man, I--

1115
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,485
I kind of have like a full
bathroom mishap in there.

1116
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,430
Oh, man, little bathroom mishap.

1117
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:42,562
Oh, you sure you didn't
get pushed in the fountain?

1118
01:00:43,328 --> 01:00:44,218
Shit.

1119
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,145
-You fucking saw that, man?
-Dude, I saw the whole fucking thing, bro.

1120
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,345
You think I'm stupid?

1121
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,140
I can't be associated with that shit, bro.

1122
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:52,124
That's fucked up

1123
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:55,014
that you would let me be a part of
your fucking bullshit scheme, dude.

1124
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:55,945
I'm fucking pissed.

1125
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,499
Dude, what if someone recognized me?

1126
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,245
People know who the fuck I am, Dog.

1127
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,255
That's whack. You need help bro.

1128
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,936
It's fucking scandalous, dude.

1129
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:05,875
I'm sorry, man.

1130
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,010

That dope sure makes
you guys religious, huh?

1140
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,186
Just a friend.

1141
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,436
Seems like a very friendly friend.

1142
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:16,040
Yeah.

1143
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,421
It's whatever.

1144
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,413
So I blew him in Junior Prom.

1145
01:02:23,771 --> 01:02:24,891
At Junior prom?

1146
01:02:24,976 --> 01:02:27,670
No, not at, after. You know what I mean.

1147
01:02:27,755 --> 01:02:29,693
Anyways, I blew him in Junior Prom

1148
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:31,990
and ever since then
he's been clingy as fuck.

1149
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:33,567
Is he stalking you?

1150
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:35,672
No. No. We hated shit.

1151
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:38,075
You fucking him?

1152
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,199
When I feel like it.

1153
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:40,785
It's not like a real thing.

1154
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,277
This guy thinks you're dating.

1155
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:46,731
-No.
-Raylee, I need need you inside.

1156
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:49,551
-Okay.
-And I told you not to smoke in front.

1157
01:02:50,445 --> 01:02:51,401
Sorry.

1158
01:02:52,155 --> 01:02:53,968
So you're going to keep fucking him?

1159
01:02:54,053 --> 01:02:55,147
That depends.

1160
01:02:55,722 --> 01:02:56,778
Does he know that?

1161
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,881
Alright. What's this guy's name?

1162
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,475
Nash.

1163
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,584
Nash?

1164
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,605
Alright, look.

1165
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:08,005
I think it's time Nash got it
that you guys aren't dating.

1166
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,085
Come on.

1167
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,315
Wait. What?

1168
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:13,871
God. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is insane.

1169
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,680
I can't believe we're
doing this right now.

1170
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,315
Like maybe it's not such
a good idea, you know?

1171
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,658
It will be quick and easy.

1172
01:03:20,743 --> 01:03:22,105
He'll get the message.

1173
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,785
Okay. No fighting. Okay?

1174
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,135
I just wanna talk to him.

1175
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,253
You promise?

1176
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:30,237
This is crazy.

1177
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,589
Now what?

1178
01:03:35,674 --> 01:03:37,182
Is this the house?

1179
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:40,073
Oh my God.

1180
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,658
Wow. That's his mom?

1181
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,666
Hello, ma'am. Would you be so kind
as to send Nash out, please?

1182
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,018
Hi, Mrs. Parker.

1183
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,409
Nice necklace, fucking dork.

1184
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,831
What is this? What's going on?

1185
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:20,845
Hey buddy. I hate to be the bearer of
bad news, but you ain't with Strawberry.

1186
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:24,101
You never were. She's with me now.
You understand?

1187
01:04:24,186 --> 01:04:25,321
Raylee, what is this?

1188
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:27,211
I've been tryna tell you, Nash.

1189
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,961
All right. Look, bro, so you're not
gonna call her, not gonna text her.

1190
01:04:30,046 --> 01:04:32,304
You're not going to go by the
Donut Hole anymore. You understand me?

1191
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:34,069
Raylee, come on, I need to talk to you.

1192
01:04:34,154 --> 01:04:35,161
Whoa, whoa--

1193
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,733
Hold on. Hold on.

1194
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,905
Whoa, hey, no fighting. Okay?

1195
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,570
Just stay in the car, babe.

1196
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:42,580
All right. Come here. Google me.

1197
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:45,176
Take out your phone right now
and Google Mikey Saber.

1198
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:46,570
Do it.
You got your phone on you?

1199
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,326
What the fuck are you talking about?

1200
01:04:48,411 --> 01:04:49,900
-No fighting.
-Babe. It's okay.

1201
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,570
20.1 million views on PornHub, bro.

1202
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:53,710
I'm not fucking with you.

1203
01:04:53,795 --> 01:04:55,451
Strawberry's in a different league now.

1204
01:04:55,536 --> 01:04:56,505
Do you understand me?

1205
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,973
You can't compete with someone that fucked
1300 bitches. Do you get what I'm saying?

1206
01:05:00,058 --> 01:05:01,433
Hey, let's not cause a scene.

1207
01:05:02,025 --> 01:05:03,618
What are you doing? Who is this?

1208
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:05,173
-Come on.
-I'm with him now.

1209
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:07,019
You heard it from her mouth.
She's with me.

1210
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:08,200
Are you serious?

1211
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:10,150
-Come on.
-I'm sorry, dude.

1212
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:11,907
-It was fun though.
-It wasn't fun.

1213
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,678
Oh my God.

1214
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:32,374
I'll see you tomorrow.

1215
01:05:33,257 --> 01:05:34,608
Yeah. You will.

1216
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:00,883
Life's sweet, Sophie, life is sweet.

1217
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:09,352
X equals negative B plus minus the square
root of B squared minus four C all over to A.

1218
01:06:09,437 --> 01:06:11,273
What-- that's geometry?

1219
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:12,845
Algebra.

1220
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:16,430
Shit.

1221
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:18,821
All right. Relax.

1222
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:20,500
No. That's Nash.

1223
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:22,799
That's Nash? Shit.

1224
01:06:22,884 --> 01:06:25,251
I think this time I had a man to man
with this kid.

1225
01:06:25,336 --> 01:06:26,170
No fighting.

1226
01:06:26,727 --> 01:06:28,750
You know what,
I'm tired of your fucking shit, bro.

1227
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:30,875
I'm not afraid to fight you.
I don't give a fuck.

1228
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:34,360
What? This is your mommy and daddy.
You brought them to the dance.

1229
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:36,905
You can't handle your shit
by yourself, huh, tough guy?

1230
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,570
Sir, your son is fucking with
my girlfriend. It ain't cool any--

1231
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:47,703
No. Stop.

1232
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:49,660
Fuck. Nash, what the fuck?

1233
01:06:49,745 --> 01:06:51,100
I'm not with you anymore.

1234
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:54,864
-Fuck you. You cheated on me.
-No, I didn't. We were never together. No.

1235
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,928
You go in my home, threatening
my son motherfucker?

1236
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,841
Really took three of you to
fuck me up. You're a pussy.

1237
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,135
What are you talking about? What do
you mean you're not with him anymore?

1238
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,125
From the start I fucking said I
never wanted to be with you.

1239
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,930
It was like a casual fucking thing.

1240
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:06,759
Fuck that shit you wanted me.

1241
01:07:06,844 --> 01:07:08,650
-You're a little slut.
-No--

1242
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:09,978
You're a fucking slut.

1243
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:11,821
Hey, don't call my momma that.

1244
01:07:11,906 --> 01:07:13,690
-What the fuck?
-You ain't got nothing to say?

1245
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:16,829
You come near my house again,
you'll be leaving in a body bag, bitch.

1246
01:07:16,914 --> 01:07:18,430
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1247
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:19,914
He should go to the hospital.

1248
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,759
Yeah, maybe you
should go to the hospital.

1249
01:07:21,844 --> 01:07:22,985
No. It's not that bad.

1250
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,995
And plus I don't have health insurance
anyway but thank you, Miss Phan.

1251
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,715
-Okay. Now, stop moving.
-Alright.

1252
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,760
-There's no fighting in my parking lot.
-He flat out sucker punched me.

1253
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:34,105
I would have hundred percent
out cardio that guy.

1254
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:35,721
Fuck. Sorry for swearing.

1255
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,950
Oh shit.

1256
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,891
Be careful. That's where he kicked me.

1257
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:44,149
That's where he kicked me.
That fucking little bitch.

1258
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:49,171
Shit. Am I bleeding on my head? Fuck.

1259
01:07:56,404 --> 01:07:58,224
We both gonna be hurting tomorrow.

1260
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:00,248
Why is that?

1261
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,536
Let's just say you're blessed.

1262
01:08:05,365 --> 01:08:08,545
Yeah.
I can't believe I'm attracted to a ginger.

1263
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,591
You're not allowed to use the G word.

1264
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,397
You have a type?

1265
01:08:14,482 --> 01:08:15,482
Maybe.

1266
01:08:16,794 --> 01:08:17,638
What's your type?

1267
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:22,780
Let's just say, I like men, not boys.

1268
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:49,744
Oh, I'm sorry.

1269
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:51,920
I think I have the wrong house.

1270
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,979
Yeah. Cause I saw you parked
in front of my house last night, too.

1271
01:08:56,585 --> 01:08:58,835
No, it's as simple mistake.
I'm new in town.

1272
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,330
If I see you around here again--

1273
01:09:00,425 --> 01:09:02,795
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

1274
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,634
Honestly, if shit was different,

1275
01:09:27,718 --> 01:09:29,421
I could take over the industry with her.

1276
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,806
You think so?

1277
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:33,765
Yeah, within six months I could
see her nabbing best newcomer.

1278
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,624
One year and she would sweep the AVNs.

1279
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:37,209
Tori Black-- you know who Tori Black is?

1280
01:09:37,294 --> 01:09:39,514
Yeah, man, of course,
I know Tori Black is.

1281
01:09:39,599 --> 01:09:42,125
Uh, she won performer of the year,
two years back to back. Right?

1282
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:44,290
I think that Strawberry's
got the potential.

1283
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,600
I'm not exaggerating.
I really believe this.

1284
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,430
I think-- I think she could
win three years in a row

1285
01:09:49,514 --> 01:09:51,356
with my guidance, of course.

1286
01:09:55,305 --> 01:09:57,942
Doesn't matter.
I'm stuck in this shit hole anyway.

1287
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,630
Yeah, man, it's gonna be kinda awkward,
anyway.

1288
01:10:01,715 --> 01:10:04,371
She's gonna have to bang all those
other fucking guys on scene.

1289
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:06,190
I don't give a fuck.

1290
01:10:06,275 --> 01:10:08,350
I'll be fucking other bitches, bro.

1291
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:09,400
Come on.

1292
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:11,050
I think it's hot. I don't care.

1293
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,177
Okay, man.

1294
01:10:14,135 --> 01:10:15,731
Seriously, it's part of the game.

1295
01:10:17,787 --> 01:10:18,950
That was nice.

1296
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:30,805
You wanna explain those bruises?

1297
01:10:33,138 --> 01:10:34,614
I fell off my bike.

1298
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:42,474
Must have been a hard fall.

1299
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,552
This is eight, I need 10.

1300
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:13,465
I'm moving a lot of weight
for you guys. Huh?

1301
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,695
I like those gold teeth.

1302
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,667
I got one dia-- I got one diamond
I had my dentist in Cali put in. So--

1303
01:11:27,969 --> 01:11:29,891
You need to get your ass outta here, man.

1304
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:34,071
All right. Say hi to your mom for me.

1305
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,374
These refinery boys are the best.

1306
01:11:58,459 --> 01:12:02,297
They buy way more weed than these
skaters and dancers I gotta deal with.

1307
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,786
-Dancers?
-Yeah, from the titty bar.

1308
01:12:05,294 --> 01:12:06,204
Strippers.

1309
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:08,419
They prefer the term dancers.

1310
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:10,575
Young lady, show some respect.

1311
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:11,605
Okay.

1312
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:12,775
Topless dancers.

1313
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,869
Oh, bottomless too, when they got it off.

1314
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:16,345
Really?

1315
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,824
Yeah. You've never been?

1316
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:20,850
Why would I've been? Plus,
I'm not even old enough to get in.

1317
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,541
You wanna go?

1318
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:24,714
Seriously?

1319
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:32,206
Hello.

1320
01:12:32,886 --> 01:12:34,980
-How old is she?
-18.

1321
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:36,698
20 bucks.

1322
01:12:38,072 --> 01:12:39,956
You are hotter than
all of these girls combined.

1323
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:43,448
If you worked here,
they'd be outta their job.

1324
01:12:44,675 --> 01:12:45,792
You give a tip?

1325
01:12:46,503 --> 01:12:48,182
Give it to them. It's fine. Go.

1326
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:24,545
Right here. Right here.

1327
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,069
-Here?
-Yeah. Go in there.

1328
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,233
Just gotta get some milk.

1329
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,469
Well,

1330
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:38,144
Goodnight.

1331
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:40,970
I can-- I can wait
and drive you all the way home.

1332
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:42,140
Oh no, it's okay.

1333
01:13:42,225 --> 01:13:44,221
I like to ride my bike at night.

1334
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:45,273
Okay.

1335
01:13:46,773 --> 01:13:49,190
But technically that was our first date.

1336
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:52,888
So you just brought me to a strip joint
for our first date.

1337
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,040
-Real classy.
-Ooh, snap.

1338
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:58,635
Well, I guess we got to do it again.

1339
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,554
You wanna go to the pier Friday night?

1340
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,190
Pete's liver and onions at Louie's.

1341
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:05,376
I love Louie's.

1342
01:14:38,812 --> 01:14:40,038
Daddy wanna play?

1343
01:14:40,123 --> 01:14:42,234
I don't know if I'm feeling it.

1344
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:43,983
I can feel it.

1345
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:47,483
-Just not--
-Nice and fast.

1346
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:50,023
I don't think it's happening today.

1347
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:54,007
Don't you wanna get in me?

1348
01:14:54,372 --> 01:14:56,858
Yeah. Don't you wanna get in this pussy?

1349
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:59,507
I don't feel it. I'm sorry,
I'm just not feeling it.

1350
01:14:59,592 --> 01:15:01,817
Jesus Christ. Okay. Okay.

1351
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:03,771
What?

1352
01:15:03,856 --> 01:15:07,763
It's fine. Whatever,
I didn't want to anyway.

1353
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:24,406
Lonnie.

1354
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:26,711
Lonnie.

1355
01:15:27,547 --> 01:15:28,742
Lonnie.

1356
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:34,688
Don't be tied up all day.

1357
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,593
-Hey, Lonnie-kanes.
-Hey, Lexi. What's up?

1358
01:15:40,678 --> 01:15:43,211
Not much. What are you doing?

1359
01:15:43,296 --> 01:15:45,421
Ah, you know,
working around with the old man.

1360
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:46,367
Nice.

1361
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:47,600
Same shit different day.

1362
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:48,913
I know. I know.

1363
01:15:48,998 --> 01:15:50,202
What are you doing?

1364
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:52,288
I'm just-- you know, getting some air.

1365
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:54,077
Some sunshine.

1366
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,545
So you and Mike have
been hanging out, huh?

1367
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,767
Yeah. It's been fun having him in town.

1368
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:01,637
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1369
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:05,285
Is he giving you money for
all those rides you giving him?

1370
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:07,115
No.

1371
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,915
I mean, I don't mind we're buds.

1372
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,221
I know y'all don't got
one set of wheels right now. So--

1373
01:16:11,306 --> 01:16:13,394
No, we don't. Not right now.

1374
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,067
-You've been working out?
-No.

1375
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:23,398
-You look good.
-Thanks.

1376
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,138
You're sure you haven't been working out?

1377
01:16:25,223 --> 01:16:26,326
I'm positive.

1378
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:29,357
Can't call you scrawny
Lonnie no more. Can they?

1379
01:16:33,498 --> 01:16:36,256
-You keep Mikey out of trouble, you hear?
-I'll try.

1380
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:38,903
I know you will.

1381
01:16:40,615 --> 01:16:42,755
-It was good seeing you.
-Good seeing you. Take care.

1382
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:49,587
There's a lot of rides.
We could do the roller coaster.

1383
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,150
I'm not tall enough.
I think it's like 48 inches or whatever.

1384
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:56,212
I'll give you a 48 inches all day long.

1385
01:16:56,297 --> 01:16:58,337
I'm sorry, that was too easy.

1386
01:16:58,422 --> 01:17:01,134
But I got you, it's like, if
you get scared, just grab on something.

1387
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:02,367
I'll hold your hand.

1388
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:06,909
So after this, are you gonna
fuck me on to the boardwalk?

1389
01:17:07,867 --> 01:17:10,102
You sexy little exhibitionist,
you know that?

1390
01:17:10,187 --> 01:17:11,399
Look who is talking.

1391
01:17:12,156 --> 01:17:13,523
Wait. What do you mean?

1392
01:17:14,274 --> 01:17:15,531
You know what I mean.

1393
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:17,633
Mr. Saber.

1394
01:17:31,851 --> 01:17:33,359
Oh my God.

1395
01:17:36,739 --> 01:17:38,695
The second I broke up with Nash

1396
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:42,301
my Facebook blew up with
everyone and their fucking grandmas

1397
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:44,205
sending me links to your videos.

1398
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:47,629
And you're cool with it?

1399
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,761
Would I be here if I gave a shit?

1400
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,909
I actually think it's kind of dope.

1401
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,011
I think it's cool. You just said:

1402
01:17:57,096 --> 01:17:58,060
Fuck it.

1403
01:17:58,145 --> 01:18:00,880
I'm going to get paid for
doing the thing I love most.

1404
01:18:00,965 --> 01:18:04,299
And as long as you're not hurting anybody,
you do you, man.

1405
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:08,510
But if you give me something,
I swear to fucking God.

1406
01:18:08,595 --> 01:18:11,885
Thus porn folks are most
tested people on the whole planet.

1407
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:14,931
I mean, think about it.
We gotta get tested to work, you know.

1408
01:18:15,016 --> 01:18:18,930
-Maybe I gave you something.
-Oh, don't even kid.

1409
01:18:21,157 --> 01:18:22,782
I posted a nude online once.

1410
01:18:24,109 --> 01:18:26,319
I can never tell if you're joking
or if you're serious.

1411
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:31,636
My friends and I were messing around
and that subreddit gone wild.

1412
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,544
We were just trying to see how
much attention we could gain

1413
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:35,780
and we weren't even naked.

1414
01:18:35,865 --> 01:18:37,919
We had like our stuffed
animals like that, you know?

1415
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:40,300
But this old guy in Ohio

1416
01:18:40,385 --> 01:18:42,605
propositioned us to sell the nude pic.

1417
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:45,051
And I did. And he Venmo-ed me 60 bucks.

1418
01:18:46,299 --> 01:18:47,408
60 bucks?

1419
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:49,190
You're a bad, bad girl.

1420
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:50,502
The 60 bucks ain't shit.

1421
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:52,252
You should get at least double that.

1422
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,539
Were you planning on never telling me?

1423
01:18:55,624 --> 01:18:56,478
Yeah.

1424
01:18:57,124 --> 01:18:59,780
It's not something you drop on a civilian.

1425
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:02,835
A civilian. Is that what I am?

1426
01:19:04,034 --> 01:19:07,217
Yeah, you don't have to be.

1427
01:19:08,101 --> 01:19:09,155
For real?

1428
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:12,866
Look. I'm gonna be straight with you.

1429
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:17,959
I've been in the business
almost 20 years and nobody,

1430
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:20,614
nobody comes close to you.

1431
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:24,789
Straight up,
you could be a huge star, I'm just saying.

1432
01:19:26,148 --> 01:19:27,211
You are funny.

1433
01:19:29,855 --> 01:19:34,264
Look, I'm already about to have
a very awkward senior year.

1434
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,043
I'm not about to have a very
awkward rest of my life.

1435
01:20:11,454 --> 01:20:12,677
Hey.

1436
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,825
Hey Mikey, how are you doing?

1437
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:19,525
I'm good.
What are you doing here?

1438
01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:24,355
Just catching up with Lil and Lexi.
Catching up on some old stuff.

1439
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,490
Shooting the breeze.

1440
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:26,535
Sounds like it.

1441
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,767
Let me know next time.

1442
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:29,395
I'll make some steaks.

1443
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,602
Hang out with you guys.

1444
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,635
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

1445
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,651
Sound like a plan.

1446
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,230
Ladies, I'mma get up outta here.

1447
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,320
It's getting late, but
your hospitality was good.

1448
01:20:39,405 --> 01:20:41,295
The conversation was boss.

1449
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,663
-See you.
-Absolutely.

1450
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:45,724
See you again, Lily.

1451
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:47,406
-My baby.
-Please come back.

1452
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,826
I will. I will.

1453
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,295
-Take care of yourself, baby girl.
-You too.

1454
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,963
All right.
Mikey, I'm sure, I'll see you soon.

1455
01:20:55,048 --> 01:20:56,076
Yep. You will.

1456
01:20:57,193 --> 01:20:58,045
Good night.

1457
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:59,247
God bless you.

1458
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:06,957
Did it come through?

1459
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,917
<i>Yeah. Bullshit.</i>

1460
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:10,255
You see her?

1461
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:12,263
She's fucking smoking, right?

1462
01:21:12,348 --> 01:21:13,879
You're not going to believe this dude.

1463
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,387
Her name is Strawberry.

1464
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,785
<i>-What?</i>
-Fucking strawberry.

1465
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:19,465
You can't make this shit up, man.

1466
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,049
Yeah. Has there even been
a strawberry before?

1467
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,260
Oh, she's my way back in, man.

1468
01:21:24,345 --> 01:21:28,470
I'm telling you, this is like a Jenna
Jamieson, Sasha Grey level find here.

1469
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,130
Fuck. I'm blessed.
I'm so fucking blessed.

1470
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,685
See, this is my talent.

1471
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:35,635
I could be a bad-ass scout.

1472
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,618
I got my finger on the pulse
of next generation, baby.

1473
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,155
How you know she's gonna be
down for this, man?

1474
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,155
Oh, she's down.
Trust me. She's down.

1475
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,177
Plus, she sucks on my fingers
while I'm fucking her, bro.

1476
01:21:47,506 --> 01:21:49,615
-Oh yeah? That's cool.
-Yeah. That's cool.

1477
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,865
You know what that means?

1478
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:52,521
She likes fingers.

1479
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:53,715
You're so cute.

1480
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:58,137
Means she likes having a Dick in her mouth
while getting fucked.

1481
01:21:58,222 --> 01:21:59,545
It's a tell-a-tell sign, bro.

1482
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,834
-Oh yeah.
-Yeah.

1483
01:22:00,919 --> 01:22:02,950
Anytime a girl puts something
in her mouth while fucking

1484
01:22:03,035 --> 01:22:04,755
either they're familiar with that scenario

1485
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,655
or they're intrigued by that scenario.

1486
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,708
Think about it, man.

1487
01:22:07,793 --> 01:22:08,668
It's just logic.

1488
01:22:08,753 --> 01:22:10,045
I never thought about it that way.

1489
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,220
Yeah man. You know, that's what Lexi did.

1490
01:22:12,305 --> 01:22:14,815
When he first started dating,
Lexi would suck on my fingers

1491
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:15,865
while I was fucking her.

1492
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,380
That's what schooled me to the knowledge
that she had slept with

1493
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:19,932
more than one dude at a time before.

1494
01:22:20,017 --> 01:22:21,322
So when I proposed a threesome,

1495
01:22:21,406 --> 01:22:23,559
she was in, she didn't fight it,
she fucking loved it.

1496
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:25,114
-Huh?
-Yeah.

1497
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:30,184
Well, what do you think Lexi is
gonna think about all this though?

1498
01:22:30,764 --> 01:22:33,954
Dude, Lexi's the bane of my
fucking existence, man.

1499
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:36,514
Everything that's gone wrong
in my life for the last 15 years,

1500
01:22:36,599 --> 01:22:38,382
pretty much steps back to her.

1501
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:41,784
I've forgiven her over and over again.

1502
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,970
I overlooked so much shit in the name
of forgiveness.

1503
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:45,845
But it doesn't matter.
She always fucks me--

1504
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,189
Hey, how you doing, sir?

1505
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:56,755
Go look up the Lexi Lane Ashley Blue
gang-bang. In the end I'm fucking Ashley.

1506
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,164
So I wasn't paying attention.

1507
01:22:58,249 --> 01:23:00,725
Lexi starts badmouthing me
to the male talent on camera

1508
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,788
saying that I'm limp dick and shit,
and that's a total fucking lie.

1509
01:23:02,873 --> 01:23:04,284
Of course I can get it up. Right?

1510
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:06,385
I didn't know this until
the fucking DVD came out.

1511
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,032
I wanted to knock that bitch out.

1512
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:09,800
Anyway, don't say shit.
That stays between us.

1513
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:11,783
-I got you brother.
-You got the next set.

1514
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:16,283
-Here is your tip.
-Thank you.

1515
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:20,439
So I joined your Pornhub page.

1516
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:24,654
-You watching my scenes?
-Checked out a few.

1517
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:26,744
I watched the one you won best oral for.

1518
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:28,345
Yeah?

1519
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,024
Yeah.

1520
01:23:30,109 --> 01:23:32,525
Not that it's not hot
watching you, but like--

1521
01:23:33,111 --> 01:23:33,954
Yeah?

1522
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:38,345
So the girl plus all
the guys she's blown--

1523
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:42,930
Hello, Mr. Mikey.

1524
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:43,921
Hi, Ms. Phan.

1525
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:47,065
Uh, I swept outside
and watered the plant for you.

1526
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:48,072
Great.

1527
01:23:51,132 --> 01:23:54,985
So the girl plus all the guys
she's blowing win the award?

1528
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,005
Right.

1529
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:57,955
But we all share it, the award.

1530
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,644
Okay. But like she's on her
knees blowing the line of guys.

1531
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:03,143
It's like her scene.

1532
01:24:03,228 --> 01:24:05,125
Why are you winning an award for it?

1533
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,436
Okay, well. That's up for discussion.

1534
01:24:08,397 --> 01:24:10,135
Anyway you shouldn't be
watching that stuff.

1535
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,920
You know, just pretend it doesn't exist.
Don't watch that stuff.

1536
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,915
It's not good.

1537
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,462
I'm sorry.

1538
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,665
-Did I hurt your feelings?
-No, it's okay.

1539
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,938
Sorry. I should've asked
if it was okay if I watched.

1540
01:24:27,305 --> 01:24:29,800
Check out the Fast &
the Furry-Ass paradise.

1541
01:24:29,885 --> 01:24:33,275
-Are you serious?
-Hell yeah. Fast & Furry-Ass.

1542
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:35,830
Yeah. I love it.

1543
01:24:35,915 --> 01:24:39,835
Love it. Right? I play Brian O'Connor,
that's Paul Walker's character.

1544
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,570
And my acting was next level, seriously.
I mean, my scenes were miles above

1545
01:24:43,655 --> 01:24:44,585
the other scenes.

1546
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:47,591
To this day, people tweet me like
oh you were the perfect O'Connor.

1547
01:24:48,275 --> 01:24:52,929
I was actually even nominated for that
role, best supporting actor in a parody.

1548
01:24:53,013 --> 01:24:54,122
But I didn't win.

1549
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:55,750
It was a big snap of the night.

1550
01:24:55,835 --> 01:24:58,030
It was booze and everything.
It was crazy.

1551
01:24:58,115 --> 01:25:00,845
And then Paul Walker goes
and gets himself killed,

1552
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:04,788
which is such a bummer because
then I'm fucked out of the sequels.

1553
01:25:05,374 --> 01:25:07,046
-That sucks.
-Yeah.

1554
01:25:07,577 --> 01:25:08,492
So--

1555
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:12,476
You wanna come over this weekend?

1556
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,561
Come over. What? To your place?

1557
01:25:15,646 --> 01:25:17,656
Yeah. We could spend Saturday night there.

1558
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:19,865
No, no. I'm not into the
whole meet the parents.

1559
01:25:20,951 --> 01:25:22,679
You think that I'd introduce you
to my mom?

1560
01:25:22,763 --> 01:25:25,325
Are you fucking kidding me?
No. God, no, no.

1561
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:26,340
She'll be out of town.

1562
01:25:26,849 --> 01:25:28,224
She got a new boyfriend

1563
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:30,550
and they're going to Houston
to fuck themselves silly.

1564
01:25:30,635 --> 01:25:34,762
So we got the place to our own,
to fuck ourselves even sillier.

1565
01:25:41,255 --> 01:25:42,549
-Mikey?
-Yeah.

1566
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:46,073
You haven't even asked about Eric once.

1567
01:25:48,345 --> 01:25:50,377
You got my Facebook message
when it happened.

1568
01:25:50,462 --> 01:25:51,674
We chatted.

1569
01:25:56,525 --> 01:25:58,505
My heart goes out to you.
It was a terrible thing.

1570
01:26:04,815 --> 01:26:05,705
So--

1571
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:08,994
any word on your getting
custody or whatever?

1572
01:26:11,555 --> 01:26:12,417
Yeah.

1573
01:26:13,505 --> 01:26:15,385
Well, I was thinking--

1574
01:26:16,151 --> 01:26:17,917
I have a maintenance CPS next week.

1575
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:21,617
And I was thinking
you could come with me.

1576
01:26:21,701 --> 01:26:23,971
And we could tell the caseworker.

1577
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:27,796
Her name's Marianne. She's real nice.
And she's trying to help me out.

1578
01:26:28,565 --> 01:26:31,870
And we could tell her about
how things are going well here.

1579
01:26:31,955 --> 01:26:32,972
And you know--

1580
01:26:34,116 --> 01:26:36,634
like you and me and all.

1581
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:40,385
Because I mean--

1582
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:44,667
if things are going well here, you
and me and all, and I get clean test--

1583
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:45,889
And that's gonna happen?

1584
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:48,118
No wonder they took him.

1585
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,461
You right back to where you were,
and over it all over again.

1586
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:54,002
Where's his dad in all this shit anyway?

1587
01:26:54,087 --> 01:26:56,187
Why doesn't he step
the fuck up? Seriously.

1588
01:26:59,163 --> 01:27:01,764
Better yet, why doesn't Leondria
go with you being that

1589
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,709
she's so concerned with
our fucking business?

1590
01:27:04,834 --> 01:27:06,302
You know what? Fuck this place.

1591
01:27:07,294 --> 01:27:09,177
I'm going to go watch TV with your mom.

1592
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,522
Don't judge. Okay?

1593
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:44,755
Uh, why would I do that?

1594
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,914
You're talking to a boy
who grew up in Texas City.

1595
01:27:46,999 --> 01:27:48,522
So I'm not going to judge anything.

1596
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:50,545
-This is it?
-Yeah.

1597
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,138
Oh, I take it back.

1598
01:27:53,222 --> 01:27:55,686
This place is a shit hole.
 Can you take me home please?

1599
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:00,624
All right. Ta-da.

1600
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:02,755
Wow. Luxurious.

1601
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,455
Can't smoke in here by the way.
My mom's trying to quit.

1602
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,432
That's okay.

1603
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,925
Is this you?

1604
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,119
Yeah.
That's the first selfie I ever took.

1605
01:28:12,494 --> 01:28:13,478
Vintage.

1606
01:28:13,999 --> 01:28:14,874
Do you want a Coke?

1607
01:28:14,959 --> 01:28:15,858
Yes.

1608
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,260
And that's your mom?

1609
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:24,378
Yep. And that's my grandma and
that's me and that's me and that's me.

1610
01:28:24,463 --> 01:28:26,454
Cute. What's back here?

1611
01:28:26,539 --> 01:28:27,685
Uh, that's my mom's room.

1612
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,111
I am right here.

1613
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,855
Wow.

1614
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,111
Wow.

1615
01:28:36,196 --> 01:28:37,158
Pink.

1616
01:28:38,174 --> 01:28:39,199
Pink.

1617
01:28:39,284 --> 01:28:41,049
It's supposed to make you
happy or something.

1618
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:42,151
Yeah.

1619
01:28:43,153 --> 01:28:44,112
Wow.

1620
01:28:50,645 --> 01:28:53,041
So tell your mom I'm moving in.

1621
01:28:58,184 --> 01:28:59,659
Do you feel the sunshine?

1622
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:04,168
By the way, what sign are you?

1623
01:29:06,356 --> 01:29:07,286
Why?

1624
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:12,034
I mean, I don't even believe in
astrology, but I'm just asking.

1625
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:14,879
A bad sign.

1626
01:29:16,655 --> 01:29:18,279
I don't believe in that shit either.

1627
01:29:18,364 --> 01:29:19,246
Yeah.

1628
01:29:26,555 --> 01:29:29,762
You know, before this place was about
black Gold, it was about black ivory?

1629
01:29:30,515 --> 01:29:32,110
Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

1630
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:33,265
I don't understand.

1631
01:29:34,211 --> 01:29:35,485
Slave trade, silly.

1632
01:29:36,142 --> 01:29:37,600
Slaves were sold here.

1633
01:29:37,685 --> 01:29:40,798
Something like famous French pirate
ran the show.

1634
01:29:41,614 --> 01:29:44,110
A French pirate?
I bet he had really good style.

1635
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:45,552
I bet he dressed good.

1636
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:46,987
When I was little,

1637
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:50,661
my mama would take me out here
and we'd go hunt the pirate booty.

1638
01:29:51,497 --> 01:29:53,231
I love pirate booty.

1639
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:54,583
Tell me more.

1640
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:58,942
I'm coming to get ya.

1641
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:18,415
This is prime Texas beef right here.

1642
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,685
This might be the one thing
this place has above LA.

1643
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:22,971
Besides you, of course.

1644
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,510
You're like an
extraterrestrial around here.

1645
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,180
And when I look at you,
I don't think Gulf coast.

1646
01:30:30,944 --> 01:30:33,024
Well, besides the sexy draw.

1647
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:34,610
Jerk, it's not that bad.

1648
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:35,809
It's pretty bad.

1649
01:30:35,894 --> 01:30:37,435
Stop making fun of me.

1650
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,050
I'm not, I had one but I lost it.

1651
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:43,425
After living in LA for a while,
you lose it and

1652
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:44,804
I remember being at work.

1653
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:47,053
when I first got there and
these guys make fun of me,

1654
01:30:47,138 --> 01:30:48,541
cause I was like, hi, I'm Mikey.

1655
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:50,608
They all said
you sound like a dumb hick.

1656
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,017
So yeah, just lost it.

1657
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:57,220
Well, not a year or so
and I'm outta here.

1658
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,185
Why wait?

1659
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:00,740
I told you, mula.

1660
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,403
I didn't have any money when I left.

1661
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,890
I have no friends, no connections.

1662
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:08,801
I'll be your friend.

1663
01:31:09,612 --> 01:31:10,759
I'll be your connection.

1664
01:31:10,844 --> 01:31:12,065
Don't fuck with me.

1665
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:13,823
I'm not.

1666
01:31:31,964 --> 01:31:33,073
This is nice.

1667
01:31:35,213 --> 01:31:37,340
Hold up. Got an idea.

1668
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:43,255
Yo, what are you doing?

1669
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,521
Let's shoot a scene.

1670
01:31:44,606 --> 01:31:46,740
For us. Just for us.

1671
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,653
All right. If we do that,
we are using my phone.

1672
01:31:52,552 --> 01:31:54,385
Why? You don't trust me?

1673
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:56,575
You can lose your phone, motherfucker.

1674
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:58,636
You can lose your phone, motherfucker.

1675
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,183
Well. Then it would be on me.

1676
01:32:00,879 --> 01:32:02,082
True that.

1677
01:32:03,404 --> 01:32:04,889
Look at it.

1678
01:32:04,974 --> 01:32:06,085
You see that?

1679
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:07,279
See how good you are.

1680
01:32:08,466 --> 01:32:11,232
You film it. Here, take it.

1681
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:21,545
-It's so hot.
-I know.

1682
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:23,060
You're telling me.

1683
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,470
Look at that. You know how to play
to the camera and everything.

1684
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,094
You see how you make sure
your face is always seen.

1685
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,835
And you're aware of the camera.

1686
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:36,055
That's skill right there.

1687
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,040
That's crazy.

1688
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:42,011
If this doesn't show you that you
could be a star, I don't know what will.

1689
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:43,885
Do you really think so?

1690
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:44,865
I know so.

1691
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:49,139
I'm not into that swinger stuff though.

1692
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,355
Swinger stuff?

1693
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:55,820
Yeah. I like fucking you and I
don't want to fuck anybody else.

1694
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:58,670
And I don't want to think
about you fucking other girls.

1695
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,631
It would be just us.

1696
01:33:02,255 --> 01:33:03,815
It's called couple scenes.

1697
01:33:04,535 --> 01:33:08,585
It will be exclusive. Just me and you
getting paid to do what we just did.

1698
01:33:09,395 --> 01:33:12,515
Shit. You would've made $2,000
for that video right there.

1699
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,679
-How many times did you come?
-Three times.

1700
01:33:15,763 --> 01:33:18,335
You would have been paid
two grand to come three times.

1701
01:33:18,935 --> 01:33:21,489
I'm not that good at math,
but that's a really good deal.

1702
01:33:23,585 --> 01:33:25,347
I have to sleep on it but

1703
01:33:25,431 --> 01:33:27,962
it's not like I don't already
have the porn star name.

1704
01:33:28,047 --> 01:33:29,181
Right?

1705
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:33,813
You play?

1706
01:33:34,595 --> 01:33:36,110
No, I eat off of it.

1707
01:33:36,195 --> 01:33:37,368
Such a smart-ass.

1708
01:33:37,453 --> 01:33:40,062
Yeah. Since I was six.

1709
01:33:41,905 --> 01:33:43,422
You wanna play me something?

1710
01:33:43,507 --> 01:33:44,733
Are you gonna make me?

1711
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:46,913

So--

1731
01:35:29,131 --> 01:35:30,420
Where were you?

1732
01:35:33,544 --> 01:35:34,560
I texted you.

1733
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:36,286
I was gone for the weekend.

1734
01:35:38,982 --> 01:35:39,943
Yeah, I know.

1735
01:35:44,435 --> 01:35:46,115
That's not my question.

1736
01:35:47,795 --> 01:35:48,974
Where were you?

1737
01:35:51,818 --> 01:35:53,260
Are you serious right now?

1738
01:35:53,345 --> 01:35:54,911
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1739
01:35:55,966 --> 01:35:58,985
I was in this cute little town called
none of your fucking business, Texas.

1740
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,255
How about that's where I was?

1741
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:02,429
-Were you?
-Yeah.

1742
01:36:03,186 --> 01:36:05,968
Sounds like a lot of fun.
I hope you had a good fucking time.

1743
01:36:08,406 --> 01:36:09,913
What the fuck was that, huh?

1744
01:36:11,429 --> 01:36:13,505
Hey, Lil. Come get your daughter.

1745
01:36:14,437 --> 01:36:15,784
Mikey, go fuck yourself.

1746
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:17,187
Okay. Look. Look.

1747
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:18,164
Look.

1748
01:36:19,444 --> 01:36:21,369
I was making us money.
Okay?

1749
01:36:21,454 --> 01:36:25,150
I had to go down to Corpus Christi
to pick up some shit for us.

1750
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:28,657
-I don't believe you.
-You don't believe me?

1751
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,313
Four weeks ago I had zilch, huh?

1752
01:36:35,078 --> 01:36:36,279
Now I got 3K.

1753
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:37,510
Look at it.

1754
01:36:37,595 --> 01:36:38,675
Give me a fucking break.

1755
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,690
How long was the last time you had money
like that under your fucking roof? Huh?

1756
01:36:41,775 --> 01:36:45,640
Now, if you want me to keep paying
for rent and food, shut the fuck up.

1757
01:36:45,725 --> 01:36:47,564
And I'm not cleaning that shit up either.

1758
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:01,225
-She's in man. She's fucking in.
-Yeah. she's in?

1759
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:03,720
Yeah, but I'm still ironing
out the details, but guaranteed

1760
01:37:03,804 --> 01:37:06,954
I'll have her
shooting scenes by September, baby.

1761
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:08,386
That's pretty impressive though, man.

1762
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:11,185
Three weeks,
you convince the girl to do porn.

1763
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,634
Like what the fuck?

1764
01:37:13,372 --> 01:37:14,951
I couldn't convince my first girlfriend

1765
01:37:15,036 --> 01:37:17,618
to give me a blow job
for three fucking years.

1766
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:20,180
Hey man, what can I say, baby?

1767
01:37:20,265 --> 01:37:21,582
I'm good at what I do.

1768
01:37:22,965 --> 01:37:24,519
So that means you're gonna be leaving.

1769
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,004
Yeah, I'm leaving.

1770
01:37:26,690 --> 01:37:28,634
Well, when are you leaving?

1771
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,645
But basically I just need enough
to float us until she starts shooting.

1772
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:34,289
I'm thinking I can have that
by end of August. Easy.

1773
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,472
It's gonna suck for you to go.

1774
01:37:36,965 --> 01:37:39,746
I know, man. It's gonna suck,
not hanging with you anymore

1775
01:37:39,831 --> 01:37:42,074
Lonnie, you my guy, but dude

1776
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,969
I'm on top of my game right now
on like every single possible level.

1777
01:37:46,053 --> 01:37:48,400
Physical, stamina, my mind is sharp.

1778
01:37:48,485 --> 01:37:52,000
Now that I'm making money, I'm taking
5-HTP for serotonin in my brain.

1779
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:55,463
Dude, with my skill and ability
and my identic memory shit,

1780
01:37:55,547 --> 01:37:57,190
there's no denying what I could do.

1781
01:37:57,275 --> 01:37:59,023
The universe is on my side, bro.

1782
01:37:59,108 --> 01:38:00,070
Yeah.

1783
01:38:00,155 --> 01:38:04,240
Saber Entertainment's first
signed contract girl, Strawberry.

1784
01:38:04,325 --> 01:38:06,133
-Huh, you like that?
-I do. Yeah.

1785
01:38:06,218 --> 01:38:07,240
Just strawberry.

1786
01:38:07,325 --> 01:38:08,590
No need for anything fancy.

1787
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:11,679
All the biggest celebrities have one name,
Cher, Prince, Madonna

1788
01:38:11,763 --> 01:38:14,020
Oh. I'm getting an LLC
for Saber entertainment.

1789
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:14,967
Yeah.?

1790
01:38:15,052 --> 01:38:18,890
I had a DBA for Mikey Saber, but uh, I
didn't pay my annual fee, so it expired.

1791
01:38:18,975 --> 01:38:20,852
And I had a falling out with
my old business partner,

1792
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:23,009
but I do have Mike Saber trademarked.

1793
01:38:23,093 --> 01:38:24,359
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

1794
01:38:24,444 --> 01:38:26,950
Oh, it's gonna be a
big announcement at Adult Con, bro.

1795
01:38:27,035 --> 01:38:28,600
-Yeah?
-Yeah, dude.

1796
01:38:28,685 --> 01:38:31,769
You know what, that small town life
it's just ain't for me, man, no offense,

1797
01:38:31,853 --> 01:38:34,696
but like I'm a big
city guy, you know. Dude, if you want

1798
01:38:34,781 --> 01:38:37,300
I could hook you up with Leondria
so you can have my clientele.

1799
01:38:37,385 --> 01:38:38,789
-Hell yeah.
-Yeah.

1800
01:38:38,874 --> 01:38:41,112
I just don't want you selling
fucking flags for the rest of your life

1801
01:38:41,196 --> 01:38:41,740
you know what I mean?

1802
01:38:41,825 --> 01:38:43,489
Here's the exit right here, bro.

1803
01:38:43,574 --> 01:38:44,630
Oh shit.

1804
01:38:45,863 --> 01:38:47,800
Dude, we're fucked, dude, we're fucked.

1805
01:38:47,885 --> 01:38:49,060
I fucking know, man.

1806
01:38:49,145 --> 01:38:50,278
We're fucked.

1807
01:38:50,945 --> 01:38:54,190
Oh my God, Lonnie,
why did you fucking pull off like that?

1808
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:55,375
I didn't do anything, man,

1809
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:58,717
I just fucking took the turn like
you fucking asked me to, man.

1810
01:38:58,802 --> 01:39:01,338
Stop the car, man. Stop the fucking car.

1811
01:39:01,776 --> 01:39:02,822
Stop.

1812
01:39:04,595 --> 01:39:05,996
Where are you going?

1813
01:39:11,675 --> 01:39:15,189
Listen, listen, Russell, look at me.

1814
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:20,440
I was never with you. You don't know me.

1815
01:39:20,525 --> 01:39:22,454
I don't know you. This never happened.

1816
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:24,010
Are you listening to me?

1817
01:39:24,095 --> 01:39:25,180
What are we going to do?

1818
01:39:25,265 --> 01:39:26,999
We? You did this. Not me.

1819
01:39:27,815 --> 01:39:29,906
Look at me. You don't know me? Say it.

1820
01:39:29,991 --> 01:39:31,119
You don't know me. Say it.

1821
01:39:31,204 --> 01:39:32,593
I don't remember you, man.

1822
01:39:33,484 --> 01:39:34,671
Fuck.

1823
01:39:39,867 --> 01:39:42,437
Jesus Christ, what the fuck, Mikey?

1824
01:39:42,522 --> 01:39:43,398
Fuck.

1825
01:39:55,085 --> 01:39:57,185
-Mikey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm-- no, I'm fine.

1826
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:58,480
Yeah. I'm okay. Thanks.

1827
01:39:58,565 --> 01:40:01,160
-You scared the shit out of me.
-I just don't feel good.

1828
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:03,095
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah. Thank you.

1829
01:40:13,865 --> 01:40:16,930
According to authorities,
the 22 car pileup was caused by

1830
01:40:17,015 --> 01:40:19,030
a reckless driver that fled the scene.

1831
01:40:19,115 --> 01:40:21,575
I hope they find who's
responsible for this.

1832
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:23,169
Better not be a drunk driver.

1833
01:40:23,254 --> 01:40:24,857
Oh, they will find him.

1834
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:30,060
Told you some kind of CSI or something,
investigation.

1835
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:32,849
Can you guys keep it down?
I can't hear the--

1836
01:40:33,492 --> 01:40:35,742
Oh, I'm sorry, Mikey,
he gives a shit about it.

1837
01:40:35,827 --> 01:40:36,967
Shut up. I can't hear the announcer.

1838
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:40,060
I can't hear anything cause
you're talking. Jesus Christ.

1839
01:40:40,144 --> 01:40:43,515
<i>Witnesses say that the reckless
driver crossed from the far left lane</i>

1840
01:40:43,599 --> 01:40:46,685
<i>in front of a semi-truck
causing the truck to jack-knife</i>

1841
01:40:46,769 --> 01:40:50,841
<i>resulting in a chain reaction crash
that came out of nowhere.</i>

1842
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:55,144
Hey, how you doing?

1843
01:40:57,058 --> 01:40:59,058
Yeah, everything's good.

1844
01:41:00,005 --> 01:41:02,300
Uh, yeah, we're just watching the news.

1845
01:41:02,675 --> 01:41:04,085
Shit's crazy. Right?

1846
01:41:05,585 --> 01:41:06,448
I know.

1847
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:10,823
Um, look, some business stuff came up,
so I'm not sure I can make it tonight.

1848
01:41:12,235 --> 01:41:15,042
No, no, it's all good. Just some
business stuff I got to take care of.

1849
01:41:16,265 --> 01:41:17,156
Yeah.

1850
01:41:17,675 --> 01:41:18,780
Okay.

1851
01:41:18,865 --> 01:41:19,878
Okay. Bye.

1852
01:41:38,886 --> 01:41:41,266
Oh my God. There's fucking
cops outside of fucking Lonnie's.

1853
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:42,733
Someone's going down.

1854
01:41:43,492 --> 01:41:44,632
What?

1855
01:41:48,122 --> 01:41:49,939
The sheriff's here too.

1856
01:41:50,999 --> 01:41:52,055
Holy shit.

1857
01:41:55,415 --> 01:41:56,446
Oh my God, Ma, the news.

1858
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:59,030
Fucking news is here.
I'm gonna go check it out.

1859
01:41:59,544 --> 01:42:00,528
Wait.

1860
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:26,725
<i>Thank you, Nathan,
Texas city resident,</i>

1861
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:30,805
<i>Lonnie Hill is in custody
at the Galveston county jail.</i>

1862
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:33,775
<i>He is scheduled to make his
court appearance this afternoon--</i>

1863
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,005
Good morning.

1864
01:42:35,724 --> 01:42:36,583
Morning.

1865
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,389
-I'm gonna get some milk.
-Okay.

1866
01:43:00,446 --> 01:43:01,744
Watch your bike out there, man.

1867
01:43:09,813 --> 01:43:11,848
I spoke to the neighbor of the individual

1868
01:43:11,932 --> 01:43:14,423
allegedly responsible
for the incident last night.

1869
01:43:14,508 --> 01:43:16,040
But it's shocking.

1870
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:18,844
I mean, I have known him forever.

1871
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:20,571
They got him, man.

1872
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:22,766
Son of a bitch.

1873
01:43:23,344 --> 01:43:24,477
$3.

1874
01:43:26,062 --> 01:43:27,563
Great, great neighbor.

1875
01:43:30,953 --> 01:43:34,498
Hey. They've been playing
my interview all morning.

1876
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,520
I should've put on some makeup,
I look like shit.

1877
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:46,395
Mr. Hill has no prior convictions.

1878
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,005
However, this isn't his first run-in

1879
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:51,945
with the Galveston county
district attorney's office.

1880
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:56,837
In 2014, Mr. Hill had Stolen Valor
charges filed against him,

1881
01:43:56,921 --> 01:43:58,700
which were subsequently dropped.

1882
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:00,520
That's all for now.

1883
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:02,076
Lonnie's fucked.

1884
01:44:02,161 --> 01:44:04,669
<i>State Highway 146 in
Texas City remains closed</i>

1885
01:44:04,753 --> 01:44:07,674
<i>while cleanup crews continue to remove
wreckage from the southbound lanes.</i>

1886
01:44:12,173 --> 01:44:13,829
Michael, I'm fixing to make supper,

1887
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,439
What would you like?
Cinnamon --

1888
01:44:16,524 --> 01:44:17,978
or chicken pot steak?

1889
01:44:18,548 --> 01:44:20,079
I ain't hungry, Lil.

1890
01:44:20,164 --> 01:44:21,540
Suit yourself.

1891
01:44:31,258 --> 01:44:34,095
I'm just tied up at work with a
client for a little bit, but yeah,

1892
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,593
I should be able to meet up soon.

1893
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:40,515
The residence of Lonnie Hill,
the driver responsible for the

1894
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,345
chain reaction crash that took
place on highway 146 on Tuesday.

1895
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:48,515
We have not received any comments
from his family at this time.

1896
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,328
Okay. Let's do it again.

1897
01:44:53,234 --> 01:44:55,390
Yo, Lonnie's lawyer's talking.

1898
01:44:56,570 --> 01:45:01,975
<i>My client Lonnifer Hill will remain
in custody for the time being,</i>

1899
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:05,796
<i>but he is cooperating fully with the
Galveston county police department.</i>

1900
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:10,210
<i>My client has prepared a statement
that I would like to read.</i>

1901
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,796
<i>My era of judgment</i>

1902
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:18,950
<i>has led to irreversible ramifications
and I am deeply sorry</i>

1903
01:45:19,035 --> 01:45:21,350
<i>to those I've affected and hurt.</i>

1904
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:25,610
<i>I panicked and wrongfully
left a crash site.</i>

1905
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:32,128
<i>I take full responsibility for my
actions and will accept the consequences.</i>

1906
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,015
<i>Thank you.</i>

1907
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:37,672
<i>Three, the individuals who
sustained serious bodily injury</i>

1908
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:41,965
<i>remain under close observation
at John Sealy hospital.</i>

1909
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,545
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1910
01:45:44,491 --> 01:45:45,983
Sweet little Lonnie-kanes.

1911
01:45:46,694 --> 01:45:48,084
What did you do?

1912
01:46:09,622 --> 01:46:10,700
Thank you.

1913
01:46:11,723 --> 01:46:13,622
Oh my God.

1914
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:14,910
Okay.

1915
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,815
Thank you.

1916
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:21,895
Thank you.

1917
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:22,942
Thank--

1918
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:02,575
-Strawberry, our lives are about--
-Hello, stranger.

1919
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:03,745
Oh, sorry guys.

1920
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:04,689
Sorry, Ms. Phan.

1921
01:47:04,774 --> 01:47:07,142
Strawberry, I need to talk
to you outside now. Come.

1922
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:11,572
Look,

1923
01:47:11,657 --> 01:47:13,452
I've been doing some real soul searching.

1924
01:47:13,955 --> 01:47:16,045
That pile up that happened here
the other day

1925
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,575
that shit affected me.

1926
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,228
Life could change on a dime.

1927
01:47:19,313 --> 01:47:21,197
You could've been in one of those cars.

1928
01:47:21,282 --> 01:47:23,454
I could have been in one of those cars.

1929
01:47:23,539 --> 01:47:25,704
Life would be so different right now.

1930
01:47:25,789 --> 01:47:28,439
Look, I was going to wait
a few weeks to ask you.

1931
01:47:33,525 --> 01:47:35,119
-What?
-Are you proposing to me?

1932
01:47:35,204 --> 01:47:38,605
No. Chill. Look, we gotta get outta here.

1933
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:41,707
That shit that happened on 146,
that was a sign.

1934
01:47:41,792 --> 01:47:43,856
You do what makes you happy today

1935
01:47:43,941 --> 01:47:46,149
because there might not be a tomorrow.

1936
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:52,152
Look, I want you to celebrate
your 18th birthday in LA with me.

1937
01:47:52,237 --> 01:47:56,215
I want you to follow your destiny and
I wanna be right there next to you

1938
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:57,530
to help you follow it.

1939
01:47:58,249 --> 01:47:59,410
So what do you say?

1940
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,030
Let's start a new life together.

1941
01:48:02,115 --> 01:48:04,928
Get the fuck out of this
dead and shit hole town, okay?

1942
01:48:05,552 --> 01:48:06,583
You mean like now?

1943
01:48:07,099 --> 01:48:10,638
We'll leave tomorrow and
we'll be in LA by Monday, babe.

1944
01:48:10,723 --> 01:48:13,201
Oh my gosh, Mikey.

1945
01:48:13,756 --> 01:48:15,951
-I think I'm dreaming.
-Me too.

1946
01:48:18,169 --> 01:48:20,035
Ms. Phan, I have to quit.

1947
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,888
I love you guys
but I'm going to LA with Mikey.

1948
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:31,088
Thank you for all the
free donuts Ms. Phan.

1949
01:48:37,715 --> 01:48:40,209
So we're going to leave at 10:00 AM.
Okay?

1950
01:48:40,294 --> 01:48:42,495
I'm gonna get a car,
I'm gonna pick you up.

1951
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:43,570
You got a car?

1952
01:48:43,655 --> 01:48:44,975
Well, we'll get a taxi.

1953
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,614
I'm gonna have a taxi pick us up
and take us to this station.

1954
01:48:47,699 --> 01:48:50,374
And we're taking a bus to Hollywood baby.

1955
01:48:51,209 --> 01:48:52,119
Okay.

1956
01:48:52,204 --> 01:48:54,845
So just be packed and ready to
go at 10, but just bring one bag.

1957
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:57,389
Cause when we get to LA,
we're going to buy all new shit.

1958
01:49:00,626 --> 01:49:02,274
-Mikey?
-Yeah.

1959
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,626
You make me so happy.

1960
01:49:16,806 --> 01:49:18,235
-Hey.
-Hey.

1961
01:49:32,384 --> 01:49:33,446
Is Lil here?

1962
01:49:33,531 --> 01:49:34,813
She's sleeping.

1963
01:49:50,868 --> 01:49:52,501
It's been a crazy month, huh?

1964
01:49:53,267 --> 01:49:54,392
It sure is.

1965
01:49:55,024 --> 01:49:56,829
-Poor Lonnie.
-Oh God.

1966
01:49:56,914 --> 01:49:58,015
That's so fucked up.

1967
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,926
-I hope he's all right.
-Yeah. Me too.

1968
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:07,825
Yeah.

1969
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:10,649
It's just been so wild and we've
been fighting and all that stuff.

1970
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:17,965
-I'm not, I'm not really in the mood.
-Huh?

1971
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,589
I'm not really in the mood. I'm sorry.

1972
01:50:21,110 --> 01:50:22,285
-Yeah.
-Just saying.

1973
01:50:22,370 --> 01:50:23,549
-Okay.
-Okay.

1974
01:50:26,573 --> 01:50:29,378
It's been fighting a lot
with a lot of drama lately and

1975
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,609
we don't want to fight,
you know what I mean?

1976
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,088
I know you don't want that.
I don't want that.

1977
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:45,127
So yeah.

1978
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:50,003
Look, I'm--

1979
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:52,752
I'm just gonna tell you,

1980
01:50:52,837 --> 01:50:54,830
I'm going back to California
in the morning.

1981
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,557
So--

1982
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:06,925
-I mean--
-You're going back to California?

1983
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:07,947
Yeah.

1984
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,317
I got some work.

1985
01:51:11,535 --> 01:51:12,625
So that's good.

1986
01:51:12,710 --> 01:51:13,916
And--

1987
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:21,985
You know, this has not been going
good with us.

1988
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:25,160
It's so much drama, throwing
coffee pots. We don't need that.

1989
01:51:25,245 --> 01:51:28,573
You know, and, but this has been fun,

1990
01:51:29,245 --> 01:51:31,221
you know, we had some
good times, I know--

1991
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:37,838
It just feels like, uh, it just
feels like it's time to go, you know?

1992
01:51:38,705 --> 01:51:41,401
I'm sure Lil's ready for me to go.

1993
01:51:44,033 --> 01:51:45,087
Yeah.

1994
01:51:48,533 --> 01:51:50,393
I don't wanna fight with you,
you know what I mean?

1995
01:51:50,478 --> 01:51:52,218
But we had good times as always.

1996
01:51:52,805 --> 01:51:55,325
And-- thank you for the hospitality.

1997
01:51:56,705 --> 01:51:57,799
It's been great.

1998
01:51:58,565 --> 01:51:59,705
So--

1999
01:52:01,892 --> 01:52:03,916
You know, I wanted to tell
you and Lil together,

2000
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:06,017
but I guess I could just
tell her in the morning.

2001
01:52:06,798 --> 01:52:09,790
Before I go, or if I don't see her,

2002
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:12,610
I can-- I'll call her or something,
thank her.

2003
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:13,718
But--

2004
01:52:16,655 --> 01:52:17,887
So I'm gonna go to bed.

2005
01:52:27,089 --> 01:52:27,979
Okay?

2006
01:52:28,535 --> 01:52:29,527
We're good?

2007
01:52:30,090 --> 01:52:31,027
You understand?

2008
01:54:50,852 --> 01:54:53,095
Oh. Look at this cutie-pie.

2009
01:54:54,329 --> 01:54:55,383
Hey yo, B, hit the light.

2010
01:54:55,468 --> 01:54:57,500
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

2011
01:54:59,009 --> 01:54:59,993
Yo!

2012
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:01,594
What the fuck?

2013
01:55:03,032 --> 01:55:04,096
Oh God, I'm dead.

2014
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:06,470
Look at this scared motherfucker, man.

2015
01:55:06,555 --> 01:55:07,743
June?

2016
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:09,495
It's me, homeboy.

2017
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:10,899
The fuck?

2018
01:55:10,984 --> 01:55:12,048
That's right.

2019
01:55:13,149 --> 01:55:14,365
What are you doing out here?

2020
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:18,985
Money. Weed.
Get your shit and get the fuck out.

2021
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:20,275
June, what the fuck?
I'm good with your mom.

2022
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,453
-What are you talking about?
-You good with my Momma?

2023
01:55:22,985 --> 01:55:23,891
Yeah, nah.

2024
01:55:23,976 --> 01:55:26,126
This is your eviction notice, Mikey.

2025
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:27,781
I don't think you got the message.

2026
01:55:27,866 --> 01:55:29,860
No. Wait, what the fuck
are you talking about?

2027
01:55:29,945 --> 01:55:31,390
-I'm good with your momma.
-She sent us here.

2028
01:55:31,475 --> 01:55:33,095
Give me my phone.
I'm calling Leondria.

2029
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:34,604
That shit's not an option.

2030
01:55:34,689 --> 01:55:36,334
-Where the hell your money at?
-No. Fuck you.

2031
01:55:36,419 --> 01:55:38,981
I'm not giving you shit. I'm not telling
you where my fucking money is. Fuck you.

2032
01:55:44,872 --> 01:55:46,559
-Damn.
-What the fuck?

2033
01:55:46,644 --> 01:55:48,927
-What are you doing?
-Motherfucker's naked.

2034
01:55:49,019 --> 01:55:51,059
The money is under the mattress.

2035
01:55:51,144 --> 01:55:52,122
Under there.

2036
01:55:52,207 --> 01:55:54,075
It's on the other side,
it's under the mattress.

2037
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:55,382
Go on. Get there, B.

2038
01:55:56,546 --> 01:55:59,148
Get that money. Get that money.

2039
01:55:59,718 --> 01:56:00,921
I'm sorry, Mikey.

2040
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,865
That's my money.
Hey, that's my fucking money.

2041
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:08,809
What are you doing?

2042
01:56:08,894 --> 01:56:11,558
Look, I was gonna leave tomorrow.
Give me that shit back. Come on.

2043
01:56:11,643 --> 01:56:13,014
-Out tonight.
-Oh, fuck you, Lil.

2044
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:14,440
I don’t give a fuck about you.

2045
01:56:14,525 --> 01:56:17,015
I don't give a fuck about nothing
that they got going on over here.

2046
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,365
I'm here for motherfucking job.

2047
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:19,930
-Give me that shit.
-Get your ass back.

2048
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,480
-What are you doing, man?
-Thank you so much.

2049
01:56:22,565 --> 01:56:24,940
I see. You bitches played me.

2050
01:56:25,025 --> 01:56:27,990
Oh, this is fucking great.
This is just great.

2051
01:56:28,075 --> 01:56:29,490
-Fuck you.
-So much fucking money.

2052
01:56:29,575 --> 01:56:31,720
I can't believe she called me over here
for this shit, man.

2053
01:56:31,805 --> 01:56:33,507
Fuck you. I paid for August rent.

2054
01:56:33,592 --> 01:56:35,310
Now give me my Mom weed, homeboy.

2055
01:56:35,395 --> 01:56:37,541
-I'm not telling you where the weed's at.
-I'mma fuck you up.

2056
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:39,418
You got my money.
You're not getting my weed.

2057
01:56:39,503 --> 01:56:41,602
-It's right over there actually.
-You fucking bitch.

2058
01:56:43,636 --> 01:56:46,180
Oh, it is so hot in here, ma. Are you hot?

2059
01:56:46,265 --> 01:56:46,894
Oh ma--

2060
01:56:46,979 --> 01:56:49,031
I'll fucking lunch kick you and your mom.

2061
01:56:49,116 --> 01:56:51,516
You got the green belt.
You going to do some of those moves?

2062
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:53,657
-Fuck you, bitch!
-Shut the fuck up, Mikey.

2063
01:56:53,742 --> 01:56:55,026
Relax, Ernesto.

2064
01:56:55,111 --> 01:56:57,460
-Get him out, guys.
-Go get your shit and get out.

2065
01:56:57,545 --> 01:57:00,310
And don't even think about stepping foot
in Texas City again.

2066
01:57:00,395 --> 01:57:01,285
You got me?

2067
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:04,302
Ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye.

2068
01:57:05,105 --> 01:57:06,228
Can I put my clothes on, please?

2069
01:57:06,313 --> 01:57:08,754
Can you just give me some privacy
so I can put my clothes on, please?

2070
01:57:08,839 --> 01:57:10,887
You got 30 motherfucking seconds, homeboy.

2071
01:57:10,972 --> 01:57:12,878
30 seconds cause you're wasting my time.

2072
01:57:12,963 --> 01:57:13,846
Okay.

2073
01:57:13,931 --> 01:57:16,704
-That's less than a minute, Mikey.
-Yeah, I'll give you less than a minute.

2074
01:57:21,545 --> 01:57:23,680
You hear me? 30 seconds.

2075
01:57:23,765 --> 01:57:25,235
All right, let me get changed. Jesus.

2076
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,420
Motherfucker.

2077
01:57:28,045 --> 01:57:29,568
Hurry the fuck up.

Okay. I'm sorry.

2096
01:58:29,144 --> 01:58:30,620
Fuck this.
What are you doing?

2097
01:58:30,705 --> 01:58:31,895
-We gotta talk.
-Where's June?

2098
01:58:32,418 --> 01:58:34,645
Wait, listen. Go in the back.

2099
01:58:34,730 --> 01:58:35,739
Okay.

2100
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,640
-Can I have a towel?
-Hell no, go that way.

2101
01:58:38,665 --> 01:58:39,656
Fuck this.

2102
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:43,242
Cover that shit up, boy.

2103
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:49,189
Okay, look. Yeah. You want me to admit it?
I was selling to the hardhats.

2104
01:58:49,274 --> 01:58:51,525
I know you told me not to,
but they're good customers.

2105
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:52,718
They're good, guys.

2106
01:58:53,391 --> 01:58:55,086
I-- I--
You got their money.

2107
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:03,618
Yes. Yeah. Okay.

2108
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:11,240
You're persona non grata.

2109
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:14,035
You know what that means Mr. Hollywood?

2110
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:16,445
Yeah. Yes. I know what that means.
But why?

2111
01:59:16,529 --> 01:59:19,771
I'm looking out for Lil and
that's all you need to know.

2112
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,588
God damn sabotage.

2113
01:59:23,328 --> 01:59:24,474
What happened?

2114
01:59:25,732 --> 01:59:29,349
Oh, great.
The goonette squad. Look at them go.

2115
01:59:29,435 --> 01:59:31,495
Hey Ma.
Man, this nigga jumped out the window.

2116
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:33,119
Is Lil and Lexi okay?

2117
01:59:33,204 --> 01:59:34,205
They are fine.

2118
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,580
Hey, man, shut the fuck up.

2119
01:59:36,748 --> 01:59:38,338
Look, their house is crazy.

2120
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,866
Everybody over there, screaming
and crying.

2121
01:59:40,951 --> 01:59:43,445
This motherfucker with his
junk swinging everywhere.

2122
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:46,474
This lazy bastard not doing
shit besides sitting on yo ass.

2123
01:59:46,559 --> 01:59:48,282
I showed up, man.
I'm the fucking muscle.

2124
01:59:48,367 --> 01:59:50,105
And your lazy ass,

2125
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:52,954
All you did was get the money
and then you would just watch it.

2126
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:55,745
Nobody told me I was gonna be dragging
a freaking butt naked dude out of the bed.

2127
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,305
Now you ain't even do shit anyways.

2128
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,849
I don't need you coming
on no runs with me.

2129
01:59:58,933 --> 02:00:00,570
You ain't nothing for
dead weight motherfucker.

2130
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:02,831
Okay. That's cool. It's all good.

2131
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:04,415
Mom, you're gonna let her
talk to me like that?

2132
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,215
Hell yeah, I'mma talk to you like this.

2133
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:08,275
-Listen. Time out.
-She can't save you.

2134
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,823
-Lazy motherfuck--
-Time the fuck out.

2135
02:00:12,415 --> 02:00:13,945
Yeah, you guys are on timeout.

2136
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:15,445
-Shut up, man.
-Shut up, bro.

2137
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,676
Zip it.

2138
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:21,625
Mom, this incident ruined my night.

2139
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:23,455
One of my buddies had a party at Oceans.

2140
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:26,250
I could've been there, but I gotta
come and deal with this bullshit.

2141
02:00:26,335 --> 02:00:27,595
You see. Constant complaining.

2142
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:30,530
-You were there to protect your sister.
-He not coming with me, no more.

2143
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:32,847
-All right, well I'm done with this shit.
-Shoulda stayed your ass at home.

2144
02:00:32,932 --> 02:00:34,045
You know what--

2145
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:36,044
We're having a family meeting after this.

2146
02:00:36,128 --> 02:00:37,643
-Family meeting?
-Point Blank.

2147
02:00:37,728 --> 02:00:39,049
-You serious?
-We need a meeting.

2148
02:00:39,134 --> 02:00:41,073
You can take that information and
do what you want with it.

2149
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:42,588
Why do you send these
motherfuckers with me?

2150
02:00:42,673 --> 02:00:44,334
You ain't going to that fucked up club.

2151
02:00:44,419 --> 02:00:45,718
You ain't going away home, boy.

2152
02:00:45,803 --> 02:00:47,574
You gon' sit right here and roll with us.

2153
02:00:47,659 --> 02:00:48,919
We need a meeting.

2154
02:00:49,003 --> 02:00:50,042
Now back to you.

2155
02:00:50,127 --> 02:00:51,685
Yeah. Back to the sabotage.

2156
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:54,065
Whatever you want to call it,
it's over with.

2157
02:00:54,619 --> 02:00:57,235
That was between me and Lexi.
Seriously. What the fuck?

2158
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:00,204
At the end of the day, it's about
you getting up out of Texas.

2159
02:01:00,289 --> 02:01:01,914
It's time for you to bounce.

2160
02:01:01,999 --> 02:01:05,300
Yeah, I'm fixing to, but I was
gonna leave in the morning.

2161
02:01:05,385 --> 02:01:07,284
I need money to do that.

2162
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:09,565
Well, maybe you go sell
one of your fuck trophies.

2163
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:11,096
Hey, watch your mouth
in front of Ma.

2164
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:12,501
What's wrong with you?

2165
02:01:12,586 --> 02:01:13,970
Did you give him his 200?

2166
02:01:14,055 --> 02:01:16,033
I was but then his punk
ass jumped out the window.

2167
02:01:16,118 --> 02:01:17,095
$200. That's it?

2168
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,922
That's enough to get you a bus
ticket far beyond the state line.

2169
02:01:22,459 --> 02:01:25,255
After everything I did for you. 200?

2170
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:26,368
Wow.

2171
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,485
Be gone by midday.

2172
02:01:31,691 --> 02:01:33,900
-Thank your mom for me.
-I sure will.

2173
02:01:33,993 --> 02:01:35,839
Maybe you ought to come
by the house sometime.

2174
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,669
Yeah, that would be nice.

2175
02:01:37,754 --> 02:01:39,574
Yeah. You and Lexi,
y'all come on over here.

2176
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:42,347
-We can, you know, barbecue, drinks some.
-Oh that would be great.

2177
02:01:43,346 --> 02:01:44,840
You know I should,
I should be taking

2178
02:01:44,925 --> 02:01:47,645
the backpack that you gave me,
but no, I'll take-- I'll use that.

2179
02:01:47,730 --> 02:01:50,005
You want me to walk down the
street with a garbage bag? Fine.

2180
02:01:50,090 --> 02:01:51,299
Yeah, you shit.

2181
02:01:51,384 --> 02:01:52,960
Fucking bullshit.

2182
02:01:53,045 --> 02:01:54,785
Threw my clothes in there.
I'll fuck them.

2183
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:56,830
I'm gonna fold my clothes.
So when I leave, they're not wrinkled.

2184
02:01:56,915 --> 02:01:58,677
Me and him got in a fight
about twenty-five years ago.

2185
02:01:58,761 --> 02:01:59,320
Right?

2186
02:01:59,405 --> 02:02:00,766
I whipped his ass in high school.

2187
02:02:00,851 --> 02:02:01,774
Sure you did.

2188
02:02:01,859 --> 02:02:02,800
Yeah.

2189
02:02:02,885 --> 02:02:04,016
I'm going to take my time.

2190
02:02:04,101 --> 02:02:05,050
Watch.

2191
02:02:05,135 --> 02:02:06,386
Oh, look at that fold.

2192
02:02:08,525 --> 02:02:10,470
-Y'all don't get tired of this shit, man?
-Nope. I love it.

2193
02:02:10,555 --> 02:02:12,010
-You don't get tired of this shit.
-I live for it.

2194
02:02:12,095 --> 02:02:14,064
-Lil, you're a good woman, Lil.
-Thank you.

2195
02:02:14,611 --> 02:02:15,945
You really are.

2196
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:17,080
Fucking dumb bitch.

2197
02:02:17,165 --> 02:02:17,767
All this--

2198
02:02:17,852 --> 02:02:20,594
-Hurry the fuck up.
-Yo, relax. What the fuck?

2199
02:02:21,728 --> 02:02:22,939
Get your shit--

2200
02:02:25,205 --> 02:02:26,470
June.

2201
02:02:26,555 --> 02:02:27,954
Get a lot of drama here.

2202
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:30,711
Oh no, no, no, no.
You're not taking that--

2203
02:02:39,114 --> 02:02:40,030
Go sit down!

2204
02:02:40,774 --> 02:02:42,078
I'm taking my toothbrush.

2205
02:02:42,163 --> 02:02:43,118
Shut up.

2206
02:02:43,203 --> 02:02:44,250
Relax, June.

2207
02:02:46,352 --> 02:02:49,385
Lil, seriously,
thank you so much for letting me stay.

2208
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:52,025
I had an amazing time and you and
your daughter are dumb bitches.

2209
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:52,946
Don't say that.

2210
02:02:53,711 --> 02:02:54,852
That is not right.

2211
02:02:54,937 --> 02:02:55,937
Get the fuck out.

2212
02:02:56,022 --> 02:02:57,437
I need a water before I leave,
cause I'm gonna be thirsty.

2213
02:02:57,522 --> 02:02:58,459
You gotta go, man.

2214
02:02:58,544 --> 02:02:59,921
I bought this ashtray.

2215
02:03:00,006 --> 02:03:02,512
No. I said when I got it,
I could take it back.

2216
02:03:02,597 --> 02:03:04,132
Let's go. Let's go.

2217
02:03:04,217 --> 02:03:06,100
-Fine, fine.
-Get outta here, man.

2218
02:03:06,185 --> 02:03:08,045
I should have beat your ass
in high school.

2219
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,910
Too bad. It was other way around, huh?

2220
02:03:09,995 --> 02:03:11,650
-Do you want to go another round?
-Nah.

2221
02:03:11,735 --> 02:03:13,180
You know what?

2222
02:03:13,265 --> 02:03:15,184
I got one last thing
to say to all you guys.

2223
02:03:15,269 --> 02:03:16,513
Man, shut your bitch ass up.

2224
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:18,044
Shut the fuck up.

2225
02:03:18,129 --> 02:03:19,966
Not an another word out of your mouth.

2226
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:24,500
Now, get the fuck out,
you suitcase pimp.

2227
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,755
What'd you say?

2228
02:03:27,778 --> 02:03:31,146
You heard me. Suitcase pimp.

2229
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:33,415
Say that shit again.

2230
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,153
Homeless suitcase pimp.

2231
02:03:45,325 --> 02:03:46,864
Just go ahead and leave, dude.

2232
02:03:55,110 --> 02:03:56,387
He's outta here, babe.

2233
02:03:57,005 --> 02:03:58,067
No more--

2234
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:00,840
That was nothing but trouble.

2235
02:06:11,605 --> 02:06:15,348
