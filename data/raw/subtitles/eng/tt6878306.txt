00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,132
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,934
Good evening.

4
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:26,171
It's good to be back with
you all here in Wichita Falls.

5
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,173
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

6
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,375
and I'm here tonight
to bring y'all the news

7
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:33,044
from across
this great world of ours.

8
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:35,213
Now...

9
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:36,981
Pleasure.

10
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,017
Now, I know how life is
in these parts,

11
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,818
working a trade
sunup to sundown.

12
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,088
No time for reading newspapers.
Am I correct?

13
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:46,690
Let me do that work for you.

14
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:49,693
And maybe, just for tonight,

15
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,830
we can escape our troubles

16
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:55,899
and hear of the great changes
that are happening out there.

17
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,671
Starting local, then.

Hey.

Stop!

I'm not gonna hurt you.

35

Come here.

36
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,930
Aah! Don't bite!

37
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,245
Who are you?

38
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,849
Do you have a name?

39
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:52,034
I don't understand.

40
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,437
I...

41
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,005
I don't speak Kiowa.

42
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,841
Come.

43
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,844
Come on.

44
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,115
It's all right. It's all right.

45
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,251
Come on.

46
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:12,888
You can't stay out here. You...

47
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,924
Give me your hand.

48
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:41,917
Mm. These are
Indian agency papers.

49
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,353
"Johanna Leonberger."

50
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,256
Is that your name?

51
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,225
Johanna?

52
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,932
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

53
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,317
Let's see what we got here.

54
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,320
Gonna check it on that side.

55
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:19,922
Got your loyalty oath?

56
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:24,560
No, nothing.

57
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,429
Where'd you serve, Captain?

58
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,564
Third Texas Infantry.

59
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:32,101
Surrendered Galveston
26 May, 1865.

60
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:33,369
Any sidearms?

61
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:34,470
No, sir.

62
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:38,140
Just bird shot.

63
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,075
Says here
you're from San Antonio.

64
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,111
What's your business up here?

65
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,147
I read the news
from town to town.

66
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,149
I was headed down
to the Red River,

67
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,418
and-and I seen him.

68
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:52,388
I think he was transporting
this little girl here

69
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,523
for the federal authorities.

70
00:08:57,226 --> 00:09:00,094
Looks like the Indians had her.

71
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,432
Here's her agency papers.

72
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,099
Just found them.

73
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,371
Let's saddle up.

74
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,317
You're good.

75
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,018
What the hell do I do
with this child?

76
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,521
Fetch her to Red River.
Command post will know.

77
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,490
- Hyah!
- Hyah.

78
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,391
Hyah!

79
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:59,822
So, the army found you
three weeks ago

80
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:03,291
when they cleared the Kiowa
out of Montague County.

81
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:06,227
You've been living with them
since they kidnapped you

82
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,396
when they attacked your family
in Hill Country

83
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,465
six years prior.

84
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,636
Dear Heaven.

85
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,575
"Her mother, father
and sister were..."

86
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:25,179
Well, they passed.

87
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:28,383
But you have an aunt
and an uncle...

88
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,353
...still living down there.

89
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:35,323
Near Castroville.

90
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,327
So, that's where
you were being taken.

91
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,099
I know Castroville.

92
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:48,202
I used to live near there
before the war.

93
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:57,345
Lot of German folk down there.

94
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:00,615
Yeah.

95
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,618
Yeah.

96
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:15,430
Uh, remember
your German family?

97
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,598
Uh...

98
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,433
All right.

99
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:26,140
Come tomorrow, we'll find
somebody who can take you home.

100
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,528
All right, me, too.

101
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,262
Come on. Ah, ah.

102
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:24,499
Come on. Come on.

103
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,367
Pardon me.

104
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,404
Lost child here.

105
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:31,539
Got a child issue here.

106
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,542
Much obliged. Bless you, sir.

107
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,209
- I got a lost... lost child.
- I can't use this.

108
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,411
That's all I can do for now.

109
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:38,479
Thank you.

110
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:46,988
What's your business?

111
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,290
Here to see your Indian agent.

112
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,993
He's up north of the Red,

113
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:53,761
on the reservation.

114
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:57,264
Well, I found this child, see,

115
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:59,734
and the lieutenant
who was patrolling the road

116
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,803
told me to bring her
to see you.

117
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:06,406
Well, what do you
expect me to do?

118
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,809
She needs taken home.

119
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,443
The agent won't be back

120
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:10,812
for another three months.

121
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:12,780
Strays are his responsibility.

122
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:15,315
Looks like
you'll need to take her.

123
00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:16,718
I-I can't take her, sir.

124
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,653
I work and travel
from town to town.

125
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,521
I can't take her.

126
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:23,557
Listen, friend.

127
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,592
Wait for the agent
or take her yourself.

128
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,494
It's up to you.

129
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,499
If you will, please.

130
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:37,404
Next.

131
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:16,077
Good to lay eyes on you,
Captain.

132
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,577
Hello, son.

133
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,714
Wonder if I could have
a word with you

134
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:22,282
and Mrs. Boudlin.

135
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,818
Well, of course, sir.

136
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,389
<i>So, three months, huh?</i>

137
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:30,824
What are you going
to do with her?

138
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,660
Wait for the agent, it appears.

139
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:49,409
Got kind of a wild look
about her, doesn't she?

140
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,511
No, she's scared.

141
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,681
Hmm.

142
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:57,484
Be careful, honey.

143
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,653
Don't get too close.

144
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,459
All right, now, see here,
child. I have to work.

145
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,763
You're gonna stay here
with these kind folks.

146
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:13,700
Friends. Friends.

147
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,436
You got that, child?

148
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,539
Well, shoot, Kidd.

149
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:22,475
She don't understand
a damn thing, does she?

150
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,880
Thank you kindly.

151
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,421

00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:29,501
I say Texas first
and damn them amendments.

186
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,040
I ain't digging no Texas soil,

187
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,577
sweating and bleeding
for some rich Yankee type.

188
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,980
I suggest y'all watch yourself.

189
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,682
Suggest y'all the same!

190
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:46,618
What are y'all even
doing here, huh?

191
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:47,987
You ain't dealing
with the Injuns,

192
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,523
fixing our roads,
minding our river crossings.

193
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:53,993
All they're doing is
beating up on Southern folk!

194
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:59,898
You know, all right.
I hear you. I hear you.

195
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,134
Go back home where you belong.

196
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,769
I hear you.

197
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,673
Northern blues
are not helping us a lot,

198
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,743
and they're asking
for a great deal in return.

199
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,548
We're all hurting.

200
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,117
All of us.

201
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:24,890
But I'm thinking we got a part
to play in all of this as well.

202
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,629
There's more than rain
and Indians

203
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:33,699
and Northern blues
troubling our roads.

204
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:37,336
I've seen it myself,
coming in from Wichita Falls.

205
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,905
Yeah.

206
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:41,940
We're all hurting.

207
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:46,078
These are difficult times.

208
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,153
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks.

209
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,653
Much obliged. Thank you.

210
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,789
Thank you so much.

211
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:57,923
Thank you for your attention.

212
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:59,058
Excuse me.

213
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,558
Pardon me. Pardon me.

214
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,762
She's gone.

215
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,732
Little one! Child!

216
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,968
Where are you?

217
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,938
I-I was singing her a hymn,

218
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,873
and I turned my back,
and she was gone.

219
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,674
She didn't take the horses.

220
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,110
- She can't be gone far.
- Oh, she could be anywhere

221
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,777
in this damn woods.

222
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:21,746
Child?

223
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:24,083
You come out now.

224
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:28,187
There's a river down there.

225
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,055
Right behind you.

226
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,391
Little girl, where are you?

227
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,093
Where you at?

228
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:35,827
We need to split up!

229
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,795
Yes, sir, Captain.

230
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,801
No!

231
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:20,004
Johanna, no! Johanna!

232
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:21,839
It's not safe!

233
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,708
You'll fall!

234
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:25,943
Step back!

235
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:28,779
Johanna!

236
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,114
Get down!

237
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,086
Set her on the bed.

238
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,957
Oh.

239
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:17,728
She's just soaked.

240
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,697
Oh.

241
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:23,501
Surer than I live,
that child's trouble.

242
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,836
Running off like that?

243
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:31,909
I said she's wild.
Didn't I say that?

244
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:34,946
Please, Mr. Boudlin.

245
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:36,948
Well, it's the goddamn truth.

246
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:40,017
You-you just got to look
at her to know.

247
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:42,186
Child's got a curse on her.

248
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,101
Well, shit, Captain.

249
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,870
What the hell are you
gonna do with her?

250
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,843
I'll take her.

251
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,880
I found her. I-I'll take her.

252
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,883
You sure about that, Captain?

253
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:17,255
Castroville's
damn near 400 miles.

254
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:21,092
Those roads have changed
since you lived down that way.

255
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,961
The little girl is lost.

256
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,798
She needs to be home.

257
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:40,010
Much obliged
for you keeping her.

258
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:41,911
I'll be back first thing.

259
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,905
She ain't been used in a while
but still runs pretty good.

260
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,852
You carrying?

261
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,121
Scattergun bird shot.

262
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,190
I, uh...

263
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:31,027
kept mine from Palmito.

264
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,863
Well, I'm sure you need it
more than me.

265
00:23:33,897 --> 00:23:35,832
Got 20 rounds, too.

266
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:44,341
I'll fetch it back to you.

267
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,376
Mm, it won't make no matter.

268
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:57,921
Captain.

269
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,857
Why are you doing this?

270
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,161
Johanna. Johanna!

271
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,397
Come on now. Come, come.

272
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,901
Another sleeve. There we go.

273
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:13,970
There we go. Okay.

274
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:16,106
There we are.

275
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,108
Come now. Come now. Come now.

276
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,677
There. Oh!

277
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,078
By the grace of God,
don't you look pretty, hmm?

278
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:25,909
Makes no matter to me
what you wear.

279
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,322
We'll be on this road
for about six days

280
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,989
till we make Dallas.

281
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,594
Then across Central Texas
to the Hill Country,

282
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,962
it'll be a few weeks.

283
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:50,366
We'll have to stop
and give readings, of course.

284
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,167
We have to pay our way.

285
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:54,237
I'll keep an eye out
for trouble.

286
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,373
Settlers killing Indians
for their land

287
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,577
and Indians killing settlers
for taking it.

288
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:05,280
I guess you know something
about that.

289
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:12,087
I'm Captain Kidd, by the by.

290
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:16,158
Captain. Captain.

291
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,627
You're Johanna.

292
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,294
You, Johanna.

293
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,069
And it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

294
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,004
Make no mistake.

295
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,526
Mm.

296
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,132
This is the bacon.

297
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:59,501
I guess I'll make some.

298
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,372
"Please" would be nice to hear.

299
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,608
That's the way it works.

300
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:10,212
That is coffee.

301
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:25,260
Yeah, coffee packs a punch,
doesn't it?

302
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,566
It's an acquired taste.

303
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,273
That's sugar.

304
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:44,446
Hmm?

305
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:47,583
Bit more to your liking, huh?

306
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:50,619
Easy, now.

307
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,689
All right, that's enough.

308
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:56,291
That's enough.

309
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:57,626
Hey.

310
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,620
See all those words

311
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:27,522
printed in a line
one after the other?

312
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:34,196
Put 'em all together,
and you have a story.

313
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,202
Story.

314
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,339
Stories.

315
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,244
Well, go right ahead.

316
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,226
That's my wife.

317
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,362
Down in San Antonio.

318
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,325
I'm gonna get some more water.

319
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,277
Come here
and help me load this up.

320
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:06,547
If you wanna make your fortune,
then that's the place to be.

321
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,100
God does not see
black and white.

322
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,868
The divide that runs
across our nation.

323
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,737
We must keep America whole.

324
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,541
Texas says no,
but I say to you all,

325
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:36,911
under the eyes of God,
that our nation,

326
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:40,714
our great nation,
must be made complete!

327
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,320
Mrs. Gannett.

328
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,558
Hey, Kidd.

329
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:51,859
She yours?

330
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,569
They paying you
to take her home,

331
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,704
or you doing it out of
the goodness of your heart?

332
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,507
No, they're not paying me.
I just know the road.

333
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,577
But I'll take a pair of rooms
if you have 'em.

334
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,912
Yeah, I got rooms.

335
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,761
Thank you.

336
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:30,530
Thank you, ma'am.

337
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,902
No. No, no, no.

338
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,770
We don't use our...
our hands and fingers.

339
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:38,438
We...

340
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:41,574
Look. See this?

341
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,744
Spoon? Spoon?

342
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:46,013
This... this is how we eat.

343
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,815
Spoon.

344
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:02,762
And, uh, and we don't sing.

345
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,902
We don't sing at the table.

346
00:33:07,935 --> 00:33:09,569
What you all looking at?

347
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:11,771
Ain't you never seen
a child eat before?

348
00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,842
What's her name?

349
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:18,511
Johanna.

350
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:22,515
She doesn't have any English.

351
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:24,584
So, what does she speak?

352
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:25,685
Kiowa.

353
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:40,934
- Mm.
- What?

354
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,835
Wh-What... what did she say?

355
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:44,804
She said you've been
calling her the wrong name.

356
00:33:44,837 --> 00:33:46,005
Her name's Cicada.

357
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,877
Well, it's Johanna now.

358
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,980
Johanna Leonberger.

359
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:55,915
This man...

360
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:20,039
She says she got no home.

361
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,076
No Kiowa family, neither.

362
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:24,944
You see the hair?

363
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,981
They cut it
when they're in mourning.

364
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:32,852
This child is an orphan
twice over.

365
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:46,699
Can you tell her that
I am taking her to family,

366
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:48,935
to an aunt and an uncle
down near Castroville?

367
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:52,772
Kidd, she don't got any idea
what that means.

368
00:34:54,107 --> 00:34:58,811
Well, they're the only ones
that will take her.

369
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:02,081
She's got no place else.
Nobody wants her.

370
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:15,061
I hear them roads are bad
Castroville way.

371
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:19,032
Yeah, yeah, so I hear.

372
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,702
Mr. Gannett used to take 'em.

373
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,739
Before he went to California.

374
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:36,816
Maybe he just didn't want
to come back.

375
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:56,836
I do not have a clue
as to the care of a child.

376
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:00,672
Never had the need
nor the patience required.

377
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,375
She's still alive, ain't she?

378
00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,177
That's not nothing.

379
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,773
Road taking its toll?

380
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:39,644
Sleeping through the night

381
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:41,746
isn't what it once was.

382
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:44,783
Yeah.

383
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:49,621
Your stories can only
keep you company for so long.

384
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:57,162
So, what you gonna do
once you've taken her?

385
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:01,032
I may just keep heading south.

386
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:08,907
Work passage on a ship
out of Galveston.

387
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:15,013
Go see those
far-off places I...

388
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,249
read about to people
every night.

389
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,895
How long's it been?

390
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:32,998
Close to five years now.

391
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,803
Castroville's San Antonio way.

392
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,107
Yeah. Yes, it is.

393
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,280
Isn't it time you went back?

394
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:51,816
Made things right with her?

395
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,091
Looking at you now...

396
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,196
...I'm thinking
you don't have a choice.

397
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:31,957
Good evening.

398
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,159
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd,

399
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:38,363
and it is an honor to be back
in the bustling city of Dallas.

400
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,299
A busy town,
and y'all are busy folk,

401
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:44,035
so let's get right to it.

402
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:45,836
Now, when I got in yesterday,

403
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,372
I collected
the latest newspapers,

404
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,774
looking for suitable readings,

405
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:54,845
something to take us away
from our troubles.

406
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:59,217
From <i>The Times,</i>
on its page three...

407
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,803
A word, Captain?

408
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:21,273
Name's Almay.

409
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,275
And these are my associates.

410
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:25,277
Mr. Almay. Gentlemen.

411
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,945
Enjoyed your reading, Cap.

412
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:29,581
You take us away
from our hard thoughts.

413
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:31,015
Thank you.

414
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,052
So, where'd you serve, Captain?

415
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,355
Infantry, Third Texas.

416
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:38,922
- Ah.
- You?

417
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:43,428
First Texas Infantry,
Northern Virginia.

418
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:45,397
Lot of good it did us.

419
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,831
Poor men fighting
a rich man's war.

420
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:49,301
Left us lying here
in the gutter.

421
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:53,305
Way I see it, we fought,

422
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:54,938
but ain't no piece
of this ours.

423
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,341
It's late, Mr. Almay.

424
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,142
And what is your point?

425
00:39:58,175 --> 00:40:01,945
Point is, us old soldiers
got to live, right?

426
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:06,317
I have a little business
proposition for you,

427
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:09,920
seeing you traveling alone
like you are.

428
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,222
This young girl.

429
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,192
What do you want?

430
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:17,861
How much you want for her?

431
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:20,964
This child is not for sale.

432
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:26,070
Word is she's that captive
out of Wichita Falls.

433
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:28,238
Mr. Almay,
you are well-informed.

434
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:32,343
News of value travels.

435
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:36,313
How about $50?

436
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:40,351
All right, a hundred, then.

437
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:43,354
And you can rest easy knowing
at least she'll get paid.

438
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:46,123
I mean, look at that fair skin.

439
00:40:47,057 --> 00:40:49,860
I bet you were a lucky man
out there in the desert.

440
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,396
You are scum.

441
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:54,398
In the alternative,
we could just take her.

442
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,066
- All right, boys.
- What's going on here?

443
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,468
Oh, thank the Lord.

444
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,270
We're local traders, sir.

445
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,505
We became concerned
about the welfare

446
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:02,906
of this here child
in the clutches

447
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,241
of a strange man such as this.

448
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:05,943
- Search him.
- I am responsible for

449
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:07,411
returning this child
to her family down south.

450
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,679
- That's her papers and my oath.
- Stay still.

451
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:10,080
Your hands.

452
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,516
Captain.

453
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:15,252
- You got that?
- Yep.

454
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,430
You take this girl,
and you get on your way.

455
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:28,365
- Let's go.
- Move.

456
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,067
- Go on.
- Write 'em up.

457
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,302
- I'll be seeing you, Captain.
- Keep walking.

458
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,238
You hear me?

459
00:41:34,271 --> 00:41:37,341
I'm coming for you as soon as
I'm done with these blues.

460
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:41,412
- <i>Name.</i>
- <i>J.G. Almay.</i>

461
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:44,148

462
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,282
12 Polk Street,

463
00:41:45,315 --> 00:41:47,217
<i>Dallas, Texas.</i>

464
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:49,987
<i>Sign.</i>

465
00:42:02,332 --> 00:42:04,000
Hyah!

466
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:19,015
Ha!

467
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:30,960
Captain!

468
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:34,298
Hyah! Come on!

469
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,545
Hyah!

470
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:11,635
Come on. Come on.

471
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,323
- Come on.
- Hyah!

472
00:43:51,574 --> 00:43:53,442
Hyah!

473
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:13,329
Come on. Down, down.

474
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:28,210
Hey, Cap, didn't I say
I'd come for you?

475
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:30,413
- Go.
- Didn't I say that?

476
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:42,124
Come on. Come on.

477
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:43,225
Move!

478
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:45,628
Ha! Ha!

479
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:02,705
Higher. Come, come!

480
00:46:05,273 --> 00:46:06,441
Let's go.

481
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:38,741
Hey, Cap!

482
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:42,410
You're good for a man of years.

483
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:44,714
But ain't you just
so damn tired of all this?

484
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:47,315
- Help me.
- Didn't we have our body and soul broke out there?

485
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:50,385
Seems an awful shame
for it to end like this

486
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,586
when you can just join us.

487
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:53,254
This world...

488
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:54,824
...rich pickings for some,

489
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,691
slim pickings
for the rest of us.

490
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:03,364
Shit.

491
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,603
Oh, goddamn it!

492
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:12,474
You go.

493
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:14,776
Take the horses and go.

494
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,612
I shoot. You go.

495
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:22,884
Captain.

496
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,819
No, no. No, this is worthless.

497
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:28,423
See this? It's for birds.

498
00:47:28,456 --> 00:47:30,759
It's for birds, understand?

499
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,727
You're not thinking
straight, Cap.

500
00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:35,530
She ain't worth dying for.

501
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:40,335
Go.

502
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:42,303
Get away while you can.

503
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:45,507
What do you say, Cap?

504
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,275
Talk to me.

505
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:55,750
Mr. Almay!

506
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:59,087
You have me...

507
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,357
in an uncomfortable
circumstance.

508
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:08,429
How exactly are we
gonna work this out?

509
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:10,665
I figure a share for each man

510
00:48:10,698 --> 00:48:11,800
and an extra for me.

511
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:17,605
Considering what you did
to my associate over there.

512
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:20,575
That sounds pretty fair to me.

513
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:23,778
So, what do you want me to do?

514
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:25,713
Just got to turn over
the girl. That's all.

515
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:26,748
No. Johanna, no!

516
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:29,350
They don't want our money.

517
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,885
- They want you!
- Captain.

518
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:51,139
Oh, Cap, what you trying to do,
tickle us to death?

519
00:48:51,172 --> 00:48:53,608
Well, we don't have a deal yet.

520
00:48:58,012 --> 00:48:59,647
Aha!

521
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:00,949
I think it's 'cause
you're out of bullets

522
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,585
and all you got left now
is bird shot.

523
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:05,887
Am I right, Cap?

524
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,156
All right, Almay.

525
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:10,692
Damn it, you have a deal.

526
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:12,559
All right.

527
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:16,731
I'm gonna lay my gun down
on this here rock.

528
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:18,398
How about you do the same?

529
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,635
Here's my sidearm.

530
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:22,837
Let me see yours.

531
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:25,372
I'm laying my weapon down.

532
00:49:28,943 --> 00:49:30,812
Here's mine.

533
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:34,015
Dime-ah.

534
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:36,918
- Captain, boom?
- Boom, boom.

535
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:44,926
Clay over there
is gonna show himself.

536
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:47,628
Then how about you do the same?

537
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:49,696
Sounds good!

538
00:50:04,678 --> 00:50:06,480
Stay down.

Oh, goddamn it!

540
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,823
Well, now you done gone
and spoiled it, Cap.

541
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:58,498
Looks like we're back
on opposite sides.

542
00:50:58,532 --> 00:50:59,566
Looks like it.

543
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,708
All right, Cap.

544
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:10,077
Looks like
I'm coming for you now.

00:55:06,078 --> 00:55:08,214
See that? See that bird?

548
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,050
"Bird."

549
00:55:13,385 --> 00:55:15,020
"Bird."

550
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:17,957
Yeah.

551
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:20,859
Yeah, that's good.

552
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,262
"Goo-toh."

553
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:26,332
- "Goo-toh"?
- "Goo-toh."

554
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,335
"Bird" is "goo-toh"?

555
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,972
- "Goo-toh."
- "Goo-toh."

556
00:55:40,145 --> 00:55:41,247
"Aungopih."

557
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,348
"Buffalo."

558
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,784
Since you're so smart...

559
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,887
..."prickly pear cactus."

560
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:53,259
"Pr-Prit-ly..."

561
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,761
"Pear cactus."
And there's juniper out there.

562
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,566
And-and there's some sage.

563
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,033
"Say-gya."

564
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,402
"Say-juh"?

565
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:04,936
"Say-uh-gya."

566
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,838
"Sage." Yeah.

567
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,874
That's right. It smells good.

568
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:12,043
- "Good."
- Yeah.

569
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:15,180
So, what else can you
teach me in Kiowa?

570
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:18,816
"Daum."

571
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:22,221
"Daum." What is "daum"?

572
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,025
"Daum."

573
00:56:27,058 --> 00:56:28,893
The-the earth.

574
00:56:28,926 --> 00:56:30,094
All right.

575
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:32,264
"Pahn."

576
00:56:32,298 --> 00:56:34,333
The clouds?

577
00:56:34,366 --> 00:56:36,268
The sky.

578
00:56:37,336 --> 00:56:41,806
"Daum pahn doo-goh daw."

579
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:45,377
Like, coll-collected?

580
00:56:45,411 --> 00:56:48,414
"Daum daw"?

581
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,981
"Daw."

582
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:53,051
"Daw" with a...
is a spirit.

583
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:54,420
A breath.

584
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,823
A circle.

585
00:57:01,427 --> 00:57:05,830
For us, it's more like
a straight line.

586
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,299
A line.

587
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:10,368
"Li-an."

588
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,003
"Li-an," yes.

589
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,272
We're all journeying
across the prairie

590
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,240
in a straight line

591
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:18,309
and looking
for that place to be.

592
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,113
And when we find it, we go
straight out and we plow it,

593
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:24,148
and we plant it
all in a straight line.

594
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,289
Yeah.

595
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,091
Very good.

596
00:57:33,124 --> 00:57:35,093
"Velly gut."

597
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:38,329
"Velly gut," indeed.

598
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:41,165
<i>Sehr gut, Onkel.</i>

599
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,002
Whoa, whoa.

600
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:47,105
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

601
00:57:47,138 --> 00:57:50,007
<i>"Sehr gut, Onkel."</i>
You just spoke German.

602
00:57:51,008 --> 00:57:52,910
<i>Deutsche.</i>

603
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,081
Can you remember anything else?

604
00:58:01,252 --> 00:58:03,421
What else can you remember?

605
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,301
What?

606
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:19,270
What is it?

607
00:58:21,472 --> 00:58:24,175
Oh, dear God.

608
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,144
Hyah! Hyah!

609
00:58:26,177 --> 00:58:27,412
Hyah!

610
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:30,014
You just leave that.
You just leave it.

611
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:31,915
Forget it.

612
00:58:33,117 --> 00:58:36,287
I guess we both have
demons to face,

613
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,322
going down this road.

614
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:24,435
Good day, gentlemen.

615
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:26,269
Road's closed.

616
00:59:26,304 --> 00:59:30,106
Ain't nobody unaccounted for
getting into Erath County.

617
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,409
Is that the law?

618
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,044
It is now.

619
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,295
I'm carrying nothing
of any great value.

620
01:00:05,475 --> 01:00:07,043
What's your name, sir?

621
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:11,114
Kidd.
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

622
01:00:11,147 --> 01:00:14,184
And your reason
for traveling, Cap?

623
01:00:14,217 --> 01:00:15,653
The news.

624
01:00:15,686 --> 01:00:18,455
I read the news
to anyone with ten cents

625
01:00:18,488 --> 01:00:20,123
and the time to hear it.

626
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:26,296
Huh.

627
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,499
My.

628
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:33,336
My, my, my, my, my.

629
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:36,172
Carrying some damage back here.

630
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:39,309
I-I got the wagon cheap, and...

631
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:41,311
the holes came with it.

632
01:00:43,346 --> 01:00:48,251
Well, your newspapers
sure got holes in 'em, mister.

633
01:00:48,285 --> 01:00:51,254
There ain't nothing in here
about Erath County.

634
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:52,857
Hell of a lot's been happening.

635
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,691
Ain't that right, boys?

636
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:56,560
But I don't see it here.

637
01:00:56,593 --> 01:00:58,562
You know, we've been busy.

638
01:00:58,595 --> 01:01:00,630
We done fixed them Mexicans.

639
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:02,432
Injuns, too.
Pushed them clean out.

640
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:05,569
Mr. Farley, he killed
a right smart of Indians.

641
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:10,073
He scalped them real good, too.

642
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:13,209
We're building
a whole new world

643
01:01:13,243 --> 01:01:15,545
down here in Erath County.

644
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:17,614
But ain't none of it writ here.

645
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:21,484
That news didn't travel.

646
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:24,354
Let's take care of that.

647
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:27,891
Why don't we have us
a little read?

648
01:01:27,924 --> 01:01:30,226
What do you say...

649
01:01:31,227 --> 01:01:32,429
...news man?

650
01:01:36,232 --> 01:01:37,601
Go on, move.

651
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:12,167
Wash out that blood.

652
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:14,604
Don't be staring. Keep working.

653
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:20,142
When he gets done here,
bring him into town.

654
01:02:57,681 --> 01:03:00,282
What business is Mr. Farley in?

655
01:03:00,315 --> 01:03:01,517
Mr. Far...

656
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,186
Business to never mind
your business.

657
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:09,358
What's your name?

658
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:11,460
John Calley.

659
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,632
Is Mr. Farley
family to you, John?

660
01:03:16,666 --> 01:03:19,535
Nah, Mr. Farley, he ain't
any kin of mine. No, no.

661
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:21,603
I ain't got no kin
now Tommy's gone.

662
01:03:22,404 --> 01:03:25,474
But I work for Mr. Farley
all same.

663
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:29,278
What happened to... to Tommy?

664
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:30,747
Mr. Farley gone shot him.

665
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:36,318
For hollering and questioning.

666
01:03:36,351 --> 01:03:37,854
Got thoughts of things
in his head.

667
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:40,322
He couldn't keep 'em in there.

668
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:42,224
Loud, loud mouth.

669
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:25,334
Have him read that.

670
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,411
Hey, Captain.

671
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,848
Mr. Farley says to read this.

672
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:45,687
Stoke it up.
This fire's got to burn.

673
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:50,325
Dime-ah? Dime-ah?

674
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:52,661
- Dime-ah?
- There you go.

675
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,775
Dime-ah?

676
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:10,779
Dime-ah?

677
01:05:17,953 --> 01:05:19,755
Dime-ah?

678
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:24,126
You, sir.

679
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:32,366
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. My name...

680
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:42,544
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

681
01:05:43,979 --> 01:05:47,448
And Mr. Farley has asked me
to come here tonight

682
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:49,685
to read to y'all the news.

683
01:05:49,718 --> 01:05:52,453
He's been kind enough
to supply me

684
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:55,456
with a copy of his own
<i>Erath Journal.</i>

685
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:59,661
Sure looks like Mr. Farley
is a very busy man

686
01:05:59,695 --> 01:06:01,562
in these parts.

687
01:06:01,596 --> 01:06:05,701
He's an editor and a publisher,
a businessman, a lawgiver.

688
01:06:05,734 --> 01:06:11,606
And all of you fine folk
working for him, at that.

689
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,508
Absolutely.

690
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,611
But the way I see it,

691
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:18,446
none of that is news.

692
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:23,819
So let me see
if I can't tempt you

693
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:25,888
with something else.

694
01:06:27,688 --> 01:06:29,757
The <i>Harper</i> illustrated.

695
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:33,828
It has a story reporting
from the lonely little town

696
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:36,497
of Keel Run, Pennsylvania.

697
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,900
I got a bad feeling about this.

698
01:06:37,933 --> 01:06:39,500
Just give him a minute.

699
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:41,502
Now, Keel Run
ain't known for much.

700
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,504
And I'm counting
none of y'all have heard of it

701
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:45,473
since, well,
it is in the North.

702
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:46,641
Why should you?

703
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:50,678
Keel Run is
just one of a thousand

704
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:54,615
little towns across our nation
birthed by the work of many

705
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:58,452
but enjoyed by the few.

706
01:06:58,486 --> 01:07:00,755
Now, Keel Run is no Durand.

707
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:03,958
It does not trade in buffalo
but in coal.

708
01:07:03,991 --> 01:07:06,861
And just like you,
every morning,

709
01:07:06,894 --> 01:07:09,897
its men rise early
from their beds

710
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:15,736
only to descend into
the great, black coal mine.

711
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:19,006
"On the morning of February 11,

712
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:24,645
"37 men of the Run attended
their first shift at noon.

713
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,881
"But before the next hour

714
01:07:26,914 --> 01:07:29,784
"was up, Keel Run's
wheel of fortune had turned,

715
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:32,820
"for the mine,
the coal mine itself,

716
01:07:32,853 --> 01:07:34,689
had caught fire."

717
01:07:36,924 --> 01:07:39,727
The first dozen died
in an instant.

718
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:42,830
Another seven not long after.

719
01:07:44,598 --> 01:07:46,767
But I'm not here
to tell you the story

720
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:49,103
of those unfortunate souls

721
01:07:49,136 --> 01:07:51,772
or of the mine owner

722
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,842
who'd been so lax
about their safety,

723
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:57,611
sitting up there
in his fancy home,

724
01:07:57,645 --> 01:08:00,948
counting the money
produced by their labor.

725
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:02,984
No, no, no,
I'm here to tell you

726
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:06,087
about the 11 men who lived.

727
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,089
Yeah!

728
01:08:08,122 --> 01:08:09,690
Who survived that fire.

729
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:12,660
The 11 men who fought back

730
01:08:12,693 --> 01:08:15,029
against their deadly fate.

731
01:08:15,062 --> 01:08:17,031
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

732
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:21,002
Thought I told you to read
from the <i>Erath,</i> Captain.

733
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:22,937
Well, see,
Mr. Farley, I was wondering

734
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,939
if folks might prefer
some storytelling

735
01:08:24,972 --> 01:08:27,575
- from places outside of Erath.
- Let's hear it!

736
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,844
Just for tonight, Mr. Farley.

737
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:31,746
I think you ought to read

738
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:33,047
from the <i>Erath</i>
all the same, Captain.

739
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:37,918
Sort of thing these people
expect to hear.

740
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:39,687
Let's hear what he has to say.

741
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,055
How about we vote on it?

742
01:08:42,656 --> 01:08:43,691
How about we don't?

743
01:08:43,724 --> 01:08:46,160
Now, I can read

744
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:48,696
from Mr. Farley's
<i>Erath Journal...</i>

745
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,134
...or I can keep on with the
story of the men of Keel Run.

746
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:59,907
- I vote men of the Run!
- Keel Run?

747
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,909
- All right. Very good.
- Let's hear it, Captain.

748
01:09:01,942 --> 01:09:06,180
That day, those 11 men
were facing a mortal enemy...

749
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:08,681
Go now. Shut this
fucking thing down. Now.

750
01:09:08,715 --> 01:09:10,084
- Go. Go!
- ...intent on destroying everything

751
01:09:10,117 --> 01:09:11,852
they ever cared about,
everything they'd built...

752
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:13,753
- Show's over, folks!
- ...every pillar of progress

753
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:15,789
- of their own civilization.
- Show's over! Now, go on home.

754
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,791
And I tell you,
those men refused defeat.

755
01:09:17,825 --> 01:09:19,193
In the dark,
they kept their heads

756
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,095
- and they worked together!
- Get out of here!

757
01:09:21,128 --> 01:09:23,064
- Those men fought back...
- Go home now!

758
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:24,965
- Move! Go on, get out!
- ...against the odds,

759
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:26,666
for better lives,

760
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:27,902
- for freedom!
- You think that's funny, boy?

761
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:34,208
- I got him!
- Whoa!

762
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:41,015
- Johanna!
- Captain!

763
01:09:45,152 --> 01:09:47,088
Move!

764
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:49,156
Y'all, clear out! Clear out!

765
01:10:19,253 --> 01:10:22,088
You should've just read,
Captain.

766
01:10:22,122 --> 01:10:25,191
I was just giving the people
a choice, Mr. Farley.

767
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:28,962
Well, you can read now.

768
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:37,637
You got no idea
what we deal with down here.

769
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,643
Mexicans, blacks, Indians.

770
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:47,013
Give 'em an inch,

771
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:50,183
and every one will slit
your throat where you piss.

772
01:10:52,018 --> 01:10:54,921
The war is over, Mr. Farley.

773
01:10:55,955 --> 01:10:59,192
We have to stop fighting
sometime.

774
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:01,928
Oh, we will.

775
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:05,098
When it's ours alone.

776
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:10,003
Come here. Don't...

777
01:11:10,036 --> 01:11:11,871
Stand up!

778
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:14,174
Yeah. Get up. Stand up.

779
01:11:22,815 --> 01:11:25,218
You ready to read, Cap?

780
01:11:44,771 --> 01:11:46,239
No. No.

781
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,075
No! No!

782
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,159
I like your stories.

783
01:12:27,146 --> 01:12:29,115
I tell you,

784
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:31,783
I ain't never heard
of news reading

785
01:12:31,817 --> 01:12:33,752
as a business before.

786
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:38,824
It's not a rich man's
occupation,

787
01:12:38,857 --> 01:12:40,926
as you can see.

788
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,862
Well, so how-how did you
bother in it, then?

789
01:12:45,964 --> 01:12:47,966
I was a printer by trade.

790
01:12:49,168 --> 01:12:53,172
And I had a printworks
in San Antonio.

791
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,941
Printed up newspapers.

792
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,845
Then the war came.

793
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:05,050
When it was over,
it was all gone.

794
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:08,221
I lost everything.

795
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:12,891
Had to make a new life
for myself right there.

796
01:13:18,364 --> 01:13:22,034
Couldn't print the newspapers
anymore, but I could read 'em.

797
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:24,404
And that's what I've been doing
from town to town.

798
01:13:27,473 --> 01:13:29,375
You got family and all?

799
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:33,211
Left a wife in San Antonio.

800
01:13:35,013 --> 01:13:36,248
Really?

801
01:14:06,345 --> 01:14:07,446
Mm.

802
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:49,888
Well, all right.
This is you, John Calley.

803
01:14:51,523 --> 01:14:53,158
Okay.

804
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:02,033
All right.

805
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:09,074
I could come with y'all.

806
01:15:10,509 --> 01:15:13,512
Yeah, I heard all about
Hill Country.

807
01:15:13,545 --> 01:15:15,547
That's Kiowa land.

808
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,949
If they find you,
they'd kill you.

809
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:24,189
The railroad's that way, John.

810
01:15:24,222 --> 01:15:26,391
Go make something of your own.

811
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:31,229
At least...

812
01:15:31,263 --> 01:15:33,365
take this gun.

813
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:35,333
I could get another real easy.

814
01:15:37,235 --> 01:15:39,271
Just take it for her.

815
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:44,476
Say, Captain...

816
01:15:46,076 --> 01:15:48,346
...those men holed up
in that mine,

817
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,982
they really beat the fire
and get home?

818
01:15:57,121 --> 01:15:59,990
Yeah, they really did.

819
01:16:06,163 --> 01:16:08,165
Right there.

820
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:13,270
Well, goddamn.

821
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:15,507
Ain't that something, huh?

822
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,277
Good luck to you, John.

823
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:21,379
Thank you.

824
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:23,347
Come on.

825
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:25,517
Good luck.

826
01:16:59,684 --> 01:17:03,120
Will you teach me
that song you always sing?

827
01:17:03,153 --> 01:17:06,457
The one that goes...

828
01:18:21,398 --> 01:18:22,533
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

829
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:11,347
We have to stay
on the main road!

830
01:19:11,382 --> 01:19:12,716
Main road!

831
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:22,626
We go.

832
01:20:10,874 --> 01:20:13,476
You don't have to do this.

833
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:17,480
They aren't there anymore.

834
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:24,454
Su-hanna go.

835
01:22:24,874 --> 01:22:26,909
<i>Mama, Papa tot?</i>

836
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,613
Yes.

837
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,582
They're dead.

838
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,784
I want to get you away
from all this pain and killing,

839
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,854
get you clear of it.

840
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,925
Going back, it's not good.

841
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,665
Need to put it behind you.

842
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,970
Move forward. Huh?

843
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:31,941
- Li-an.
- Yes.

844
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:35,644
Stay on that line.

845
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:39,015
And don't look back, hmm?

846
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:02,737
Whoa.

847
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,708
Whoa.

848
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:08,443
- Captain!
- Hang on.

849
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,984
Take the reins!

850
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,534
Jump! Jump, Johanna!

851
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,806
Yeah, good. All right.

852
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:23,670
Horses.

853
01:28:05,812 --> 01:28:07,214
Johanna!

854
01:28:09,816 --> 01:28:11,785
Johanna!

855
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:28,168
Johanna!

856
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:32,272
Where are you?

857
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:39,246
Johanna!

858
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:42,216
Johanna!

859
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:45,252
Johanna!

860
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:50,790
Johanna!

861
01:28:56,263 --> 01:28:58,265
Johanna!

862
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:06,739
Johanna!

863
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,245
Jo...

864
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:44,177
Thank God.

865
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:46,078
Johanna!

866
01:31:58,244 --> 01:32:01,380
Young man, I'm looking for
the Leonbergers of Castroville.

867
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:04,983
Straight.

868
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:17,563
Do we read story?

869
01:32:17,596 --> 01:32:19,931
Dime-ah?

870
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:23,935
No, no story here.

871
01:32:25,069 --> 01:32:26,539
No dime-ah?

872
01:32:27,573 --> 01:32:30,074
No, no dime-ah.

873
01:32:41,787 --> 01:32:44,022
We go there?

874
01:32:45,156 --> 01:32:46,459
Yes.

875
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:49,562
Yes, we go there.

876
01:32:51,129 --> 01:32:53,031
No. No, Cap.

877
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:54,567
- No. We go dime-ah.
- No. No.

878
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,034
- We go.
- No.

879
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:57,302
We go!

880
01:32:57,336 --> 01:32:59,472
We go. No.

881
01:32:59,505 --> 01:33:01,272
No, we go.

882
01:33:01,306 --> 01:33:06,144
This is... this is
where you belong now, Johanna.

883
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:14,553
This is your home now.

884
01:33:22,327 --> 01:33:24,329
Good day.

885
01:33:24,362 --> 01:33:28,099
I have business
with the Leonberger family.

886
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,135
<i>Ja?</i>

887
01:33:32,337 --> 01:33:35,574
This child is
Johanna Leonberger.

888
01:33:39,444 --> 01:33:42,013
Anna.

889
01:33:52,323 --> 01:33:56,394
My sister, she always
went her own way.

890
01:33:56,427 --> 01:34:00,431
We said, "Stay in Castroville,"
but she and her husband Wolf,

891
01:34:00,465 --> 01:34:03,134
they wanted to be
out there in the valley

892
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:04,435
where the land is cheaper.

893
01:34:04,469 --> 01:34:06,371
Hmm?

894
01:34:14,579 --> 01:34:18,082
So, she thinks
she's an Indian now?

895
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,451
Well, s-something in between.

896
01:34:22,587 --> 01:34:26,157
She needs time to adjust.

897
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:28,593
She must work.

898
01:34:28,626 --> 01:34:31,596
She must learn...

899
01:34:38,436 --> 01:34:40,371
The proper ways.

900
01:34:40,405 --> 01:34:42,574
Of course.

901
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:45,476
You know, my sister, when
we found her in the bedroom,

902
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:47,178
they cut her throat.

903
01:34:48,346 --> 01:34:50,448
The baby sister...

904
01:34:50,481 --> 01:34:53,117
they bashed the brain out.

905
01:34:53,918 --> 01:34:56,554
Best if she forgets all that.

906
01:34:58,356 --> 01:35:01,225
She needs new memories.

907
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:06,297
Who knows what
they will have taught her?

908
01:35:08,266 --> 01:35:10,602
But we must try
to see her as a blessing.

909
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,505
And we need the extra hands.

910
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:24,147
You want money
for bring her here?

911
01:35:24,181 --> 01:35:27,218
No.
No, I don't want your money.

912
01:35:29,387 --> 01:35:31,522
Buy her books.

913
01:35:31,556 --> 01:35:34,092
- Books?
- So she can read.

914
01:35:36,394 --> 01:35:38,596
She likes stories.

915
01:36:17,234 --> 01:36:18,736
I will go.

916
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:20,972
You want some food
for the journey?

917
01:36:21,005 --> 01:36:23,240
No, thank you.

918
01:36:27,712 --> 01:36:29,579
He's leaving, child.

919
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:37,487
You ungrateful girl. This man,
he brought you on home.

920
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:39,322
That's all right.

921
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:45,295
Maybe she doesn't understand
what's happening.

922
01:39:52,514 --> 01:39:54,885
I think Michael did this.

923
01:39:54,918 --> 01:39:57,386
"Expressly agreed."

924
01:39:59,022 --> 01:40:01,423
I'm not sure
that that's accurate.

925
01:40:01,457 --> 01:40:02,893
We'll have to inform Mr. Young

926
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:04,827
about the rewriting
of this contract, no?

927
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,662
This here.

928
01:40:07,964 --> 01:40:09,732
Hello, Willie.

929
01:40:09,765 --> 01:40:12,501
Jeffrey.

930
01:40:12,534 --> 01:40:14,904
My God.

931
01:40:14,938 --> 01:40:18,008
Gentlemen, this is...

932
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:21,543
my d-dear old friend
Captain Jeffrey Kidd.

933
01:40:21,577 --> 01:40:23,013
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

934
01:40:23,046 --> 01:40:24,780
Gentlemen.

935
01:40:24,813 --> 01:40:26,682
Please.

936
01:40:39,862 --> 01:40:41,997
She's at the church.

937
01:40:44,033 --> 01:40:46,435
In the garden.

938
01:40:49,605 --> 01:40:51,974
It was cholera.

939
01:40:53,943 --> 01:40:56,578
There's nothing
you could have done.

940
01:40:58,281 --> 01:40:59,949
Doctor said.

941
01:41:01,817 --> 01:41:05,621
It was being away
for four years of war, Willie.

942
01:41:05,654 --> 01:41:08,057
Four years with all
the killing and all the blood.

943
01:41:10,559 --> 01:41:12,895
Of wanting to go home
every day.

944
01:41:14,596 --> 01:41:18,634
Of wanting to see her
and feel her.

945
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:22,805
To talk and laugh
and dream and...

946
01:41:25,107 --> 01:41:27,910
...and think
of having a family.

947
01:41:29,611 --> 01:41:33,515
Instead, I got a letter
delivered to my tent...

948
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:39,521
...saying she was gone
and already buried.

949
01:41:42,725 --> 01:41:44,760
That's when I knew.

950
01:41:45,928 --> 01:41:49,031
God's curse on me
had taken her.

951
01:41:51,033 --> 01:41:53,802
It was sickness, Jeff,
just sickness.

952
01:41:53,836 --> 01:41:55,571
It wasn't sickness.

953
01:41:56,572 --> 01:41:59,074
It was judgment

954
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:01,577
for all I had seen...

955
01:42:03,578 --> 01:42:05,647
...and all I had done.

956
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:14,023
I've known you 50 years.

957
01:42:16,725 --> 01:42:18,761
Since we were boys.

958
01:42:20,996 --> 01:42:23,799
We didn't ask for any of this.

959
01:42:25,067 --> 01:42:27,903
But it fell to us
to do the fighting.

960
01:42:30,139 --> 01:42:31,807
We lived.

961
01:42:34,009 --> 01:42:35,676
She died.

962
01:42:38,679 --> 01:42:40,949
That's not judgment.

963
01:42:42,683 --> 01:42:44,887
It's just what
we had to face and...

964
01:42:45,954 --> 01:42:47,990
...carry the rest of our days.

965
01:45:55,842 --> 01:45:58,112
Ha! Ha!

966
01:46:04,017 --> 01:46:05,852
Giddyap!

967
01:47:41,348 --> 01:47:43,049
We had to tie her.

968
01:47:45,018 --> 01:47:46,986
She runs away.

969
01:47:47,987 --> 01:47:49,389
She's a child.

970
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:54,160
She... no work.

971
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:58,365
My mistake.

972
01:48:02,135 --> 01:48:04,270
She doesn't belong here.

973
01:48:13,046 --> 01:48:15,081
I'm sorry.

974
01:48:18,485 --> 01:48:20,887
I'm sorry.

975
01:48:38,071 --> 01:48:40,106
Johanna...

976
01:48:50,383 --> 01:48:53,052
Captain, Johanna go?

977
01:48:56,589 --> 01:48:58,358
Yes.

978
01:49:00,025 --> 01:49:02,060
If that's what you want.

979
01:50:17,469 --> 01:50:20,005
Captain, Johanna go.

980
01:50:56,141 --> 01:50:57,543
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

981
01:50:57,576 --> 01:50:59,444
<i>for this final story
of the day.</i>

982
01:51:01,313 --> 01:51:04,851
"A man dead and buried

983
01:51:04,884 --> 01:51:07,586
"has risen from the grave.

984
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:11,356
"Three days ago,
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

985
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:15,260
"a Mr. Alfred Blackstone
of 47 years

986
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:17,496
"fell into a stupor.

987
01:51:17,529 --> 01:51:20,432
"His wife called the physician,
but there being no pulse,

988
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,601
"it was determined
that Mr. Blackstone was,

989
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:25,203
- most unfortunately, dead."
- Aw.

990
01:51:25,237 --> 01:51:27,573
"He was buried very swiftly
on the grounds

991
01:51:27,606 --> 01:51:29,575
"of the local church,

992
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:32,477
"where, as divine providence
would have it,

993
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:35,414
"a wedding was due to
take place the following day.

994
01:51:37,616 --> 01:51:42,220
"But nearing the church doors,
the bride abruptly stopped.

995
01:51:42,254 --> 01:51:45,223
"From the cemetery beyond,

996
01:51:45,257 --> 01:51:49,094
"she had heard
this inexplicable sound.

997
01:51:54,766 --> 01:51:59,605
"The desperate, unmistakable
hammering of life.

998
01:52:01,506 --> 01:52:03,342
"In a state
of frantic excitement,

999
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:06,578
"she ran to a nearby grave
marked 'Alfred Blackstone.'

1000
01:52:08,413 --> 01:52:10,248
"And within moments,

1001
01:52:10,282 --> 01:52:12,918
"the entire wedding
congregation was digging.

1002
01:52:15,387 --> 01:52:18,290
"Finally,
poor Alfred Blackstone

1003
01:52:18,323 --> 01:52:21,627
"was pulled from the earth
very much alive.

1004
01:52:24,195 --> 01:52:27,332
"And from his widow
Blackstone's embrace,

1005
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:32,269
"Alfred turned to the groom
and said, and I quote,

1006
01:52:32,303 --> 01:52:35,374
"'Feller, when you get
in that church

1007
01:52:35,407 --> 01:52:39,210
"'and she says,
"Till death us do part"...

1008
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:42,748
...don't you believe
a word of it.'"

1009
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:54,693
My name is
Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd.

1010
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:57,963
This is Miss Johanna Kidd.

1011
01:53:03,802 --> 01:53:06,270
And that is all the news
of the world we have for you.

1012
01:53:06,303 --> 01:53:07,438
We thank you, and good night.
