1
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,545
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

2
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,088
Tonight, as usual,

3
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:17,383
we will share this time...

4
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:28,227
Just a second...

5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,147
-Where does the shot cut?
-Down here.

6
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:34,608
Down here? You can't see my...
This hand, right?

7
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,068
-No.
-OK.

8
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:41,407
Wait, cut.

9
00:00:42,158 --> 00:00:44,452
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

10
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:48,539
Today on "While you're asleep" we are
accompanying a team of firemen

11
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:50,416
on their nightly rounds.

12
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:53,502
I'm out of breath...

13
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,505
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

14
00:00:56,672 --> 00:01:00,217
Tonight on "While you're asleep"
we'll accompany a team of firemen

15
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:03,179
on their rounds through the city.

16
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:06,932
Not only that, but we'll see
things never before revealed:

17
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,770
how they live, sleep,
what they eat...

18
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:14,440
We'll get an inside look
at this fire station.

19
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,777
Join us for "While you're asleep."

20
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,781
-OK.
-OK?

21
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:27,828
If this is a pain in the ass,
just cut, OK?

22
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:30,164
I don't want to waste the tape.

23
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,501
Andreu, you're the boss, right?

24
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,753
The organizer...

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,756
Yes, I'm in charge of this shift,

26
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:42,301
both inside the fire house
and out fighting fires.

27
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,847
This is our helmet.
It's a full face helmet.

28
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,682
You can put it on, it's clean.

29
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:51,727
I'm going to be the heroine of
"While you're asleep".

30
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,606
Should we put them on?

31
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:59,819
It's easy. You're all so huge,
aren't you?

32
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,613
We're big, yes.
Theres are the boots.

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,657
Our pants are inside the boots.

34
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,952
Like in the cartoons, right?
You jump right in them!

35
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,996
The cartoons copied us,
not the other way around.

36
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,583
I'm a firefighter.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,877
Well, let's see if...

38
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:20,339
-if there’s a call.
-Yeah.

39
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,883
Will you let me go with you?

40
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,385
-Of course.
-OK.

41
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,178
-It's like a lottery.
-A what?

42
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:27,304
A lottery.

43
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:29,014
We might get a call,
we might not.

44
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,266
We'll see if we do...

45
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,518
You'll see, I'll help you out.

46
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:33,477
Perfect.

47
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:34,270
OK.

48
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:38,190
We're going to the dining room.
It's dinner time.

49
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,193
-Will they mind if I come in?
-No, not at all.

50
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,988
-They know you're here.
-We can try that...

51
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:46,907
...that delicious food
that firemen make.

52
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,701
-Exactly. Very good.
-Let's go.

53
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,786
Be careful!
You'll hurt yourself.

54
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,373
-Let's go to the dining room.
-This way.

55
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:57,918
Hello.

56
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,129
-Bon appétit!
-Thanks!

57
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,923
Enjoy your meal.

58
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,635
This is Manu and Alex,
they will join you this evening.

59
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:10,723
Nice to meet you. Please,
keep eating. My name's Angela.

60
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:14,393
We'll accompany you tonight.

61
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:20,691
Finish eating, we'll see you later.

62
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:23,444
-Do you want to go to the museum?
-Yes, after you.

63
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:31,452
Turn around.

64
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,329
I think I'll put it
in your pocket.

65
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:36,332
Won't it bother you
when you put on your belt?

66
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,918
I don't think so.
If it does, we can move it.

67
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,961
Here you have to do everything.

68
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,630
-Let's see...
-Is this right?

69
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,299
-Say something.
-One, two...

70
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,551
-Hello, hello...
-OK, keep going.

71
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,220
A little more.

72
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:52,973
Hello, my name is Manu and
tonight the TV is here.

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,768
-We'll have fun... I don't know.
-OK.

74
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,398
-Ready?
-A tiny step to your right.

75
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,944
You know what?
I'm going to change sides.

76
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,738
-If you don't mind. It's my hair.
-You're here?

77
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,202
So, Alex, tell us what
a normal night is like

78
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,079
here in the fire house.

79
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,291
A normal night
is pretty monotonous because...

80
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,877
-Normal?
-Yes, normal.

81
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:25,923
People think we run around

82
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,925
putting out fires, but

83
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:31,637
around 70% of the calls we get

84
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,931
are for other types of services.

85
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,475
-Like what?
-For example,

86
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,477
broken water mains,

87
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:41,897
or pet rescue, too.

88
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,942
Even though it sounds cliché,
it's true.

89
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,986
Or to...

90
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:51,198
This will sound terrible,
but I'd love the alarm to ring now

91
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:53,868
and everyone to run off.

92
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:56,287
-I don't want anything to happen.
-Let's hope not.

93
00:04:56,454 --> 00:05:00,624
I mean, just to go with you,
to see what your real work is like.

94
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,045
-Don't get me wrong.
-No, no. I understand.

95
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,256
-It's more interesting for you.
-So we can show it.

96
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,175
It's more exciting...
Let's hope nothing happens.

97
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,302
That everything is fine
and nothing happens.

98
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:13,763
-A routine call, right?
-Exactly.

99
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:16,807
So, that's a fireman's life.

100
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,560
Waiting, passing time.

101
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,396
Watching movies

102
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:26,650
-in the living room, right Alex?
-Let's go there.

103
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,985
OK.

104
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,783
I can't take it.

105
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:36,786
What should we do?
Should we go to reception?

106
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,204
-All right.
-OK?

107
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:39,997
We should do something, right?

108
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,541
How exciting!

109
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:44,668
OK.

110
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,466
-Hello. Good evening.
-Good evening.

111
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:54,762
Finally! Women in the fire station.

112
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:57,473
Where are you going?

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,934
-I'm sorry...
-Don't be embarrassed.

114
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:03,354
Time's going by

115
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,775
and it gets quieter.
There's no one here.

116
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:12,196
The dining room is empty.

117
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,407
They're clean.

118
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,454
Here they're sleeping.

119
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:22,957
When the alarm rings,

120
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,252
they jump out of bed

121
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:30,381
and slide down here.

122
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:35,886
The fire trucks are down there.

123
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:37,555
We saw them before.

124
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:41,642
It takes them 3 minutes

125
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:43,978
to get up.

126
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,138
-We'll finish this later.
-We were winning!

127
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,767
Person trapped in apartment,
in need of rescue.

128
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:27,146
Bravo 128 take the call.

129
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,442
What'll we do?

130
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,321
I can't slide down with the camera.

131
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,656
Let's go that way. Run.

132
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:42,495
It's all ready.
They're really fast.

133
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,914
You back there.
On the other side.

134
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,126
I don't know if I can...

135
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,129
It's stuck.

136
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,131
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

137
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,592
Move your legs faster!
One, two, one, two...

138
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,522
Jose's driving.

139
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,566
Alex and Manu are the firemen

140
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,945
we will accompany this evening.

141
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,447
We're going to follow them,
and as we've seen

142
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:22,326
it's not always fires
that gets them all moving,

143
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:23,994
because the entire team goes out.

144
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:27,123
Even if it’s stopping

145
00:08:27,456 --> 00:08:31,335
a water leak, or helping someone
out of their apartment,

146
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:32,586
or a fire...

147
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:35,673
Don't you put on the...

148
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,633
what's it called... the alarm?

149
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,010
We don't normally use it
for services like these

150
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:41,762
because it's not urgent.

151
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,391
But if you want,
we can put it on, no problem.

152
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,685
-What do you think?
-No, I don't think so.

153
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:50,438
No? Well...

154
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:52,523
What's your show called?

155
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,275
"While you're asleep".

156
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,445
"While you're asleep"?
Then who watches it?

157
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,491
We have to do another take.
I said alarm, not siren.

158
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:06,829
Did it make sense?
Alarm...

159
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,841
-Ready? Come on.
-Let's go.

160
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:19,925
Let's go.

161
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,726
-What are you taking with you?
-Tools. We have everything

162
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:31,228
here in this case, tools

163
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,564
to open locks and doors.

164
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:36,859
We're here with Alex and Manu.

165
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,404
We're almost at

166
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,741
the house that called for help.

167
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,410
The police are here.

168
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:49,246
We can see a police car.

169
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:52,500
Maybe it's more serious
than we thought.

170
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,585
-We'll find out soon.
-No, I don't think it is.

171
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:55,878
Let's go in.

172
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,297
Good evening.

173
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,093
Don't worry.

174
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,261
A woman was screaming.

175
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,266
We were called
so we came over.

176
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,893
Please calm down.

177
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,687
-Screams? Noises?
-She lives alone with her cats.

178
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,689
-Did you make the call?
-No.

179
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,900
It was me.

180
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,735
-It was you?
-Yes.

181
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,909
I heard screams
so I called the police.

182
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,911
Let's go. She's upstairs.

183
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,288
Let's go upstairs.

184
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,291
It's about time.

185
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,293
We got a call and came over.

186
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,671
OK, this way please.

187
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,215
-What the hell is this?
-A local TV crew.

188
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:44,552
Please, stay here.

189
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,304
Sure, we'll sleep here if you want.

190
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,597
Miss, miss!

191
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,268
Please let us work, OK?

192
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,147
-They aren't yours, are they?
-No, they're from a local TV station.

193
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:58,607
They're doing a report
on how we work

194
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,402
-so they came with us.
-They're your responsibility.

195
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:02,987
Ladies and gentlemen!

196
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,947
Please stay in the hall.

197
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,991
Am I speaking Greek or what?

198
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,578
If I tell you to stop,
you stop taping.

199
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,121
If I tell you to get lost,
you get lost. Got it?

200
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,790
Ok. But we have permission.

201
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,584
The old lady lives
on the first floor.

202
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:17,918
What happened?

203
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,670
It looks like she fell.

204
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,298
They heard her scream
and called...

205
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,051
What about
those people downstairs?

206
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,137
She was screaming bloody murder.

207
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,806
The neighbors say
she's really weird.

208
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,894
She never goes out,
has no family...

209
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:41,317
Please, can you go with them?

210
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,903
Go down there.

211
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:51,202
Don't they have
anything better to do?

212
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:54,455
Go downstairs, damn it!

213
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,957
-Get out of the way.
-Sorry, sorry.

214
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:03,923
-What's the camera doing here?
-They're with the firemen.

215
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,219
We have permission, OK?

216
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:11,389
I'm going to do an introduction.

217
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,766
-Am I OK here?
-Yeah.

218
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,186
OK.

219
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,980
We're in front of the door

220
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:24,235
where an elderly resident

221
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:27,154
has had some sort of problem.
The neighbors heard screams.

222
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:30,282
Mari Carmen, who called
the fire department

223
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,242
says...

224
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,911
It's OK.

225
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:36,080
Whoa...

226
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,250
Ma'am, this is the police.

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,294
We're here to help you.
Can you hear me?

228
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:45,673
Ma'am, this is the police.

229
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,509
-Turn off the camera.
-I'm sorry.

230
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:58,394
Ma'am, can you hear the ambulance?

231
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,231
Don't worry. We're going
to take you to the hospital.

232
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,734
What's her name?

233
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:05,776
Conchita.

234
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:09,363
Conchita! Don't worry...

235
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:13,659
Come on, come on...

236
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,995
Don't worry,
the police are here.

237
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:25,171
What happened? Is she alright?

238
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,422
Shit...

239
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:30,259
-The light, please!
-Yeah, turn off the light.

240
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,345
Keep rolling.

241
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:37,767
-Stop taping!
-Sorry, OK. It's off.

242
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:42,063
Unit 341, please send
an ambulance immediately.

243
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,192
First floor.

244
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:49,070
OK. It's very urgent.

245
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:57,453
The ambulance is here,
don't worry, ma'am.

246
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,247
Sergio, move this, damn it.

247
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,376
I don't want anyone here
while we wait for the ambulance.

248
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,802
Fuck, she's biting him!

249
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,013
Pablo, what do I do?

250
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:19,934
Get her off him!

251
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:27,691
Holy shit! Get him out of here!

252
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:31,487
Help! Help!

253
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,533
-Stay with her, Alex!
-OK.

254
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,869
Help me!
Get out of the way.

255
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:42,748
Hurry, hurry.

256
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,084
Holy fucking shit!

257
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,128
Get out of the way!

258
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:49,797
Hurry! Be careful!

259
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:51,215
-You got him?
-Yeah.

260
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,591
Tape everything.

261
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:56,137
OK, wait.
Get up!

262
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:59,306
Pablo, tape fucking everything.

263
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,017
Holy shit, he's going
to bleed to death.

264
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,103
-You got it?
-Yeah, yeah.

265
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,607
Stop, stop.

266
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,192
We have to stop the bleeding.

267
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,278
Come on, quick.
Here.

268
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,489
-I can't!
-Press here!

269
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:19,702
What the fuck's going on?
The light!

270
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,996
The light!

271
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:24,290
Quick! The light!

272
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:27,960
Fuck, come on!

273
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,338
Be careful! Cover it up!

274
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:39,472
Get out of the way.

275
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,101
They won't let us out.

276
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:47,354
-Why not?
-I don't know, they said we can't.

277
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,941
This man is wounded.
We have to get him out.

278
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,528
-We have to make a compress.
-Are you a doctor?

279
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:58,616
-I'm an intern.
-Take him over there.

280
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,079
Be careful with his head.

281
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,165
Hold him up.

282
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:22,848
Call an ambulance.

283
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,018
The door is blocked from outside.
What the fuck is going on?

284
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,687
We need an ambulance, now!

285
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:30,523
Calm down, please.

286
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,233
Silence, please!

287
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,735
Please listen.

288
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,239
The health authorities
have decided to seal off

289
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,449
the building for safety reasons.

290
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,705
We're working to get you out
as soon as possible.

291
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:49,083
We ask for your cooperation.

292
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,627
The agents that are with you

293
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,922
will keep you posted
on what to do.

294
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:58,843
Follow their instructions

295
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,637
and remain calm. Thank you.

296
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,849
-What the...?
-Shit!

297
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:11,188
341, 341!

298
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,315
Please!

299
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,860
-What do you mean I can't...
-My friend's about to...

300
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:18,529
We are aware of the situation.
We can't do anything for now.

301
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:21,073
We'll keep you updated.

302
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,200
-Fuck!
-What did they say?

303
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,661
We have to get him out of here.
He's bleeding to death!

304
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,330
We have to get him out of here.

305
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,459
What's going on?
Why can't we leave?

306
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,545
We just can't.
Just calm down.

307
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,797
Please, stop taping,
for fuck's sake.

308
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:38,632
-Don't touch the camera!
-Why not?

309
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,469
Do not touch the camera!

310
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,721
We have to let everyone know
what's going on here!

311
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:46,057
-Fucking hell!
-Calm down.

312
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:50,186
I'm in charge here, and I say
turn it off and calm down.

313
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:52,438
Then worry about
what's going on,

314
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,941
not about whether
we tape or not.

315
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,693
Yeah. Find out what's going on.

316
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,279
-Tape this!
-Please!

317
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:05,951
OK, OK! We have to get
this man out of here!

318
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,206
-What's behind that shutter?
-A textile workshop.

319
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:13,209
-What do you mean?
-A textile workshop.

320
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:17,546
OK. Everyone, calm down.

321
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,091
-Is there a way out from there?
-Yes, through the back.

322
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:23,010
Wait a second,
move over there.

323
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:25,262
-How does this thing open?
-Please!

324
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,933
I'm not going to repeat this.
Move over there.

325
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:32,937
-What are you doing?
-Trying to get out of here.

326
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,314
Wait a second!

327
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,151
My husband's outside
and says there are loads of cops.

328
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,530
They've blocked off the street.

329
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,907
He was getting antibiotics for her.

330
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,245
Holy shit!

331
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,417
Alex!

332
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,503
No, don't move him!

333
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,631
-Yes, we have to.
-He has a pulse, don't move him!

334
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,093
-Alex! Alex!
-Shit!

335
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,016
There's somebody upstairs!

336
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,894
-Don't move him!
-Look after him.

337
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,564
Please, come with me.

338
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:20,443
We're going upstairs.

339
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,866
Nobody move from here, OK!

340
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,452
And you, stop fucking recording!

341
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,209
I don't care what they say,
we have to tape this.

342
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:40,463
We have to show
what's happening.

343
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:45,676
-What was that?
-I don't know, be careful.

344
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,309
Fuck!

345
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,689
It's coming from in there.

346
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:05,571
-Be careful.
-Where are they?

347
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,711
Move over.

348
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,885
Pablo, don't...

349
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,055
-No, Pablo, come here.
-Be quiet.

350
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,682
Pablo, come here!

351
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,659
What's going on?

352
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,704
What the fuck are you doing here?

353
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:58,165
Be careful.

354
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,167
She's dead.

355
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,922
Don't move, ma'am.

356
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:10,678
Ma'am.

357
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,638
Don't move!

358
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,783
Let's go.

359
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,245
Shejumped on me...

360
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,664
I know, relax.

361
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,167
-You saw her, right?
-Yeah, I did.

362
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,919
-I couldn't do anything.
-Let's go downstairs.

363
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,589
I know, don't worry.
Let's go.

364
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,049
Fucking asshole!

365
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,712
-Did you get it?
-I got everything.

366
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,343
-Let me see it.
-Don't worry. I got it.

367
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,597
Fucking show it to me!
How do I have to say it?

368
00:22:56,492 --> 00:22:58,786
Get this, Pablo! Come on!

369
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:05,584
You stay here with the wounded.

370
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,628
I'm going to check the exit.

371
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:08,879
Just a second.

372
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:13,092
We have strict orders
to stay in the hall.

373
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,885
Help me out here.

374
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:19,515
These men are dying.
Fuck orders!

375
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:23,185
He's right.
You shouldn't tell us...

376
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,731
There are two dead people,

377
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:29,066
that died violent deaths.

378
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,445
And two that need urgent
medical attention.

379
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,697
The police have blocked
off the area,

380
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:38,075
they are keeping us in here,
with no explanations.

381
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:41,162
So, we're searching
for another way out.

382
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:42,872
She's getting worse.

383
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,791
Her fever's gone up.
She needs a doctor.

384
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,877
Listen up.

385
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:51,338
Do not try to leave the building.

386
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:54,425
All exits have been sealed.

387
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:57,636
A BNC protocol situation
has been declared.

388
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:03,225
Shortly a health inspector
will come to assess the situation.

389
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,436
Thank you for your cooperation.

390
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:07,772
Why are we locked in here?

391
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:10,649
And what do they mean
by a health inspector?

392
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,736
-I don't know.
-What's a BNC protocol?

393
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,365
What's a BNC protocol?
What does BNC mean?

394
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:18,991
It's a procedure used

395
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,036
in Biological, Nuclear,
or Chemical threat situations.

396
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,245
What? Nuclear?

397
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:26,999
It's more usual than you think.

398
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,419
The wounded are stable,
but they won't hang on much longer.

399
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:33,964
-We have to get them out of here.
-Obviously not through here.

400
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,759
So, Ladies, Gentlemen,
come this way.

401
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:39,512
No! There's something more
to this place.

402
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,015
Our cells don't work.
Neither does the TV or radio.

403
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,893
-We're isolated. Why?
-I don't know why.

404
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,062
I can't get through
to my husband.

405
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,315
-And my daughter has a high fever.
-What's wrong with her?

406
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,067
She has tonsillitis.

407
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:56,987
-She's burning up.
-What can I do?

408
00:24:57,154 --> 00:25:00,908
From the office
we can jump down on the patio.

409
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,618
I'm going with you.

410
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:03,786
Where are you going?

411
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,040
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, it's not very high up.

412
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:10,334
How are we going to get in?

413
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:13,337
What?

414
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:23,139
The concierge has a copy of the key.

415
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,434
I gave it to him.
I'm in charge of the building.

416
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,060
Let's go.

417
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:32,273
There was someone else
in the woman's apartment.

418
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,941
What do you mean someone else?
Who?

419
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,609
I don't know. A girl.

420
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:39,447
Probably the Colombian girl.
Why didn't she come down with you?

421
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,115
She's dead.

422
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:44,452
Let's go. Open it, quick!

423
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:54,045
This way.

424
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,214
It's this way.

425
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:59,008
Let's go.

426
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,511
Help me.

427
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:04,513
Fuck...

428
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,142
Go back immediately,
for your own safety.

429
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,436
No, listen!

430
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,937
Get back.

431
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,232
We're sealing off the building.

432
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,403
-Ready up there? Go ahead.
-Listen!

433
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,156
Listen to me!

434
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,038
Listen! Can you see me?

435
00:26:30,581 --> 00:26:32,291
Can you hear me?

436
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,004
What are you doing there?
I told you to wait downstairs.

437
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:40,132
Remember I'm still in charge.

438
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,427
-You knew about this, didn't you?
-About what?

439
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:46,430
That they're sealing us in.
Like hamsters!

440
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:48,724
Step back!
For your own safety.

441
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:51,060
-What the hell is this?
-You tell us!

442
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:52,478
I don't know!

443
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,855
-I repeat, step back!
-You! That's enough!

444
00:26:55,022 --> 00:26:57,400
-Why?
-Stop messing with the camera.

445
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,778
We have to show
what's going on.

446
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,571
-Don't you get it?
-Don't touch me.

447
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:05,116
It's the only proof we have.
Can't you see that?

448
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:09,328
You're locked in here just like us.
They don't care about you either.

449
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,164
Shut up!

450
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:16,377
Please, go down to the workshop.

451
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:19,880
-Let's all calm down.
-Shut up!

452
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,092
Yes, we're going. Put the gun down.

453
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,264
Remain calm.

454
00:27:28,597 --> 00:27:32,351
We apologize for the inconvenience.

455
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,812
It is of utmost importance

456
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:38,024
that you follow the agent's
instructions.

457
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,484
He is in the building with you.

458
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:43,237
Do not try to leave the building.

459
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:47,199
I repeat, do not try
to leave the building.

460
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,628
Hold this. Relax, man...

461
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:01,922
Let's go with the others.

462
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:06,427
I'm really sorry.

463
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:09,013
Please, go downstairs.

464
00:28:11,182 --> 00:28:13,184
-Let's go.
-Thanks.

465
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,524
Let me go up to my apartment.

466
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,612
I have sutures and bandages...

467
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,448
Yes...

468
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:39,794
It's nearly 2 a.m. and we're
still sealed in this building that

469
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,130
we came to with the firemen
earlier this evening,

470
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:46,384
to assist an elderly lady
who later attacked a policeman

471
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,721
and a fireman. They're both
in critical condition.

472
00:28:50,888 --> 00:28:54,934
The police won't let us leave
and are giving us no explanations.

473
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,604
The neighbors are scared to death.

474
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,273
They want to go back home,

475
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,275
they want to know
what's going on.

476
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:48,404
Guillem, do you mind if
I ask you a few quick questions?

477
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:53,117
I've never been in such
a serious situation before.

478
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:56,495
I'm an intern. I give shots,

479
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,790
take people's blood pressure.
I live in this building.

480
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,918
Well, the injured are
in critical condition.

481
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:04,754
This is very serious.

482
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:08,340
The police have several bite wounds.

483
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,009
He's very injured.

484
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:12,094
What's obvious is that

485
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:15,264
Mrs. Izquierdo attacked
and bit them.

486
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:16,849
I guess

487
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:20,853
she had a fit of hysteria.

488
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,314
But honestly, it's hard to believe.

489
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:24,398
That...

490
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:28,611
an old lady could do
something like this to two adults.

491
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:30,613
I guess when the doctor arrives,

492
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,575
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded,

493
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,494
he'll tell us what's going on.

494
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,206
We're locked in here, the police
are outside, we can't get out,

495
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,584
we have no explanations.
They know these men are here,

496
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:47,797
and we have to get them out soon.
They've lost a lot of blood.

497
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:49,673
I can't do anything else.

498
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,134
Stay with them. Thanks.

499
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,597
We're going to keep on interviewing.
If you don't like something

500
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,599
you can cut. OK?

501
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:02,311
I would like you to tell us

502
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:05,439
what's happened this evening,

503
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:08,818
what's gone on.

504
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:12,113
I can't say too much because
I was sleeping.

505
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,241
I heard loud screams.

506
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:18,536
Of course I woke him up,
threw on what clothes I could,

507
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:19,995
and came down here.

508
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:23,165
I have to change my clothes,
I can't...

509
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:25,668
Something strange is going on.

510
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:28,671
Someone did something,
that's why we're locked in here.

511
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:30,381
This building has always been...

512
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:34,510
-Wait! Can I talk?
-Why can't I say it?

513
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,928
There's something...

514
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:39,640
Yes, someone said that there was a...

515
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:42,935
-An office, a window...
-I don't know what it's called.

516
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,979
A... That there was a...

517
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:48,107
what they used to do when
there were atomic bombs.

518
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,985
-A BNC protocol.
-A refuge or something.

519
00:31:51,152 --> 00:31:52,903
What a ruckus.

520
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,781
If we knew that when you got here,
we would have said:

521
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,950
Look, this is what happened.
Let everyone know.

522
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,661
-But we have no idea.
-But, in summary...

523
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:04,165
Fireman, fireman, yes....

524
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:09,879
Fireman fell! Fireman fell!

525
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,591
-He fell and left...
-Fell from where?

526
00:32:13,758 --> 00:32:17,178
From up there... up, yes.

527
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,106
-You were saying?
-He fell from above.

528
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:30,608
From where?

529
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:34,653
Where? I don't know.

530
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,198
But from above, right?
I don't know.

531
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:40,201
-From the stairwell?
-Yes.

532
00:32:41,702 --> 00:32:44,580
Stairwell like this and...

533
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:48,209
he fell in the middle. Yes.

534
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,379
Pablo, is this OK or should
I sit lower?

535
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,506
At her level.

536
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,259
What's your name?
I want everyone to know.

537
00:32:57,426 --> 00:33:01,347
-Jennifer.
-What a beautiful name, Jennifer!

538
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:04,141
-How old are you?
-Seven.

539
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:06,977
She just had her birthday.

540
00:33:07,436 --> 00:33:11,607
Great. So what happened?
Are you sick?

541
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:12,858
Yes.

542
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:18,155
We know you can't take
your medicine, right?

543
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:19,365
Yes.

544
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,742
Why not?

545
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,578
Because my husband isn't allowed in.

546
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:28,916
Please do not speak right now,

547
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,752
only the girl is in the shot and...

548
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,003
-Sorry.
-Since there is no microphone,

549
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,047
we can't hear your voice
and everything gets messed up.

550
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,883
We'll interview you later, OK?

551
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,468
You don't have to...

552
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:42,513
So, besides your father...

553
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,473
Who do you live with?

554
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:48,060
With my mommy, my daddy

555
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,187
and my dog, Max.

556
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:53,524
Your dog isn't here either, right?
I can't see him.

557
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,900
No, he's not.

558
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,486
-Do you love your dog?
-Yes.

559
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,947
Why isn't he here?

560
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,742
He's at the vet.

561
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:07,163
-What's wrong with him?
-He got sick.

562
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:11,042
I knew something would happen
sooner or later.

563
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,587
A fire or something serious.

564
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,049
There must be something upstairs.

565
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:21,761
If not, I don't get why people
fall like that...

566
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,390
they fall down through
the stairwell, bleeding all over.

567
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:30,144
I can't go up to my house.

568
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,896
So, here we are.

569
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,482
I am going to sue.

570
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:37,568
I am definitely going to sue.

571
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:41,655
I'm going to call the newspapers,

572
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:45,951
and have them write
about what happened.

573
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:51,290
From the beginning until the very end.

574
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,252
-Cesar?
-Hello.

575
00:34:55,419 --> 00:34:59,048
Hi. Sorry, but could I ask you
a few questions?

576
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,925
Wait... OK, yes.

577
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,136
We want to cover the story.

578
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:07,807
-Are you recording already?
-No.

579
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,976
-OK, rolling.
-Wait, I'll sit like this.

580
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:15,314
If you prefer
one side in particular...

581
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,942
Have you lived here for long?

582
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,279
Yes, I used to live with my mom.
She died, so now I live alone.

583
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:30,079
It's the Chinese.

584
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:33,791
They eat raw.

585
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:37,628
Raw fish. It smells...

586
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:39,964
They always leave the door open.

587
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:42,091
I don't know why.

588
00:35:42,258 --> 00:35:45,344
I mean, if they were the nice kind
that do Feng Shui

589
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:48,222
and cool stuff... But no.

590
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:52,226
They come in and out screaming
in Chinese all the time,

591
00:35:52,393 --> 00:35:56,397
in Japanese, I don't know.
Something I don't understand.

592
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:58,607
When are we starting?

593
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:02,278
-We did.
-Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,197
Don't you see my face is shiny?

595
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:08,826
I think this profile's better, right?

596
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:12,079
-Yes. Great.
-Like this, Pablo?

597
00:36:12,246 --> 00:36:13,164
Good.

598
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:16,292
OK, silence please.

599
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:19,253
Silence. Ma'am.

600
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,965
-I just spoke to them outside.
-It's about time!

601
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:27,303
They told me the health inspector
is on his way in.

602
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:29,138
-Health inspector?
-Yes.

603
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:33,225
There is a possible infection
in the building.

604
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,477
An infection?

605
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:37,021
Yes, but please calm down.

606
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:40,066
They’re just going to take
blood samples

607
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:43,069
of all the residents
to clarify things.

608
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:46,322
-Only of the residents?
-No, of everyone here.

609
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:49,075
When they see everything's OK,

610
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,827
they'll let us out.

611
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:52,620
Great.

612
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:54,413
We ask you to cooperate.

613
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,167
We're going to check

614
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,586
if everyone is here.

615
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:03,172
A simple "here" will be fine, OK?

616
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:04,840
Let's start.

617
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:09,095
The main floor on the left
is the office where we were before.

618
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:12,348
Who lives in the apartment
on the right?

619
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:15,559
That's the Colombian girl's apartment.

620
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,730
First floor, right...

621
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:22,024
That's where Mrs. Izquierdo
lives, right?

622
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:23,442
-First floor, left?
-Me.

623
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,195
Me, my daughter and my husband
who's been outside for a long time.

624
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:29,323
Yes, we know, lady. Calm down.

625
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:31,575
-Second floor, left?
-Us.

626
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:33,619
-You?
-No, we're the third.

627
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:35,746
-No, we live...
-Do you or don't you?

628
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:38,082
-Third...
-We live on the second.

629
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:41,419
-I'm lost.
-Calm down, sir, you're tired.

630
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:43,254
Second, left.

631
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:45,881
-Yes. Second, right?
-Present.

632
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:47,758
-Third, left?
-Here.

633
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:50,094
-Third, right?
-Yes, that's us!

634
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:52,555
-You three?
-No, four of us.

635
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:53,848
-Four?
-My father.

636
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:56,892
-Your father?
-He upstairs.

637
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,729
-Where is he?
-He on bed.

638
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:02,440
My father sick.

639
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:06,027
What she means is
he's old and paralytic.

640
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:09,363
-Exactly, my father is sick.
-Maybe all this is his fault.

641
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,948
Listen up!

642
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:13,784
We're going to finish.

643
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,745
Does anyone live in the penthouse?

644
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,788
No, nobody lives there.

645
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:20,499
A man from Madrid owns it,
but he's never there.

646
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,376
It's been closed up for years.

647
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:24,587
Excuse me?

648
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:27,131
-My father come down, yes?
-That's not a good idea,

649
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:29,967
what if he's the cause of all this.

650
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,469
My father's sick!

651
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:34,597
-He has to come down here with us.
-I don't understand you.

652
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:38,934
Be respectful. Calm down.

653
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:41,395
Your child is sick too and...

654
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:43,314
My daughter has tonsillitis!

655
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,692
Nobody move until the doctor says so.

656
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:54,784
We're going in.
Don't open the door until we say so.

657
00:38:58,496 --> 00:38:59,914
Wait.

658
00:39:10,508 --> 00:39:11,801
Go ahead, 341.

659
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,386
OK, over.

660
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:22,019
What's this?

661
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:32,988
They'll keep telling us
nothing's wrong, right?

662
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,719
Pablo, I'm going in.

663
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:56,846
-OK.
-As we...

664
00:39:57,012 --> 00:40:01,183
As we were told, the health inspector
is in the building.

665
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,979
There are incredible
security measures in place.

666
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,522
We know nothing,

667
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:09,608
they haven't told us a thing.

668
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:13,279
We saw Special Forces,
health inspectors

669
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,698
wearing suits and masks

670
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:19,910
and it's not very comforting.

671
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:24,206
That's all we know.

672
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:28,544
Take me to them.
The rest stay here.

673
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:32,965
What is a TV crew doing here?

674
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:50,024
Jennifer! Don't touch that.

675
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:52,234
-Why?
-Because I say so.

676
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,299
Pablo, can you come here?

677
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:24,642
Thanks.
What a pain in the ass.

678
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:28,979
Don't you think this inspection
has to do with that old lady?

679
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:30,648
I don't know.

680
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:35,653
The policeman and the fireman
have been bitten.

681
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,740
If it's contagious, they could react
like the old lady.

682
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,784
Don't scare me...

683
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:44,078
Fuck, what a day.

684
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,420
Pablo, grab the camera.
I can't sit here doing nothing.

685
00:41:56,132 --> 00:42:00,261
It's recording...
and the lens is dirty.

686
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,431
Someone's been messing around here.

687
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:06,600
It doesn't matter.
Let's try to get something.

688
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:17,695
Shit!

689
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:21,282
Come here.

690
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:28,748
There. Look.

691
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:30,791
Hold this.

692
00:42:34,086 --> 00:42:35,629
Be careful, Pablo.

693
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,174
Give it to me.

694
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,678
Can you see anything?

695
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:45,765
What can you see?

696
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:49,894
-They're handcuffing him.
-Who?

697
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,315
Pablo, what can you see?

698
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,986
Tell me what you see!

699
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:07,953
Say something!

700
00:43:17,088 --> 00:43:20,466
-What are they saying?
-I can't hear them.

701
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:34,230
-What's that?
-What?

702
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:37,775
I don't know. The doctor
has something in his hands.

703
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:41,821
-It's a needle.
-What's he doing?

704
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:44,615
-I don't know. Wait.
-What are they doing, Pablo?

705
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:59,547
They're injecting the fireman
with something.

706
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:09,682
Pablo!

707
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:13,227
More handcuffs.

708
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,363
-Holy shit!
-What's going on?

709
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:29,118
Shit!

710
00:44:29,577 --> 00:44:31,495
What's that, Pablo?

711
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:34,915
Say something!
What's going on in there?

712
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,253
Why are they screaming?

713
00:44:41,964 --> 00:44:43,799
Pablo, answer me!

714
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,718
Go, go. Run!

715
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:49,805
-What's going on in there?
-Go, go!

716
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:51,766
What's going on?

717
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:58,272
What are you doing?
Guillem's in there.

718
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:00,858
Guillem's still in there!

719
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:03,361
He got bitten, we can't let him out.

720
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:06,364
-What are you talking about?
-He didn't bite me!

721
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,574
It spreads through saliva.

722
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:11,077
We can't risk letting him out.

723
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:14,580
We don't know if he's been bitten!

724
00:45:14,663 --> 00:45:16,415
The infected ones are handcuffed.

725
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:19,168
Just stay away from them.

726
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:21,087
Infected with what?

727
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:25,299
-What's going on?
-A minute ago they were fine!

728
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:27,259
What the fuck is all this about?

729
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:31,597
The reaction time depends
on the blood type. We can't predict...

730
00:45:35,643 --> 00:45:38,479
Fuck! Hurry up! Run!

731
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:43,401
Come on, hurry up!

732
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:51,367
Now tell us
what the hell is going on here.

733
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:54,662
-I'm not authorized...
-Bullshit!

734
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:58,124
I just killed a cop
who tried to bite us.

735
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:02,336
Tell us everything you know.

736
00:46:02,503 --> 00:46:04,380
OK.

737
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:09,844
Yesterday we received

738
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:12,513
a call from a vet

739
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,767
who had a dog brought in
with an unknown disease.

740
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:19,603
The dog went into a coma

741
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:22,898
and a few moments later came to

742
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:27,028
and was extraordinarily aggressive.

743
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,947
He started attacking all of
the pets at the clinic.

744
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,702
We had to give him
several tranquilizers

745
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:36,495
and then put him to sleep.

746
00:46:36,662 --> 00:46:40,624
We followed the chip in his ear
which led us to this building.

747
00:46:42,835 --> 00:46:46,047
-Was the dog called Max?
-Yes.

748
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,973
She only has tonsillitis.

749
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:59,060
-Bullshit, tonsillitis.
-Relax, ma'am...

750
00:46:59,894 --> 00:47:02,063
We just have to be sure.

751
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:05,024
Calm down.

752
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:08,694
It’s just tonsillitis.

753
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:12,198
We think the dog spread the infection

754
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:15,034
through his saliva.

755
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:16,577
If that’s true...

756
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,841
Handcuffs! Get the handcuffs!

757
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:34,178
-Hold her!
-Jennifer!

758
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:38,057
Jennifer!

759
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:41,060
The cuffs!

760
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:45,398
Jennifer!

761
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:48,984
Relax, we'll get her.

762
00:47:51,278 --> 00:47:54,365
Father downstairs.
My father come down!

763
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:57,201
-What father?
-Her father's sick in bed.

764
00:47:57,368 --> 00:47:59,036
And you didn't tell me?

765
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:02,998
We can't have infected people
loose out there.

766
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:07,336
We gave you specific orders
to get everyone together downstairs.

767
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:10,464
We had no idea. We thought
everyone was here.

768
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:15,553
Take this. Get her
and inject her with this.

769
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,430
Everyone must come down here.

770
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:21,726
Get this on tape!

771
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:23,686
Be careful, Pablo!

772
00:48:28,024 --> 00:48:29,316
Jennifer?

773
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:39,660
What the hell is that?

774
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,170
Fucking hell!

775
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:53,299
-The old lady isn't there.
-Neither is the other one.

776
00:49:10,024 --> 00:49:11,567
Jennifer?

777
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,575
Jennifer.

778
00:49:30,086 --> 00:49:32,046
There's no one here. Wait.

779
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:37,426
She's over there. Look!

780
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:39,512
Fuck!

781
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:45,142
Jennifer, relax.

782
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:49,063
Relax.

783
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,357
Give me the needle.
The needle!

784
00:49:51,524 --> 00:49:52,983
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

785
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,113
Be careful, man.

786
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:01,575
Jennifer.

787
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,787
Relax.

788
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,624
Give me your hand.

789
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:13,337
-Be careful.
-Give me your hand.

790
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:16,799
What happened to her eyes?

791
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:35,693
Shit!

792
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:46,245
Be careful!

793
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:51,042
Shit! Get out of the way!

794
00:50:56,589 --> 00:51:00,009
Go, she bit me!

795
00:51:00,551 --> 00:51:03,179
She bit me, can't you see?

796
00:51:03,721 --> 00:51:05,639
Go, for fuck's sake!

797
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:28,371
Go!

798
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:32,083
Let's go!

799
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,503
No down!

800
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,713
Don't go down there!

801
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:41,550
They're getting away!

802
00:51:47,223 --> 00:51:49,225
Help me!

803
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:58,109
Take these off of me!

804
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:00,736
-Don't touch me!
-Son of a bitch!

805
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:03,531
Take them off!

806
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:07,368
I don't have it.

807
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:09,704
I don't have the key!

808
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,372
What do you mean?

809
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:15,000
-The policeman has it.
-Fuck!

810
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:17,294
-The shutter!
-What?

811
00:52:22,508 --> 00:52:25,928
Help!

812
00:52:27,555 --> 00:52:30,433
Help, you bastard!

813
00:52:31,058 --> 00:52:32,435
Don't go!

814
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:36,939
Get away!

815
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,108
We have to get her out of here.

816
00:52:40,192 --> 00:52:42,862
-Let's go.
-No!

817
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,489
I'm sorry!

818
00:52:45,656 --> 00:52:48,075
Don't leave me here!

819
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,332
This way, come on.

820
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:56,876
Hurry up!

821
00:52:57,793 --> 00:52:59,378
The lock!

822
00:53:22,568 --> 00:53:24,487
It looks like they're leaving.

823
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:26,322
They're going upstairs.

824
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:30,326
-Were you bitten?
-No.

825
00:53:30,493 --> 00:53:31,369
-Angela?
-No.

826
00:53:31,535 --> 00:53:33,329
-You?
-No.

827
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:36,540
-Did you find the little girl?
-Who cares about the girl?

828
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:38,709
It's out of control.

829
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:42,671
Pablo, what the hell were they
doing to that woman?

830
00:53:43,047 --> 00:53:47,218
They were eating her alive, Manu.
What the hell is this?

831
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:49,470
I don't know!

832
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:52,431
They could all be infected by now.

833
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:56,811
-We have to get out of here.
-I'm not moving!

834
00:53:56,977 --> 00:54:01,148
No! We can stay here

835
00:54:01,649 --> 00:54:04,193
until they come to get us.
These things...

836
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,071
No one's going to come get us!

837
00:54:07,238 --> 00:54:09,115
-Yes!
-Open your fucking eyes!

838
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:12,743
They don't give a shit!
They're going to let us die here!

839
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,288
But the doctor
does matter to them.

840
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:19,291
-They'll come get the doctor.
-The doctor? Why?

841
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,002
-He is in there.
-Son of a bitch!

842
00:54:22,169 --> 00:54:23,963
-Where?
-There!

843
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,882
I'm gonna kill you!

844
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:30,886
I've been bitten. Go away.

845
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:33,097
Get lost.

846
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:35,224
I've been bitten!

847
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:36,809
Get back!

848
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:41,772
Go away!

849
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:43,399
Shit, shit...

850
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:48,612
The door won't hold.

851
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:52,199
-Go away.
-Son of a bitch!

852
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,702
Get us out of here!

853
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:57,163
Stand away from the windows!

854
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,374
We repeat:
Stay away from the windows

855
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:03,753
or we will be forced
to take drastic measures.

856
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:07,548
Follow the inspector's
instructions.

857
00:55:11,302 --> 00:55:13,387
There might be a way out.

858
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,684
Pablo, there might be a way out!

859
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:21,854
Listen!

860
00:55:22,021 --> 00:55:25,441
There's an underground storage
area in the workshop

861
00:55:25,608 --> 00:55:29,445
that has a drain cover that joins
up with the sewers.

862
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:31,489
Can you hear me?

863
00:55:32,907 --> 00:55:36,494
-In the workshop there's a basement...
-Are you sure?

864
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,831
Yes, we can escape through there.
The problem is the reinforced door.

865
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:44,293
-How the hell will we open it?
-With the key!

866
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:47,671
The intern is in charge.
He has all the keys.

867
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,424
-Where?
-In his apartment.

868
00:56:02,978 --> 00:56:05,022
Let's go! Let's go!

869
00:56:05,272 --> 00:56:07,233
He's been bitten!

870
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,321
Hurry up!

871
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,621
They're not there.

872
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:30,172
Manu, we have to find the way out.
We need the storage key.

873
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:32,591
Yeah, but... how?

874
00:56:32,758 --> 00:56:35,803
The intern has the key,
but we don't know where he lives.

875
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,638
You checked the list!

876
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:40,141
-I can't remember.
-Pablo?

877
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:42,101
I don't remember either.

878
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:47,106
Manu, think.
I'm sure you can remember.

879
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:51,068
-I can't remember!
-Think, Manu!

880
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:54,780
Guillem! The mailboxes!

881
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:56,782
He's called Guillem...

882
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:12,506
Downstairs, quick!
Angela, hurry up!

883
00:57:12,673 --> 00:57:14,425
Hurry up!

884
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:28,230
Guillem Marimón, third floor n°2!

885
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:33,486
She's cuffed.
We can get by.

886
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:36,739
We have to go upstairs.

887
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,910
Upstairs!

888
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:03,307
Be careful, Angela!

889
00:58:10,648 --> 00:58:12,066
Pablo, help me!

890
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,620
Wait. OK.

891
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:26,831
Drop her.

892
00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:41,137
-I got bitten!
-No, you didn't.

893
00:58:41,303 --> 00:58:43,389
I saw it. You didn't.

894
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,725
Let's go upstairs.
Pablo, help.

895
00:58:45,891 --> 00:58:49,478
-Come on, get up.
-I got bitten!

896
00:58:49,645 --> 00:58:52,732
You did not, Angela.
I saw it, you didn't.

897
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:56,652
Let's go, Pablo! Hurry up!

898
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:58,946
Hurry up!

899
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,532
Shit!

900
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:04,952
-The light!
-Where's the switch?

901
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,122
-On the wall!
-I can't find it!

902
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:11,792
-Pablo, the spotlight! Turn it on!
-I'm trying!

903
00:59:11,959 --> 00:59:12,626
Quickly!

904
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:20,968
Move it! Move it!

905
00:59:29,393 --> 00:59:31,896
Shit! Go upstairs, hurry!

906
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:46,702
The mallet, Angela!

907
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:49,997
Go upstairs, quickly!

908
00:59:55,294 --> 00:59:56,337
It's here.

909
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,092
Move.

910
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,100
Hurry up. I'll wait here.

911
01:00:19,902 --> 01:00:21,237
I'll go there.

912
01:00:26,492 --> 01:00:28,035
Where are they?

913
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:30,413
Look in the drawers.

914
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:33,541
Where the hell are they?

915
01:00:35,793 --> 01:00:37,461
We have to get out.

916
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:41,757
-Here, here!
-Shit, where are they?

917
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:47,221
Shit!

918
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:57,982
The keys...

919
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:01,027
Where are...

920
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:20,254
The keys!

921
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:23,841
Which ones are they?

922
01:01:25,134 --> 01:01:26,469
Which ones are they?

923
01:01:26,635 --> 01:01:28,763
I don't know. Grab them all.

924
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,723
Let's go.

925
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:40,733
Where's Manu?

926
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,698
Upstairs, run!

927
01:01:47,865 --> 01:01:50,993
Go to the penthouse!
The key must be in the bunch.

928
01:01:53,621 --> 01:01:54,914
Come on, Angela!

929
01:01:56,457 --> 01:01:57,875
Which one is it?

930
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:03,381
This one!

931
01:02:16,143 --> 01:02:18,854
-Turn on the spotlight.
-I can't!

932
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:24,151
-The light is loose.
-Fix it, Pablo!

933
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:26,153
I'm trying!

934
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:31,826
They're leaving.

935
01:02:32,368 --> 01:02:35,996
-Pablo, turn it on!
-Calm down.

936
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,249
This is the apartment
that was closed up.

937
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:42,670
-No one will be in here.
-Turn it on, please.

938
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:45,631
OK.

939
01:02:53,806 --> 01:02:57,685
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

940
01:03:10,072 --> 01:03:12,575
What the hell is all this?

941
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:16,203
Pablo, over here.

942
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:17,955
Where?

943
01:03:22,043 --> 01:03:23,586
Holy shit!

944
01:03:26,255 --> 01:03:29,633
-What does this mean?
-I don't know.

945
01:03:35,222 --> 01:03:37,600
-Pablo!
-What?

946
01:03:42,605 --> 01:03:44,648
"The Vatican is investigating...

947
01:03:45,983 --> 01:03:48,903
the possible possession
of a Portuguese girl."

948
01:03:53,115 --> 01:03:56,118
PORTUGAL IS MOVED BY
THE CASE OF A POSSESSED GIRL

949
01:03:56,285 --> 01:03:58,496
-Fuck...
-The possessed girl.

950
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:04,627
THE MEDEIROS CASE ON HOLD

951
01:04:04,794 --> 01:04:06,504
Pablo, look!

952
01:04:07,546 --> 01:04:09,799
It's the same girl!

953
01:04:12,009 --> 01:04:14,428
What the hell is this?

954
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,808
It's all about the same.

955
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:23,145
"The hospital denies releasing
the girl who disappeared in the night"

956
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:35,658
Pablo!

957
01:04:37,034 --> 01:04:38,285
Calm down.

958
01:04:38,577 --> 01:04:41,288
It must be the pipes.

959
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:45,960
Calm down, we'll find a way out.

960
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:48,337
We have to get out of here.

961
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:52,550
Be careful. Stay close.

962
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:21,871
Didn't they say no one lived here?

963
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,249
Calm down.

964
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:42,016
Pablo.

965
01:05:42,183 --> 01:05:44,477
Over here.

966
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:52,902
What's that?

967
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:56,447
They're still talking about the same.

968
01:05:56,947 --> 01:05:58,991
What the hell is this?

969
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:02,703
-Angela, let's go.
-Wait!

970
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:05,956
It must have something
to do with...

971
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:08,376
Look!

972
01:06:09,085 --> 01:06:10,961
A tape recorder.

973
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,466
-There's no electricity.
-It's off.

974
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:19,053
There.

975
01:06:20,054 --> 01:06:22,723
I've finally isolated the enzyme.

976
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,184
The problem is that it's unstable.

977
01:06:25,935 --> 01:06:29,897
It deteriorates when it
comes into contact with oxygen.

978
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:32,983
I am, however, optimistic.

979
01:06:33,484 --> 01:06:36,112
If all goes well
we'll have a vaccine soon.

980
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:37,947
The analyses were successful.

981
01:06:38,197 --> 01:06:40,157
What the hell is he talking about?

982
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:50,084
Something unexpected has happened.

983
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:55,297
The enzyme is not only resistant
but has mutated.

984
01:06:56,632 --> 01:06:59,260
It behaves much like the flu.

985
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:02,680
This leads us
to a horrible conclusion.

986
01:07:03,514 --> 01:07:05,391
It might be contagious.

987
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:07,101
I don't get it.

988
01:07:08,102 --> 01:07:10,021
The telegram from Rome
has arrived.

989
01:07:10,396 --> 01:07:12,523
The Medeiros girl must die.

990
01:07:13,065 --> 01:07:15,359
He's talking about the girl, Pablo.

991
01:07:16,736 --> 01:07:18,195
She was here.

992
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:21,949
I must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence.

993
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:25,036
What the hell is this guy saying?

994
01:07:25,202 --> 01:07:27,163
Finally my prayers
have been answered.

995
01:07:27,329 --> 01:07:29,290
We have to get out of here.

996
01:07:29,457 --> 01:07:32,376
This decision should
have been made years ago.

997
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:35,755
This has all been a big mistake.

998
01:07:37,173 --> 01:07:40,051
I must follow the procedures.

999
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:42,470
The ritual is very specific.

1000
01:07:44,805 --> 01:07:45,806
Come here. Stay close.

1001
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:48,309
I'm going to seal off the room.

1002
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,396
The seal should keep her in.

1003
01:07:53,314 --> 01:07:56,942
If anything goes wrong,
may God help us.

1004
01:08:07,661 --> 01:08:08,704
Wait.

1005
01:08:12,416 --> 01:08:13,876
-I'm going to look.
-No!

1006
01:08:14,043 --> 01:08:17,171
There might be a way out
through the attic.

1007
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:20,257
-We have to give it a try.
-What are you going to do?

1008
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:22,927
I'll record what's up there
and we can look at it.

1009
01:08:29,642 --> 01:08:31,811
Pablo. Bring the camera down.

1010
01:08:31,977 --> 01:08:34,355
There are really weird noises.

1011
01:08:47,493 --> 01:08:50,204
-What happened?
-Something hit the camera.

1012
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:53,040
Turn it on.

1013
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,376
The fucking light broke!

1014
01:08:55,543 --> 01:08:59,547
-Turn it on, Pablo!
-I can't, it's busted.

1015
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:04,510
-Fuck! What now?
-Relax. Don't move.

1016
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,804
I'll turn on the night vision.

1017
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:10,391
OK, I can see you now.

1018
01:09:11,225 --> 01:09:12,184
That's good.

1019
01:09:12,727 --> 01:09:14,603
Stick your hand out.

1020
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:17,440
-I can't see you. Where are you?
-OK, I got you.

1021
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:23,362
Relax, it's me.

1022
01:09:23,738 --> 01:09:25,406
I can see if I use the camera.

1023
01:09:25,573 --> 01:09:28,034
Get behind me and don't let go.

1024
01:09:31,037 --> 01:09:35,207
We'll be OK.
We're going to get out.

1025
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:41,839
I'll find the way out.

1026
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:43,716
Don't let go, OK?

1027
01:09:54,977 --> 01:09:58,481
-Stay still.
-Why?

1028
01:09:59,315 --> 01:10:02,693
There's something.
Go back.

1029
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:08,741
Don't make a sound.

1030
01:10:18,876 --> 01:10:20,002
Get down.

1031
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:25,633
Keep quiet, for God's sake!

1032
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:37,186
It can't see us.
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

1033
01:11:26,652 --> 01:11:28,487
Let's go.

1034
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:51,010
-Run!
-Pablo!

1035
01:12:05,983 --> 01:12:07,777
Run!

1036
01:12:39,266 --> 01:12:42,603
Answer me!
I can't hear you!

1037
01:12:47,483 --> 01:12:48,526
Pablo.

1038
01:13:29,066 --> 01:13:32,611
We have to tape everything, Pablo.
For fuck's sake.
