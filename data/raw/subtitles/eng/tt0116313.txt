1
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,838
Middlebury College, 1969,
the year of walking on the moon -

2
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,838
- "Yellow Submarine"
and Woodstock.

3
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,591
Also the year that Pope Paul the VI
eliminated 200 saints. Amen.

4
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,590
And l, along with my three best
friends, graduated from college.

5
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,793
Where's Cynthia? We've got
to get going. I mean, shouldn't we?

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,117
Calm down, Annie.
She said she had a surprise.

7
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,356
How is this?
Is this heaven?

8
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,157
Elise, you are so gorgeous. Really!
Oh, my. It's lovely.

9
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,158
- It's solid.
- Oh, girls.

10
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,794
- Cynthia.
- Here. Open. Put them on.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,639
Oh, my God!

12
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,719
Oh, my God.
You shouldn't have done this.

13
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,151
- It's too much.
- I don't think so. It's just enough.

14
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,318
You'll all write me nice notes,
but now we need a toast.

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,470
- Got it.
- Pour, pour! It's picture time.

16
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,353
- Champagne!
- From my folks.

17
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,708
To Annie, Elise and Brenda.

18
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,275
And Cynthia,
I mean our valedictorian.

19
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,597
All right. We're all bound together
forever by friendship and love.

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,074
And jewelry!

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,068
And we're always going
to be there for each other.

22
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,796
- Oh, God! I'm gonna cry!
- Here! For the rest of our lives.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,991
- One, two, three...
- Hows my hair?

24
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,474
It's good.

25
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,434
Mrs. Cynthia?

26
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,959
Teresa...

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
- I want you to have these.
- No, no, no.

28
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,434
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I cannot take...

29
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,030
- You just think of it as a raise, OK?
- Thank you.

30
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
Now, you take the rest of the day off.
Go on.

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,357
- Thank you.
- Would you mind mailing these?

32
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,799
Of the four of us, Cynthia was
certainly the most likely to succeed.

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,798
When she decided to do something -

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,468
- Shejust went ahead and did it.

35
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,629
Roachie. Come on, honey.
It's Mommy. Mommy's home.

36
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,512
Gosh, think we got any messages?

37
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,996
- What do you think, huh?
- Annie, dear, it's your mother.

38
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,398
It's 6am. Please call me urgently.

39
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,637
Chris! ...Honey, I thought you
were going to campus yesterday.

40
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,799
My classes were cancelled.
I slept here. Where were you?!

41
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,797
I was... I was at a friend's.

42
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,118
You were with that man again.
Mother, I am so disappointed.

43
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,311
I'm sorry, but he is your father.

44
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,954
He's using you.
You shouldn't let him.

45
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,996
It's not that simple.
The truth is I love your father.

46
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,634
- I'm sure he loves me.
- You're a doormat!

47
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,229
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so crabby today?

48
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,795
Is it school? ...I know what it is.

49
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,828
- It's a boy.
- I'm a lesbian, mom.

50
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,634
I'm a lesbian.
But that's not the issue here.

51
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,559
- When you say "lesbian"...
- Don't tell Daddy.

52
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,070
I want to tell him myself when the time
is right. Like Father's Day.

53
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,599
- Or Christmas morning.
- Chris...

54
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,075
Thank God, you're all right.

55
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,998
Where were you?
Who saw you?

56
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,760
- Who saw me what?
- She was sleeping with Daddy.

57
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,590
Muffin, you've come
to your senses. I'm so happy.

58
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,635
Mother, I don't sleep with Aaron.
He has problems with his partners.

59
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,037
He's very conflicted, and he
needed somebody to talk to.

60
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,196
- Doormat!
- Lesbian.

61
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,837
Do it, Morris.
Do it to me now. I need it.

62
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,033
You're the only one who does it
the way I like it. You're the king.

63
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,994
Any more collagen, your lips will look
like they were stuck in a pool drain.

64
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,112
I haven't worked in 18 months.

65
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,108
I have a meeting with a director
for a part I would kill for.

66
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,869
- I have to look sexy.
- Elise, you are sexy!

67
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,152
Look at yourself. You're incredible.
You're my masterpiece.

68
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,636
- There's not one line on your face.
- Really? What do you call that?

69
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,469
- And these? What are these?
- You're 45.

70
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,797
One more facelift,
you'll be able to blink your lips.

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,878
- Don't you want to play your age?
- My own age?!

72
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,358
You don't understand. There are only
three ages for women in Hollywood:

73
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,950
Babe, district attorney
and "Driving Miss Daisy".

74
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,392
And right now, I want to be young.
Science Fiction 'young"!

75
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,116
This is good. Maybe you should
also cut down on the booze.

76
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,909
I know you're upset about the divorce.

77
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,111
- Upset?
- You're upset about Bill's movie.

78
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,438
This isn't about him!
This is about my lips! Look at me.

79
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,030
I want Tina Turner. I want Jagger.

80
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,679
Fill 'em up.

81
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,632
Really? This is fabulous news.
Thank you. Bye... Jason!

82
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,796
Jason! Honey!

83
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,870
Yoo-hoo! "Burning Sensation"
just confirmed.

84
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,759
Jason!

85
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,076
- What?
- "Burning Sensation" confirmed.

86
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,271
- I got the band you wanted.
- Cool!

87
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,439
Affection!

88
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,039
Gimme that!

89
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,591
- What is this?
- Hebrew!

90
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,917
Your Bar Mitzvah's in 3 weeks...
the one thing your father will pay for.

91
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,633
- Learn it!
- Mom!

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,196
Don't "but, Mom" me! Learn it.
Don't shame me in the synagogue.

93
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,432
The separation from Aaron is absurd.

94
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,790
How will you fix things
if you're not together?

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,675
We're practically together.
We're seeing the same therapist.

96
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,190
- What?
- Her name is Dr. Leslie Rosen.

97
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,030
She's incredible. She helps
Aaron with commitment issues.

98
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,674
We're working on my self-esteem.

99
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,396
You're married with a daughter.
You're happy. Who needs self-esteem!

100
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,034
Mother!

101
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,913
Dr. Rosen says that...

102
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,838
She says you're very controlling.

103
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,156
Me? Controlling?

104
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,191
That is ridiculous.

105
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,675
- Mother, I...
- Roach...

106
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,836
Go!

107
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,511
What if I found somebody else,
mother? It's possible.

108
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,955
You're 46. You're more likely
to be slaughtered by a psycho.

109
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,789
Cynthia Swann Griffiin is dead. The
former wlfe of Wall Street wizard...

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,389
Didn't you go to school with her?

111
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,318
...jumped from her
fashionable penthouse apartment.

112
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,193
Mrs. Griffiin had recently divorced
her longtime husband -

113
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,552
- Gilbert Griffiin. The Wall Street
baron remarried only yesterday.

114
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,992
- Morning, Mohammed.
- Morning, Miss Eliot.

115
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,598
Elise!

116
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,075
- Oh, God. What a tragedy!
- Poor Cynthia.

117
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,077
And your lips!

118
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,276
Elise arrived with
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg.

119
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,950
The queen of New York society.
Nobody gets anywhere -

120
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,196
- In this town without
Gunilla's say-so.

121
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,116
Hey, Elise!

122
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,870
She looks wonderful.
Has she had any work done?

123
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,479
Honey, she's a quilt.

124
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,835
Then came Cynthia's
former husband Gilbert Griffiin.

125
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,077
A man made rich by
his fiirst wlfe's connections and now -

126
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,716
- Made happy by his
second wlfe's youthful good looks.

127
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,757
The vampire Lestat. And Louis.

128
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,835
What a nerve!
He should be hanging his head.

129
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,395
You don't know
what he feels right now.

130
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,518
I knew you would be here.

131
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,994
Alice!

132
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,475
- No, Annie.
- Annie!

133
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,879
It's so wonderful to see you.
You're wearing our pearls.

134
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,718
Yeah.

135
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,753
- Hi. It's Brenda. Brenda Morang.
- Brenda!

136
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,996
Annie. Remember me!

137
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
- You look wonderful.
- You do too. You look just...

138
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,430
- : : : uncanny:
- Thank you.

139
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,359
Dear, sweet, funny, yearning Brenda.

140
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,314
What?

141
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,032
- She's such a bitch.
- I hate that guy.

142
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,473
This might sound horrible after
that but I would really...

143
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,719
- I'd love to...
- Lunch?

144
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,514
No, you're right. It's not right.

145
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,915
Why? We gotta eat. I have a car.

146
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,997
- A limo.
- Yeah.

147
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,030
It is so wonderful seeing you all.

148
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,434
- Elise.
- What?

149
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,996
You have not changed a bit in 20 years.

150
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,431
Not one little bit.

151
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,638
It's utterly bizarre.

152
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,319
- Brenda!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

153
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,033
Ladies, would anyone like a drink?

154
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,755
- Yes, I would like a Virgin Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

155
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,394
- Vodka rocks, please.
- Now, I just want to...

156
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,878
...get this out of the way.
I'm the most terrible person.

157
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,198
I tried to stay in touch.
I should have written every month.

158
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,153
Annie you had a life to lead.

159
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,148
It must have been time-consuming,
churning out those newsletters.

160
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,037
It's a terrible excuse for a reunion -

161
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,074
- But here we all are.
How are you guys, huh?

162
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,396
Just fine. Couldn't be better.

163
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,672
- Things are rolling along for me.
- Same here. Knock wood.

164
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,632
knock wood.

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,479
- It's great to see you guys again.
- Cheers.

166
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,629
Why'd she do it? I don't understand.
Could I have helped her?

167
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,912
What would make her want to?

168
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,148
She gave Gil the best years
of her life. Sacrificed her youth...

169
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,275
Always put herself last to bolster
his ego, his drive, his ambition.

170
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,033
Just as her dignity hung by a thread,
he ran off with a pre-schooler.

171
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,869
- I'm guessing.
- Elise...

172
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,832
You too?

173
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,433
You... Brenda?

174
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,108
- Brenda?
- Morty was a big shot on TV.

175
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,359
He sold electronics. On our 20th
wedding anniversary, it hits...

176
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,634
...mid-life crisis... Major! He starts
working out, grows a mustache.

177
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,355
He gets an earring. I said:
"Morty, what are you... a pirate?"

178
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,834
'What's next? A parrot?"

179
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,319
Suddenly, I'm a drag. I'm holding
him back because I won't rollerblade.

180
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,358
- What's her name?
- Shelly.

181
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,838
Shelly the barracuda. She's 12.

182
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,678
Bren... Elise.

183
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,031
I am so sorry about
both of your marriages.

184
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,074
I wish I could have helped or
been there in some way.

185
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,671
- What about your marriage?
- Everything's just fine.

186
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,519
Aaron is so terrific...

187
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,679
Now, let's think... we've been
married for 25 years...

188
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,955
Chris is perfect. I mean,
lesbians are great... nowadays!

189
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,199
The marriage is going...
It's going to be really fine.

190
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,233
Aaron and I... we're...

191
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,036
...temporarily sort of...
We're separated!

192
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,359
- Separated.
- Separated?

193
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,838
Separated.

194
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,398
OK, Elise, the time has come...

195
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,353
Spill! Those lips... what's in 'em?

196
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,597
- Are they wax?
- Excuse me?

197
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,189
What else did you have done?
You can tell me.

198
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,951
The cheeks, the jawline...
Have just a little or the full enchilada?

199
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,630
I work out daily, watch my diet.

200
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,877
- I haven't had plastic surgery!
- Good for you!

201
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,752
- You look terrific.
- Come on!

202
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,952
You're lying through your caps!

203
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,357
OK, I have been refreshed a little.

204
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,597
- Oh, God, does it hurt?
- No.

205
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,598
The stuff they take off...
Can you keep it?

206
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,995
Come on, it's the 90s.

207
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,911
Plastic surgery is like good grooming.
It's like brushing your teeth.

208
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,673
Elise, you've been yanked, stitched,
stuffed and pulled. You're a turkey.

209
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,794
- And to please your ex-husband?
- No...

210
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,391
...to please everybody.
To please everybody!

211
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,913
Men, women, studio executives.
Come on, youth and beauty.

212
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,917
Men, that's the ticket!

213
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,113
When men... No, when women
get to be a certain age...

214
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,518
...bye, bye love. Hello, poptarts.
- That's right, baby.

215
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,915
It's a holocaust.

216
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,231
God, I wish I had the courage
to give it all up. To say...

217
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,709
...who gives a rat's ass.
Just let myself go like you two did.

218
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,111
No offense.

219
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,630
- None taken.
- Speak for yourself, OK!

220
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,594
Elise, you're gifted,
talented and successful.

221
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,678
Brenda, you're wonderfully verbal.

222
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,395
And I am seeing
a very talented therapist.

223
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,630
We're in our prime! By the way,
my marriage is fine, thank you.

224
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,198
Annie, you have an amazing attitude.

225
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,632
You are... so cheerful.

226
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,988
- You are...
- Look at me.

227
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,191
You are genuinely happy.

228
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,631
- It's a beautiful thing.
- Thank you.

229
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,237
Lithium?

230
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,479
You'd have been proud of me, Leslie.
I was the only positive one there.

231
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:08,471
There were traces of the wonderful,
witty women I knew before -

232
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:15,870
- But they're just so angry. They're so
confused. When we were young...

233
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,435
...we had such spirit.
- Say it, honey.

234
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,998
- Work from love.
- OK, work from love.

235
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,670
- Grow from love.
- Grow from love.

236
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,233
Screw the world.

237
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,355
- I can't say that. I'm sorry.
- Annie, you are still doing it.

238
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,790
- I know.
- You have a problem with anger.

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,274
You're absolutely right.

240
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,597
It's my... I don't know what it is!
It's my mother. It's Connecticut.

241
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,030
- It's all these loud noises.
- And Aaron.

242
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,279
I know we're separated.
But I think this is really a rest period.

243
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,879
We're just getting our...

244
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,833
- Do it, Annie! Get angry.
- I couldn't. I know that I should...

245
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,314
- It's just...
- Hit me.

246
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,033
Stand up and hit me.

247
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,519
I can't. I'm so sorry. Maybe...

248
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,111
Let it out. I want you to hit me.
Trust me. It's OK.

249
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,674
OK.

250
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,838
Rambo!

251
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,794
A real tough guy.
Come on, Annie...

252
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,390
- Hit me!
- I love that.

253
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,159
- My God.
- That was better.

254
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,717
- I'm sorry. Please don't tell Aaron.
- Time's up.

255
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,478
- Time to go. Do you feel better?
- Thank you.

256
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,873
He hasn't the guts to tell me he wants
a divorce. I have to hear it on TV.

257
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,435
- Elise, be cool. Be calm.
- I am!

258
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,552
- I saw that show. It was interesting.
- I don't want to hear it.

259
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,117
My client's and Miss Eliot's marriage
resulted in many successful films -

260
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,471
- Including "Inner Urges",
"Human Instinct" -

261
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,471
- And "Animal Nature" in which she
played a sensuous veterinarian.

262
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,193
- Thank you.
- My idea!

263
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,277
- Was not.
- Was too.

264
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,711
My client produced these films
which enhanced Miss Eliot's career.

265
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,117
- Therefore, she is indebted to him.
- I produced these films!

266
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,311
You knew nothing when I met you.

267
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,353
I taught you everything! What?

268
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,596
Those were your best years, Elise.

269
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,591
Therefore, we request half of Miss
Eliot's assets and a monthly stipend.

270
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,153
He wants alimony?

271
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,353
As for the sculpture, art, Japanese
porcelain and objets d'art-

272
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,916
- Collected during the marriage,
my client thinks it fair for Miss Eliot -

273
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,590
- To dispose of the items
and divide the proceeds evenly.

274
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,392
They were anniversary presents -

275
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,716
- Xmas presents. I gave him
everything. Now he wants more?!

276
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,109
Now, Duarto, I ask you: who's this
for? An anorexic teen? A fetus?

277
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,949
It's a conspiracy. I know it is. I've
had enough. I'm leading a protest.

278
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,756
I'm not buying any more clothes until
designers come to their senses.

279
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,032
Brenda worked for a
man named Duarto Feliz -

280
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,949
- One of the ten worst
interior decorators in New York.

281
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,357
I think his real name
was Duane Hemelwitz.

282
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,711
- It's electric. Look at this hideous...
- I can't afford it.

283
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,152
You've got to have it. Try it on.
You could sell a broach, your son...

284
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,191
Duarto...

285
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,629
- Morty! Look at you.
- Brenda, don't embarrass me.

286
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,718
Don't embarrass me.
Don't make a scene.

287
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,151
You've got nerve.
know what's embarrassing?

288
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,114
Being hassled by Mr. Zaworsky
because I'm behind in the rent.

289
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,518
That's embarrassing. Worrying about
how to pay for my kid's college.

290
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,315
You know what? You never listened.
20 years and you never listened.

291
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,751
Here! Try this on in the fitting
room. It looks very nice.

292
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,713
I could use this. It's very
beautiful. I love the color...

293
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,229
But what can I use for money?
How am I gonna pay for it?

294
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,389
The company is expanding. Not me!
I'm a mere laborer.

295
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,309
- You're a liar and a fraud.
- I have no money. I'm not rich.

296
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,192
- Why don't you look in your purse?
- Very funny.

297
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,597
- They're stunning, Morton. I want 'em.
- Morton?

298
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,116
- Oh, God, make it go away.
- Shelly, look at you.

299
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,233
- The bulimia has paid off.
- Don't start.

300
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,637
What's the matter, Morty?
Can't you buy her a whole dress?

301
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,276
Why don't you try these on
in your size?

302
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,874
- It was a delight running into you.
- You've read the script.

303
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,311
Yes, it is so original. It's so good.

304
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,353
You're so gifted, Brett.

305
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,792
And Monique..." Monique"...

306
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,514
She is a great character.

307
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,151
Thank you. Man, what a kick!

308
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,749
Elise Eliot in a Brett Artounian film.

309
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,471
So, tell me how do you see her?

310
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,638
Well, uh, I think we go for...

311
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,718
...grotesque.
- What?

312
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,391
All the way. No make-up, overhead
lighting. Bring out every wrinkle...

313
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,319
Every crag.
With you in the part -

314
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,069
- Monique's mother won't be another
Jurassic fleshbag in a wheelchair.

315
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,236
She's epic.

316
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,433
Elise Eliot,
the crypt-keeper. Wow!

317
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,198
Mom, I'm spending the night
at Dad's. Don't worry, I'm studying.

318
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
Baruch atta adonoy...
Happy now?

319
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,759
Maurice?

320
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,673
I want another one.
They want me to play the mother.

321
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,353
- Sorry.
- The mother!

322
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,198
Let me ask you something.

323
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,517
- Is this the face of a mother?
- No, ma'am.

324
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,950
Certainly not mine.

325
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,518
So I thought.

326
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,232
Not to be critical,
but you've no feeling for noodles.

327
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,317
Thank you, Mom.

328
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,239
Hello.

329
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,037
Aaron... Nothing...
Just having pasta with mother.

330
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,071
No, you say... Sure!

331
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,874
That would be good. Bye.

332
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,311
We're going to have dinner!
Can you believe that? Oh my God!

333
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,069
Do you know what this means?
It means he's re-prioritized.

334
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,430
He's worked through his
relationship phobias -

335
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,792
- His fear of intimacy, his thing about
my poisoning his food.

336
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,672
He's ready to recommit.

337
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,396
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

338
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,436
Excuse me, so sorry.

339
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,313
Una? By yourself?

340
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,714
Si.

341
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,638
- How are you?
- Hello. Allow me.

342
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,588
I'm not Monique's mother. Angela
Lansbury's Monique's mother.

343
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,190
- Shelley Winters is Unique's mother.
- Now, that's good.

344
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,918
- Sean Connery's Unique's mother.
- Perhaps some coffee now.

345
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,831
I take that back. Sean Connery
is Monique's boyfriend.

346
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,238
He's 300 years old,
but he's still a stud.

347
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,280
- I'm not happy, Maurice.
- I'm going to get you that coffee.

348
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,271
- Honey... I think I should go.
- I know.

349
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,272
Tomorrow, we could start moving
your things back in... if that's okay?

350
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,678
I hated seeing your side
of the closet all empty.

351
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,951
Dr. Rosen... she would be proud of us.
I wish she were here.

352
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,156
Not literally. I can't wait to tell her
how we worked it all out.

353
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,989
We should get therapy gold stars.

354
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,349
Annie...

355
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,232
I love you.

356
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,238
Come here.

357
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,919
Yes.

358
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,194
I love you.

359
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,110
I want a divorce.

360
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,075
- Stay calm.
- But we just made love!

361
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,919
You asked me out.

362
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,680
I asked you out to tell you,
but you looked so great.

363
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,394
I thought: "How romantic.
One last time."

364
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,673
- A goodbye kiss.
- But this wasn't just a kiss.

365
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,758
Don't be childish.
You know how you manipulate me.

366
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,428
- What?! Manipulate?
- Don't.

367
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,200
What? ...Oh my God.

368
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,315
- Is there someone else?
- No. This is about us.

369
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,919
It's really not you.

370
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,999
Babe?

371
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,354
Oh my God!

372
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,120
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God.

373
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,959
- This is very awkward.
- No, Annie was just leaving.

374
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,435
- You told her?
- I was totally upfront.

375
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,631
What? Excuse me!

376
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,070
Annie, this is rough.
I know that.

377
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,397
Rough?! Wait a minute.
I don't understand. You're my therapist?

378
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,070
- I'm a woman.
- He is my husband.

379
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,751
We've been separated for months.
Let's not overdramatize, OK?

380
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,191
She's allowed to be angry.
- Annie, let's use this.

381
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,994
He's found someone new.
You're free! Closure!

382
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,273
I'm sorry,
but that isn't what this is.

383
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,472
You're not helping us out here.

384
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,194
- Now, I'm sorry.
- So am I!

385
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,748
Very sorry I ever met you!
Sorry I loved you for all those years!

386
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,270
I'm sorry I was there
for you every minute -

387
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,268
- Of every day and supported
you in your every move.

388
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,636
I'm sorry!

389
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,559
Oh, my God.

390
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,919
"I wish I had talent like Elise"-

391
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,236
- "Brenda's humor" -

392
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,879
- "or your strength, Annie."

393
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,634
"Most of all I wish
I still had our friendship."

394
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,391
"Perhaps Gil isn't the problem."
Oh, God...

395
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,433
"Perhaps Ioneliness is."

396
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,190
"Please take care of each other.
Love, Cynthia."

397
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,632
- And on such pretty stationery.
- I have to make some calls, Mom.

398
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,476
- God, poor Cynthia.
- If only she had called me.

399
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,874
If only I were listed.

400
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,311
You know what? She was right.
In college we were focused.

401
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,476
We were brave.
We couldn't wait.

402
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,116
It's all over. I'm alone.
I don't have anything.

403
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,878
I don't have anything!

404
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,712
You have a son who adores you.
I'm alone! I'm Monique's mother.

405
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,390
But Jason's off to college pretty
soon. I'll be even more alone.

406
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,477
Plus I'll be a lot older.

407
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,433
Any more plastic surgery,
I won't be able to sleep.

408
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,119
I'll have to work at McDonalds!

409
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,915
- I'll have to do ads for adult diapers.
- I'll have to wear them.

410
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,834
I just spent 25 years -

411
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,398
- With a self-absorbed man
who is marrying my therapist...

412
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,149
...who lectured me on self-esteem.
- You win!

413
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,352
I won't be that woman anymore.
It's unacceptable.

414
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,235
It is unacceptable! I made
all those stupid movies with Bill.

415
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,829
I gave him a career
and he stole mine.

416
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,430
I worked behind the cash register
at his first store... in his first 15 stores!

417
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,393
I gave Aaron a home
and a daughter.

418
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,751
- I washed and ironed his shorts.
- You did?

419
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,076
Well, I supervised.

420
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,397
What do we want? Revenge?

421
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,956
No! We are not talking about revenge.
I am talking about justice.

422
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,549
I'm going to give Aaron so much
justice he won't see straight...

423
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,433
...if he thinks partners are trouble.
- Bill's always had it easy.

424
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,916
That's right. Bill's had it easy
every inch of the way.

425
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,758
He's always had a woman
look after him.

426
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,076
What would happen one day
if he didn't?

427
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,794
What do you think, Brenda?

428
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,878
I love Morty. Very deeply.

429
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,709
- I wouldn't want to see him harmed.
- You don't?

430
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,356
I want him dumped!
By Little Miss Midriff.

431
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,869
By that Stairmastered
L'Orealed crotch jockey.

432
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,399
In front of
the whole Western Hemisphere.

433
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,073
On the 6 o'clock news. Okay!
After that I want world peace.

434
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,670
Let's get serious. We helped them rise.
We can help them fall.

435
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,075
How are we going to do that.

436
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,511
We're has-beens, hanging on
by a thread. We're discards.

437
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,316
We're not hanging on by a thread.
Look, by being together-us-unity.

438
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,080
If all the first wives of the world
got together...

439
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,953
...what else do we need?
- Just one amazing attorney.

440
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,277
All we need is us.
Three women who aren't afraid to fight.

441
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,510
Stand up for dignity and self-esteem!
Then we'll let 'em have it.

442
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,554
- See this?
- What?

443
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,557
- Wait, right here, OK?
- OK.

444
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,354
See this? Put it in there.

445
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,997
All right. First Wives Club,
come to order.

446
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,918
Starting the club was easy.

447
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,078
Figuring out what to do next
was much harder.

448
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,556
We each decided to gather
information about our husbands.

449
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,957
- Elise, Elise...
- Yeah...

450
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,115
I went in search of a spy.

451
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,390
Why can't we call Chris
and ask her to help us?

452
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,309
I want her to know I support
her lifestyle completely.

453
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,069
- I've never been to a gay bar!
- Here we go.

454
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,113
Hi, I think you're just terrific.

455
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,950
Look at this. My God!
Isn't this great? All these women.

456
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,593
Yeah, maybe we'll get lucky.

457
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,588
Elise Eliot, right?
You're from the movies.

458
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,791
- Yeah...
- I knew you were gay!

459
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,312
I said Elise Eliot is so hot!
You're like the most -

460
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,556
- Amazing babe on this planet.

461
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,752
God bless you!

462
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,714
- You wanna dance?
- Uh, yeah.

463
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,113
Hi, Sweetie.

464
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,869
Mom! Hi...

465
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,196
We wanted to have a little...

466
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,799
What's the matter?

467
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,958
I thought we could have a little chat
about our plans.

468
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,513
Mom...

469
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,632
- You know you're in a gay bar.
- That's what's so great.

470
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,799
It's very women-identified and...
by the way...

471
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,594
I'm Chris' Mom.

472
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,711
Are you gay?

473
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,399
Sorry!

474
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,112
What's wrong?

475
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,238
My lover left mer after 18 years
for some teenager who weighs 12 Ib.

476
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,839
What am I going to do?

477
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,999
- God! That's just like me and Morty.
- Who?

478
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,236
Morty.

479
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,230
She's butch.

480
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,828
Nail Daddy and those
other low-lifes?

481
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,113
I don't mean "nail 'em".
I mean, just teach and help them.

482
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,834
- Vaporize them!
- Yeah, sure.

483
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,270
Yes! Yes! Yes!

484
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,074
I'm in. I'm really in.

485
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,395
Elise...

486
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,433
Elise, Chris is in!

487
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,518
Can you believe it? Mission
accomplished. We'd better go.

488
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,994
She's staying!

489
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,192
She's with me, babe!
Come on, honey, my place.

490
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,355
Brenda, you're so possessive!

491
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,957
Something I was just
thinking about... my resume.

492
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,190
Wouldn't interfere with school.
Something part-time until I graduate.

493
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,278
Come on, Dad.
How about a little nepotism?

494
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,754
I'll hire you.

495
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,717
I'm surprised. You've never
shown interest in advertising.

496
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,798
I know, Daddy.
I'm here to learn.

497
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,872
That's great.

498
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,952
Elise decided to pull the rug
out from under Bill... literally.

499
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,675
After all, his lawyer told her
to dispose of their common property.

500
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,871
Miss Eliot, you know
he hates interruptions.

501
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,197
Please let me
tell him you're here. Please...

502
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,150
Elise... what a kick!
But I'm on with the Coast.

503
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,557
All the good stuff goes.
The Lampico, the Ming vase.

504
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,993
Amari horsemen, Fabergé eggs, the
Wingback chair, the green Tiffany lamp.

505
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,156
Babe... what's going on?

506
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,558
As requested, I'm consolidating
the matrimonial assets for liquidation.

507
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,116
That includes these antiques
I bought for you.

508
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,198
- You are the best.
- Love tokens, anniversary gifts.

509
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,678
- Junk. Here, take that desk too.
- Elise, this hurts me.

510
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,599
I care about you... about us.
About the magic.

511
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,633
- What exactly is going on here?
- And this Japanese secretary.

512
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,115
- I want that to go.
- Back off, Jacko!

513
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,232
Elise, this isn't right. It's hormonal.
You can't do this.

514
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,113
- Watch me!
- But this is my stuff!

515
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,471
It's the 90s, Bill. Downsize!

516
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,156
At Jason's Bar Mitzvah
2 weeks later-

517
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,511
- First Wives Club
got its fiirst big break.

518
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,077
Thanks to Brenda's dear,
dear Sicilian uncle.

519
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,071
Uncle Carmine. My father's side.

520
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,876
Morty and I have planned for this day
since Jason was born.

521
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,868
- But Morty's going to be here.
- But next to me.

522
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,230
We're not a family anymore.

523
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,193
It's OK. I'll be fine.

524
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,517
Excuse me.

525
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,879
He brought her...

526
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,240
...to my son's Bar Mitzvah!

527
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,714
Is she a gift?

528
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,233
- Brenda, can I speak freely?
- Sure. Annie's cool.

529
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,797
I speak for the entire family and your
late father-my beloved brother -

530
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,792
- When I say Morty is garbage.
I'd be honored to take him out.

531
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,713
No, don't you dare. Morty the
Garbage is my problem.

532
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,276
I'll work it out myself.
Thanks for the thought anyway.

533
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,754
My angel.

534
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,396
For Morty to treat you this way after
what your father did for him...

535
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,909
Where would he be?

536
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,716
The first year of his business,
all his merchandise -

537
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,629
- Fell off one of our trucks.

538
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,398
You're not serious?

539
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,751
We were happy
to help you newlyweds.

540
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,918
My Morty a crook?

541
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,113
Check his books.
They're fiction. Bestsellers!

542
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,831
- Ciao.
- Ciao. Grazie.

543
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,396
Really liked your uncle.

544
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,352
- Mother! Mother! Where are you?
- Over here, bitch.

545
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,394
Mother, I met a man. He's an angel.

546
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,239
He's a God. He's a doctor.

547
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,479
It's perfect.

548
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,199
- Do I really have the part?
- Baby, you know it.

549
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,078
Pizza!

550
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,073
- Oh my God!
- Elise!

551
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,078
- There's the Lichtenstein.
- What the hell are you doing?

552
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,589
- The Dine. Take that.
- This is so cool.

553
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,791
- All the gym equipment.
- I'm getting a restraining order.

554
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,879
No, Bill, this is great.
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.

555
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,550
I've seen all your movies
and I want to be just like you, only me!

556
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,992
Phoebe, some advice...
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

557
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,590
- Pheebs, she's bitter.
- And take the cappuccino machine!

558
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,677
Bill, I have a great idea.

559
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,713
Wouldn't she be great
to play opposite me?

560
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,672
Bill is producing this new,
incredible movie -

561
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,474
- With this young, hot director.
I'm the star of it.

562
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,399
- I'm Monique.
- What?

563
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,716
And you can be my Mom!

564
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,792
While Elise cleaned out Bill's offiice,
loft and house in the Hamptons -

565
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,709
Brenda and I looked for an offiice.
A base for the Club.

566
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,957
Come in.

567
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,599
Look at this.
It's early everything, huh.

568
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,349
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

569
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,555
You know what it says?
"I beat Meryl."

570
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,275
- It does not. Put that down.
- Is there chocolate inside?

571
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,357
- Put it down!
- OK, OK.

572
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,112
Put it gently down.
Look. Do you believe this stuff?

573
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,788
I don't know where to put it.
There's no room in my warehouse.

574
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,037
I could have put it in my
building downtown.

575
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,958
- You own a building?
- Yeah, I do.

576
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,071
I sublet it normally, but...

577
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,635
...now it's... vacant.

578
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,996
There's a lot of work to be done.
You have to see it.

579
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,316
Look at this.

580
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,798
All right, this is perfect.

581
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,755
All right, girls!
This is fabulous.

582
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,474
While Brenda and I worked like crazy
gathering information -

583
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,433
- Elise spent most of her time
on the phone to her agent.

584
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,789
Dan Carlin, please.
Elise Eliot calling.

585
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,629
- Elise Eliot!
- And fiinally it came through for her.

586
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,753
- This is a great play!
- I told her she had to do it.

587
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,157
I don't want to do theater!
I haven't done theater in years!

588
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,148
Bill always said theater
was bad for my career...

589
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,352
...which actually I agree with.
- Excuse me, but this is a great role.

590
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,189
This is about a bitter, unloved,
emotionally barren woman.

591
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,709
- That's not me!
- It's you!

592
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,759
Thank you.

593
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,754
- Hello.
- It's Bill. Where's Elise?

594
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,554
- It's for you... Bill.
- Hello.

595
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,752
- Listen to me, you piece of garbage.
- I can't hear you.

596
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,872
I'll sue you. I'll break you.

597
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,594
You vindictive sack of silicone!

598
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,191
- That's my car, you piece of plastic!
- Oh, darn.

599
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,595
Bill... Lamborghini.

600
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,358
The Lamborghini.

601
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,834
He's mad. Whoo!

602
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,950
Elise, can I ask you a question?

603
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,789
Aren't you frustrated? You climb
and climb and go nowhere.

604
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,755
I love it! Burns off the booze.
You want to know something?

605
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,033
- I get my best ideas when I work out.
- You get ideas?!

606
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,232
It clears out my head. I think straight.
Everything makes sense.

607
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,512
Better start thinking because
we need Morty's books to prove fraud.

608
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,395
I know where they are!
Morty just bought Shelly a penthouse.

609
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,876
- Now, figure out how to get in.
- Duarto.

610
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,038
Shelly has a new apartment
that needs to be decorated.

611
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,872
Gunilla, I'd adore it.

612
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,030
Enchantée. Au revoir, jolie!

613
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:37,554
Gunilla Garson-Goldberg personally
invited me to her society luncheon.

614
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,512
Why?

615
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,598
Gunilla Goldberg was happy helping
us, she being a fiirst wlfe herself.

616
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,634
Indeed, Gunilla was a 1st, 2nd, 3rd -

617
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,311
- And 4th wlfe, which accounted for
her very comfortable surroundings.

618
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,353
This is delicious!
Usually I bring my own dressing.

619
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,473
That fat-free ranch stuff,
but this is restaurant quality.

620
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,399
- Thank you.
- Can I tell you something?

621
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,670
When I first got your call,
I said to Morty...

622
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,351
'This just feels so right."
Me and Gunilla.

623
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,758
I used to work for Morty
as his executive assistant.

624
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,554
He was married to that
nightmare then... Brenda -

625
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,354
- A completely class-free
dumpster woman.

626
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,836
I said to him: "Morty, you' ve got to
move on and move up."

627
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,192
Now, here I am! Taste Central.

628
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,919
The moment I saw you... my first
impression was she's someone...

629
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,874
See, that's what I told him.
But he doesn't get it.

630
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,356
- He doesn't get a lot of things.
- Are you finished?

631
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,438
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Take the fork.

632
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,512
Fork!

633
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,397
All you need to enter society
is some advice and a guiding hand.

634
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,318
Like what?

635
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,433
The correct florist
and the utterly ideal chef.

636
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,996
Of course, a decorator... of death.

637
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,950
Your house is your calling card.
It has to be perfected -

638
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,628
- Photographed, published.

639
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,354
Can you really help me?
I would kill for that.

640
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,999
That's unnecessary.
Just two words: Duarto Feliz.

641
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,590
He is a genius. A gem!

642
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,549
Of course, he's impossible to get.
He works all the time.

643
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,274
Oh, my God!

644
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,558
There she is! Princess Pelvis.

645
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,069
- Gunilla says she went for it.
- Fabulous!

646
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,077
Johnny, let's go.

647
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,078
So, Duarto makes his move
and Shelly falls for it.

648
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,158
- Let's synchronize our watches.
- Just like "Mission Impossible".

649
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,191
- These people are always late.
- Shut up, Morty, and stay shut up.

650
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,631
- Take it easy.
- What if he doesn't like us?
