1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,893
The screams of the victim deaden his pain.

3
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:03,855
The act of killing
makes him feel intensely alive.

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,691
What he feels next is not guilt...

5
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,568
...but disappointment.

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,112
It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped.

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,865
Maybe next time, it will be perfect.

8
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,827
And as his determination builds
to take another life...

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,413
...he plans, in obsessive detail...

10
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,374
...what props he'll bring...

11
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,501
...what knots he'll tie.

12
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,254
Let me ask you something.

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,798
What turns you on?

14
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,051
What really does it for you?
Is it a great body?

15
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,096
Is it a nice smile? Is it beautiful legs?

16
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:41,267
What turns on a serial killer is the suffering
and death of a human being.

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,688
Now, I'd like to ask you guys a favor.

18
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,899
If you could all stand up,
all the men in the room.

19
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,734
Please indulge me.

20
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,950
Come on, it's only fair,
after all the time you've ogled us.

21
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,745
Now, would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat.

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,333
If you are of Asian or African-American
descent, you may sit down.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,128
Kenny, turn that light on, please...

24
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,339
...so we can get a good look at these guys.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,717
Ladies, what do you see?

26
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,803
Some pretty cute guys, don't you think?

27
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,515
If one of these fellas asked you out
for a drink, you'd go.

28
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,851
Let me tell you something.

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,271
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

30
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,690
...aged 20 to 35...

31
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,567
...just like these.

32
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,362
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono...

33
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,198
...Berkowitz, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.

34
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,409
They were quiet, unassuming...

35
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
...even nice.

36
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,705
They had jobs.
They made decent neighbors.

37
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,915
Their victims trusted them.

38
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,417
The FBl estimates...

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,754
...there could be as many
as 35 serial killers...

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,798
...cruising for victims even as I speak.

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,551
Guys, sit down. You're scaring me.

42
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,637
Serial killers...

43
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,973
...are not a 20th-century invention...

44
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,768
...but we are spawning them
in greater numbers.

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,646
The state of Florida
spent almost $8 million...

46
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,440
...to electrocute Ted-

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,360
You're dead.

48
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,701
Sorry.

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:27,123
The state of Florida spent $8 million
to electrocute Ted Bundy.

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,461
Wouldn't that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail...

51
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,214
...subject to intense scientific scrutiny?

52
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,927
Isn't our best hope to try to identify
the Ted Bundys of the future...

53
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,471
...before they kill?

54
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,973
Thank you.

55
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,773
Don't park next to vans.

56
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,024
Thanks for coming.

57
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,026
I'm hitting the ladies' room.

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,029
Since she's using the ladies' room,
I'll use the men's room.

59
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,740
-Thanks for your help, Tom.
-Anytime.

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,455
Hello?

61
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,758
Sorry, ma'am.

62
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,678
Doc, it's all yours.

63
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,828
Dr. Hudson?

64
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,333
Hello?

65
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,137
Come out with your hands up.

66
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,975
I'm not going to ask you-

67
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,444
What are you doing with my gun?

68
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,114
How'd you get my gun?

69
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,576
What are you doing in the ladies' room?
Are you spying on little girls?

70
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,581
I'll tell you something right now.

71
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,501
Don't she look pretty up there, Officer?

72
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,795
You know what I want to know?

73
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,589
Help me out on this,
since you're the expert.

74
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,800
How would a fartknocker like me...

75
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,386
...take out a dumb guy like this?

76
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,388
Would you stick him...

77
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,848
...or would you shoot him?

78
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,933
Stick him or shoot him?

79
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,938
I can't decide, but I think I'll just go ahead
and do both.

80
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,327
You bloodied up my knife, you dog.

81
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,288
I hate cops.

82
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,833
Hey, Dr. Hudson.

83
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,297
What do you say me
and you have a little fun?

84
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,202
John Adams...

85
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,579
Adams...

86
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,247
...Jefferson...

87
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,001
...James Monroe, James Madison...

88
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
...John Quincy Adams.

89
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,090
Andy?

90
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,842
Andy?

91
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,975
John Quincy Adams.

92
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,770
Andrew Jackson.

93
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,148
Martin Van Buren.

94
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,526
Wait a minute. This is so stupid.

95
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,195
Calvin Coolidge.

96
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,694
I got you beat.

97
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,830
Bye, Kate.

98
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,957
Police! Freeze!

99
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,676
The good news is, you're still alive.

100
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,888
You see a downside to that?

101
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,057
This is pretty remedial stuff.

102
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,351
Let's review the scenario.

103
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,063
Didn't anyone at the Academy
teach you to shoot conservatively?

104
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,565
You shredded him.

105
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,233
I'm an intuitive cop.

106
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,235
With poor impulse control.

107
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,322
Let's assume you didn't mow down
a 75-year-old man...

108
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,450
...who couldn't hear your warning
because he's deaf.

109
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,662
Let's say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender.

110
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,958
Now, you're on leave pending an inquiry.

111
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,711
Friends wonder if you're a psychopath.
On top of that...

112
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:56,424
...the guy's junkie-wife's lawyer slams
a wrongful-death action up your tail.

113
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,135
All right, smart-ass, let's see how you do.

114
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,394
The shoulder of his gun hand's exposed.

115
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,356
You hit the brachial nerve,
he drops the gun. You read him his rights.

116
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,568
Plus, you haven't taken a human life
so your karma's still okay.

117
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,529
You hungry? I'm starving.

118
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,824
-Aren't you going to answer that?
-No, it's probably not important.

119
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,283
She thinks it is.

120
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,703
How about Moroccan? You like couscous?

121
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,205
Don't you want to know which one it is?

122
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,625
Hello?

123
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,796
You must have mental telepathy.
I was just about to call you.

124
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,633
The usual.
Long days making sure justice prevails.

125
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,291
10390 Mariposa.

126
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,795
Scaffolding on the north and west sides
of the building.

127
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,005
Great. The Mouth is here.

128
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,007
You can end her career.

129
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,469
Pop her in the brachial nerve,
she'll drop the microphone.

130
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,305
It's a thought.

131
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,821
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks.

132
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:27,492
Can you confirm that this latest murder
fits the same pattern as the other two?

133
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,869
We just got here. I'm not prepared to-

134
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,665
Is there a serial killer stalking
the streets of San Francisco?

135
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,084
Excuse me. I'm a member of the press.

136
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,544
Hey, MJ, all done.

137
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,965
Hey, Jim. Can you grab some overalls
from the crowd, some nice, clear faces?

138
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,092
I'll make them say "cheese."

139
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,177
The landlady found her.

140
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,221
The front door was open.
She tried the bell.

141
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,599
The tenant didn't answer,
so she went inside and found the body.

142
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:55,437
She used the telephone to dial 911,
otherwise she touched nothing.

143
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,939
-You're thinking robbery?
-It doesn't look like it.

144
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,900
It's all yours, kids.
I'll take care of the Mouth.

145
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,360
Good morning, sir.

146
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:05,655
-With this scaffolding, we should call-
-I'll call the contractor.

147
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,115
Take this.

148
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,869
Good morning.

149
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,998
Were you first on the scene?

150
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,542
Is that the landlady?

151
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,753
Thanks.

152
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,547
-"Johnson." What's the first part?
-Mike.

153
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,466
Did you touch anything, Mike?

154
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,802
I don't want to get excited about
latents and find out they're yours.

155
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,013
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

156
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,394
She usually goes jogging in the morning,
to the Delores Park.

157
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,974
This one.

158
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,464
Pretty wild.

159
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,800
How're you doing?

160
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,219
Got an estimate for me?

161
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,346
About eight hours.

162
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm seeing ligature marks, petechiae.

163
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,768
Strangled, huh?

164
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,812
Same as the others.

165
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,648
You'll bag all the stuff
on the bedside table?

166
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:07,235
Thanks, Bill. Excellent.
That's the only one I need.

167
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,496
Were you the first one here?

168
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,998
Did you touch anything?

169
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,416
No, ma'am.

170
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,753
What's wrong?

171
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,171
Nothing.

172
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,759
If you're holding out on me,
I'll get it out of you. You know I will.

173
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,097
There was a stocking around her neck
when I found her.

174
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,433
I don't know what happened to it.

175
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,687
Who else was in there
before the CSI came?

176
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,940
Lieutenant Quinn.

177
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,860
That's all right, then.

178
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,278
Thanks, Mike.

179
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:54,532
Celebrating 25 years of the spirit
of the 60s in San Francisco...

180
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,204
...the Festival of Love got underway today
in Golden Gate Park.

181
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,040
Why did you remove evidence from the-

182
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,459
I want to hear this.

183
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,294
In Potrero Hill...

184
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:10,799
...homicide detectives discovered
yet another grisly murder today.

185
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,969
Police would not comment, but informed
sources inside the Department...

186
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,805
...tell us this latest death...

187
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:21,893
...could be the work of the same killer
responsible for the deaths of two women.

188
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,437
Susan Schiffer, Potrero Hill.

189
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,231
You messed with the scene.

190
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:30,151
Someone around here can't keep
his yap shut, and I'll find out who.

191
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,903
What did you do with the stocking?

192
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,363
I tagged it.

193
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,908
I don't want some blabbermouth
leaking the MO to her...

194
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,662
...so she can tell everyone,
leaving us nothing to play.

195
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,749
Am I in charge of this or not?

196
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,043
Why are you so prickly?

197
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,922
I ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester.

198
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,008
All right, lnspector.

199
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,137
Which evidence on this case
would you like to sequester?

200
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,724
-The stocking around the neck.
-The stocking around the neck.

201
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,268
You're one pushy broad, MJ.

202
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,770
I'll take that as a compliment, sir.

203
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,278
I didn't say serial killer,
you didn't say serial killer.

204
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,542
For Christ's sake.

205
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,836
Again.

206
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,078
George Washington.

207
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,871
John Adams.

208
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,499
Thomas Jefferson.

209
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,292
James Madison.

210
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,378
James Monroe.

211
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,841
Oh, come on.

212
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,220
John Quincy Adams.

213
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,972
Martin Van Buren.

214
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,204
ldiots!

215
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,003
You followed the girl home. Then what?

216
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,338
I killed her.

217
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,967
Where did you do that?

218
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,803
It was in the bathtub.

219
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,057
Why did you do that?

220
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,477
She was dirty.

221
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:12,355
She was a very dirty girl. Very dirty.

222
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,860
Do you remember...

223
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,612
...how many times you stabbed her?

224
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,366
Eighty-seven.

225
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,162
Harvey...

226
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,000
Get the fuck out of here.

227
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,793
I got work to do.

228
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,339
Come on, let's go. What?

229
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,674
lnnocent blood is on these hands.

230
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:43,219
I understand. That's a terrible thing.
But let me tell you...

231
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:47,265
...if you come back,
I'll make you stand in the corner again.

232
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,270
-But innocent blood is on these hands.
-I understand. It's terrible.

233
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,608
You don't care about the truth.

234
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,279
We pay for city government, just like this,
and you never care about the truth.

235
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,530
I killed her!

236
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,949
-I know.
-I killed her in the bathtub.

237
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,618
Good-bye, Harvey.

238
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,082
Was it something I did in another life?

239
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,626
Probably something you did in this one.

240
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:19,631
Stuff came in from Mercer.
Medical, dental receipts...

241
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,092
Nothing in common with the others.

242
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,344
What's that around your neck?

243
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:29,391
I'd get one like yours,
but I don't live near K Mart.

244
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,310
How about friends, acquaintances?

245
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,481
The only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators.

246
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,233
The tool of survival.

247
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,069
How can he come to work wearing that?

248
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,570
Lay off him.

249
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,572
A cop should look like a cop.

250
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,825
What's the world coming to?

251
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,704
Let me let you talk to the lead inspector
on the case.

252
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,080
Hold on.

253
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,583
MJ, we got Deep Throat again.

254
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,669
How many calls is that?

255
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,672
That makes three today. Fourteen, total.

256
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,341
Phone company set up on our Centrex?

257
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,843
Yes, this morning.

258
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,430
-Have Gigi put a tracer on her ass.
-I'll see if it'll work.

259
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,225
lnspector Monahan speaking. Homicide.

260
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,353
Ask her about the moon bike.

261
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,481
I'm interested in your ideas.

262
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,400
The moon bike...

263
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,029
What is that?

264
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,196
Moon bike?

265
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,700
I said a "lunar cycle."
I think he might be on a lunar cycle.

266
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,953
Because the first two murders
were 28 days apart.

267
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,538
Still want to crackjokes?

268
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:37,876
No, this is no joke. Neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls.

269
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,794
Are you calling me a crank?

270
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,131
Do you have any evidence to report?
Did you know the victims?

271
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,758
This is Number 3.

272
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,718
That is an opinion, not evidence.

273
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,137
May I ask who I'm speaking with?

274
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,190
Who's Helen Hudson?

275
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:04,861
What did you think of his claim,
that he tied these women to a tree...

276
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,156
...and burned them alive
because Joan of Arc told him to?

277
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,532
He was lying.

278
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,159
How do you know?

279
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:15,538
People suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears.

280
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,873
In stereo.

281
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,833
Daryll Lee told me...

282
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,419
...Joan of Arc always appeared
on his left side...

283
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,005
...and spoke softly in his left ear.

284
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:27,509
Those are the lab results,
hot off the press. No sperm.

285
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,345
We've got a serial.

286
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,263
You didn't say that.

287
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,599
You interviewed Cullum three times.

288
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,686
Who's that?
The woman that got the cop killed?

289
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,187
She might be useful.

290
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,899
That woman is a wrong number.
Work the clues, for Christ's sake.

291
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,695
What clues? We don't have any clues.

292
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,656
Nobody here has ever worked
a serial case before.

293
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,574
I have.

294
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,076
The Zodiac, right?

295
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:57,038
Did anyone ever catch the Zodiac,
or did he die of old age?

296
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,209
Commissioner's on 2,
about the Chinatown thing.

297
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,128
Work the clues.

298
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,550
But what else?

299
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,137
Mr. Cullum satisfies the rules for sanity...

300
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,431
...in being fully aware
at the time of the murders...

301
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,975
...that his actions were wrong
and unlawful.

302
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,602
Thank you, Dr. Hudson.
No more questions.

303
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,449
San Francisco Homicide.

304
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,326
I'm lnspector Goetz.
This is lnspector Monahan.

305
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,328
Is Helen Hudson here?

306
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,497
I'm her assistant. Can I help?

307
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,833
Could we have a few minutes?

308
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,127
Come in.

309
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,633
This way, please.

310
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:56,348
Dr. Hudson, these are lnspectors Goetz
and Monahan.

311
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,184
He's escaped again, right?

312
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,310
I'm sorry?

313
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,186
Well?

314
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,188
Is he out or isn't he?

315
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,398
I'm not following, ma'am.

316
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,859
Let's talk about your phone calls.

317
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,486
Phone calls?

318
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,030
I didn't make any phone calls.

319
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,283
Isn't this nice?

320
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,787
Would everyone like to sit down?
Shall I make coffee?

321
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,580
Get me my stuff.

322
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:21,956
Joyfully.

323
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,835
I talked to you this morning, Dr. Hudson.

324
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,380
Do you remember?

325
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,340
Of course I remember.

326
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,968
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
You called me a crank.

327
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,888
I suppose I am.

328
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,641
I got a couple crank calls myself.

329
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,103
That's why I thought
Daryll Lee Cullum was out of prison.

330
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:47,190
If Daryll Lee had gotten out,
you'd be the first to know.

331
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,067
Good.

332
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,402
I'm relieved.

333
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,905
I hate to sound like a broken record,
but you called us.

334
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,576
I did. I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

335
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,703
Why?

336
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:04,207
There's a serial killer out there who's
strangled three women. He'll do it again.

337
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,420
If there's evidence connecting these
murders, nothing's been made public.

338
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,130
How do you connect them?

339
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,423
I don't know.

340
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:15,093
Twenty years of clinical experience
with serial killers.

341
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,888
Would you work with us on this?

342
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,392
You're kidding?

343
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,357
I thought you knew
that I don't do this anymore.

344
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,734
I'm retired.

345
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:34,362
Is that why you called us 14 times?
'Cause you're retired?

346
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,032
Help me out. I really admire your work.

347
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,742
Does she do this...

348
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,619
...wide-eyed-little-girl routine often?

349
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:42,704
Yeah.

350
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,123
Does it work?

351
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:47,208
-Usually.
-Sometimes.

352
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,045
You can spare me the bullshit.

353
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:53,757
You don't admire me or like me.
None of your people do.

354
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,969
But I don't give a fuck!
That's the upside of a nervous breakdown.

355
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,639
If you don't mind, I have a very busy day.

356
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,810
It's a hell of an apartment you got here.

357
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,354
I guess...

358
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,482
...the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well.

359
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,859
We can't afford to pay you...

360
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:14,986
...your usual fee...

361
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,989
...but if you'd be so kind as to look...

362
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:20,992
I don't want these here.

363
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:24,079
-Would you be comfortable downtown?
-I don't want to see them here.

364
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,164
I'll drive you, if you prefer.

365
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:38,468
It's all right. It's okay.
Just breathe. I'm here.

366
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,180
-Should we call the paramedics?
-No.

367
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,599
It's just a good, old-fashioned panic attack.

368
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:48,728
She hyperventilates till she faints, then her
breathing gets normal and she's fine.

369
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,855
-What did we do?
-She's agoraphobic.

370
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,191
She's afraid of spiders, too?

371
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,527
She hasn't left home in over a year.

372
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,945
She's okay?

373
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,823
She's fine. ln half an hour,
she'll be singing.

374
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,282
Tell her...

375
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,952
...we're sorry we bothered her.

376
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,746
Did you want her to look at those?

377
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,456
If you do, leave them.

378
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,875
I'll make sure they're safe.

379
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,711
Tell her to call me...

380
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,546
...if she feels like it.

381
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,764
That one is a strange ranger.

382
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,059
Quinn said she was a crackpot.

383
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,271
He forgot to mention pill-popping
juicehead...

384
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,150
...hyperventilating, agoraphobic asshole.

385
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,486
I thought she was sweet.

386
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,532
Honest to God!

387
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,181
Are they gone?

388
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:07,974
All gone.

389
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,687
I must've looked like such an asshole.

390
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,816
You look good with a bag on your head.

391
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,193
Oh, God.

392
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,778
I want to die.

393
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,029
I wouldn't.

394
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,614
He'll be back.

395
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,115
Who'll be back?

396
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,117
Don't be coy.

397
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,870
You thought he was cute, too.

398
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,039
No, I didn't. I did not.

399
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:36,086
You like those cute, brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs.

400
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,422
Admit it.

401
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:41,841
Oh, God.

402
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,760
What? What'd I say?

403
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,637
Nothing.

404
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,806
I miss men.

405
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,016
What am l?

406
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,726
You know what I mean.

407
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,145
I miss sex.

408
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,984
He was pretty cute.

409
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,986
Yes, he was very cute.

410
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,492
No young cops for you.

411
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,831
Up you come. Sit over here.
Look at these pictures.

412
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,332
Why are these here?

413
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,167
I'll get you some coffee.

414
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:18,169
I can't.

415
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,422
Why don't you just die, then?

416
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:25,260
They'll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers.

417
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:30,473
Yeah, the old hermit lady.
She lived on cat food and Camembert.

418
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,268
She used to be a really good shrink.

419
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,187
Make up your mind. Here's your coffee.

420
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:37,897
Live or die.

421
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,644
You scared me.

422
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,480
Burning the midnight oil?

423
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,193
This stuff never gets any easier.

424
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:36,071
That's why they pay us the small bucks.

425
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:43,953
Do you...

426
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,127
What would you think if...

427
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:54,214
...when you're finished here
we go to Joe's and we...

428
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:56,299
...have a steak and...

429
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,096
I don't think so.

430
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,932
Thanks anyway.

431
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,853
You got other plans?
Not that it's any of my business...

432
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,523
You got that right.

433
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,859
Bean curd, smoked-eel sushi.

434
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,947
We got prawn tempura, seaweed salad.
You want to join us?

435
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,491
You kiss your mother after eating that?

436
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,743
No. I can kiss you, if you like.

437
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,203
Go fuck yourself.

438
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,546
Who put the bug up his ass?

439
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,297
Where's my cheeseburger?

440
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,508
I made an executive decision.

441
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:40,468
Japanese.

442
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,471
It's better for your heart.

443
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,227
You didn't even get French fries.
You're pissing me off.

444
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,645
Here, here.

445
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,981
Any word from...

446
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,567
...Helen "Paper Bag" Hudson?

447
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,153
Not yet, but there will be.

448
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:58,987
No way.

449
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,448
Five bucks she's going to call tonight.

450
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:03,742
Deal.

451
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,163
Wait a minute.

452
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,167
What's this Quarter Pounder
with cheese doing here?

453
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,683
lnspector Monahan, please.

454
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,561
These three are the work of the same man.

455
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,938
This one is different.

456
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,899
Are you testing me?

457
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,736
Not exactly. We had reason to believe...

458
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:41,780
I have to take tests now?

459
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,034
Ongoing case?

460
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,369
Six months.

461
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,622
The scene is disorganized.

462
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:54,125
The killer lives nearby.
He would've been too disoriented to drive.

463
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:58,880
You have two possibilities: One is
a mental patient, the other is a boyfriend.

464
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,716
Someone who was denied sex
on this occasion...

465
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,426
...who knew and cared about her.

466
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,886
He beat the shit out of her.

467
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,638
But he felt remorse.

468
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:10,642
He covered her up afterward,
because he felt conflicted.

469
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,436
Not like this man.

470
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,691
These are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all.

471
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,235
He's doing exactly what he wants to do.

472
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,653
Highly organized.

473
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,948
I'll bet there were no prints,
no stains, no blood.

474
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,116
Right.

475
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,327
No sign of forced entry.
He probably conned his way in.

476
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:31,996
They may or may not be about sex...

477
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,873
...but they're about power.

478
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,668
See the multiple thumbprints
along the throat?

479
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,004
Was the hyoid bone broken?

480
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,547
Yes, it was.

481
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,300
He strangles them face to face,
so they can see his power...

482
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:47,012
...and he can watch their terror.
That gets him off.

483
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,264
Then he revives them and does it again.

484
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:54,269
Look for an intelligent white male,
20 to 30 years old, socially functional...

485
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:57,647
...with a major interest in golden oldies.

486
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:02,902
Did I pass?

487
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,947
You passed.
What do you mean by golden oldies?

488
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:10,118
Where's the stocking
that was tied around this one's neck?

489
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,911
How'd you know that?

490
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:14,873
I mean, I assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose...

491
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,916
...tied in a big loopy bow...

492
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,460
...like this one.

493
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:20,754
Right.

494
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:23,882
For goodness sakes,
it's the Boston Strangler.

495
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:28,470
He's imitating Albert DeSalvo's
crime scene down to the kinky details.

496
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,681
This guy's copycatting a serial killer
who's been dead for...

497
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,099
Twenty years.

498
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:35,852
Why DeSalvo? Why not somebody
in the news recently?

499
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,604
Gacy or Ramirez?

500
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:39,522
I don't know.

501
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,983
These guys are like viruses.

502
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,986
There's always some new mutation.

503
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:26,528
The commissioner is up my ass,
saying we could use help here.

504
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,823
We could use help.
We need their VlCAP, we need their...

505
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,117
...database thingies.

506
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,994
The FBI will bury you with fucking help.

507
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,454
During Patty Hearst...

508
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:40,458
...some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month.

509
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,544
So, you're saying...?

510
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,255
I'm saying, if you need help...

511
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:48,425
...Nikko is almost through
with the Chinatown thing.

512
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,052
That really won't be necessary, sir.

513
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,388
Join us. We need you.

514
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,640
Anyone with a similar profile
to the Strangler.

515
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,809
Or with a German wife. Can you do that?

516
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,311
Anyone who wears green pants...

517
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:02,313
The files in from Boston, yet?

518
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:04,441
Should be here tomorrow.

519
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,568
What are you up to?

520
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:07,819
Going to Chinatown.

521
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,155
Sit in on this for a minute.

522
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:14,784
What do you got?

523
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,302
Winning?

524
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,512
I'm pulverizing him.

525
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,097
All right, I'm off.

526
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,433
-See you.
-Have a good time.

527
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,643
I won't wait up.

528
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,607
Got you.

529
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:11,401
She's next.

530
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:12,610
How do you know?

531
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,821
'Cause I watched her face change to that.

532
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,781
Did you try to play it back?

533
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:18,742
How did he send this to you?

534
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:20,702
He hacked into her lnternet address.

535
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,454
Can we trace it?

536
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,873
-Only if he's online right now.
-He ain't.

537
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:26,499
Can we rewind or...?

538
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,211
Yeah, we should be able to play it back.

539
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,881
-How long is the program?
-Thirty seconds.

540
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:36,301
-Can we get a copy of that face?
-No, it's too big a file.

541
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,428
Back up to tape.

542
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:43,516
She's got a tape backup.
We can make a copy and take it with us.

543
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,769
How do you know all this?

544
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,646
Misspent youth in video arcades, I guess.

545
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:51,149
A lot of quarters.

546
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,111
Why would he send this to you?

547
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,321
Why do you think?

548
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:57,781
No one mentioned your involvement.

549
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,867
There is no involvement. I'm not involved!

550
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,828
This is a game they play.
They hang around watching the cops...

551
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,330
...feeling superior to them.

552
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,749
lnstead of catching him, you led him to me.

553
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:10,210
He didn't write to me,
he wrote to you. Why?

554
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,295
Because I'm their damn pinup girl.

555
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,882
They all know me. They have libraries.
They collect clippings.

556
00:45:15,965 --> 00:45:18,301
I'm the muse of serial killers.

557
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:37,654
Try the C drive.

558
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,156
Any other suggestions?

559
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,951
It's gone. The file is not here.

560
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:46,413
It's not on C drive, and it's not in List.

561
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,374
You think he put a virus in there?

562
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,584
-Yeah.
-What exactly is...?

563
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,838
He wrote a virus into the program.
If you try to copy it, it's erased.

564
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:56,047
He booby-trapped it!

565
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,882
I must hand it to the guy.

566
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:01,803
-He's a smart motherfucker.
-Do you remember what she looked like?

567
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:03,888
Yes.

568
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,932
She looked like a girl.

569
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,351
She looked like a million other girls.

570
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,355
I barely saw her.

571
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:21,614
I'm going to the office to get
a systems guy on this. Maybe Marty.

572
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:23,825
What're you doing?

573
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:25,201
Unplugging this.

574
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,912
It's an open window.
He can crawl in any time he likes.

575
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:31,624
He comes in, we grab him.
It's the only lead we've got.

576
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:33,710
And what am l?

577
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:35,837
The lamb tied to the stake?

578
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:39,215
This is the only space
that I have in the world.

579
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,344
-You're not getting it.
-I'll get a guard here.

580
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,137
I don't want a guard here!

581
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,430
All right.

582
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,932
-We're all working together.
-I'm not.

583
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,268
I'm not working with anybody.

584
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:55,523
Turn the monitor back on and I'll stay
until we figure out what's happening.

585
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:57,859
-Go on.
-Catch you later.

586
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,070
All right?

587
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:02,489
Heil, Hitler.

588
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:16,628
I don't think he's going to send us
anything tonight. He's too busy.

589
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,759
You want a drink?

590
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,594
No, thank you.

591
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:26,137
On duty?

592
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,181
Always.

593
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:30,892
So...

594
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,813
What about you and the wee inspector?

595
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,275
What about us?

596
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:45,198
Are you?

597
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:47,826
We're partners.

598
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,244
Partners?

599
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,870
ln every way?

600
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:52,664
Not yet.

601
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,043
Self-confident.

602
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,337
Actually, I'm...

603
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:00,547
...shy...

604
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:01,881
...selective.

605
00:48:01,965 --> 00:48:03,550
The trouble is I'm...

606
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,804
...I'm finding myself...

607
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:12,183
You're in the witness category, you see.

608
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,906
ln better times, maybe.

609
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:36,207
Peter!

610
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,757
I've been calling and calling.
Didn't you hear me?

611
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,968
You completely forgot about me.

612
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:50,388
Very thirsty, weren't you,
my little sweetie?

613
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,349
Come on.

614
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,267
Are you teasing me?

615
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,977
Naughty little boy.

616
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,065
What are you doing?
Want to watch Letterman with me?

617
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:01,983
Well, I could, but...

618
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,277
I don't watch talk shows on my own.

619
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,612
I know.

620
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,616
Oh, go on.

621
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,243
Go back to your silly little computers.

622
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,496
Thanks.

623
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:17,624
Haven't you forgotten something?

624
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,098
I love you.

625
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:34,599
Yeah, me, too.

626
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,263
Look's like you're in a bit of trouble.

627
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:59,017
I'm going to place my hand...

628
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,477
...right here.

629
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:04,898
I'm going to put my elbow right here.

630
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:07,525
Just...

631
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:10,820
...cut...

632
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,114
...there.

633
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,117
There, now.

634
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:18,787
Didn't I say I'd take care of you?

635
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:21,706
Goodness! You're so hot!

636
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:29,464
This is going to hurt a little, I'm afraid.

637
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:32,842
They claim they didn't see anything.

638
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:36,054
You received a call from dispatch
at 6:35 a.m.?

639
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:40,350
Correct. 6:35. The first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later.

640
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,685
Great.

641
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,770
Did you isolate the kids who found her?

642
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:46,439
Yes, they're over on the side of the hill.

643
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,483
How many of you knew her?

644
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,402
We just danced with her.

645
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:51,653
Really?

646
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,822
You just met her tonight?

647
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,741
Excuse me.

648
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:58,076
Good afternoon.

649
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:02,205
Did you stand too far
from your razor today?

650
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,166
I was up all night with a sick friend.

651
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,168
I want to talk to you.

652
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:10,296
Have you got a thing going with MJ now?

653
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:13,008
I don't believe you.

654
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:15,260
Good God, man, you stink.

655
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:18,888
Heavy date last night?
Are you screwing around on her already?

656
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,265
What's wrong with you?

657
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:23,476
Me? I'll tell you, you just treat her right.

658
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:28,189
Don't go screwing around on her.
She doesn't deserve that.

659
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,526
Remind me again why she dumped you.

660
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:39,075
Why is he here?

661
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,703
What do you see? Tell me what you see.

662
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:46,791
There are stains.
So, she's been sexually assaulted.

663
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:51,254
No defense wounds. No ligature marks
or bruising, like the others.

664
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,630
Very cyanotic.

665
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,257
Asphyxiation, huh?

666
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:57,177
-Doesn't look like our guy.
-You don't think so?

667
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,012
Look at her heels.

668
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:02,015
There's abrasions, but no bleeding.

669
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:04,059
-She's been dragged up here postmortem.
-Maybe.

670
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:07,479
On this stuff we're not going to get
any prints or tracks.

671
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:08,980
Long night?

672
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:11,441
-Don't you start.
-What about her arms?

673
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,321
There's needle marks.

674
00:53:16,404 --> 00:53:18,740
No tracks. Not a regular user.

675
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:21,242
Probably so stoned,
she never knew what got her.

676
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:22,535
Hope so.

677
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,829
A lot of little hippie girls.

678
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:28,917
They all want to make love.
They all want to be beautiful.

679
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,752
That's your type, right?

680
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,505
What're you doing?

681
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:35,674
Want to be on the 6:00 news?

682
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,468
Go down and finish taking statements.

683
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,770
Let's get out of here.
