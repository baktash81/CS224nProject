1
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:45,852
My dear children,

2
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:50,845
It is now better than several years
since I moved to New York

3
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:54,928
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

4
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,044
I hope you will come to this ceremony
ofPapal honors,

5
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,524
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:06,847
The only wealth in this world is children.

7
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,007
More than all the money and power
on Earth.

8
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:13,090
You are my treasure.

9
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:16,725
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:21,446
although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:27,565
I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:33,251
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:38,535
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:44,011
Anyway, I remain your loving father.

15
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:15,653
Hail Mary, full of grace...

16
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:21,567
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

17
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:25,205
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,
Jesus.

18
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:29,763
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

19
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:59,366
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

20
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:05,565
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:24,528
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

22
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:29,086
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

23
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:31,052
I do so promise.

24
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,733
May the blessing of Almighty God,

25
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:53,650
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

26
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:58,969
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

27
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:31,892
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

28
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,613
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

29
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,529
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

30
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:46,325
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

31
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,009
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

32
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,814
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,125
Welcome to the party.

34
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:48,614
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

35
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,369
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

36
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:56,810
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

37
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,011
It was first granted by Pope...

38
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,485
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

39
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,726
The press kits have...

40
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:08,490
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.

41
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,653
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

42
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:16,331
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

43
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,087
Vincent! She loves you.

44
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:22,007
Yeah?

45
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:27,014
I love you too.

46
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:36,091
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

47
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:41,408
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

48
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:45,693
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

49
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,767
I was eight and you were 1 5.

50
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,968
I had many girlfriends when I was 1 5.

51
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,285
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

52
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,450
Where's Mary?

53
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:04,006
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

54
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,493
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

55
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:12,170
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

56
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:22,565
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

57
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:25,253
He's Italian.

58
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,890
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

59
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:32,604
Remember to keep your voice low.

60
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:35,448
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

61
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:58,374
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation:

62
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:02,085
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

63
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,252
Thanks.

64
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:18,134
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

65
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:23,647
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

66
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:28,252
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

67
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:32,966
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

68
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,126
Archbishop Gilday,

69
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:41,484
here is 1 00 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

70
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,688
Don't spend it all in one place.

71
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:06,694
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

72
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,807
Michael...

73
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:18,251
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

74
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:22,203
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

75
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,694
Amen.

76
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,563
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

77
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,573
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

78
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:44,855
I would like you to join me in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

79
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:52,366
I have something special
for our godfather.

80
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:56,847
I happen to know his favourite song.
Michael, where are you going?

81
00:11:57,015 --> 00:12:01,008
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

82
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:04,334
Your favourite song: "Salsiccia's Own".

83
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:07,931
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

84
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,486
Hello, Kay.

85
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:54,887
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honour.

86
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:58,047
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

87
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:03,292
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

88
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,488
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

89
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,089
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

90
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:24,530
You look wonderful.

91
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:32,285
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

92
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:10,972
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

93
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:16,567
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

94
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,214
Anthony...

95
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,447
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

96
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,173
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

97
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,566
What happens if you fail?

98
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:30,694
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

99
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:34,643
A law degree is like taking out insurance.

100
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:38,933
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

101
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,334
I have bad memories.

102
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,654
Every family has bad memories.

103
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,207
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

104
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,614
Anthony... finish the law degree.

105
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,288
No.

106
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:22,408
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

107
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:30,414
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

108
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,611
Of what?

109
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:37,485
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

110
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,564
This is greatness?

111
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,492
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

112
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:49,967
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

113
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,447
Okay.

114
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:56,525
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

115
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:05,927
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

116
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:14,972
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

117
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:20,163
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

118
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,934
I spent my life protecting my son.

119
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:30,644
I spent my life protecting my family!

120
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:33,488
Let's be reasonable, okay?

121
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:38,531
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason.

122
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:42,889
- Backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

123
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:47,525
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

124
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,686
I don't hate you.

125
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:53,489
I dread you.

126
00:16:56,135 --> 00:17:02,324
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

127
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:06,294
But you became my horror.

128
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:18,809
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

129
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,450
That's something.

130
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:29,208
We can build on that. For their sake.

131
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,246
Let's try.

132
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:39,569
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

133
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:49,003
I'll let Tony go.

134
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,526
Thank you.

135
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,565
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:34,209
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

137
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,764
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

138
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:41,804
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

139
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:45,088
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:48,088
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

141
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,964
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

142
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:56,128
- How will I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a loser?

143
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:58,206
Well...

144
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,290
Spooky-looking guy there.

145
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:07,485
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

146
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,249
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

147
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:15,091
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

148
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,213
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

149
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,365
Don Altobello.

150
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,963
- I've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.

151
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,409
You honour my father's friendship.

152
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:41,965
Where is my god-daughter?

153
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,774
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

154
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:49,531
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

155
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:02,050
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

156
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:07,733
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

157
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:14,414
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favour to ask of you.

158
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:22,611
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

159
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:28,168
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

160
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:34,731
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

161
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:41,249
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

162
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:48,248
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

163
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:57,886
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

164
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,374
Good.

165
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:04,245
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

166
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:09,489
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

167
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:13,529
Good. How do you think
I got this grey hair?

168
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:17,893
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

169
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:22,088
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

170
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:24,610
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

171
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,254
Andrew!

172
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:30,408
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

173
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:34,454
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

174
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:38,608
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

175
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,972
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

176
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,007
Honoured to meet you.

177
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,333
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

178
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:52,886
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me, that maybe you'd see me.

179
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:56,206
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

180
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,526
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

181
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:05,244
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

182
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:09,203
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

183
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:14,369
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

184
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:19,771
Hey, Vinnie!

185
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:23,014
- Who's your favourite aunt?
- You are.

186
00:22:25,415 --> 00:22:28,885
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

187
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,090
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

188
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:37,087
The Meucci Association
has elected you

189
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,894
Italian-American Man of the Year.

190
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,445
Meucci...

191
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:48,003
Who's Meucci?

192
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:53,772
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

193
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,612
And this is the reason
you've come today?

194
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:09,725
I...

195
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,089
I've got a stone in my shoe.

196
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:18,288
A two-bit punk who works for me.

197
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:22,448
The one who thinks he's related to you.

198
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,932
A bastard.

199
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:33,526
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

200
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,366
Bring him in.

201
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:42,566
I think it's good that we talk.

202
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,811
No, grazie.

203
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:48,690
I have a problem...

204
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:54,885
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

205
00:23:55,055 --> 00:24:00,493
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

206
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:04,610
Good. Then it's my problem.

207
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:12,408
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

208
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,533
- How are you, Mr. Corleone?
- How are you?

209
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:21,210
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

210
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,526
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

211
00:24:28,975 --> 00:24:33,446
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

212
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:39,053
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

213
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:44,489
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

214
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:49,090
- Right?!
- Temper like his father...

215
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,450
Vincent...

216
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:57,529
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

217
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:01,608
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

218
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:04,494
You took it against my advice.

219
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:09,410
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

220
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:14,444
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

221
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,206
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

222
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:22,527
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

223
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:26,165
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

224
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:30,010
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

225
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,494
Yes.

226
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:36,046
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

227
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:38,365
So kill him.

228
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,813
What does all this have to do with me?

229
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:46,924
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

230
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,529
Say it to his face, one time!

231
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:55,969
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

232
00:25:56,135 --> 00:25:59,684
What am I going to do with this guy?!

233
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:09,451
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

234
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,970
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

235
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:17,374
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

236
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:21,647
He's a fucking dog.

237
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:30,965
Yes, it's true. If anyone would say
such a thing,

238
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:34,571
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

239
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:45,972
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

240
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:47,727
Quiet, Vincent.

241
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:49,931
He needs your support!

242
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:53,690
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

243
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:59,566
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

244
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:07,731
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

245
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:13,931
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

246
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:26,250
Bastardo...

247
00:27:31,175 --> 00:27:33,928
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!

248
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:36,290
Get him out of here.

249
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,566
Jesus Christ...

250
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,612
- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

251
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:47,324
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

252
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:50,248
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

253
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:53,885
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

254
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,446
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

255
00:27:56,615 --> 00:27:59,448
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

256
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,846
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

257
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,006
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

258
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:13,765
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

259
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,893
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

260
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:21,051
And we'll talk about your future.

261
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:24,129
I won't let you down.

262
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:32,164
It's about ready.

263
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:38,854
What happened?

264
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:42,690
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

265
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,733
Here we go. Watch the card.

266
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:49,374
Hold it!

267
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:53,333
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

268
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:55,963
Take the picture with us.

269
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:04,885
Nice jacket.

270
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:08,649
Closer to the centre, sir.

271
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,133
Smile!

272
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:36,649
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

273
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:39,530
Do you want to do it?

274
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:26,134
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

275
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,646
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

276
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,844
Do you love me?

277
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:35,773
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

278
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,130
I love you.

279
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,855
I love you, too.

280
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:44,645
You've got a cat?

281
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:53,812
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

282
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,446
Come on.

283
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:06,006
Well, I guess I know my place.

284
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:09,965
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

285
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:14,128
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

286
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,648
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

287
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:14,046
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

288
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,406
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

289
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,332
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

290
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:29,090
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

291
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:34,770
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

292
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:38,928
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

293
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:41,370
Cut her throat! Right now!

294
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:47,131
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

295
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:53,448
Oh, shit!

296
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:57,770
Drop the knife. Drop it!

297
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:03,646
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

298
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:06,446
Lose the mask.

299
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:12,411
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

300
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:17,047
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

301
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,014
Tell me who sent you.

302
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,694
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

303
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,130
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

304
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,970
It was Joey Zasa.

305
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,283
Are you okay?

306
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,447
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

307
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:56,812
You pig! You sick fuck!

308
00:34:57,975 --> 00:35:01,968
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

309
00:35:06,215 --> 00:35:10,049
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

310
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:13,651
It was self-defence.
Go ahead, call the police.

311
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:16,446
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

312
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,845
No pictures.

313
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:21,368
You had a gun!

314
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:26,404
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

315
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:30,329
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

316
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:36,009
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Is Zasa going to send me one back?

317
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,928
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

318
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:44,089
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

319
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:48,848
All right. You are what you are.

320
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:52,053
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

321
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:55,924
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

322
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:59,087
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

323
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:03,009
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

324
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:07,771
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

325
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:10,733
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

326
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,886
Yes?

327
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:17,971
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

328
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:24,564
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

329
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:27,613
We've arranged some amazing things.

330
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:32,530
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

331
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,284
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

332
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:42,449
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

333
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:45,694
Man to man. But we're different.

334
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:50,565
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

335
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:55,365
Minimise taxes.
With no government control.

336
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:07,045
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

337
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:13,052
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

338
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:16,207
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

339
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:20,209
- How's your Italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.

340
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,650
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

341
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:28,286
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

342
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,925
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

343
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:36,007
If you hear any rumours in the Vatican,
let me know.

344
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:38,894
No, Andrew has the true faith.

345
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:49,252
Don Corleone,

346
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:53,806
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

347
00:37:54,975 --> 00:38:01,687
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

348
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:07,170
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

349
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:11,893
...but I was never a true banker.

350
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:18,927
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

351
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:22,204
Friendship and money...

352
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:24,733
Oil and water...

353
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:26,487
Indeed.

354
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:33,367
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

355
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:36,895
If money was lost...

356
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:40,455
...then I am to blame.

357
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:46,687
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

358
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,934
769 million...

359
00:38:56,295 --> 00:39:01,289
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: immobiliare.

360
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:04,126
You know the one I mean?

361
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:09,289
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

362
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,886
That's true.

363
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:17,048
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

364
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,367
No, you're mistaken.

365
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:26,733
This isn't a question of one person
deciding, one deciding vote.

366
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:32,606
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

367
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:38,051
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

368
00:39:41,935 --> 00:39:44,165
We've sold the casinos.

369
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:49,403
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

370
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:55,127
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

371
00:39:57,815 --> 00:40:02,525
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

372
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:05,687
when Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of immobiliare.

373
00:40:05,855 --> 00:40:11,168
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

374
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:16,327
Few families have control
of such a company.

375
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:22,048
It seems that, in today's world,

376
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:27,209
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

377
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,445
600 million dollars.

378
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,764
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

379
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:42,046
Don Corleone,

380
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:47,050
this deal with immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

381
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:52,528
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

382
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:58,683
600 million.

383
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:17,965
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

384
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:23,528
to acquire 100,000,000 newly-issued
Class A voting shares.

385
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:31,528
... Corleone capital invested directly
into international immobiliare,

386
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:35,449
an old and respected
European company.

387
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:40,769
Mr. Corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company

388
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:43,813
into an international conglomerate...

389
00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:51,925
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

390
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,973
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

391
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:58,650
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

392
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,648
which is affiliated with immobiliare?

393
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,294
True. Why not?

394
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:08,688
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

395
00:42:09,415 --> 00:42:11,883
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

396
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:17,646
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

397
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:21,012
has made an endowment
of 1 00 million dollars.

398
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:25,248
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

399
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,929
Does that answer your question?

400
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:34,204
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

401
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,843
personally and bottom line.

402
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:42,533
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

403
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:46,574
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

404
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:51,570
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

405
00:42:52,135 --> 00:42:54,729
Thank you for your time.

406
00:42:54,895 --> 00:42:59,332
I hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal. Thank you.

407
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:07,573
Let me have this microphone here.

408
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:12,855
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

409
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,494
Order!

410
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:17,567
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

411
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:23,691
The Hamilton investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

412
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:25,574
Your Excellency...

413
00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:28,094
Mr. Chairman...

414
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:34,851
...the Vatican Bank feels
that international immobiliare...

415
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:40,654
...will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.

416
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:45,605
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

417
00:43:45,775 --> 00:43:49,529
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

418
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:00,887
Dad?

419
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:06,684
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

420
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:11,410
That you're using me to pull the strings.

421
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:14,567
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

422
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,772
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

423
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:22,488
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

424
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:29,650
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

425
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:34,013
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

426
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,735
What is this really for?

427
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:41,525
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

428
00:44:41,695 --> 00:44:46,610
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

429
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:50,087
This foundation is supposed to
help all people?

430
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,734
That's the purpose.

431
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:57,171
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

432
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,445
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

433
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:16,047
I would burn in Hell to keep you safe.

434
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,973
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

435
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:34,126
Go, go, go.

436
00:45:47,215 --> 00:45:53,006
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

437
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:58,127
Tell me, Don Altobello.

438
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:03,648
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

439
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:06,124
They worship you...

440
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:12,965
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

441
00:46:13,415 --> 00:46:19,365
They want to share your deal
on immobiliare, to be a family again.

442
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:22,289
It can purify their money.

443
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,723
This I cannot do.

444
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:32,284
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

445
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,849
I know.

446
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,529
But they're unhappy.

447
00:46:40,015 --> 00:46:41,846
And you?

448
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:47,885
I ask nothing for myself,
only peace in my old age.

449
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,604
But I must please the world around me.

450
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:58,970
Michael, your father was a
reasonable man. Learn from him.

451
00:47:00,975 --> 00:47:04,445
I learned many things from my father.

452
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:14,933
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

453
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:19,207
We will make the peace, you and l.

454
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:28,771
The Vatican announced today...

455
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:33,053
that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

456
00:47:33,215 --> 00:47:35,365
due to ill health.

457
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:41,007
His physician has ordered
total bed rest...

458
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,928
and cessation of all activities.

459
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:02,413
They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo. "

460
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:33,329
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

461
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:37,408
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

462
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:40,166
Please...

463
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:44,806
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

464
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:47,967
against the Corleone control.

465
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:53,250
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

466
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:58,051
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

467
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,775
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

468
00:49:04,095 --> 00:49:07,565
The Pope is gravely ill.

469
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:12,528
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

470
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:15,933
- What if he dies?
- Then...

471
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:19,972
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

472
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:22,695
Gentlemen, please.

473
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:27,533
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

474
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,606
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

475
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:40,487
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

476
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,207
We had an agreement!

477
00:49:44,455 --> 00:49:48,164
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

478
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:53,250
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

479
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:58,694
The immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

480
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:02,645
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

481
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:05,807
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

482
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:10,969
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

483
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:19,411
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

484
00:50:20,055 --> 00:50:23,968
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

485
00:50:24,135 --> 00:50:28,048
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

486
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:35,211
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

487
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:43,124
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

488
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,768
Very well.

489
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:53,730
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

490
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:57,289
Vipers, all of them.

491
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:05,327
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

492
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,373
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

493
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:12,767
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

494
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:15,972
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

495
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:24,093
- Recognise it?
- Yeah.

496
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:29,565
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

497
00:51:29,735 --> 00:51:32,533
Three years later he owned it.

498
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:35,967
- Only in America.
- That's it.

499
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:41,129
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

500
00:51:41,295 --> 00:51:45,288
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

501
00:51:45,455 --> 00:51:49,767
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

502
00:51:49,935 --> 00:51:52,085
Where should they be now?

503
00:51:52,255 --> 00:51:55,247
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

504
00:51:57,015 --> 00:51:59,483
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

505
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:01,964
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

506
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:03,853
Enjoy yourselves.

507
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:14,327
- What was that?
- The neighbourhood's in trouble.

508
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:17,374
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

509
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,413
- And for me?
- From now on.

510
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:25,049
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

511
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,243
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

512
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:35,127
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

513
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:38,287
Yeah, what do you want to know?

514
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:45,532
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

515
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:50,209
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

516
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:55,324
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

517
00:52:56,535 --> 00:52:59,254
He's a hero. He saved the family.

518
00:53:00,455 --> 00:53:02,446
- Vincent?
- What?

519
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:05,083
Did he kill his own brother?

520
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:10,846
No.

521
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:15,169
So, it's all lies?

522
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:21,810
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

523
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:27,133
Okay.

524
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:30,645
I believe you.

525
00:53:30,815 --> 00:53:34,728
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

526
00:53:39,055 --> 00:53:41,011
Cugina...

527
00:53:41,215 --> 00:53:43,206
Cous...

528
00:53:56,455 --> 00:53:59,686
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

529
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:02,494
Joey Zasa is nothing.

530
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:06,364
He's a small-time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

531
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:10,369
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

532
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:14,007
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

533
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:21,051
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgement.

534
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:38,689
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

535
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:00,974
Hey, girls. Let's go.

536
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:21,733
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

537
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:27,492
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

538
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:29,964
Bravo, Don Corleone!

539
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,014
Thank you.

540
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:40,932
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

541
00:55:42,015 --> 00:55:43,733
We have prospered,

542
00:55:43,895 --> 00:55:49,606
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

543
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:52,811
That's it.

544
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:56,365
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

545
00:55:58,615 --> 00:56:01,129
Your shares in the casinos.

546
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:05,288
I've cut the red tape, so you could
get your money right away.

547
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:13,885
50 million dollars!

548
00:56:14,055 --> 00:56:17,365
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

549
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:23,167
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

550
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:24,654
Wonderful!

551
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:32,655
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

552
00:56:32,815 --> 00:56:34,771
You're blessed.

553
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:44,374
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

554
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,847
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

555
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,643
You all know Joey Zasa.

556
00:56:53,935 --> 00:56:56,927
He is, I admit, an important man.

557
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:01,567
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

558
00:57:01,735 --> 00:57:06,331
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best-dressed gangster.

559
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:08,372
The newspapers praise him

560
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:12,892
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

561
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,570
He is famous.

562
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:23,526
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

563
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:26,454
It's true.

564
00:57:26,615 --> 00:57:31,848
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

565
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:36,725
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

566
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:39,489
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

567
00:57:39,935 --> 00:57:44,804
Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish
into my family,

568
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:48,126
because that's America.

569
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:52,808
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

570
00:57:53,655 --> 00:57:58,888
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

571
00:58:02,575 --> 00:58:07,603
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

572
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:10,808
- Joey, are you...
- No!

573
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:16,493
I say to all of you: I have been
treated this day with no respect.

574
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:22,329
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

575
00:58:22,495 --> 00:58:26,852
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

576
00:58:27,695 --> 00:58:30,163
As for Don Corleone,

577
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:36,171
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

578
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:42,368
You must choose between us.

579
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:47,847
No, Joey!

580
00:58:48,895 --> 00:58:51,773
Michael, we could reason together.

581
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,448
No.

582
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:58,813
Michael, please... Let's agree.

583
00:58:58,975 --> 00:59:01,250
He doesn't know what he's...

584
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:03,246
No, no.

585
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:10,565
Michael, the news is everywhere.

586
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:14,844
Everyone says that you
control immobiliare.

587
00:59:15,015 --> 00:59:20,328
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

588
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:25,766
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

589
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:30,963
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

590
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:43,045
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

591
01:00:01,335 --> 01:00:04,168
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

592
01:00:05,175 --> 01:00:07,166
It's my lucky coat!

593
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:15,249
Stay behind me!

594
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:31,532
Mikey, this way!

595
01:00:39,775 --> 01:00:42,687
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

596
01:01:02,495 --> 01:01:05,055
Come on. We're out of here.

597
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:38,003
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

598
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:41,485
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

599
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:44,488
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

600
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:48,004
- Altobello?
- He survived.

601
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:53,249
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

602
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:59,490
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

603
01:01:59,655 --> 01:02:05,127
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

604
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:09,493
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

605
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:12,453
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

606
01:02:17,575 --> 01:02:20,567
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

607
01:02:28,175 --> 01:02:31,167
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

608
01:02:34,095 --> 01:02:36,893
I respect what he's done.

609
01:02:37,415 --> 01:02:40,487
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

610
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:44,284
How can you do business
with this guy?

611
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:49,408
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

612
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:54,365
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

613
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:13,486
That's it.

614
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:17,006
Joey Zasa...

615
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:19,848
He can't be doing this alone.

616
01:03:22,975 --> 01:03:27,730
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

617
01:03:35,175 --> 01:03:40,727
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

618
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:46,607
Michael!

619
01:03:52,855 --> 01:03:56,848
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

620
01:03:59,015 --> 01:04:02,849
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

621
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:05,768
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

622
01:04:05,935 --> 01:04:08,005
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

623
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:12,089
Harmless noise!

624
01:04:12,255 --> 01:04:16,806
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

625
01:04:17,535 --> 01:04:19,890
Altobello, you fuck!

626
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:24,612
Fredo!

627
01:04:25,015 --> 01:04:26,448
Fredo!

628
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:51,927
Oh, God! Dad!

629
01:04:53,855 --> 01:04:55,971
Excuse me.

630
01:04:56,135 --> 01:04:58,126
I'll call Kay.

631
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:11,888
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

632
01:05:17,935 --> 01:05:24,249
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

633
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:29,370
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

634
01:05:29,535 --> 01:05:34,165
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

635
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:36,371
The Pope has not much time left.

636
01:05:37,815 --> 01:05:41,694
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

637
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:45,689
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

638
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:48,847
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

639
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:53,768
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

640
01:05:57,775 --> 01:06:01,768
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

641
01:06:04,055 --> 01:06:08,287
Everything would be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

642
01:06:08,935 --> 01:06:11,051
Play for time, Keinszig.

643
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:16,411
A habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity.

644
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:26,448
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

645
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:32,292
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

646
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:37,688
He's always with people, in front of TV
cameras in his own neighborhood.

647
01:06:37,855 --> 01:06:41,245
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
- How?

648
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:46,091
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

649
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:49,053
He may not survive anyway.

650
01:06:49,535 --> 01:06:53,244
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

651
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:56,771
Do it!

652
01:06:58,335 --> 01:07:01,213
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

653
01:07:30,695 --> 01:07:33,004
Hello, Michael.

654
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:37,246
It's Kay.

655
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,173
Kay...

656
01:07:45,135 --> 01:07:47,490
I never expected you.

657
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:50,090
No, I know.

658
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,132
But I'm here.

659
01:07:57,695 --> 01:08:00,163
- I'm glad.
- You know...

660
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:05,529
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

661
01:08:09,815 --> 01:08:12,375
It's not so bad, really.

662
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:17,967
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

663
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,410
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

664
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:26,727
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

665
01:08:28,015 --> 01:08:32,406
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

666
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:39,293
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

667
01:08:39,455 --> 01:08:44,927
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

668
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:47,927
So, thank you.

669
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:52,564
That's a real honour. In Sicily.

670
01:08:57,015 --> 01:09:00,087
I will be there. I won't miss that.

671
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:02,492
I won't miss that.

672
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:10,763
Mary, Tony...

673
01:09:11,975 --> 01:09:14,170
Go see Dad.

674
01:09:19,015 --> 01:09:22,485
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

675
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:25,967
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

676
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:31,126
Your mother told me what happened.

677
01:09:31,295 --> 01:09:36,972
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

678
01:09:55,615 --> 01:10:01,133
- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartment.

679
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:04,731
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

680
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:12,454
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

681
01:10:12,615 --> 01:10:15,175
I'll get the guys.

682
01:10:16,215 --> 01:10:19,685
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

683
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:23,050
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

684
01:10:24,335 --> 01:10:27,611
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

685
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:33,251
So this is your club, your hideout?

686
01:10:33,415 --> 01:10:36,532
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

687
01:10:40,615 --> 01:10:44,608
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

688
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:49,246
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

689
01:10:49,415 --> 01:10:52,009
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

690
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:56,487
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

691
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:59,647
Everybody says he's going to be better.

692
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:02,446
Don't worry.

693
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:05,368
I remember a shooting when I was little.

694
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:11,285
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

695
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,727
Is it all happening again?

696
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:18,723
Not like that, sweetie.

697
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:24,366
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

698
01:11:25,255 --> 01:11:29,965
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

699
01:11:39,935 --> 01:11:44,292
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

700
01:11:44,455 --> 01:11:48,448
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

701
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:02,326
Okay...

702
01:12:02,495 --> 01:12:04,486
What do I do?

703
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:38,451
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

704
01:12:41,575 --> 01:12:43,884
Let us cook.

705
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:01,246
Hold me.

706
01:13:35,935 --> 01:13:40,406
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

707
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:45,808
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

708
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:48,443
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

709
01:13:48,615 --> 01:13:52,130
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

710
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:56,208
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

711
01:13:57,455 --> 01:13:59,844
The salsiccia is wonderful!

712
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:02,165
Here, have a sandwich.

713
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:18,209
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

714
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:22,127
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

715
01:14:24,415 --> 01:14:27,646
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

716
01:14:27,815 --> 01:14:31,091
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

717
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:51,123
Joey! How are you?

718
01:14:51,935 --> 01:14:54,574
How are you, Buddy boy?

719
01:14:54,735 --> 01:14:58,364
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

720
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:02,248
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

721
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:06,044
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

722
01:15:07,535 --> 01:15:11,767
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

723
01:15:11,935 --> 01:15:14,165
Joey, up your ass!

724
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:17,133
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

725
01:15:17,895 --> 01:15:21,092
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

726
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:25,411
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

727
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:29,090
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

728
01:15:31,575 --> 01:15:34,169
Get out of here!

729
01:15:48,975 --> 01:15:52,206
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

730
01:16:03,615 --> 01:16:04,934
Open the door!

731
01:16:05,495 --> 01:16:08,248
How are you, Joe?

732
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,694
Zasa!

733
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:35,173
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

734
01:16:35,535 --> 01:16:37,332
Understand?

735
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:44,405
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

736
01:16:45,175 --> 01:16:46,972
Connie?

737
01:16:55,895 --> 01:16:59,012
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

738
01:16:59,175 --> 01:17:02,804
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

739
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,445
Right or wrong...

740
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:09,008
...it was not what I wanted!

741
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,486
Do you understand?

742
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:36,134
Yes.

743
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,247
Come on, Michael.

744
01:17:55,415 --> 01:17:57,246
Yes.

745
01:17:58,695 --> 01:18:04,452
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

746
01:18:12,215 --> 01:18:16,811
You know, I always felt
responsible for you.

747
01:18:16,975 --> 01:18:19,045
You know that.

748
01:18:19,335 --> 01:18:21,087
Your father...

749
01:18:22,015 --> 01:18:25,291
...my brother, we were opposites.

750
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:30,324
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

751
01:18:30,495 --> 01:18:35,125
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

752
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,408
Too much. It clouded his reason.

753
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:46,726
I don't want you to make that mistake.

754
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:51,005
Also...

755
01:18:51,175 --> 01:18:54,167
...he, too, had a way with women.

756
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,843
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

757
01:18:58,015 --> 01:19:00,404
What are you doing with my daughter?

758
01:19:02,895 --> 01:19:05,887
What are you doing with her?

759
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:11,645
It's too dangerous.

760
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:16,126
Do you hear me?

761
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:23,526
Okay.

762
01:19:36,695 --> 01:19:38,845
Vincenzo...

763
01:19:42,095 --> 01:19:46,885
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

764
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,206
Michael, you must lead another life.

765
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:02,608
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

766
01:20:03,295 --> 01:20:06,128
I have too much responsibility.

767
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:12,208
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

768
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:17,285
What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

769
01:20:20,655 --> 01:20:24,364
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

770
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:29,086
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

771
01:20:30,095 --> 01:20:34,327
- We're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

772
01:20:34,815 --> 01:20:39,445
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

773
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:43,813
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

774
01:20:43,975 --> 01:20:49,333
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

775
01:20:49,495 --> 01:20:53,488
Joey Zasa... You were wrong
about him.

776
01:20:54,455 --> 01:20:58,243
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

777
01:21:05,415 --> 01:21:09,294
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

778
01:21:09,455 --> 01:21:13,687
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

779
01:21:14,615 --> 01:21:17,607
Let's see more of each other.

780
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:22,166
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

781
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:24,686
In Sicilia.

782
01:21:24,935 --> 01:21:27,449
In Sicilia.

783
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:14,686
How are you?

784
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:17,323
Don Bendino, my old friend.

785
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:53,093
I brought you here so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

786
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:55,246
could advise us.

787
01:22:55,415 --> 01:22:59,294
What do you think about Altobello?

788
01:23:01,295 --> 01:23:03,286
A very talented man.

789
01:23:03,455 --> 01:23:08,006
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

790
01:23:08,175 --> 01:23:10,735
The saint of reason.

791
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:16,289
A blood-bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

792
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:19,447
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

793
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:23,369
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

794
01:23:23,535 --> 01:23:27,847
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

795
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:33,373
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

796
01:23:34,255 --> 01:23:38,248
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

797
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:44,970
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

798
01:23:47,175 --> 01:23:50,850
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

799
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:55,770
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

800
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:01,494
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

801
01:24:02,615 --> 01:24:08,133
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

802
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:11,446
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

803
01:24:11,615 --> 01:24:15,733
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

804
01:24:16,255 --> 01:24:18,769
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

805
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:23,246
They totally protect him.

806
01:24:23,415 --> 01:24:27,647
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

807
01:24:27,815 --> 01:24:31,410
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

808
01:24:32,455 --> 01:24:34,446
Cardinal Lamberto.

809
01:24:34,615 --> 01:24:39,814
A wise and good man...
very influential.

810
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,853
He will see you.

811
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:53,287
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

812
01:24:54,895 --> 01:24:59,605
You honour your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

813
01:25:00,055 --> 01:25:02,523
They have no honour.

814
01:25:04,215 --> 01:25:05,967
My word is final.

815
01:25:16,175 --> 01:25:19,929
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

816
01:25:41,575 --> 01:25:47,969
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

817
01:25:48,135 --> 01:25:51,127
We'll play "Philadelphia".

818
01:25:51,295 --> 01:25:55,527
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

819
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:58,255
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

820
01:25:58,415 --> 01:26:02,010
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana", Dad.
- "Cavalleria".

821
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:07,169
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

822
01:26:08,015 --> 01:26:11,325
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

823
01:26:11,495 --> 01:26:14,487
Dad, I've got a present for you.

824
01:26:17,175 --> 01:26:21,612
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

825
01:26:22,615 --> 01:26:25,891
And... I learned it for you.

826
01:27:51,415 --> 01:27:56,933
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.

827
01:27:58,015 --> 01:28:03,043
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

828
01:28:04,415 --> 01:28:07,327
She drove it before I did.

829
01:28:07,855 --> 01:28:11,370
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

830
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:12,854
History.

831
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:17,566
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

832
01:28:17,735 --> 01:28:21,171
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

833
01:28:21,335 --> 01:28:26,329
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

834
01:28:26,495 --> 01:28:30,249
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

835
01:28:33,695 --> 01:28:35,765
I really love him.

836
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:41,047
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

837
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,934
Mary, you can't see him.

838
01:28:44,415 --> 01:28:47,248
Just don't see him anymore.

839
01:28:47,415 --> 01:28:51,090
He's right. It's too dangerous.

840
01:28:52,975 --> 01:28:55,967
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

841
01:28:56,135 --> 01:28:58,524
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

842
01:28:59,895 --> 01:29:03,410
- Please, promise me.
- No!

843
01:29:03,575 --> 01:29:05,645
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

844
01:29:10,815 --> 01:29:15,366
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

845
01:29:36,855 --> 01:29:39,847
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

846
01:29:50,495 --> 01:29:53,487
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

847
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:57,170
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

848
01:29:58,855 --> 01:30:02,211
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

849
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:05,924
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

850
01:30:06,095 --> 01:30:08,529
To betray me.

851
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:13,808
He'd never believe me.

852
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,092
- That depends.
- Sit down.

853
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:21,484
I have an idea.

854
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:26,566
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

855
01:30:29,415 --> 01:30:31,770
Arrange a meeting.

856
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:38,610
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

857
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:42,530
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

858
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:47,006
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

859
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:51,965
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

860
01:30:55,775 --> 01:30:59,290
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

861
01:31:00,295 --> 01:31:05,244
Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

862
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:10,773
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

863
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:15,929
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

864
01:31:16,535 --> 01:31:20,414
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

865
01:31:21,095 --> 01:31:24,371
I could use your friendship
to persuade him.

866
01:31:24,975 --> 01:31:28,012
I would be indebted to you forever.

867
01:31:29,655 --> 01:31:33,614
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

868
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:37,244
Then you would work for me?

869
01:31:38,255 --> 01:31:39,529
Si.

870
01:31:42,055 --> 01:31:44,728
Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

871
01:31:47,255 --> 01:31:52,124
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

872
01:31:52,655 --> 01:31:55,328
because that's his trap.

873
01:32:01,535 --> 01:32:04,925
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

874
01:32:07,615 --> 01:32:13,292
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

875
01:32:16,695 --> 01:32:20,529
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

876
01:32:20,695 --> 01:32:23,129
And she loves you.

877
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:44,974
I guessed it, didn't l?

878
01:32:46,655 --> 01:32:52,013
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

879
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:56,168
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

880
01:32:57,775 --> 01:33:00,494
It's my duty to make the introductions.

881
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:09,126
Don Lucchesi.

882
01:33:11,615 --> 01:33:17,167
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

883
01:33:17,335 --> 01:33:20,725
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa
in his grave.

884
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:25,127
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

885
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:27,763
No one wants another Joe.

886
01:33:29,055 --> 01:33:31,649
Let me be your friend.

887
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:36,127
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

888
01:33:37,095 --> 01:33:41,691
You're a man of finance and politics,
things I don't understand.

889
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:47,488
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

890
01:33:48,015 --> 01:33:52,008
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

891
01:33:56,135 --> 01:33:58,444
How can I help?

892
01:33:58,615 --> 01:34:00,014
Vieni?

893
01:34:02,855 --> 01:34:08,248
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

894
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:11,088
- Tu parli Italiano un poco?
- Si.

895
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:35,488
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

896
01:34:43,095 --> 01:34:47,327
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

897
01:34:47,495 --> 01:34:51,249
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

898
01:34:51,415 --> 01:34:56,205
But, as you see, I'm now
the victim of a swindle.

899
01:34:56,375 --> 01:35:02,086
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

900
01:35:02,255 --> 01:35:04,928
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

901
01:35:05,095 --> 01:35:10,294
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

902
01:35:12,215 --> 01:35:16,891
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

903
01:35:17,055 --> 01:35:21,128
but the water has not penetrated it.

904
01:35:24,775 --> 01:35:26,094
Look...

905
01:35:27,095 --> 01:35:32,044
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

906
01:35:32,215 --> 01:35:36,606
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

907
01:35:36,775 --> 01:35:42,486
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

908
01:35:46,215 --> 01:35:50,208
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

909
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:53,685
Some orange juice, candy...

910
01:35:57,215 --> 01:36:00,252
I have trouble with diabetes.

911
01:36:02,895 --> 01:36:05,409
My blood sugar goes low.

912
01:36:05,575 --> 01:36:07,611
I understand.

913
01:36:29,135 --> 01:36:32,525
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

914
01:36:33,055 --> 01:36:35,285
I understand.

915
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:40,573
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

916
01:36:43,015 --> 01:36:47,884
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

917
01:36:49,015 --> 01:36:50,892
The mind suffers

918
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:54,127
and the body cries out.

919
01:36:57,295 --> 01:37:00,605
That's true.

920
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:06,694
Would you like to make
your confession?

921
01:37:12,975 --> 01:37:16,285
Your Eminence, I'm...

922
01:37:18,775 --> 01:37:24,645
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

923
01:37:25,495 --> 01:37:27,486
It's been 30 years.

924
01:37:28,495 --> 01:37:31,931
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

925
01:37:32,655 --> 01:37:35,010
I always have time to save souls.

926
01:37:36,255 --> 01:37:41,170
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

927
01:37:49,975 --> 01:37:54,253
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

928
01:37:54,815 --> 01:37:58,569
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

929
01:37:58,735 --> 01:38:01,488
and we must seize the moment.

930
01:38:05,535 --> 01:38:10,086
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

931
01:38:11,495 --> 01:38:14,885
I hear you are a practical man.

932
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:17,523
What have you got to lose?

933
01:38:28,255 --> 01:38:30,325
Go on.

934
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:38,285
I...

935
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:40,764
...betrayed my wife.

936
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:44,454
Go on, my son.

937
01:38:48,735 --> 01:38:51,249
I betrayed myself.

938
01:38:53,535 --> 01:38:55,685
I killed men.

939
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:01,807
And I ordered men to be killed.

940
01:39:02,655 --> 01:39:05,249
Go on, my son. Go on.

941
01:39:10,375 --> 01:39:11,808
It's useless.

942
01:39:13,655 --> 01:39:15,646
Go on, my son.

943
01:39:16,535 --> 01:39:18,844
I killed...

944
01:39:22,815 --> 01:39:25,807
I ordered the death of my brother.

945
01:39:26,375 --> 01:39:28,445
He injured me.

946
01:39:29,615 --> 01:39:32,334
I killed my mother's son.

947
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:35,730
I killed my father's son.

948
01:39:45,575 --> 01:39:50,330
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

949
01:39:51,655 --> 01:39:54,806
Your life could be redeemed,

950
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:59,571
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

951
01:40:27,935 --> 01:40:33,089
Pope Paul Vl, the Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...

952
01:40:33,255 --> 01:40:36,884
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

953
01:40:37,055 --> 01:40:40,730
The Pope was 81 years old,...

954
01:40:40,895 --> 01:40:44,126
and had been in poor health
for the last several months.

955
01:40:48,855 --> 01:40:50,846
Connie...

956
01:40:51,935 --> 01:40:56,645
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

957
01:40:56,815 --> 01:41:01,252
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

958
01:41:01,695 --> 01:41:05,324
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

959
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:10,214
Where the hell does it end?

960
01:41:18,215 --> 01:41:22,094
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

961
01:41:23,015 --> 01:41:27,213
For money, for pride, for family.

962
01:41:29,975 --> 01:41:34,491
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

963
01:41:40,655 --> 01:41:43,169
I made confession, Connie.

964
01:41:43,855 --> 01:41:46,369
I confessed my sins.

965
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:52,807
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

966
01:41:52,975 --> 01:41:54,647
It was the man.

967
01:41:55,975 --> 01:41:59,604
He's a good man. A true priest.

968
01:42:03,215 --> 01:42:05,410
He can change things.

969
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:09,366
Michael...

970
01:42:10,335 --> 01:42:13,964
You know, sometimes I think
of poor Fredo.

971
01:42:14,975 --> 01:42:18,650
Drowned. It was God's will.

972
01:42:20,615 --> 01:42:23,049
It was a terrible accident.

973
01:42:23,975 --> 01:42:26,091
But it's finished.

974
01:42:30,815 --> 01:42:33,124
Michael, I love you.

975
01:42:34,855 --> 01:42:37,164
I'll always help you.

976
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:50,486
Oh, Connie...

977
01:43:18,695 --> 01:43:25,214
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

978
01:43:28,575 --> 01:43:33,171
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

979
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:35,847
Do the donkey for me.

980
01:43:52,455 --> 01:43:57,085
It's been some time since we
did business together.

981
01:43:59,975 --> 01:44:04,366
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

982
01:44:05,255 --> 01:44:11,091
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

983
01:44:17,775 --> 01:44:20,084
Only one stone?

984
01:44:22,415 --> 01:44:28,092
It's dangerous. A famous man.

985
01:44:28,255 --> 01:44:31,372
You will have to take precautions.

986
01:44:34,255 --> 01:44:39,249
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

987
01:44:43,935 --> 01:44:46,324
Ah, what bread!

988
01:44:50,415 --> 01:44:52,406
Olive oil...

989
01:44:57,455 --> 01:45:01,004
Virgin... only in Sicily.

990
01:45:03,415 --> 01:45:04,894
Alla salute!

991
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:06,773
To death.

992
01:45:19,935 --> 01:45:21,607
Kay!

993
01:45:21,775 --> 01:45:23,845
- Connie!
- How are you?

994
01:45:24,015 --> 01:45:26,893
Mary, I've missed you.

995
01:45:27,495 --> 01:45:31,488
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

996
01:45:34,815 --> 01:45:40,572
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

997
01:45:40,735 --> 01:45:43,329
I know he wanted to come.

998
01:45:43,735 --> 01:45:45,771
- The car is...
- Okay.

999
01:45:47,535 --> 01:45:53,690
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1000
01:45:53,855 --> 01:45:58,406
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

1001
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:03,730
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1002
01:46:03,895 --> 01:46:07,126
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- Okay.

1003
01:46:08,895 --> 01:46:10,886
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1004
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:18,644
I see you still have AI Neri. Why?

1005
01:46:18,815 --> 01:46:23,206
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1006
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:27,368
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

1007
01:46:28,255 --> 01:46:34,125
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

1008
01:46:34,295 --> 01:46:37,367
I think I understand it more than enough.

1009
01:47:26,655 --> 01:47:32,252
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1010
01:47:34,095 --> 01:47:37,007
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1011
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:43,646
You saved it... I remember.

1012
01:47:47,655 --> 01:47:49,646
Thank you, Dad.

1013
01:47:50,935 --> 01:47:52,448
I'm proud of you.

1014
01:47:53,215 --> 01:47:55,012
Thank you.

1015
01:48:10,215 --> 01:48:12,809
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

1016
01:48:12,975 --> 01:48:17,491
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1017
01:48:17,655 --> 01:48:19,964
Goodbye.

1018
01:48:21,815 --> 01:48:25,091
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

1019
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:27,769
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1020
01:48:27,935 --> 01:48:29,926
I will.

1021
01:48:31,695 --> 01:48:34,812
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1022
01:48:38,935 --> 01:48:42,291
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1023
01:48:47,175 --> 01:48:50,724
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1024
01:48:52,815 --> 01:48:57,093
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1025
01:48:59,455 --> 01:49:01,173
I'll have everything ready.

1026
01:49:04,695 --> 01:49:07,368
Do you swear?

1027
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:15,764
I swear to you.

1028
01:49:44,295 --> 01:49:46,525
Here it is.

1029
01:49:47,535 --> 01:49:50,527
The house where my father was born.

1030
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:56,527
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1031
01:49:59,495 --> 01:50:01,133
Wait...

1032
01:50:01,855 --> 01:50:03,846
Listen to that.

1033
01:50:22,135 --> 01:50:25,047
You know Mary's in love.

1034
01:50:25,415 --> 01:50:27,724
Yes, I know.

1035
01:50:27,975 --> 01:50:32,014
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1036
01:50:33,255 --> 01:50:35,371
I won't allow it.

1037
01:50:37,495 --> 01:50:41,170
It's wrong. It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1038
01:50:41,535 --> 01:50:44,208
"Oh, father, my father!"

1039
01:50:44,615 --> 01:50:47,083
"Give me time to pray
to the Lord."

1040
01:50:47,255 --> 01:50:51,931
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1041
01:50:52,095 --> 01:50:54,325
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1042
01:50:54,495 --> 01:50:55,814
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1043
01:50:55,975 --> 01:51:00,093
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1044
01:51:12,015 --> 01:51:13,892
Honour, huh?

1045
01:51:32,015 --> 01:51:35,007
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1046
01:51:35,175 --> 01:51:38,485
and told me about the family business.

1047
01:51:38,655 --> 01:51:44,048
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1048
01:51:44,575 --> 01:51:47,567
I was a lot like Tony.

1049
01:51:53,695 --> 01:51:56,573
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1050
01:51:56,735 --> 01:51:59,044
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1051
01:51:59,215 --> 01:52:02,207
My eyes. Sometimes
they're all right, but...

1052
01:52:03,615 --> 01:52:06,334
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1053
01:52:09,335 --> 01:52:11,326
Well...

1054
01:52:11,775 --> 01:52:15,404
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1055
01:52:22,255 --> 01:52:26,533
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1056
01:52:35,615 --> 01:52:39,403
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1057
01:52:40,575 --> 01:52:44,250
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

1058
01:52:44,415 --> 01:52:47,612
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1059
01:52:47,775 --> 01:52:50,926
I will pass through the gates
with you.

1060
01:53:06,095 --> 01:53:07,687
How are you?

1061
01:53:07,855 --> 01:53:11,848
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1062
01:53:16,615 --> 01:53:19,413
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1063
01:53:24,455 --> 01:53:27,447
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1064
01:53:28,295 --> 01:53:30,365
...thinking of you.

1065
01:53:33,455 --> 01:53:36,015
And then you got married.

1066
01:53:39,055 --> 01:53:42,764
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1067
01:53:46,575 --> 01:53:50,568
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

1068
01:53:52,975 --> 01:53:56,012
- I love this country.
- Why?

1069
01:53:57,695 --> 01:54:03,565
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

1070
01:54:04,215 --> 01:54:06,775
Terrible injustices.

1071
01:54:07,415 --> 01:54:12,443
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1072
01:54:12,615 --> 01:54:15,448
Sort of like me and you?

1073
01:54:18,495 --> 01:54:21,885
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1074
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:25,092
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1075
01:54:25,255 --> 01:54:27,723
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1076
01:54:32,415 --> 01:54:34,053
Give me the order!

1077
01:54:34,535 --> 01:54:38,084
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1078
01:54:39,935 --> 01:54:42,529
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1079
01:54:44,255 --> 01:54:46,246
Okay.

1080
01:54:48,055 --> 01:54:50,364
What do we do now?

1081
01:54:52,815 --> 01:54:57,445
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1082
01:55:03,575 --> 01:55:06,294
I want you to forgive me.

1083
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:11,567
- For what?
- Everything.

1084
01:55:14,815 --> 01:55:17,693
Oh, like God?

1085
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:21,333
No, I need something a little closer.

1086
01:55:24,055 --> 01:55:27,092
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1087
01:55:28,575 --> 01:55:33,205
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1088
01:55:33,375 --> 01:55:37,448
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1089
01:55:37,615 --> 01:55:40,925
And then later, you were in danger.

1090
01:55:41,095 --> 01:55:44,883
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1091
01:55:45,055 --> 01:55:50,493
You were all that l... Loved and valued
most in the world.

1092
01:55:52,095 --> 01:55:54,655
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1093
01:55:55,495 --> 01:55:57,611
You're gone.

1094
01:55:58,575 --> 01:56:02,090
And it was all for nothing. So...

1095
01:56:06,015 --> 01:56:10,930
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1096
01:56:13,935 --> 01:56:16,495
All right, I'll stop.

1097
01:56:25,935 --> 01:56:29,848
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1098
01:56:30,015 --> 01:56:34,805
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

1099
01:56:36,095 --> 01:56:40,008
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1100
01:56:41,255 --> 01:56:43,894
Don't dread me anymore.

1101
01:56:48,695 --> 01:56:52,574
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1102
01:56:54,495 --> 01:56:59,774
...l dream about my wife
and my children...

1103
01:57:02,895 --> 01:57:05,170
...and how I lost them.

1104
01:57:06,735 --> 01:57:12,253
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1105
01:57:15,455 --> 01:57:16,774
...that...

1106
01:57:17,855 --> 01:57:20,494
...l always loved you, Michael.

1107
01:57:21,615 --> 01:57:23,412
And you know...

1108
01:57:24,975 --> 01:57:27,489
...always, I always will.

1109
01:57:54,175 --> 01:57:55,927
What is it? What's wrong?

1110
01:57:57,135 --> 01:58:00,093
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1111
01:58:01,295 --> 01:58:02,774
Is he dead?

1112
01:58:04,855 --> 01:58:08,450
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1113
01:58:08,855 --> 01:58:12,006
I must have revenge!

1114
01:58:14,855 --> 01:58:20,168
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1115
01:58:20,655 --> 01:58:23,089
Command me.

1116
01:58:23,535 --> 01:58:24,854
It never ends.

1117
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:27,370
I will avenge him!

1118
01:58:41,695 --> 01:58:43,333
Totals...

1119
01:58:44,975 --> 01:58:47,728
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1120
01:58:48,135 --> 01:58:50,933
Siri, 11 votes.

1121
01:58:51,575 --> 01:58:55,363
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1122
01:59:00,015 --> 01:59:05,408
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1123
01:59:05,575 --> 01:59:11,127
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1124
01:59:12,095 --> 01:59:13,653
I accept.

1125
01:59:13,815 --> 01:59:16,283
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1126
01:59:16,455 --> 01:59:19,367
John Paul the First.

1127
01:59:47,615 --> 01:59:53,167
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1128
01:59:54,415 --> 01:59:59,489
Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker", has been reported missing.

1129
01:59:59,655 --> 02:00:06,094
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned immobiliare.

1130
02:00:06,775 --> 02:00:10,529
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1131
02:00:11,575 --> 02:00:14,135
Keinszig, you fool.

1132
02:00:16,615 --> 02:00:21,450
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1133
02:00:21,615 --> 02:00:24,368
For several years,
the bank and its companies

1134
02:00:24,535 --> 02:00:28,892
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1135
02:00:29,535 --> 02:00:33,653
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1136
02:00:34,775 --> 02:00:39,326
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1137
02:00:41,695 --> 02:00:46,132
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,

1138
02:00:46,295 --> 02:00:53,007
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1139
02:01:13,695 --> 02:01:15,890
Goodbye, my old friend.

1140
02:01:18,175 --> 02:01:21,451
You could have lived a little longer.

1141
02:01:21,615 --> 02:01:24,846
I could be closer to my dream.

1142
02:01:29,775 --> 02:01:33,006
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1143
02:01:37,215 --> 02:01:41,003
Why was I so feared,
and you so loved?

1144
02:01:42,015 --> 02:01:44,131
What was it?

1145
02:01:44,575 --> 02:01:47,294
I was no less honourable.

1146
02:01:48,575 --> 02:01:50,805
I wanted to do good.

1147
02:01:54,415 --> 02:01:57,725
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

1148
02:02:00,215 --> 02:02:02,934
Why do I condemn myself so?

1149
02:02:08,815 --> 02:02:10,885
I swear,

1150
02:02:11,055 --> 02:02:13,728
on the lives of my children...

1151
02:02:17,535 --> 02:02:20,447
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1152
02:02:23,935 --> 02:02:27,530
...and I will sin no more.

1153
02:02:50,295 --> 02:02:54,447
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1154
02:02:56,295 --> 02:02:59,605
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1155
02:02:59,775 --> 02:03:02,687
These guys are butchers.

1156
02:03:02,855 --> 02:03:05,892
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1157
02:03:07,175 --> 02:03:11,373
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1158
02:03:12,455 --> 02:03:15,015
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1159
02:03:15,175 --> 02:03:18,963
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1160
02:03:21,815 --> 02:03:26,843
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1161
02:03:27,015 --> 02:03:30,325
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1162
02:03:31,535 --> 02:03:33,890
But they say he never fails.

1163
02:03:34,895 --> 02:03:37,329
Then no one is safe.

1164
02:03:39,655 --> 02:03:42,852
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1165
02:03:43,015 --> 02:03:46,849
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1166
02:03:50,935 --> 02:03:53,654
I tried, Vincent.

1167
02:03:55,375 --> 02:03:58,094
I tried...

1168
02:03:58,255 --> 02:04:03,613
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1169
02:04:03,775 --> 02:04:06,084
Not in this world.

1170
02:04:07,095 --> 02:04:09,051
Give me the order.

1171
02:04:12,375 --> 02:04:15,367
You won't be able to go back.

1172
02:04:15,535 --> 02:04:18,493
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1173
02:04:19,335 --> 02:04:21,849
All my life I wanted out.

1174
02:04:22,015 --> 02:04:24,734
I wanted the family out.

1175
02:04:26,015 --> 02:04:27,653
I don't want out.

1176
02:04:28,255 --> 02:04:31,292
I want the power to preserve the family.

1177
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:37,730
I'm asking for the order.

1178
02:04:57,495 --> 02:04:59,645
It's done.

1179
02:05:00,615 --> 02:05:03,334
Because I can't do it anymore.

1180
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:10,209
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1181
02:05:10,375 --> 02:05:15,244
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1182
02:05:15,415 --> 02:05:19,374
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1183
02:05:19,535 --> 02:05:22,254
Command me in all things.

1184
02:05:23,615 --> 02:05:26,209
Give up my daughter.

1185
02:05:28,495 --> 02:05:31,532
That's the price you pay...

1186
02:05:31,695 --> 02:05:34,289
...for the life you choose.

1187
02:05:58,735 --> 02:06:00,566
Nephew...

1188
02:06:02,615 --> 02:06:04,890
...from this moment on...

1189
02:06:06,255 --> 02:06:09,088
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1190
02:06:13,055 --> 02:06:14,647
Sit.

1191
02:06:28,815 --> 02:06:30,806
Don Vincenzo...

1192
02:06:36,295 --> 02:06:38,047
Don Corleone...

1193
02:06:41,015 --> 02:06:43,609
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1194
02:08:13,135 --> 02:08:14,454
E tu, Vincenzo...

1195
02:08:15,455 --> 02:08:20,165
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1196
02:08:20,815 --> 02:08:22,533
He's lost.

1197
02:08:23,655 --> 02:08:25,168
Think of yourself.

1198
02:08:26,535 --> 02:08:29,254
What's your answer, Vincent?

1199
02:08:30,615 --> 02:08:33,209
Enjoy the opera.

1200
02:08:34,495 --> 02:08:37,009
It's all taken care of.

1201
02:08:41,535 --> 02:08:44,333
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1202
02:08:47,935 --> 02:08:52,053
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower."

1203
02:08:52,215 --> 02:08:54,171
"Love, Douglas."

1204
02:08:54,335 --> 02:08:57,805
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

1205
02:08:58,655 --> 02:09:02,091
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1206
02:09:05,815 --> 02:09:10,252
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1207
02:09:10,415 --> 02:09:12,053
You're the only one who remembered.

1208
02:09:12,455 --> 02:09:17,609
We've just got the word. The Pope has
ratified the immobiliare deal. We've won.

1209
02:09:17,775 --> 02:09:19,731
Congratulations.

1210
02:09:22,015 --> 02:09:24,210
Strange how things work.

1211
02:09:24,375 --> 02:09:29,165
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1212
02:09:29,335 --> 02:09:33,533
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1213
02:09:38,975 --> 02:09:43,093
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1214
02:09:53,375 --> 02:09:56,651
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1215
02:09:56,815 --> 02:09:59,170
Tootsie Rolls!

1216
02:09:59,335 --> 02:10:04,614
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1217
02:10:08,135 --> 02:10:11,252
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1218
02:10:12,775 --> 02:10:15,812
Hi. Where's your leather?

1219
02:10:19,295 --> 02:10:20,774
Stop it.

1220
02:10:26,455 --> 02:10:29,731
You're so thin. You eat it.

1221
02:10:45,655 --> 02:10:46,974
E buono.

1222
02:10:47,575 --> 02:10:49,850
Grazie!

1223
02:10:52,535 --> 02:10:56,608
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

1224
02:10:56,775 --> 02:10:59,687
It's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1225
02:11:01,255 --> 02:11:03,769
Don't hate your father.

1226
02:11:05,335 --> 02:11:09,044
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1227
02:11:10,975 --> 02:11:14,331
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1228
02:11:17,695 --> 02:11:21,688
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1229
02:11:22,215 --> 02:11:24,775
I'll always love you.

1230
02:11:36,535 --> 02:11:37,888
Love somebody else.

1231
02:15:10,255 --> 02:15:14,168
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1232
02:15:14,335 --> 02:15:17,247
I've already sent AI Neri to the Vatican.

1233
02:15:28,615 --> 02:15:31,288
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1234
02:15:32,895 --> 02:15:37,013
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1235
02:15:38,375 --> 02:15:40,286
Let him in.

1236
02:17:05,095 --> 02:17:06,767
Buona sera.

1237
02:20:19,775 --> 02:20:22,289
Good. You got him.

1238
02:21:11,695 --> 02:21:15,131
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1239
02:21:15,295 --> 02:21:19,846
Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1240
02:21:20,975 --> 02:21:25,287
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1241
02:21:26,175 --> 02:21:28,735
Don Lucchesi, my friend.

1242
02:21:28,895 --> 02:21:31,853
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1243
02:21:33,815 --> 02:21:37,091
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1244
02:21:38,655 --> 02:21:40,486
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1245
02:22:15,375 --> 02:22:18,606
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

1246
02:22:40,255 --> 02:22:43,053
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1247
02:23:38,895 --> 02:23:43,571
It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1248
02:23:43,735 --> 02:23:45,805
He'll have a heart attack?

1249
02:23:52,655 --> 02:23:57,649
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1250
02:24:00,375 --> 02:24:01,933
Let's go back.

1251
02:24:42,295 --> 02:24:44,650
Eminenza...

1252
02:24:52,295 --> 02:24:54,445
The Holy Father is dead!

1253
02:26:20,575 --> 02:26:21,894
Sleep.

1254
02:26:23,175 --> 02:26:25,484
Sleep, Godfather.

1255
02:27:32,335 --> 02:27:34,326
Speak...tell me.

1256
02:27:35,935 --> 02:27:41,453
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1257
02:27:43,455 --> 02:27:47,130
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1258
02:27:47,575 --> 02:27:51,488
And Michael Corleone's message?

1259
02:28:07,935 --> 02:28:13,771
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1260
02:28:17,535 --> 02:28:19,366
He's clean.

1261
02:28:36,615 --> 02:28:39,527
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1262
02:30:04,455 --> 02:30:07,606
- I like this outfit.
- I figured you would.

1263
02:30:07,775 --> 02:30:09,413
Say hello.

1264
02:30:30,615 --> 02:30:34,324
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1265
02:30:34,495 --> 02:30:38,329
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

1266
02:30:39,575 --> 02:30:41,293
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1267
02:30:41,455 --> 02:30:46,210
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1268
02:30:46,375 --> 02:30:48,843
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1269
02:30:49,015 --> 02:30:51,404
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1270
02:31:04,815 --> 02:31:07,773
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1271
02:31:17,375 --> 02:31:18,933
Dad...

1272
02:31:37,495 --> 02:31:40,851
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1273
02:31:49,775 --> 02:31:52,494
Move back, move back.

1274
02:31:52,935 --> 02:31:58,089
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1275
02:32:23,055 --> 02:32:25,046
Dad...

1276
02:32:40,455 --> 02:32:43,049
No! Mary!

1277
02:32:45,815 --> 02:32:47,134
God, no!
