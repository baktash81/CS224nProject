1
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,651
# Fly me to the moon

2
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,448
# Let me play among the stars

3
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,035
# Let me see what spring is like

4
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:39,080
# On Jupiter and Mars

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,708
# In other words

6
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,962
# Hold my hand

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,300
# In other words

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,762
# Baby, kiss me

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,808
# Fill my heart with song

10
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:03,563
# And let me sing forever more

11
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:07,275
# You are all I long for

12
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,196
# All I worship and adore

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,240
# In other words

14
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,203
# Please be true

15
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,749
# In other words

16
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,211
# I love you

17
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,416
# Fill my heart with song

18
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,878
# Let me sing forever more

19
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,757
# You are all I long for

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,137
# All I worship and adore

21
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,681
# In other words

22
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,435
- Easy!
- Excuse me!

23
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,857
# In other words

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,653
# In other words

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,616
# I love...

26
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,120
Good morning. Jackson Steinem.

27
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,038
# You

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,582
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

29
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,126
Doing any better would be a sin.

30
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,630
Morning.

31
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,515
Morning, Dan. What's looking good today?

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,227
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business.
Get out while you're young.

33
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,606
I came here one day, I sat down,
and look at me now.

34
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,733
Look at you now.

35
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,820
Morning, Brian.

36
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,699
- Chuckie! How's the woman slayer?
- Looking for an 18-year-old wife.

37
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,744
- How you doing, pal?
- Well, if I had your looks, better.

38
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,498
Takes years of genetics,
a Yale education and the right tailor.

39
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,042
Not that you learned anything, Chunk.

40
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,173
Marv, I got a feeling that we
are gonna make a killing today.

41
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,883
Yeah? Where's your machine gun?

42
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,968
You can't make a buck in this market.

43
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:43,098
The country's going to hell faster
than when Roosevelt was in charge.

44
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,351
Too much cheap money
sloshing around the world.

45
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,397
Worst mistake we ever made was
letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,774
Putney Drug - you boys
might wanna look at it.

47
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,362
- No. They'll take five years to come around.
- But they got a good new drug.

48
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,449
Stick to the fundamentals.
That's how IBM and Hilton were built.

49
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,536
Good things sometimes take time.

50
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:09,165
Look sharp, especially you rookies.
Nikkei Index closed up 90 points last night.

51
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,918
We expect heavy Japanese buying
on the opening.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,007
The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
A million Big Blue. 350,000 pork and beans.

53
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:22,137
Get on the horn with your institutions.
These utilities are our top priority today.

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,516
- OK. Let's go to work.
- And they're off and running!

55
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:48,121
We cleared up to 60,000 XGC at 48 1/2.
Yes, that's right. Right.

56
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,004
- The market just doubled.
- Brenner!

57
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,132
Research has put thrifts
on the recommended.

58
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,968
What? Dump it for chrissake!

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,639
30,000. Three-eight top.
I go along at 23. You got it.

60
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,809
Now you own it!
Conwest Air? Let me check it.

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,151
Circle 29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

62
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:24,199
Mr Harrison, are you aware that we are
in the biggest bull market of our generation?

63
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,203
No, sir, it's not what you think.
If you take five minutes of your time...

64
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,164
Dreyfus is looking for 50,000 Conair!

65
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,833
September 50s? How about Decembers?

66
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,586
Mr Zaros? Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

67
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,088
Yes, sir, I am aware of that.

68
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,509
But if I could have five minutes
to explain the opportunities emerging

69
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,594
in the international debt market.

70
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,553
No, no...

71
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,472
Bud Fox, Jackson Steinem.

72
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:53,478
Yes, I am aware ofthis. But if I could just
explain the opportunities emerging

73
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,481
in the international debt market...

74
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,650
I'm sure that...

75
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:10,578
Yesterday concerns my future.
I need the info now, before the close.

76
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,707
No, in ten minutes it's history!
At four I'm a dinosaur!

77
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,212
Howard, I thought you were a gentleman.
Sure it's gone down. You got the tip. I didn't.

78
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,257
- Why would I tell you to sell it?
- Give it back!

79
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,010
To who? I can't give it back - you own it!

80
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,720
No, he's not here.

81
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,140
- That's what you told us to say.
- Gimme that phone.

82
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,225
- Hello?
- Hello.

83
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,895
- Who am I talking to?
- The sales manager. What's the problem?

84
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,567
What? Will you gimme a break? How was
I supposed to know you were in surgery?

85
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,111
What am I - Marvin the Mindreader?!

86
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:48,116
Uh, no, sir. I'll discuss that with the
account executive, and I'll get back to you.

87
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,493
No, no, sir. You're welcome.

88
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,459
I'm closing the account.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

89
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,045
Mr Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying.

90
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,422
We give you a rich man's account,

91
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,092
and you tell me he's gonna DK you
for a lousy quarter point?

92
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,555
You're being unfair, sir.
You know he's got a history for bullshit.

93
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,183
Somebody's got to pay.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,560
Ain't gonna be me.

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,149
Buddy, Buddy.
A little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

96
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,945
Howard the jerk reneged on me. I gotta
cover his losses to the tune of seven grand.

97
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,489
Yeah! I'm holding!

98
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,117
I'm tapped out. American Express
got a hit man looking for me.

99
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,121
It coulda been worse, right?
Coulda been my money.

100
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,211
Here, here, rookie, let me help you out.
I got... a C-note.

101
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,591
- Thanks, Marv. I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, I am still here!

102
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,638
You know what my dream is?
To one day be on the other end of that phone.

103
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,974
Oh, you got it, baby.
Where the real cheesecake is.

104
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,603
Hey, Bud, you forgetting something?

105
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,814
The Gekko phone call?

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:06,111
When are you gonna realize it's the big game
hunters who bag elephants, not guys like us.

107
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,488
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Gekko's beautiful.

108
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,367
30 seconds after the Challenger blew up,
he's selling NASA stock short.

109
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,538
Yeah, but... 47 million he made
on the Melcore deal.

110
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,541
23 on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

111
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:24,754
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

112
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,298
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

113
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,592
- Hello, Natalie. Guess who?
- Mr Fox.

114
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:36,141
Right. Every day I say to myself that today
could be the day. So will you marry me?

115
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,936
- I'll think about it.
- Then can you get me through to Mr Gekko?

116
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,982
- He's very busy.
- Of course he is. Five minutes is all I ask.

117
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:49,738
Mr Fox, I'm sure you're a good broker,
but our traders deal with the brokers.

118
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,157
Mr Gekko deals with investment bankers.

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,494
- Tell him I called. There are big changes...
- Yes, I'll give him your message.

120
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:02,208
Leo, I understand, but you have to realize
there'll be major subordinated debt involved.

121
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,435
- Buddy, how ya doing?
- Great, Charlie. Any better would be a sin.

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:25,523
Jesus Christ! Listen, I hear all you guys
on Wall Street are millionaires.

123
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,652
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You need an account to win the lottery.

124
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:34,115
- Give me 50 grand. I'll get you a condo.
- Sure! We'll own the airline by then!

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,745
Why don't he make himself rich,
so he can pay off his school loans?

126
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,999
Nice to see you're in such a good mood, Dad.
Did Mom give you fish for dinner?

127
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,544
You smoke too much. How often you
gotta go to the hospital to realize?

128
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,257
Leave me alone. It's the only thing that
makes me feel good. There, Frank. All set.

129
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,011
Spaghetti!
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

130
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,516
- It's pasta now. Spaghetti's out of date.
- So am I. You want a beer?

131
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,769
Billie! Bring a Molson Lite for the kid!

132
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,356
- Looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

133
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,442
Carl, we'll be at the bar.

134
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,238
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right, Charlie.

135
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,950
So...

136
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,746
You look like you've grown another inch,
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

137
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,834
- You're gonna get bags under your eyes.
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

138
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,921
- Some jerk DK'd me. I gotta cover his loss.
- Speak English.

139
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,508
DK: Didn't Know who I was
when the options he bought took a bath.

140
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:37,137
- Bastard reneged on me.
- I told you not to get into that racket.

141
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,514
You coulda been a doctor or a lawyer.

142
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:45,520
If you'd stayed at Bluestar, you coulda been a
supervisor now, instead of being a salesman.

143
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:49,983
Dad, how many times I gotta tell you I am not
a salesman? I'm an account executive.

144
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,569
Soon I'm moving into investment banking.

145
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,864
You ask strangers for money -
you're a salesman.

146
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,200
Dad, it takes time.
You gotta build a client list.

147
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,163
I can make more money in one year
as a broker than in five at this airline.

148
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,373
Thank you, Billie.

149
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:10,170
I don't get it, kid. You borrow money to go
to NYU. First year out, you make 35 grand.

150
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,174
You made 50 grand last year, and can't
pay off your loans. Where does it go?!

151
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,719
Dad, 50K does not get you
to first base in the Big Apple.

152
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,929
I got 40% in taxes, 15 grand for rent.

153
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,768
I got school loans, car loans, food -
that's three bills a month. I need suits...

154
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:29,356
Come back home and live rent-free
instead of that roach-infected place.

155
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,151
$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!

156
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,030
I made $47,000 last year. That's before taxes.

157
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,575
That's Queens, Dad! A 5% mortgage
and you rent the top room.

158
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:46,081
I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player.
There is no nobility in poverty anymore, Dad.

159
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,833
One day you'll be proud of me. You'll see.

160
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,755
It's yourself you gotta
be proud of, Huckleberry.

161
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,882
How much you need?

162
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,220
Can you spare 300?
I'll pay you back next month, I promise.

163
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,973
- I don't know if I got that much on me.
- Not in here. Please.

164
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,229
It adds up. 300 here, 200 there.
Your brother...

165
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,442
I always say money's something you need
in case you don't die tomorrow. Right, Carl?

166
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,403
How you doing?

167
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,073
- How's work treating you?
- Damn mandatory drug test.

168
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:25,036
They're driving us crazy. I got flagged for my
blood pressure pills. Can you believe that?

169
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,749
The good news is we had a meeting with
the controller about some union business.

170
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,253
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?

171
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:39,009
The FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing
error in the door-latch mechanism. I knew it.

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:44,055
I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance.
It's the greedy manufacturers in Cincinnati.

173
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,600
- That's great.
- This gets us out from under suspension.

174
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:53,231
We can go for those new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston. We'll compete with the big guys.

175
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:58,278
To Bluestar. As your broker, all I can
advise is you hold on to that stock.

176
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,905
What stock? Are you kiddin'?

177
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,451
- Are you sure about this thing?
- What?

178
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,121
- The FAA announcement.
- Sure I'm sure.

179
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:14,919
Look at me. You got that
mischievous look in your eye, Buddy.

180
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,131
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

181
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,051
It's true. Just like that.

182
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,677
Morning, Gordon.

183
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,398
Delivery for Mr Gekko. It's a personal item.
He needs you to sign for it.

184
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,191
Send him in.

185
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:36,626
Hello, Natalie. Recognize the voice? Here's
a hint - you're thinking about marrying me.

186
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,629
- Why are you here?
- You're lovelier than I pictured.

187
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:44,175
- Got a birthday present for Mr Gekko.
- You can't come barging in here.

188
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:49,055
- What makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the bible, see?

189
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,307
You better go buy him a gift.

190
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:57,063
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.
Cuban cigars. His favorite and tough to get.

191
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,067
Please, Natalie?

192
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,905
Stay here. I'll see what I can do.

193
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,426
Wait outside.

194
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,139
Yeah, I'll see you shortly, I hope.

195
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,945
Five minutes.

196
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,954
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

197
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,665
This is one of 'em.

198
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,087
What the hell's going on?

199
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,841
I'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.
I wanna know if we're part of it.

200
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,970
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come
and eat your lunch for you. Back in two.

201
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:15,517
Sorry, Jeff. Look, I loved it at 40.
It's an insult at 50.

202
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,270
Their analysts don't know
preferred stock from livestock.

203
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:24,359
Wait till it heads south, then we raise the
sperm count on the deal. Get back at ya.

204
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:31,157
This is the kid. Calls me 59 days in a row.
Wants to be a player.

205
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,285
Oughta be in the dictionary
under "persistence."

206
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:38,790
Listen, Jerry, I'm looking for negative control.
No more than 30, 35%.

207
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:44,504
Just enough to block anybody else's merger
plans, and find out if the books are cooked.

208
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,299
If it looks as good as on paper,
we're in the kill zone, pal.

209
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,345
Lunch? You kiddin'? Lunch is for wimps.
OK, Billy. I'll talk at ya.

210
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,810
How do you do, Mr Gekko? I'm Bud Fox.

211
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,188
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

212
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,901
- Where'd you get these?
- I got a connection at the airport.

213
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,572
So what's on your mind, kemo sabe?
Why am I listening to you?

214
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,534
I gotta monitor my blood pressure,
so don't upset me.

215
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,119
No. No, sir.

216
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:21,374
In 45 seconds, the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

217
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,004
Got an LCD read-out, cost-effective...
Less than one visit to a doctor.

218
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:34,220
I just wanna let you know I've read all about
you at NYU Business. I think you're a genius.

219
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:39,225
I've always dreamed of one thing and
that's to do business with a man like you.

220
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,561
- What firm you with?
- Jackson Steinem.

221
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,439
They're going places.
Good junk-bond department.

222
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,442
You the financing on
that Jansen investment?

223
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,862
Yeah. I'm working on
some other interesting stuff.

224
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,490
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

225
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,284
Are you twelfth man on the deal team?
Last to know?

226
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,789
- I can't tell you that, Mr Gekko.
- So what you got for me, sport?

227
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,583
Chart breakout on
Whitewood-Young Industries.

228
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:08,380
Explosive earnings. A 30% discount from
book. Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.

229
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,298
- It's a dog.
- Strong management.

230
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:15,095
It's a dog, pal. What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

231
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,306
Mr Stevenson in San Francisco.

232
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,229
- He respond?
- Lecturing on economics.

233
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,439
- What?!
- No, he's in Chicago.

234
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:31,319
Why the hell is Cromwell giving a lecture
tour when he's losing 60 million a quarter?!

235
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,030
Guess he's giving lectures
in how to lose money.

236
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:39,327
If this guy owned a funeral parlor,
no one would die! This turkey is braindead!

237
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:44,040
OK. All right, Christmas is over,
and business is business.

238
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,085
You keep on buying. Dilute the son of a bitch!

239
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,964
Ollie, I want every orifice
in his fuckin' body flowin' red!

240
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,299
He's flowin', Gordo. Piece of cake.

241
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,760
This guy's the best trader on the street.

242
00:18:55,844 --> 00:19:00,765
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper. Bring it in here, please.

243
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,977
- Mr Gekko, your wife.
- What else you got?

244
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:10,275
Terafly. Analysts don't like it. I do.
The break-up value is twice the market price.

245
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,445
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions...

246
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,906
Not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

247
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,452
Come on, pal.
Tell me something I don't know.

248
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,746
It's my birthday.

249
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,914
Surprise me.

250
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,670
- Bluestar.
- What?

251
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,091
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

252
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:40,347
It's a comer. 80 medium-bodyjets. 300 pilots.

253
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,976
Flies to Florida, Canada,
Northeast, Caribbean.

254
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,855
- Great slots in major cities.
- I don't like airlines. Lousy unions.

255
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,067
Well, there was a crash last year.

256
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,028
They just got a favorable
ruling on a lawsuit.

257
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,947
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

258
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,950
Well, how do you know about it?

259
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,495
I just know.

260
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,998
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and routes.

261
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,127
There's only a small float. You should grab it.
Good for a five-point pop.

262
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,838
250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Jansen.

263
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,425
I can pull twice that at 18 1/2
from the California pensions.

264
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,762
We got close to half a million
shares in the bag.

265
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,391
The Terminator!
Blow 'em away, Ollie!

266
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,728
We got the Beezer Brothers.
I'm working on the Silverberg boys.

267
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:33,400
Rip their fuckin' throats out!
Stuff 'em in your garbage compactor!

268
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,568
Interesting. Got a card?

269
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,238
Home number's on the back.

270
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,200
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred
deals a day. I choose one.

271
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:45,829
- I hope to hear from you, sir.
- Thanks for the cigars.

272
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,040
Let's go, guys. Looks like
we're going over 5% in Teldar.

273
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,085
Start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D.

274
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,046
We buy everything in sight,
but we don't pay over 22.

275
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,175
They'll fight. They got Myers
and Thromberg doing their legal.

276
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,263
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr Fox.

277
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:08,351
Mr Gekko, your conference call is ready. Mr
Sugarman in Delaware, Mr Bernard in LA,

278
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,396
Mr Jackson and Ms Rosco
in London. They're all on.

279
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,025
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm in a bind down here.

280
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:20,613
We got all these damn new computers and
young men that are edging me out here.

281
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,617
Hey, Bud! Did he see you?

282
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,287
Yeah, he saw right through me.

283
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,957
Cheer up. You shook Gekko's hand
and you still got all your fingers.

284
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,461
Besides, he's not the only
elephant in the jungle.

285
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,173
Holy cow! Did you get something
from him? Teldar Paper, huh?

286
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,925
Nah. It's a dog with fleas.

287
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,848
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours, hm?

288
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,643
If I were you, and I thank
my personal God I am not,

289
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,396
I wouldn't be sitting around chinwagging.

290
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,068
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip-code pile to cold-call.

291
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:06,826
Buddy, I got tickets for the Knick game
tonight. Cruise some chicks afterwards.

292
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,994
Whaddaya say?

293
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,122
- No, I gotta read my charts.
- Forget charts, will ya?

294
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:14,000
We're not fund managers.
Churn 'em and burn 'em!

295
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:16,544
I am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

296
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:21,049
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

297
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,844
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

298
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:30,850
Yeah, nice guy, but he's a loser. He lost all
his equity when the firm went belly-up in '71.

299
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,937
You wanna be in your sixties still pitching?

300
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:38,525
Hey, Buddy, whatever happened to
that cute analyst at Thudder and Wicks?

301
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,570
Cindy. Having sex with her
was like reading the Wall Street Journal.

302
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,906
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

303
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,909
I gotta get to work. Zs today.

304
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,371
Call for you, Buddy! Pick up two!

305
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,043
- Bud Fox.
- All right, Bud Fox.

306
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,714
I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar

307
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:05,719
at fifteen and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

308
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,972
And don't screw it up, sport.

309
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:14,269
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir! Thank you. You won't regret this.

310
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,814
Marv! I just bagged the elephant!

311
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,401
Gekko?

312
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,605
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr Gekko.

313
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,275
Try the steak tartare. It's off the menu.
Louis'll make it for you.

314
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,405
- Of course, sir. Anything to drink?
- Just an Evian, please.

315
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:12,035
Hey, see this? Can you believe it?
It's got a two-inch screen.

316
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,454
I can hardly see it.

317
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,583
It's for my kid - Rudy.
Three years old, he's an electronics freak.

318
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,586
We're going into a new age, pal.

319
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,464
So how's business today?

320
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:29,219
Great. Bluestar was at 17 1/4
when I left the office. Up from 15.

321
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,388
Might spin up to 18 by the bell.

322
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:35,058
Teldar's shooting up.
Did you buy any for yourself?

323
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:39,896
I bet you were on the phone two minutes
after you got out of my office.

324
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:43,316
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

325
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,987
Sure. Relax, pal.
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

326
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:53,243
Is that legal? Why don't you
put that in my account?

327
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:56,871
- Hey, Gordon!
- Georgie! The cellular king! How you been?

328
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,250
- Monique, nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

329
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,170
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very well yourself.

330
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,339
And Mr Davis...

331
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:10,635
Can I get the check here, please?
For chrissakes!

332
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:16,016
Cover that Bluestar buy. Put 200 thou on one
of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

333
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:21,229
Pick the dog with the least fleas.
Use a stop-loss, so your downside's 100 thou.

334
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:26,026
And buy a decent suit.
You can't come in here looking like this.

335
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,319
Go to Morty Sills. Tell him I sent you.

336
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:33,241
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr Gekko. Thank you
for the chance. You will not regret this.

337
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,035
You're with a winner.

338
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,037
Right... right...

339
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,709
Put the rest of the money in a tax-free fund.
I wanna see how you do before I invest it.

340
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:45,545
And save the cheap salesman talk.
It's obvious.

341
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,214
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

342
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,345
I don't like losses, sport.
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

343
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,723
Now you do good... you get perks.

344
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,476
Lots and lots of perks.

345
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,521
- Louis, take care of my friend.
- Thank you, sir.

346
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:05,690
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

347
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,527
Hi, Richard.

348
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,017
Hi, Bud.

349
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,352
Hi.

350
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,605
I'm Lisa. A friend of Gordon's.

351
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:50,777
Lisa? Gordon? Oh, oh, Mr Gekko. Sure.

352
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,614
Uh, would you like to come in?

353
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,783
Didn't he tell you?

354
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,744
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

355
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:04,165
Why don't you get dressed? We're going out.

356
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,751
We are?

357
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:27,188
So... where are we going?

358
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,357
Wherever you like.

359
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,695
Lutece. 21. The River Cafe.

360
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,948
Or maybe we could just...

361
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,285
drive around for a while.

362
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,664
Work up an appetite.

363
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,919
Want some?

364
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,011
Gordon tells me that
you're a very talented broker.

365
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,931
What do you like?

366
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,934
Like? Well...

367
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:08,938
I've got this guy who tells me
to buy Hewlett-Packard,

368
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,524
but I've been burned on tips.

369
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:16,654
Uh... Hewlett.
Now, let's see. It closed at 41 1/4.

370
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,824
Up an eighth. Very attractive.

371
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,703
About, uh... average yield.

372
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,164
Very attractive.

373
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,750
Rising profits.

374
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,835
Strong balance sheet.

375
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,837
You're hot on this stock.

376
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,632
Uh... It's ready to take off.

377
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,968
I'd jump all over it if I were you.

378
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,391
- Good morning, Carolyn.
- Morning. You look happy.

379
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,561
- Any better and I'd be guilty.
- You were never innocent, sugar pie.

380
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,356
How do you know? You wish!

381
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:12,479
Goddamn! We sure went down
the toilet on that ugly bitch!

382
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:18,485
Oh, Buddy! Mr Gekko's office is looking
for you. Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six.

383
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,582
Come on, sport. You gotta try harder.

384
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,127
I need some exercise, for chrissakes.

385
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:42,467
- I don't think I can go on, Mr Gekko.
- Push yourself. Finish out the game.

386
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,137
It's a very nice club, Mr Gekko.

387
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,972
Yeah.

388
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,558
Not bad for a City College boy.

389
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:56,815
Bought my way in. Now all these Ivy League
schmucks are sucking my kneecaps.

390
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,111
I just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

391
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,738
It cost me a mil.

392
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,534
That's the thing you gotta
remember about WASPs.

393
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,787
They love animals,
but they can't stand people.

394
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,291
Uh, Mr Gekko,

395
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,336
we took a little loss today.

396
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:23,008
We got stopped out on Terafly.
About a hundred grand.

397
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:32,892
Well, I guess your dad's not a union
representative of that company, huh?

398
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,562
How do you know about my father?

399
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:39,983
The most valuable commodity
I know of is information.

400
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,736
Wouldn't you agree?

401
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,113
Yeah.

402
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:54,372
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

403
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,754
I don't throw darts at a board.
I bet on sure things.

404
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,758
Read Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

405
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:09,054
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."

406
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,890
Think about it.

407
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:14,476
You're not as smart as I thought you were.

408
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:18,688
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

409
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:22,150
Cos they're sheep.
And sheep get slaughtered.

410
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:27,072
I've been in this business since '69.

411
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,784
Most of these Harvard MBA types
don't add up to dogshit.

412
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:35,413
You need guys that are poor,
smart and hungry. And no feelings.

413
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:39,834
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

414
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:45,131
And if you need a friend, get a dog.
It's trench warfare out there, pal.

415
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:47,300
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey, Gordon.

416
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:51,471
- How's Larchmont treating you?
- Fine. How's the Praxar deal going?

417
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,307
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole!

418
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,019
And inside here, too.

419
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:04,067
I got 20 other brokers analyzing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.

420
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,320
See you around, Buddy.

421
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:12,867
I am not just another broker, Mr Gekko.
If you give me another chance, I'll prove it.

422
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,871
I'll go the extra yard for you.
Just one more chance, Mr Gekko. Please!

423
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:23,128
Want another chance? Then stop sending me
information, and start getting me some.

424
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,881
Get dressed. I'll show you my charts.

425
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:34,639
- You know the name?
- Larry Wildman, one of the first raiders.

426
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:39,853
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits, thinks
he was born with a better pot to piss in.

427
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,689
Bribed an old secretary of mine
to open her mouth.

428
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:46,192
Stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

429
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,361
Wildman, the "White Knight."

430
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:51,865
I remember that deal.
You were involved, Mr Gekko?

431
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,950
Payback time, sport.

432
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:59,539
See that building? I bought that building
ten years ago. My first real-estate deal.

433
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:03,793
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

434
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,380
It was better than sex.

435
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:12,802
At the time I thought that was all the money
in the world. Now it's a day's pay.

436
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,973
Anyway, I had a mole in Wildman's operation.

437
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:21,436
- He gave me half the picture, then got fired.
- I don't think I follow you.

438
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,815
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

439
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,443
Something big is going down, OK?

440
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:34,199
I wanna know where he goes, what he sees.
I want you, pal, to fill out the missing picture.

441
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,789
Mr Gekko, it's not exactly what I do.
I could lose my license.

442
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:46,878
If the SEC found out, I could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

443
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:51,383
Like when a father tells his son
about a court ruling on an airline?

444
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:55,720
Or someone overhears I'm buying Teldar,
and decides he's gonna buy some?

445
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:00,767
Or the chairman of the board of XYZ
decides it's time to blow out XYZ?

446
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,894
Is that what you mean?

447
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:10,610
Unless your father's on the board
of directors of another company,

448
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:14,823
you and I are gonna have a very
tough time doing business together.

449
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:18,201
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

450
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:22,539
Bet you stayed up analyzing that stock
you gave me. Where'd it get you?

451
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:27,711
My father worked like an elephant till
he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack.

452
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,921
Wake up, will ya, pal?

453
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,299
If you're not inside, you are outside, OK?

454
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,012
I'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year Wall Street stiff,

455
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:41,725
flying first class and being comfortable.
I'm talking about liquid.

456
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,728
Rich enough to have your own jet.

457
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:47,731
Rich enough not to waste time.

458
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,734
Fifty, a hundred million dollars, Buddy.

459
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,778
A player,

460
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,947
or nothing.

461
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,952
Now you had what it took
to get into my office.

462
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:04,998
The real question is whether
you got what it takes to stay.

463
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,378
Look at that.

464
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:15,175
You're gonna tell me the difference
between this guy and that guy is luck?

465
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,595
Mohammed, pull over.

466
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:22,724
If you don't mind, I'm gonna
drop you off here. I'm late.

467
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,769
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, OK?

468
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,543
All right, Mr Gekko.

469
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,880
You got me.

470
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:57,110
Excuse me, please.

471
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,862
Excuse me.

472
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,254
I'm sorry, sir. Do you have a reservation?

473
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:20,508
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a week.

474
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,302
All right. Don't touch.

475
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,998
Everything ready, sir.

476
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:11,643
Excuse me! Is Mr Wildman
on board that plane?

477
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:15,730
Shit! My boss is gonna kill me!
I'm supposed to give him this.

478
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:19,109
- You know where that plane is going?
- Erie, Pennsylvania.

479
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,277
Thank you.

480
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:27,951
After spending the morning at Kahn
Seidelman in the junk-bond department,

481
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:33,206
he had lunch at that restaurant, Le Circus,
with some well-dressed bean counters.

482
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:37,961
He later stopped off at Morgan. I'd say
from all the smiling and palm-pressing

483
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,797
Larry got himself some
nice fat financing, GG.

484
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:45,468
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.
Roll the dice and play Monopoly.

485
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,972
What box is Sir Larry gonna
land on in Erie, Pennsylvania?

486
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:54,394
Jesus Christ! He's buying Anacott Steel.

487
00:39:54,477 --> 00:40:01,151
OK. When the market opens tomorrow,
I want you to buy 1500 July 50 calls.

488
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:03,570
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

489
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:08,575
And start buying 1,000-share blocks
and take it up to $50.

490
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:13,038
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

491
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:18,293
Then I want you to call
the Wall Street Chronicle, extension 1605.

492
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:23,631
You tell the man
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel."

493
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:26,217
- You got that?
- The Wall Street Chronicle.

494
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:30,722
Congratulations, Buddy.
You scored. I'll talk at ya.

495
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,853
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

496
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,439
Use the offshore accounts.

497
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,650
And keep it quiet.

498
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,120
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46. Let me know
how the options are opening, OK?

499
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:55,914
Thank you.

500
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,628
Jackson Steinem!

501
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:08,301
- How is Anacott Steel?
- 5 3/4, 6. 2,000 up.

502
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,096
- Six at 10,000.
- I'll sell you 2,000.

503
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:14,099
That's not what I said. I said 20,000 shares.

504
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,318
Anacott trades at six.

505
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:29,197
- 8,000 at a quarter?
- I'll take 8,000.

506
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,574
Make it six to a half, 2,000 up.

507
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:35,995
I know what time it is,
and this is what I'm saying.

508
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:42,210
We have important financial news, Mr Erlich,
that just happens to concern your future.

509
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:48,174
- You could benefit... What's going on?
- Anacott Steel. Put your best customers in it.

510
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,847
Lou, I got a sure thing.

511
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,182
Anacott Steel.

512
00:41:56,224 --> 00:42:01,896
No such thing, except death and taxes. Not
a good company anymore. No fundamentals.

513
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,941
What's goin' on, Bud?

514
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:09,029
You know something?

515
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:13,199
Remember, there are no shortcuts, son.

516
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:17,037
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market.

517
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,123
The steady players make it
through the bear markets.

518
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,208
You're a part of something here, Bud.

519
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:27,130
The money you make for people creates
science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.

520
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:31,843
You're right, but you gotta get to the
big time first, then you can do good things.

521
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:37,057
- You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.
- Lou, trust me. It's a winner. Buy it.

522
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:42,479
We'll kamikaze over to Nell's,
chase some cotton underwear.

523
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:46,900
I know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's gorgeous. Hold on.

524
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:52,572
- Play tennis Saturday?
- Can't. Fly-fishing in Canada. Real big client.

525
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:55,450
- Take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

526
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,411
You're sharking your way up.

527
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,748
No, no, my dear, you've got to diversify.

528
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,751
I got a sure thing. Anacott Steel.

529
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:07,587
I've just heard the most lovely two words.

530
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,925
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

531
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:13,426
Anacott Steel.

532
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:32,278
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.
Check the ARBs.

533
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,242
Looks like it's being accumulated.

534
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:42,455
Lou? Anacott. I buy. Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

535
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:45,333
Quarters won't matter.
Keep taking Anacott.

536
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,169
This is special. Anacott. Paint the tape.

537
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:50,463
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

538
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:53,466
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- It's on automatic pilot to the moon.

539
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,761
- If it hits 75, we'll clean 24 mil.
- Relax, pal.

540
00:43:57,178 --> 00:44:00,974
Don't get emotional about stock.
It clouds the judgment.

541
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:06,271
Which closed at 5 1/8, up 5 1/8  from
yesterday's close on heavy trading.

542
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,496
Can I help you?

543
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:26,708
Yes, I'm Bud Fox. I have some
papers for Mr Gekko to sign.

544
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,294
- Come in.
- Thank you.

545
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:35,175
- I'm sorry about this, Mr Gekko.
- It's all right. It's OK.

546
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,678
You wanna wait here?

547
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,013
Problems?

548
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,682
No problem.
This is Bud Fox. My wife, Kate.

549
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:46,061
- Hello. You came out from the city?
- Yes, ma'am.

550
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,314
Ah, long drive. You want a drink?

551
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:51,608
Yeah, you want a drink? Um... sure.

552
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:54,527
- If you'd rather not.
- No, come on. Have a drink.

553
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:58,615
Get to meet all the people.
It's a good idea.

554
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,328
We got Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston. This is Bud Fox.

555
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,456
His illustrious wife, Muffie.

556
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,127
Candice Rogers, Dick Brady.
Darien Taylor. All old friends.

557
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:12,462
Hi.

558
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:23,014
Great idea, Gordon. I know good help is hard
to find, but can it create a dry vodka martini?

559
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:25,725
It doesn't talk back or steal the silverware.

560
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,354
And Dick here is gonna get me
an exemption, aren't you?

561
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:35,235
I'm in St Kitts with this new
Kamali leopard-skin V-cut bikini,

562
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:40,073
which is gonna turn back the clock on my
marriage five years. Know what I mean?

563
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:43,993
Call for you, sir. Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

564
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,745
Thank you, Nyung.

565
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:50,166
Would you fix Mr Livingston another
martini? Stick around. This could be fun.

566
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:55,255
It's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

567
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,215
How ghastly! Sue her.

568
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:00,719
- Larry, what a surprise!
- I want to see you, Gordon.

569
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,304
Can it wait till tomorrow? I got people here.

570
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:08,727
- No, this can't wait. It's important.
- OK. If you feel that way, come on over.

571
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:13,773
Ah! There you are!
Can I steal him for a minute?

572
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,484
- Of course.
- I want your opinion.

573
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,536
So what do you see in this?

574
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,169
Purity. Innocence.

575
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:39,132
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes, if you ask me.

576
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:41,134
Really?

577
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:44,512
You can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye.

578
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:48,600
We paid over 400,000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last June.

579
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:51,978
Jesus, you could've had
a whole beach house for that!

580
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,398
Sure you could. In Wildwood, New Jersey.

581
00:46:57,025 --> 00:47:00,570
If you sold this one, you could
have a nice penthouse on Fifth.

582
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,741
You wouldn't have much
left over for decoration.

583
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:07,035
It's nice, if you're on mushrooms.

584
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,956
I thought Gordon was a tough businessman.
He sure has taken a bath on that.

585
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:17,962
A bath? I'd say Gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around.

586
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,675
He has a great eye, and he only buys the best.

587
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:27,180
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokhara. It's the finest of its kind.

588
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:31,226
After he bought it, a dealer
representing the Saudi royal family

589
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:35,814
offered him twice what he paid.
It absolutely makes the room.

590
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:40,568
See how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions?

591
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:44,823
Although it's a sacrilege
having that Etruscan vase on the table.

592
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:47,367
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

593
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:51,454
- I guess you're a decorator?
- You got it.

594
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,249
A great spender of other people's money.

595
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:57,836
If you're that good, I'm sure you
can do wonders with my place.

596
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,880
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

597
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:06,052
Really? Home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant?

598
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:11,725
It's just a rental. I'll be moving to the East
Side soon. Some deals brewing with Gordon.

599
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,853
But that's just conversation.
What about real things?

600
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:20,483
Like dinner? The two of us... next Friday?
Cafe Santo Domingo.

601
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,695
What if I have a previous engagement?

602
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:25,947
You break it.

603
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:30,243
There you go again, Darien.
Talking with strange men.

604
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:34,831
Hello. Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam is in banking.

605
00:48:34,914 --> 00:48:38,460
- Works for Gordon.
- Nice meeting you.

606
00:48:38,543 --> 00:48:42,047
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, I have work to do.

607
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,257
Ah. The bell.

608
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,762
Excuse me.

609
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:53,058
Call me next week. I'll give you an estimate.

610
00:48:56,936 --> 00:49:00,607
- Larry, how have you been?
- Fine. Traveling, actually.

611
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,942
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

612
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:06,488
Larry! Excuse me. Sir Larry.

613
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:10,950
How are ya? Goddamn, you look great!

614
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:14,287
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk.

615
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:18,333
- I'll be heading back now, Mr Gekko.
- Stick around.

616
00:49:18,416 --> 00:49:21,336
This is one of my gang. Bud Fox.

617
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:25,256
Shall we go upstairs?

618
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,716
Yeah.

619
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,938
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry.

620
00:49:40,021 --> 00:49:42,357
A .45 Luger.

621
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:45,443
Only six of 'em were ever manufactured.

622
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:48,863
Congratulations.

623
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:52,826
Rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.

624
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:58,456
My interest is the same as yours. Money.
Thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

625
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,503
No, this time I'm in for the long term. It's
not a liquidation. I'm gonna turn it around.

626
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:06,756
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

627
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:11,886
With the dollars you're costing me to buy
back stock, I could modernize the plant.

628
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,889
I'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

629
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:19,310
We're talking about lives and jobs.
Four generations of steelworkers...

630
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:25,692
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you got
CNX Electronics, you laid off 6,000 workers.

631
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:29,320
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.
That airline you bought, um...

632
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:33,366
I could break you, mate.
In two pieces over my knees.

633
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:35,994
You know it. I know it.

634
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:38,830
I could buy you six times over.

635
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:41,624
I could dump the stock just to burn your arse!

636
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,838
But I happen to want the company,
and I want your block of shares.

637
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:51,134
I'm announcing
a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

638
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,095
I'm expecting your commitment.

639
00:50:55,638 --> 00:51:00,602
Showdowns bore me, Larry. Nobody wins.
You can have the company.

640
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:05,982
In fact, it'll be fun watching you and your
giant ego trying to make a horse race of it.

641
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,819
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

642
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:13,156
The break-up value is higher. It's worth 80.

643
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:18,328
Well, we don't want to be greedy.
So what do you say to 72?

644
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:24,042
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer.
Nothing more,

645
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,419
Gekko.

646
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:32,634
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal, you'd send her COD.

647
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:36,763
My mail is the same color as yours is, pal.

648
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:40,684
Or at least it was until the Queen
started calling you "Sir."

649
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:44,562
Excuse me before I lose my temper.

650
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,272
71?

651
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,700
Considering you brought my mother into it,

652
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,451
71.50.

653
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,166
Done.

654
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,837
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8am. Good night.

655
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:19,097
He's right, I had to sell.
The key to the game is capital reserves.

656
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,977
If you don't have enough, you can't piss
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

657
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,272
"All warfare is based on deception." Sun Tzu.

658
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,984
"If your enemy is superior, evade him."

659
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:33,486
"If angry, irritate him."

660
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:38,992
"If equally matched, fight.
And if not, split. Reevaluate."

661
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,619
He's learning, huh? Buddy's learning!

662
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:56,843
- Yeah?
- Money never sleeps, pal.

663
00:52:57,135 --> 00:53:00,638
Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.

664
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:06,186
Play with it. You done good,
but you gotta keep doing good.

665
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:09,522
I showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

666
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,734
Mr Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

667
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:17,447
No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I wanna be surprised.

668
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,995
Astonish me, pal. New info.
I don't care where or how you get it.

669
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:26,581
Just get it.

670
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,795
My wife tells me you made a move on Darien.

671
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:34,964
Here's some inside info for you.

672
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:38,426
That GQ type she's going out with
got big bucks,

673
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,096
but he's putting her feet to sleep.

674
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,890
Exit visas are imminent.

675
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:47,102
I don't want you losing your place in line.

676
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,980
Ah, Jesus!

677
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:53,566
I wish you could see this.

678
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,778
The light's coming up.

679
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:04,452
I've never seen a painting that
captures the beauty of the ocean

680
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:06,830
at a moment like this.

681
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,251
I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.

682
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:16,297
Yeah. Rich enough
that you can afforda girl like Darien.

683
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:19,050
This is your wake-up call, pal.

684
00:54:20,218 --> 00:54:22,262
Go to work.

685
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:40,238
- Fox!
- Mr Barnes.

686
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:46,244
Buddy D, is this deja vu?
What's it been? A year, year and a half?

687
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,955
So, I hear you're moving up in the world.

688
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,293
A senior associate. Not bad. Not bad.
How's Margie?

689
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:56,796
I can't complain.
I got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

690
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,132
Market treating you good?

691
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:04,137
- Still seeing that sexy French chick?
- No. No. She asked the wrong question.

692
00:55:04,262 --> 00:55:07,307
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

693
00:55:10,518 --> 00:55:14,898
The hours are hell, but the cash
is starting to tumble in.

694
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:19,778
I know this guy who has an ironclad way
of making money. I can't lose or get hurt.

695
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:24,616
Can't get hurt. So does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

696
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:28,620
Maybe. Check out Teldar Paper,

697
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,955
but don't quote me.

698
00:55:31,956 --> 00:55:37,754
And you? I hear you're handling the Fairchild
Foods merger, and it may not go through.

699
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:41,508
Any surprises I haven't read about
in the Wall Street Journal?

700
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:45,303
Come on, that's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred.

701
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:49,766
Who's listening?
Just one college buddy talking to another.

702
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:54,521
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, relax, Roger.

703
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:56,898
Everybody's doing it now.

704
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:01,069
But, if you don't know,
then... you don't know.

705
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:09,035
And if I did...

706
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,371
what's in it for moi?

707
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:15,583
More money than you ever dreamed of.

708
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,586
Nobody gets hurt.

709
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,340
You think about it.

710
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:29,139
- Let's grab a beer. What do you say?
- Uh... too much to do. But I'll walk you out.

711
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,184
The file's on the desk, Marie.

712
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:37,063
Get inside my uncle's door
and the secrets of the world are yours.

713
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:38,898
Lifeblood of companies...

714
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:42,819
Of course, you gotta go
to law school first, but...

715
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:02,756
Mr Panos, I've been charting
the growth of office space.

716
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,717
You're in the right business
at the right time.

717
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,927
Thank you for tell me what I already know.

718
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:11,931
Look, I'm very impressed with your work,
and I could use a tax break.

719
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:15,935
Let me ask, what would you say to
some working capital and a partner?

720
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,937
Why do I need a partner?

721
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:22,442
Look, you need more vans. 42 employees
can't cover the buildings you got,

722
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:25,153
not to mention the clients
we'd have together.

723
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:29,949
I am an expert at identifying undervalued
assets such as this business.

724
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,835
The good news, Gordon,
is Rorker Electronics.

725
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:25,088
That's right. I see it happening
in the next two months.

726
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,924
Come on, their quarterlies are for shit.

727
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,719
I got a little gift for you.

728
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:35,515
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

729
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:42,147
You know Marty Weidman?

730
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:46,026
He netted 650G off of that merger.
26 years old, the guy's Rambo.

731
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,236
- He's an asshole!
- He is Rambo!

732
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,322
He's got a Porsche Turbo
Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

733
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:56,202
I think if I can make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30 and get out of this racket,

734
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:59,539
I'll be able to ride
my motorcycle across China.

735
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:04,336
I'd like to do for furniture what
Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics.

736
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:07,714
Produce a line of high-quality
antiques at a low price.

737
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,924
Sounds great. I'll take you public.

738
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,885
You will?

739
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:38,328
Can I help you?

740
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,123
Oh. Excuse me. Is this Bill Bates' office?

741
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,500
No.

742
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,543
I'm sorry.

743
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,098
Hiya, Dad.

744
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:01,768
- What brings you out here?
- Client's got a private jet at Butler.

745
01:00:01,893 --> 01:00:04,479
- Hey, Buddy. How ya doing?
- Mr Wall Street!

746
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:06,731
The bozos that keep us in the air!

747
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:09,317
- Give us a hand.
- Do an honest day's work.

748
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,779
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tires and park it out back.

749
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,948
This kid wanna buy the plane?

750
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:18,952
- You always light up when you see me.
- Don't start, all right?

751
01:00:18,993 --> 01:00:20,704
All right.

752
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,997
So who peed in your Cheerios?

753
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,959
Goddamn fare wars are killing us.

754
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:29,254
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

755
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,256
I'm sorry about that.

756
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:35,301
- So how much you need?
- I don't need anything. I'm doing great.

757
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,638
New client, new ball game.
Things are starting to happen.

758
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:41,558
Sure. Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

759
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:46,479
How do you know you'll have any dough
next month? Jesus Christ, what is this?

760
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,440
It's a dividend.

761
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:51,484
I've borrowed at least five grand
over the years.

762
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,988
Oh, stop it.
Put this towards your school loan.

763
01:00:55,071 --> 01:00:59,951
Forget the loans. Look, Dad, things
are good and it's gonna stay that way.

764
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,871
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do I need a suit for?

765
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:06,249
I don't hobnob with the jet set.
I just fix their planes.

766
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:11,588
Then get a decent bowling jacket, so you
don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

767
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:14,049
Come on, what's money for? Enjoy yourself.

768
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,344
Money is a pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

769
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:20,055
- How about dinner?
- Sure. Any night this week.

770
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,515
OK. No, I'm sorry. This week's booked.

771
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:26,895
- I'll check with my girl. I'll get back to you.
- You do that, Huckleberry.

772
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,689
I gotta run. You stop smoking, you hear?

773
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:31,608
I'll talk at ya.

774
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:50,335
It's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

775
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,879
- You understand that, Mr Fox?
- Sure.

776
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:57,676
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr Gekko's account.

777
01:01:57,717 --> 01:02:01,638
Every ticket you buy must be
marked "power of attorney."

778
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:03,973
That means that you call the shots.

779
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:08,687
Mr Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks you're buying. All right?

780
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,481
Just sign it at the end, twice.

781
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,860
I never knew how poor I was
until I started making money.

782
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:18,863
Your transactions will be
monitored by StockWatch.

783
01:02:19,322 --> 01:02:22,701
If any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

784
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:25,078
The trail stops with you, understand?

785
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:29,124
Spread the buy orders over
different accounts, you won't get burnt.

786
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:32,585
I have friends that won't
mind making easy money.

787
01:02:33,378 --> 01:02:37,924
Rudy Gazoodi! How's my cutie? Viens ici!

788
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:42,178
We need more votes for the
showdown, but don't wanna go public...

789
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:45,557
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.
- Bonjour, Monsieur Buddy.

790
01:02:45,598 --> 01:02:48,935
Oh! He speaks French already.

791
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,730
Kid had the highest score in his IQ test.

792
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:55,567
It is so difficult to get into
a good nursery school now.

793
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:01,322
They even go to your home
to make sure you're acceptable.

794
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,075
That's it for you with the grownups.

795
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,537
Nicole, would you take him for a nap now?

796
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,999
Give him a bath and put that
cute little black suit on him.

797
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:14,210
This is a contact at one of our offshore banks.

798
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:17,964
On settlement day you'll open
an account for Mr Gekko

799
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:20,633
under the name Geneva Roth Holding Corp.

800
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:25,764
Then you'll wire-transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman Islands.

801
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:28,433
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

802
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:32,312
The stakes are going up. No mistakes.

803
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,732
Piece of cake, Gordon.

804
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,458
If I could have anything,

805
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:56,002
this would almost do.

806
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,546
Almost.

807
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,384
How'd your conference go with Gordon?

808
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:07,430
It went fine. We reached an agreement,
and decided to split up the world between us.

809
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:12,644
You have modest wants.
I like that in a man.

810
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:16,189
- What do you want?
- Let's see.

811
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:20,652
A Turner. A perfect canary diamond.

812
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,612
World peace.

813
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:24,572
The best of everything.

814
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:26,491
Well, why stop at that?

815
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,243
I don't.

816
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:48,513
My client wants to buy a large block
of Teldar. He needs to spread it around.

817
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:52,058
I'll park some money in your account.
If it hits, you get a big cut.

818
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:56,062
I'm telling you, this is the easiest
money you've ever made.

819
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:58,523
All right, Bud.

820
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,734
Let's do it.

821
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:03,194
We go way back, Harry.

822
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:07,657
You know, I've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years.

823
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:11,161
- I brought in a lot of business.
- You've taken enough out, too.

824
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:16,624
- You should have something put aside.
- With the divorces I haven't had a chance.

825
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:21,171
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me I'm finished. On the street.

826
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:24,632
- How do you think I feel about this?
- How do you think I feel?

827
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:27,594
I've got responsibilities. I've got two kids...

828
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:29,721
What's going on?

829
01:05:29,846 --> 01:05:33,600
Lynch is giving him the boot.
Not pulling his quota.

830
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,562
We're all one trade away from humility.

831
01:05:37,687 --> 01:05:42,275
New report on GManda conference call
in defense stock in my office, 7am tomorrow.

832
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,028
No RSVP required. Just be there.

833
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:49,824
Now, on a more inspiring note,
the new office record

834
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:54,913
for a single month's gross commission
from the wealthy individual accounts

835
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:58,917
goes to Bud Fox.
Shows cold calling does work, fellas.

836
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,961
Way to go, Bud. Super job. Come on up here.

837
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:06,800
Bud, congrats. You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

838
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:16,685
You're on a roll, kid. Enjoy it
while it lasts, cos it never does.

839
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,479
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

840
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,621
Come along with me, Bud.

841
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,795
This is yours now, Bud.

842
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:46,423
Credenza. Tree. Windows.

843
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:50,760
And, significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

844
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,555
- Nice to meet you, Mr Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

845
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:58,601
Well, I don't really know what to say.
Thank you, Mr Lynch.

846
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,353
No, I thank you, Bud.

847
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:04,566
The minute I laid my eyes on you
I knew that you had what it takes.

848
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:07,694
Now you can focus on the big-ticket retail.

849
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:11,573
Oh, this is very nice. This is very nice.

850
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:14,993
So what is it? Mr Cocksucker now?

851
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:20,707
Everybody hates the Upper East Side.
They wanna live on the West Side.

852
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:25,211
But when it's resale time
the East Side moves all the time.

853
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:28,882
What have you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna?! Trust me.

854
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:33,970
Massage, sauna, Jacuzzi... tanning salon.

855
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:38,141
Best schools in the city.

856
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:42,937
A cute young boy like you gotta think
of a future lady friend in your life

857
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:45,607
when you've finished wolfing around.

858
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,776
Course, I'm taken.

859
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:49,944
Oak strip floors.

860
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,238
My husband can get you a 10% mortgage.

861
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:56,242
I would do it myself, except
I'm into four other deals right now.

862
01:07:56,785 --> 01:08:02,248
So, I got a four o'clock and a five. One's an
all-cash type. Monique something or other.

863
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:07,837
Look, maybe you'd like to see something
cheaper that I got on First Avenue?

864
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:11,466
Honey, the meter's running. Anybody home?

865
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:15,762
All right. Offer 950.

866
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,393
I got something over on Sutton Place.

867
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:25,146
It's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

868
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,773
No.

869
01:08:26,981 --> 01:08:29,693
This is it. This is home.

870
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,599
That's enough gold over there.

871
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:24,998
Like it?

872
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:32,255
I'm having House & Garden come up next
week to photograph it before it gets lived in.

873
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,298
Do you mind?

874
01:09:34,674 --> 01:09:37,635
Hey! Jerry! Come at me. Whaddaya got?

875
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:40,263
No, no. 37 1/2.

876
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:45,268
Convert the bonds and check the price
in Tokyo at eight o'clock your time. Right.

877
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:10,335
I'm spilling everything.

878
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:43,702
Isn't it perfect?

879
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,496
It's too perfect.

880
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,790
Let's not even eat.

881
01:10:48,915 --> 01:10:51,710
Let's just watch it... think about it.

882
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,426
Who am I?

883
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:53,605
Bud, come to bed.

884
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,612
One million six. Seven.

885
01:12:00,653 --> 01:12:04,991
On my left now.
Against you, 1,800,000.

886
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,828
1,900,000. New bidder this side.
$2m here now.

887
01:12:08,995 --> 01:12:12,665
Not yours. At $2,100,000. $2,100,000.

888
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:16,169
Fair warning, then.
Selling for $2,100,000. All done.

889
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:18,672
For you, sir. $2,100,000.

890
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:22,258
Whaddaya say we get a suite at the Carlyle?

891
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:26,221
Champagne, caviar...?
Celebrate just like old times?

892
01:12:26,304 --> 01:12:29,182
Come on, Gordon. Those days are over.

893
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:32,227
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

894
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:35,647
You're as beautiful as
that painting I just bought.

895
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:41,486
Sunshine, what's wrong?
I think you got a bad case of puppy love.

896
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,030
I think I'm falling for Bud.

897
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:48,201
Don't fall too far. He hasn't been
around the block yet. You have.

898
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:53,498
- Told him about us?
- No! Are you crazy?

899
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:57,877
- I don't want him to ever know, understand?
- Mum is the word.

900
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:02,173
You and I are the same, Darien.

901
01:13:02,257 --> 01:13:06,886
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running - love.

902
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:12,017
Fiction created by people to keep
them from jumping out of windows.

903
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,980
You know, sometimes I miss you, Gordon.
You're really twisted.

904
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:21,693
For chrissake, Jack, it's easy!

905
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:25,905
On settlement day you endorse a check
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company.

906
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:28,074
Then I'll send you your cut.

907
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:32,704
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

908
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:35,373
What the fuck is wrong with you?

909
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:39,919
It's so bad, even the liars are complaining.
But not you. You're making big money.

910
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:42,213
- What's the bottom line?
- Hey, look!

911
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:46,426
I am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you!

912
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:51,514
- Will you do your own homework, Marv?
- What an asshole, man!

913
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:54,142
That's a shame.

914
01:13:56,936 --> 01:14:02,108
Yeah, Frank. Work 500,000 shares Teldar
with a limit of 26. New account.

915
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:04,319
Don't fuck it up.

916
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:08,073
- How's Teldar doing?
- Back again?

917
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:12,077
- I've got a real appetite.
- Bring it five to a half. 2,000 up.

918
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:16,247
- I gotta buy stock. What's offered at a half?
- What are we looking at?

919
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:18,792
- Make me an offer on 80.
- 80,000 at a half.

920
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,543
I'll take it.

921
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:50,365
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko.

922
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:55,787
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt,
like some piss-poor South American country.

923
01:14:56,037 --> 01:15:01,626
I strongly recommend you to see through
Mr Gekko's shameless intention here

924
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:06,506
to strip this company,
and severely penalize the stockholders.

925
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:09,718
I strongly recommend you
to reject his tender

926
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:15,140
by voting for management's
restructuring of the stock.

927
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:27,986
Well, I appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr Cromwell,

928
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:32,157
as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper, to speak.

929
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:40,540
We are not here to indulge in fantasy,
but in political and economic reality.

930
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:47,005
America... America
has become a second-rate power.

931
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:53,970
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions.

932
01:15:55,221 --> 01:15:59,601
In the days of the free market, when
our country was a top industrial power,

933
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:03,104
there was accountability to the stockholder.

934
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:09,319
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men
that built this great empire, made sure of it

935
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:11,988
because it was their money at stake.

936
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:16,242
Today, management
has no stake in the company!

937
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,707
All together, these men sitting up here
own less than 3% of the company.

938
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:26,711
And where does Mr Cromwell
put his $1,000,000 salary?

939
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:30,548
Not in Teldar stock. He owns less than 1%.

940
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:34,719
You own the company.
That's right, you, the stockholder.

941
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:39,182
And you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats,

942
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:45,271
with their steak lunches, their fishing trips,
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

943
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,899
This is an outrage! You're out of line, Gekko!

944
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:53,947
Teldar Paper, Mr Cromwell,
has 33 different vice presidents,

945
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:58,410
each earning over $200,000 a year.

946
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:05,291
Now, I have spent the last two months
analyzing what all these guys do.

947
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,628
And I still can't figure it out.

948
01:17:08,753 --> 01:17:14,718
One thing I do know is that
our paper company lost $110m last year.

949
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:20,557
And I'll bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents!

950
01:17:22,642 --> 01:17:26,187
The new law of evolution
in corporate America

951
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:30,233
seems to be... survival of the unfit test.

952
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:35,739
Well, in my book you either do it right,
or you get eliminated.

953
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:43,371
In the last seven deals that I have been
involved with there were 2.5m stockholders

954
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:47,959
who have made a pretax profit of $12 billion.

955
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,420
Thank you.

956
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:55,842
I am not a destroyer of companies.

957
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:58,386
I am a liberator of them!

958
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:07,062
The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
that greed, for lack of a better word,

959
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,022
is good.

960
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:12,359
Greed is right. Greed works.

961
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:20,075
Greed clarifies, cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

962
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,248
Greed, in all of its forms - greed for life,
for money, for love, knowledge -

963
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:30,126
has marked the upward surge of mankind.

964
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:36,841
And greed, you mark my words,
will not only save Teldar Paper,

965
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:41,054
but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the USA.

966
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:43,473
Thank you very much.

967
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:53,608
# Fly me to the moon

968
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:58,446
# Let me play among the stars

969
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,241
Buy me 20 June Eurodollar CDs,

970
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:06,329
20 March gold and sell 10 September
Deutsch marks. Right. Talk at ya, babe.

971
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:13,336
Ah, Buddy, Buddy, I hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius!

972
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:16,172
Darien! Lightning has struck.

973
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:19,759
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

974
01:19:19,884 --> 01:19:23,096
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein.
They're all watching me.

975
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,306
Ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

976
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:29,561
You've gotta go to work soon. I'm getting
psychotic from a lack of REM sleep.

977
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:32,063
I'm not gonna broker the rest of my life.

978
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:37,318
I am gonna be a giant, an entrepreneur
in the Italian 16th-century sense of the word.

979
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:41,322
A mover, a shaker.
I'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

980
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:43,992
You're coming along for the ride.

981
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,372
Bluestar is an unpolished gem, Gordon.

982
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:53,752
A half-assed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win.

983
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:57,088
But the gates at LaGuardia alone
can bail us out.

984
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:01,343
If it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks
a share. They're ripe to fall.

985
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,345
Mixed emotions, Buddy.

986
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:08,433
Like Larry Wildman going off
a cliff... in my new Maserati!

987
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:13,563
Guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines!

988
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:18,401
- Fuel could go up. Unions are killers.
- Yeah, but aren't you forgetting one thing?

989
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:23,740
Capital reserves. This company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension.

990
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:26,034
That buys us a lot of credibility.

991
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,496
And the beauty is, you already
own close to 2% of this sucker.

992
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:34,459
The insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks. What do you want to do?

993
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:38,380
Tell those assholes
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

994
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:42,801
I can't believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes.

995
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:50,225
Gordon, what I want,
and I've never asked you for anything,

996
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:53,019
is to be your copilot on this one.

997
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:58,775
I wanna take this airline, turn it around and
make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune.

998
01:21:01,444 --> 01:21:06,866
I got a stockbroker who wants an airline. It'll
take two years to turn Teldar Paper around.

999
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:11,204
What do I need a dink airline for? I'm up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.

1000
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:15,750
I've worked at Bluestar. I know my way
around. I have friends there, inside.

1001
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,461
What do you mean?

1002
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:23,049
The three unions.
It's 43% of BIuestar's operating budget.

1003
01:21:23,174 --> 01:21:28,304
The hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour. That's the real hidden value, GG.

1004
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:32,767
If you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to 350, 400 an hour,

1005
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:36,021
this airline'll be the hottest thing
since Texas Air.

1006
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:40,900
- What makes you think you can?
- I can talk to these people. They trust me.

1007
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:43,903
My father can be a big help in getting cuts.

1008
01:21:50,326 --> 01:21:54,664
All right. Susan, get Buckingham
on the phone. Tell him to look into it.

1009
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:58,001
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

1010
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,226
- Hi, Dad.
- Sorry I'm late.

1011
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,896
That's OK. Overdressed as usual.

1012
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:23,985
Come on in. Everybody's here.
I couldn't start the show without you.

1013
01:22:25,403 --> 01:22:27,572
Well, I'll be a lousy Republican!

1014
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:31,951
I decorate for Democrats, too.
Lots of them. I'm Darien Taylor.

1015
01:22:31,993 --> 01:22:34,954
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Don't believe a word.

1016
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:37,499
I never beat him or locked him in a closet.

1017
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:40,210
- I forgot about the closet.
- He turned out OK.

1018
01:22:40,293 --> 01:22:43,296
Bud's a born liar, otherwise he's a good kid.

1019
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,217
I hope you come here more often,
under less formal circumstances.

1020
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,843
Thank you.

1021
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:51,930
- Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore.
- Sure. How are ya?

1022
01:22:52,013 --> 01:22:55,600
Pilots' union.
Toni Carpenter, flight attendants'.

1023
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:57,769
I'd like you to meet Mr Gekko.

1024
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:00,021
Mr Fox, pleasure to meet you.

1025
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,315
His attorney, Mr Salt.

1026
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,860
I'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
Got a hell of a career in front of him.

1027
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:10,824
I'm glad you think so. I thought this was
informal. What's your attorney doing here?

1028
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:14,452
Harold, you don't mind walking
around the block, do you?

1029
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:17,080
- Of course.
- I'll take that.

1030
01:23:17,163 --> 01:23:18,873
No offense.

1031
01:23:18,998 --> 01:23:21,042
None taken.

1032
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:28,675
That's OK, Gordon. Bud does it all the time.

1033
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:35,974
Look, I got no illusions about winning
a popularity contest with any of you.

1034
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:38,601
I got roasted the other night.

1035
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:43,857
A friend asked "Why are we honoring this
man? Did we run out of human beings?"

1036
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:48,778
It's not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done.

1037
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,660
You've got losses of $20-30 million,
dividends cut to zero,

1038
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:58,705
and you're being squeezed
to death by the majors.

1039
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:04,711
The management may not be the worst scum,
but they put you on this kamikaze course,

1040
01:24:04,836 --> 01:24:09,382
and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes.

1041
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,010
Only there's not enough to go around.

1042
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:15,055
Management has them. You don't.

1043
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:20,518
If they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11,
which I think they will,

1044
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:26,274
they'll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions, and throw you off the property.

1045
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:31,363
Oh, come on! With all due respect, what's
to prevent you from doing the same thing?

1046
01:24:31,446 --> 01:24:33,740
Cos I got a way around all this,

1047
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:38,328
where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

1048
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:41,414
So what do you say we cut to the chase?

1049
01:24:42,707 --> 01:24:49,381
I'm asking for a modest 20% across-the-board
wage cut, and seven more hours a month.

1050
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:53,051
What kind of time frame?

1051
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:56,471
A year. If we're still losing money,
the reduction stands.

1052
01:24:56,554 --> 01:25:01,434
If we're in the black, I'll return part of the
givebacks, pay goes back to current levels,

1053
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:07,482
and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing program with stock.

1054
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:11,277
- You'll own part of the airline.
- Will you put it in writing?

1055
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:14,781
I'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days.

1056
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:19,119
What's your marketing strategy?
How will you return us to profitability?

1057
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,580
Why don't I give Buddy an opportunity
to answer that? Buddy?

1058
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,749
Thank you, Gordon.

1059
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:28,545
First, I want you all to know
that my door will always be open,

1060
01:25:28,628 --> 01:25:32,757
because I know from my dad
it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

1061
01:25:32,799 --> 01:25:36,678
What I've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan.

1062
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:41,307
One: we modernize. Our computer
software is dogshit. We update it.

1063
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:44,185
We squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown.

1064
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:48,023
Don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

1065
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:54,404
Effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 5-20%.

1066
01:25:54,487 --> 01:25:58,742
That translates to approximately
$50-200 million in revenues.

1067
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:02,245
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

1068
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:06,666
Two: advertising. More, and aggressive.
We attack the majors.

1069
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:11,171
Three: expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St Louis.

1070
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:14,341
And we reorganize all
of our feeder schedules.

1071
01:26:14,424 --> 01:26:18,261
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors.

1072
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,725
Well, cards on the table, guys.
What do you say?

1073
01:26:23,808 --> 01:26:28,355
Well, if you mean what you say,
I think we're probably in the ballpark.

1074
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:31,775
- I guess I can take it to my people.
- Good.

1075
01:26:31,858 --> 01:26:35,570
You've sketched broad strokes.
I'd like to see the fine print.

1076
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:37,781
But I like what I hear so far.

1077
01:26:42,702 --> 01:26:48,583
I guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything, and I do mean everything.

1078
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:52,337
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr Gekko?

1079
01:26:53,546 --> 01:26:59,636
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more,
but, if you have any suggestions, I'll listen.

1080
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:02,806
"There came into Egypt
a Pharaoh who did not know."

1081
01:27:02,889 --> 01:27:06,810
- I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
- No, a prophecy.

1082
01:27:06,893 --> 01:27:10,021
The rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began.

1083
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:14,192
The only difference is
the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

1084
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:16,736
I know what this guy's all about - greed.

1085
01:27:16,861 --> 01:27:21,825
He don't care about Bluestar or the unions.
He's in for the buck. He don't take prisoners.

1086
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,493
Wait a minute, Dad.

1087
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:27,580
Sure. What's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

1088
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:32,669
It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.
And if we do this deal, everybody gains.

1089
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:37,465
Course, my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers.

1090
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:40,885
With those qualifications,
he can run an airline!

1091
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:43,680
Fine. Stay with the present management

1092
01:27:43,763 --> 01:27:47,392
dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground.

1093
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:53,231
That "scum" built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing.

1094
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:59,112
If that's a scum, I'll take it over a rat any day.
You know where I stand. Good night, all.

1095
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:07,078
Excuse me.

1096
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:15,587
Congratulations, Dad. You did a great job
embarrassing me, not to mention yourself.

1097
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:19,632
Save the "workers unite" speech.
I heard it too much growing up.

1098
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:22,969
- Oh, yeah?
- You'll get axed. No two ways about it.

1099
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:26,598
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes.

1100
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:30,226
And if it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer.

1101
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:40,779
He's using you, kid. He's got your prick
in his pocket, but you're too blind to see it.

1102
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,406
No. I see a jealous old machinist

1103
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:47,369
who can't stand the fact that his son's
more successful than he is!

1104
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:53,041
What you see is a guy who never measured
a man's success by the size of his wallet!

1105
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:58,630
That's because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim!

1106
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:12,435
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
I must've done a really lousy job as a father.

1107
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:19,442
As far as being axed, I'm still around,

1108
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:23,154
and I have a responsibility
to the union membership I represent.

1109
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:27,283
Your responsibility is to present the facts,
not opinions, to your men.

1110
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:30,578
You'll destroy their lives.
Let them decide for themselves.

1111
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:35,041
My men will want to know what's
going on, and I won't lie to them.

1112
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:38,003
Oh, yeah, your men! Your fuckin' men!

1113
01:29:38,044 --> 01:29:41,381
All my life your men have
been able to count on you!

1114
01:29:41,423 --> 01:29:44,092
Why have you never been there for me?!

1115
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:46,845
What if you're wrong?

1116
01:29:46,886 --> 01:29:52,809
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the
east, and for once your compass was off?

1117
01:29:52,892 --> 01:29:56,438
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future? My future?

1118
01:29:56,521 --> 01:30:01,901
Dad, think for a change. Be practical.
I'm asking you. I'm fuckin' begging you.

1119
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,614
I don't go to sleep with no whore
and I don't wake up with no whore.

1120
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:10,493
That's how I live with myself.
I don't know how you do it.

1121
01:30:10,618 --> 01:30:15,665
I hope I'm wrong about this guy...
but I'll let the men decide for themselves.

1122
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:18,043
That much I promise you.

1123
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:48,323
You should look at this, Chief.
A guy at Jackson Steinem

1124
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:53,078
buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

1125
01:30:58,124 --> 01:31:00,293
So, what's the problema?

1126
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:03,505
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

1127
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:06,716
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

1128
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,637
I get a strange call from the SEC.
They asked to see my records.

1129
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,474
- This is heavy, Bud.
- Hey, hey, hey, relax! Relax, Roger.

1130
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:18,770
You're 82M in the account numbers
and I'm the invisible man.

1131
01:31:18,895 --> 01:31:21,189
Well, that's good for you, Bud.

1132
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:25,944
They're always looking for red flags.
Gekko's always getting checked by 'em.

1133
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:28,780
They never come up with anything, Rog.

1134
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:34,119
Hey... we're invulnerable on this one.

1135
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:37,706
I just wanna slow down, Bud.

1136
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:39,290
All right?

1137
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:44,504
No more lunches, no calls, all right?
We suspend our business, all right?

1138
01:31:44,587 --> 01:31:47,298
Whatever you want, Rog. It's cooI.

1139
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:51,136
Excuse me. Hey, Rog, can you come
back in? Bring the cost report.

1140
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:53,304
We're starting again.

1141
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:59,519
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

1142
01:31:59,602 --> 01:32:03,398
- You wanna come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

1143
01:32:03,523 --> 01:32:09,154
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

1144
01:32:19,122 --> 01:32:21,958
Guys, new chief of Bluestar - Bud Fox.

1145
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:23,918
- Hi.
- Hello, Bud.

1146
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:26,963
Guys, what's the problem? It's time to kill.

1147
01:32:27,839 --> 01:32:32,552
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.
Plus he's got the unions in his back pocket.

1148
01:32:32,677 --> 01:32:37,265
Everybody knows the stock's in play.
By next week the street will own Bluestar.

1149
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:39,434
Is the bank financing in place?

1150
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:44,397
Or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings?

1151
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:49,736
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure.

1152
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:53,615
Unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now,

1153
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:57,077
I'm gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75.

1154
01:32:57,702 --> 01:33:03,958
Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate
in a four-year revolving credit line.

1155
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:11,007
We must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months.

1156
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:17,013
The only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

1157
01:33:17,097 --> 01:33:20,975
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

1158
01:33:21,059 --> 01:33:23,186
Guarantee? No sweat!

1159
01:33:23,269 --> 01:33:27,107
We got the Bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are.

1160
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:31,194
We lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans,
who are dumb enough to buy 'em.

1161
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:35,323
And I got the Texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots.

1162
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:37,951
What's your problem? It's done!

1163
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:41,830
Here's the price tags
on the 737s, gates, hangars, routes.

1164
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:45,166
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

1165
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:48,294
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

1166
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:51,756
Gekko makes $75m there.

1167
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:56,553
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6,000 employees,

1168
01:33:56,636 --> 01:34:03,810
and he walks away with the rest.
I figure he'll make... He'll clear $60-70m.

1169
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:06,438
Not bad for a month's work.

1170
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:10,400
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

1171
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:15,780
And you'll have the shortest executive
career since that Pope that got poisoned.

1172
01:34:15,822 --> 01:34:20,160
Now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

1173
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:24,622
- He'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

1174
01:34:24,664 --> 01:34:27,083
Bud, you can't go in! He's in a meeting!

1175
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:30,670
Alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to...

1176
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:35,050
I didn't know we had a meeting today, sport.

1177
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:38,303
I didn't, either.
I think we should talk, Gordon.

1178
01:34:39,512 --> 01:34:44,517
- Would you excuse us for a second?
- Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

1179
01:34:44,642 --> 01:34:46,686
Thank you, Alex.

1180
01:34:48,855 --> 01:34:50,357
What do you want?

1181
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:53,568
I just found out about
the garage sale at Bluestar.

1182
01:34:53,693 --> 01:34:57,572
Why?

1183
01:34:57,655 --> 01:35:01,326
Last night I was reading Rudy
Winnie-the-Pooh and the HoneyPot.

1184
01:35:01,451 --> 01:35:07,290
You know what happened? He stuck his nose
in the pot once too often, and he got stuck.

1185
01:35:07,999 --> 01:35:10,377
Maybe you oughta read him Pinocchio.

1186
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:14,923
I thought you were gonna turn
Bluestar around, not upside down.

1187
01:35:15,006 --> 01:35:19,260
- You fuckin' used me.
- You're walking around blind without a cane.

1188
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:22,138
A fool and his money are lucky to even meet.

1189
01:35:22,222 --> 01:35:27,102
- Why do you need to wreck this company?
- Because it's wreckable, all right?!

1190
01:35:27,185 --> 01:35:30,063
I took another look. I changed my mind.

1191
01:35:30,146 --> 01:35:33,108
If they lose their jobs,
they got nowhere to go!

1192
01:35:33,191 --> 01:35:36,903
My father has worked there for 24 years!
I gave him my word!

1193
01:35:36,986 --> 01:35:39,531
It's all about bucks, kid.

1194
01:35:40,031 --> 01:35:42,534
The rest is conversation.

1195
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:44,911
Buddy, you'll still be president.

1196
01:35:44,994 --> 01:35:48,289
When the time comes,
you'll parachute out a rich man.

1197
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:52,419
With the money you'll make,
your dad's never got to work again.

1198
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:56,631
So tell me, Gordon,
when does it all end, huh?

1199
01:35:56,756 --> 01:36:00,135
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

1200
01:36:00,218 --> 01:36:03,763
It's not a question of enough, pal.
It's a zero-sum game.

1201
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:06,766
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

1202
01:36:06,808 --> 01:36:10,770
Money itself isn't lost or made,
it's simply transferred

1203
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:14,399
from one perception to another, like magic.

1204
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:19,320
This painting here.
I bought it ten years ago for $60,000.

1205
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:23,867
I could sell it today for six hundred.
The illusion has become real.

1206
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:28,246
And the more real it becomes,
the more desperate they want it.

1207
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:31,750
Capitalism at its finest.

1208
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,753
How much is enough, Gordon?

1209
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:43,636
The richest 1% of this country owns half
our country's wealth. Five trillion dollars.

1210
01:36:43,762 --> 01:36:47,766
One third comes from hard work,
two thirds from inheritance,

1211
01:36:47,807 --> 01:36:51,478
interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons,

1212
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:55,148
and what I do:
stock and real-estate speculation.

1213
01:36:55,815 --> 01:36:57,442
It's bullshit.

1214
01:36:57,567 --> 01:37:01,821
You got 90% of the American public
with little or no net worth.

1215
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:04,032
I create nothing.

1216
01:37:04,991 --> 01:37:07,077
I own.

1217
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:09,662
We make the rules, pal.

1218
01:37:09,788 --> 01:37:14,626
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval,
the price of a paper clip.

1219
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:19,714
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it.

1220
01:37:20,674 --> 01:37:25,595
You're not naive enough to think we're
living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

1221
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,516
It's the free market, and you're part of it.

1222
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:33,603
Yeah. You got that killer instinct.

1223
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:38,608
Stick around, pal.
I still got a lot to teach you.

1224
01:37:38,692 --> 01:37:40,527
Obviously.

1225
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:43,738
Oh, Buddy, come on.
I was gonna tell you about it.

1226
01:37:43,863 --> 01:37:47,325
Calm down, all right?
We'll have dinner tonight. Bring Darien.

1227
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:49,244
No, I can't make it tonight.

1228
01:37:49,327 --> 01:37:51,538
Hey, Buddy.

1229
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:54,165
Are you with me?

1230
01:37:54,874 --> 01:37:57,836
I need to know if you're with me.

1231
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:01,423
I'm with you, Gordon.

1232
01:38:05,343 --> 01:38:08,471
- Natalie, I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr Gekko.

1233
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:18,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Ollie.

1234
01:38:19,065 --> 01:38:22,527
Tell them I want ziplocked mouths
on the Bluestar deal,

1235
01:38:22,652 --> 01:38:26,197
or I'll come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

1236
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:10,825
Bud?

1237
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,205
What's going on?

1238
01:39:20,126 --> 01:39:24,839
I've been played like a grand piano
by the master, Gekko the Great.

1239
01:39:26,216 --> 01:39:28,718
Today was the big crash,

1240
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,930
the liquidation sale.

1241
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:36,851
He's gonna carve Bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off.

1242
01:39:36,976 --> 01:39:39,187
Bastard.

1243
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,356
I'm sorry.

1244
01:39:41,815 --> 01:39:44,776
I was afraid something
like this could happen.

1245
01:39:44,943 --> 01:39:48,446
I handed it to him on a silver platter.
I told my father...

1246
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:51,783
Bud... Bud, it's not your fault.

1247
01:39:51,866 --> 01:39:54,244
And it's not your decision.

1248
01:39:54,327 --> 01:39:57,288
I'm not gonna let it happen.

1249
01:39:57,372 --> 01:40:00,291
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.

1250
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:07,257
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar, someone else
will. Who's to say they won't do the same?

1251
01:40:07,882 --> 01:40:10,844
At least I won't be pulling the trigger.

1252
01:40:12,387 --> 01:40:17,976
Why are you doing this?
You've worked hard to get where you are.

1253
01:40:18,059 --> 01:40:21,771
We're so close.
You don't wanna throw it all away.

1254
01:40:22,397 --> 01:40:25,775
Look, I can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

1255
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:28,778
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

1256
01:40:36,536 --> 01:40:39,539
I'm not looking to just survive.

1257
01:40:39,622 --> 01:40:42,542
I've been doing that all my life.

1258
01:40:42,584 --> 01:40:45,545
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud!

1259
01:40:45,628 --> 01:40:48,590
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

1260
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:55,680
It means if you make an enemy of Gordon
Gekko, I can't be there to stand by you.

1261
01:40:57,015 --> 01:41:00,018
Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?

1262
01:41:01,227 --> 01:41:04,439
What did he promise you?
To take you public?

1263
01:41:05,732 --> 01:41:11,446
Without his money and seal of approval
I'm not such a hot investment anymore.

1264
01:41:11,571 --> 01:41:16,242
- You're just the best money can buy, Darien.
- You're not exactly pure, Bud.

1265
01:41:16,743 --> 01:41:20,789
You went after Gekko and me with
the same vengeance. Look in the mirror.

1266
01:41:20,872 --> 01:41:24,250
I'm looking, and I sure don't like what I see.

1267
01:41:26,252 --> 01:41:30,090
Fair enough. But it's not that simple, Bud.

1268
01:41:31,591 --> 01:41:35,178
When I was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

1269
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:41,226
He got me all my clients - you among them -
and he can take them away from me like that.

1270
01:41:42,268 --> 01:41:45,647
You may find out that when
you've had money and lost it,

1271
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,234
- it's worse than never having had it at all.
- Oh, yeah?

1272
01:41:49,275 --> 01:41:51,403
That is bullshit!

1273
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:59,786
You step out that door
and I am changing the locks!

1274
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:08,044
You may not believe this, Bud,
but I really do care for you.

1275
01:42:09,129 --> 01:42:12,048
We would've made a good team.

1276
01:42:12,132 --> 01:42:14,426
I'm sorry.

1277
01:42:14,968 --> 01:42:17,303
Get the fuck outta here.

1278
01:42:32,152 --> 01:42:36,114
The market is dead right now.
Even the rich are bitching.

1279
01:42:36,156 --> 01:42:40,493
The only thing moving is the termites
and cockroaches, and my commission...

1280
01:42:40,535 --> 01:42:44,581
Look, save the rap, all right?
Just sell the fucker, fast.

1281
01:42:52,505 --> 01:42:55,008
There he is.
Where you been the last two days?

1282
01:42:55,091 --> 01:43:00,263
- Janet, get my father on the phone and...
- Your mom's been calling. Your father's...

1283
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:03,516
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's OK.

1284
01:43:03,641 --> 01:43:06,644
- He's at St John's.
- Oh, Christ.

1285
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:15,111
Mom? How is he?

1286
01:43:15,862 --> 01:43:18,490
He was complaining
about chest pains at work.

1287
01:43:18,531 --> 01:43:22,243
The next thing I know he's collapsed.
You gotta talk to him.

1288
01:43:22,327 --> 01:43:26,039
Don't worry, he's a tough old nut.
He's got another 20 years.

1289
01:43:26,122 --> 01:43:29,084
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- Is he conscious?

1290
01:43:46,226 --> 01:43:48,353
Hiya, Dad.

1291
01:43:49,062 --> 01:43:52,065
You're looking younger every day.

1292
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:56,820
Didn't I tell you never
to lift a 747 by yourself?

1293
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,118
You even got me smoking now.

1294
01:44:06,538 --> 01:44:09,290
It's your second heart attack, Dad.

1295
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:13,253
You're pushing your luck.
I hope you know that.

1296
01:44:14,754 --> 01:44:17,007
I guess I never told you,

1297
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:19,843
but I love you, Dad.

1298
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:25,765
I love you so much!

1299
01:44:28,393 --> 01:44:31,521
I'm sorry... about the things I said.

1300
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:37,277
You're the only honest man I know.

1301
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,404
The best.

1302
01:44:41,197 --> 01:44:43,616
I got a plan, Dad. I can save the airline.

1303
01:44:43,783 --> 01:44:48,413
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, OK?

1304
01:44:49,247 --> 01:44:51,916
I need to speak to the union members.

1305
01:44:53,335 --> 01:44:55,211
Can I speak for you?

1306
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:59,341
Your words, not mine.

1307
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:04,429
OK.

1308
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:14,814
I gotta go.

1309
01:45:15,565 --> 01:45:18,068
I'm proud of you.

1310
01:45:27,202 --> 01:45:29,704
The stock's at 19 1/4, and it's going up.

1311
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:33,291
Gekko figures, by breaking up Bluestar,
it's 30 bucks a share.

1312
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:36,878
He'll buy up to 24 and still
think he's making money.

1313
01:45:37,003 --> 01:45:39,047
How do you know it'll go up?

1314
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:43,927
You don't wanna know, Duncan.
Let's just say I have some friends.

1315
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:47,013
OK. What happens now?

1316
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:50,016
When it hits 23, you go
to Gekko and lower the boom.

1317
01:45:50,058 --> 01:45:53,853
When he learns he has no union
concessions, he'll jump ship.

1318
01:45:53,895 --> 01:45:58,983
Yeah, but who'll buy then, and what's
to prevent some other shark devouring us?

1319
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:04,656
We have an appointment to see Mr Wildman.

1320
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:08,451
Sir Lawrence, or can I call you Larry?

1321
01:46:08,993 --> 01:46:13,581
What would you say to owning Bluestar
Airlines, with union concessions,

1322
01:46:13,665 --> 01:46:15,500
at $18 a share,

1323
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:20,130
and, in the process, hanging
Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist?

1324
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:23,383
I might be very interested. Why you, mate?

1325
01:46:23,925 --> 01:46:28,013
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

1326
01:46:28,096 --> 01:46:33,309
Let's just say that me and Mr Gekko
have a serious conflict of interest.

1327
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:36,938
But we all wanna see this airline work.

1328
01:46:37,063 --> 01:46:39,691
These figures show that it can.

1329
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:44,696
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

1330
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:49,242
We are, but we want a contract
agreement that's ironclad.

1331
01:46:49,284 --> 01:46:52,370
So if you buy it, you can't break it up.

1332
01:46:55,248 --> 01:46:57,334
I'm still listening.

1333
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:03,381
Hi.

1334
01:47:03,465 --> 01:47:07,177
Oh, hi. Say, why don't you
get the hell out of my office?

1335
01:47:07,385 --> 01:47:10,513
I know I've been a schmuck lately.
I want to apologize.

1336
01:47:10,764 --> 01:47:15,226
You've been a real schmuck lately.
So go thou and sin no more.

1337
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:17,395
I wanna make it up to you.

1338
01:47:19,272 --> 01:47:22,359
Bluestar. Put all your clients in it.

1339
01:47:27,989 --> 01:47:30,116
OK, Buddy-Buddy.

1340
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,370
We are back in business on Bluestar.

1341
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:41,753
Bluestar, Mr Mannheim.
Put all your clients in it. It's gonna move.

1342
01:47:41,836 --> 01:47:46,257
I don't know where you get
your information, son, but I don't like it.

1343
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:52,097
The main thing about money, Bud...
it makes you do things you don't wanna do.

1344
01:47:56,309 --> 01:48:02,482
Marty, a favor. 200,000 shares Bluestar at
19 1/2. Can you position it in an equity fund?

1345
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:05,694
- The Chronicle is on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

1346
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:11,157
Listen, Blue Horseshoe
loves Bluestar Airlines. Got it?

1347
01:48:11,241 --> 01:48:13,868
- Got it.
- Right. Marty, you still there?

1348
01:48:14,494 --> 01:48:17,330
Bluestar's in play. Let's check it out.

1349
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:29,801
- 19 1/4, 3/8. 5,000.
- 3/8 at 10,000.

1350
01:48:32,178 --> 01:48:34,514
I do love it so.

1351
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:38,977
Gordon, I see it at 21 5/8.
I don't know what to make of it.

1352
01:48:39,519 --> 01:48:44,357
The word is out, pal!
Your union buddies are talking.

1353
01:48:44,482 --> 01:48:47,652
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
All the way in.

1354
01:48:47,736 --> 01:48:52,157
You slash and burn, you buy everything
in sight up to 22, then call me.

1355
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:58,747
When I get hold of whoever leaked this, I'll
tear his eyes out and suck his fuckin' skull!

1356
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:09,758
- Stock's going to Pluto.
- Start unloading.

1357
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:12,719
- What? Sell?
- Dump it! Now! Dump it all!

1358
01:49:12,761 --> 01:49:15,347
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

1359
01:49:16,348 --> 01:49:18,850
Ken? Marvin. Jackson Steinem.

1360
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:22,354
Dump this baby. Take the money and run.
We're getting out.

1361
01:49:23,146 --> 01:49:24,773
It's gotta be a big hitter.

1362
01:49:25,065 --> 01:49:28,401
There's some people from Bluestar
demanding to see you.

1363
01:49:28,443 --> 01:49:31,738
- What the hell do they want?
- I'd be happy to tell you.

1364
01:49:31,821 --> 01:49:36,826
We know what you're up to, Gekko,
and you can go straight to hell!

1365
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:39,245
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

1366
01:49:39,371 --> 01:49:44,042
- If that's my plan, it's the first I've heard of it.
- Would you put that in writing?

1367
01:49:44,167 --> 01:49:47,962
We have an agreement,
which I expect you to honor.

1368
01:49:48,046 --> 01:49:53,176
- Then you better have a pilot's license.
- Don't worry, the engines won't fall out.

1369
01:49:53,259 --> 01:49:57,055
But those reservations can get screwed up
if we don't pay attention.

1370
01:49:57,138 --> 01:50:00,475
Baggage for St Petersburg
could wind up in Pittsburgh.

1371
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,561
Look, somebody else
wants to buy your airline.

1372
01:50:03,603 --> 01:50:08,024
You wanna be gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

1373
01:50:08,108 --> 01:50:10,527
We'll take our chances.

1374
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:13,071
Nice to see you, Gekko.

1375
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:20,954
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23.
What do you want him to do?

1376
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:25,083
Sell it all.

1377
01:50:26,251 --> 01:50:30,422
- What the hell. So we only make 10 million.
- Sell it. Yes, all of it.

1378
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:34,217
10,000 at 7/8!

1379
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:35,885
At 7/8, sold!

1380
01:50:36,845 --> 01:50:39,556
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, for chrissake!

1381
01:50:39,639 --> 01:50:41,266
Goddamn connection!

1382
01:50:41,391 --> 01:50:45,395
Bob, we're in big trouble on BST.
You gotta get out now.

1383
01:50:46,021 --> 01:50:47,147
Another 30,000. Out!

1384
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:50,900
Gekko's selling. There's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

1385
01:50:51,317 --> 01:50:55,071
I guess I'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

1386
01:50:56,823 --> 01:51:03,496
Don't make a big deal of it. Buy it lightly
on the way down. When it hits 18, buy it all.

1387
01:51:03,788 --> 01:51:05,457
Piece of cake, Larry.

1388
01:51:10,378 --> 01:51:12,464
8,000 at 18.

1389
01:51:13,923 --> 01:51:16,009
What is offered at 18?

1390
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:19,596
300,000... 300,000 at 18!

1391
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:21,389
18 for 500,000!

1392
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:22,349
Sold!

1393
01:51:25,518 --> 01:51:27,645
- I'll sell you 50!
- I'll take it!

1394
01:51:34,861 --> 01:51:38,531
- There's gotta be a way outta this.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

1395
01:51:38,656 --> 01:51:40,700
Fox is on four.

1396
01:51:40,825 --> 01:51:46,831
Where the hell are you? I am losing millions.
You sure as hell better get me out of this,

1397
01:51:46,873 --> 01:51:51,086
or the only job you'll have
on this street is sweeping it!

1398
01:51:51,961 --> 01:51:56,299
You once told me, don't get emotional
about stock, Gordon. Don't.

1399
01:51:56,383 --> 01:52:01,513
The bid is 16 1/2 and going down.
As your broker, I advise you to take it.

1400
01:52:01,638 --> 01:52:06,351
Yeah? Well, you take it! Right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

1401
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,731
It's two minutes to close, Gordon.
What do you wanna do? Decide.

1402
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:18,697
Dump it.

1403
01:52:24,411 --> 01:52:28,373
The big Wall Street story today
was Bluestar Airlines.

1404
01:52:28,915 --> 01:52:33,878
Fueled by takeover rumors, the stock
soared to an all-time high of 24 1/8.

1405
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:38,091
When rumors later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded,

1406
01:52:38,174 --> 01:52:45,098
buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 1/2 before closing at 17.

1407
01:52:45,473 --> 01:52:49,728
Then, amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.

1408
01:52:49,769 --> 01:52:55,400
Raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of Bluestar,

1409
01:52:55,483 --> 01:52:59,821
and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions.

1410
01:52:59,946 --> 01:53:03,199
We talked with a leading
stock market analyst,

1411
01:53:03,283 --> 01:53:06,494
in order to understand the ramifications...

1412
01:53:06,578 --> 01:53:07,787
Son of a bitch!

1413
01:53:18,965 --> 01:53:21,968
Smile, Carolyn. There's justice in the world.

1414
01:53:36,608 --> 01:53:38,693
Good morning, folks.

1415
01:53:51,414 --> 01:53:53,500
Did somebody die?

1416
01:53:54,959 --> 01:53:57,003
Yeah.

1417
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:04,678
Morning, Chuckie. Morning, Lou.

1418
01:54:04,761 --> 01:54:06,429
Bud...

1419
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:10,600
Bud, I like you.

1420
01:54:11,518 --> 01:54:13,603
Just remember something.

1421
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:21,861
Man looks in the abyss.

1422
01:54:21,986 --> 01:54:24,489
There's nothing staring back at him.

1423
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:27,826
At that moment, man finds his character.

1424
01:54:27,867 --> 01:54:31,371
And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.

1425
01:54:33,498 --> 01:54:35,583
I think I understand.

1426
01:54:46,678 --> 01:54:49,264
Janet, get my father, will you?

1427
01:54:51,975 --> 01:54:54,644
He just came in. I'll call you back.

1428
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:01,860
I guess you're not here to open an IRA.

1429
01:55:01,901 --> 01:55:07,824
Henry Patterson, Postal Inspection Service.
Mr Ebenhopper, US Attorney's office.

1430
01:55:07,907 --> 01:55:11,244
Evan Morrissey, Securities and
Exchange Enforcement office.

1431
01:55:11,327 --> 01:55:14,748
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to commit securities fraud,

1432
01:55:14,831 --> 01:55:18,293
and for violating
the Insider Traders Sanction Act.

1433
01:55:18,418 --> 01:55:21,880
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were no good.

1434
01:55:21,963 --> 01:55:25,717
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer questions.

1435
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:28,303
Anything you do say
may be used against you.

1436
01:55:28,428 --> 01:55:31,014
You have the right to consult an attorney

1437
01:55:31,097 --> 01:55:34,851
and to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

1438
01:56:03,254 --> 01:56:05,298
So long, Carolyn.

1439
01:56:18,228 --> 01:56:19,771
Hiya, Buddy.

1440
01:56:19,854 --> 01:56:21,564
Gordon.

1441
01:56:21,648 --> 01:56:24,234
Sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

1442
01:56:25,151 --> 01:56:30,573
I guess you think you taught the teacher
a lesson, that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

1443
01:56:33,785 --> 01:56:35,787
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

1444
01:56:35,912 --> 01:56:39,541
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

1445
01:56:42,794 --> 01:56:47,215
You think you could have gotten this far
this fast with anybody else?

1446
01:56:47,298 --> 01:56:49,300
And dickin' someone like Darien?

1447
01:56:49,342 --> 01:56:55,432
No. You'd be cold-calling widows and
dentists to buy fuckin' dogshit stock!

1448
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:57,308
I took you in.

1449
01:56:57,809 --> 01:56:59,477
A nobody!

1450
01:57:00,145 --> 01:57:02,105
I opened doors for you.

1451
01:57:02,188 --> 01:57:06,943
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1452
01:57:07,027 --> 01:57:10,113
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geodynamics.

1453
01:57:10,196 --> 01:57:12,907
And this is how you fuckin'
pay me back, you cockroach!

1454
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,537
I gave you Darien!

1455
01:57:18,079 --> 01:57:21,541
I gave you your manhood!
I gave you everything!

1456
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:36,514
You coulda been one of
the great ones, Buddy.

1457
01:57:38,141 --> 01:57:41,353
I look at you... and I see myself.

1458
01:57:43,563 --> 01:57:45,357
Why?

1459
01:57:46,775 --> 01:57:48,860
I don't know.

1460
01:57:50,487 --> 01:57:52,781
I guess I realized that...

1461
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:55,367
I'm just Bud Fox.

1462
01:57:57,243 --> 01:58:00,205
As much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko

1463
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:03,249
I'll always be Bud Fox.

1464
01:58:49,546 --> 01:58:53,633
I showed you how the system works,
the value of information, how to get it!

1465
01:58:53,717 --> 01:58:55,802
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources...

1466
01:58:59,264 --> 01:59:01,725
You did the right thing, Bud.

1467
01:59:09,315 --> 01:59:11,526
You told the truth
and gave the money back.

1468
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:15,655
All things considered in this
cockamamie world, you're shooting par.

1469
01:59:15,697 --> 01:59:19,284
You helped save the airline,
and they'll remember you for it.

1470
01:59:19,325 --> 01:59:23,663
That's right. Think about the job
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

1471
01:59:23,747 --> 01:59:26,249
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.

1472
01:59:26,499 --> 01:59:30,045
Yeah, well... maybe that's the price, son.

1473
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:32,255
It's gonna be hard on you,

1474
01:59:32,339 --> 01:59:37,344
but maybe in a kind of screwed-up way it's
the best thing that coulda happened to you.

1475
01:59:37,469 --> 01:59:41,181
Stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

1476
01:59:41,306 --> 01:59:45,393
Create, instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

1477
01:59:50,899 --> 01:59:53,360
We'll park the car and catch up with you.

1478
01:59:53,401 --> 01:59:55,111
All right.
