before Halloween,

312
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,225

313
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:51,144

314
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,855

315
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,525
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

316
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,403

317
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:03,323
Or was it more than a man?

318
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,742
He was watching them.

319
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:09,787
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

320
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,458
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

321
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,960
and a young boy
and a young girl,

322
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,297
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

323
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,635
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

324
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,181
My name is Tommy Doyle.

325
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,434
And I was that young boy.

326
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:35,188

342

Not this time.

351

succumb to fear.

from your house,

there was a rusty razor blade.

She's in recovery.

879

It's lucky she survived.

880
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:21,854
I just heard from
one of the police officers

881
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:23,272
at her compound.

882
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,400
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

884

Three of his friends
were killed.

885
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:31,072
- It's a madhouse.
- All right, Lonnie, listen.

886
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:33,157
The only way
we're gonna stop this

887
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,118
is if we all come together
on this.

888
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,369
You're goddamn right.

889

these people protection.

there's strength in numbers.

923
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:57,408
You cover Spring Creek

if you see anything.

Now, the only way to catch him

is to play by his own game...
the element of surprise.

932
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:18,137

you're going one place,

933
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:20,390
then you pop up someplace else.

934
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,392

Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

We've been trick-or-treating.

- You guys should not be

00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,460
He's just hiding behind trees.

969

"Peekaboo!"

three years old.

00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:07,130
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

1050
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:11,342
Karen.

1051
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,637
Karen.

1052
00:54:15,638 --> 00:54:17,807
Michael's gone.

1053
00:54:18,641 --> 00:54:20,310
We got him.

1054
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:22,103
That's right. We got him.

1055
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:25,898
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

1056
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,234
- (door opens)
- NURSE: Excuse us.

1057
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:30,486
Pardon.

1058
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,071
- Uh, over here.
- Frank?

1059
00:54:32,113 --> 00:54:34,282
- EMT: Go a little further back.
- NURSE: Okay. Okay.

1060
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:35,616
- Got the draw sheet?
- Yeah.

1061
00:54:35,658 --> 00:54:36,951
EMT:
One, two...

1062
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:38,536
- (thudding)
- (grunting): There you go.

1063
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:39,996
NURSE:
Okay.

1064
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:43,333
You knew my dad?

1065
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:45,668
Yeah, I knew Ray.

1066
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,629
He used to sell me peyote.

1067
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:52,842
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

1068
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:55,303
with a shaman from Little Rock.

1069
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:59,223
(laughing):
Your-your daddy got freaked out

1070
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:01,059
by his own reflection.

1071
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,603
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

1072
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,355
(laughing)

1073
00:55:05,396 --> 00:55:07,815
I stopped doing drugs with him,

1074
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:10,693
but I'll-I'll miss him.

1075
00:55:10,735 --> 00:55:12,528
- CAMERON: Dad.
- LONNIE: What? It's true.

1076
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,614
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

1077
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:16,908
You see that? That's Tommy.

1078
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:19,369
- LONNIE: Yeah.
- CAMERON: Whose car is that?

1079
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,704
LONNIE:
Lindsey's. Shit.

1080
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,834
Lindsey's car.

1081
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:28,753
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

1082
00:55:28,795 --> 00:55:30,713
It's Michael.

1083
00:55:30,755 --> 00:55:32,548
He's here.

1084
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,884
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

1085
00:55:34,926 --> 00:55:36,094
TOMMY:
Be careful now, all right?

1086
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:37,512
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

1087
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:39,180
CAMERON:
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

1088
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,683
TOMMY:
Lindsey!

1089
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,893
- CAMERON: Okay.
- TOMMY: Just be safe, okay?

1090
00:55:43,935 --> 00:55:45,728
ALLYSON:
You, too. Lindsey!

1091
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,855
CAMERON:
Lindsey!

1092
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:51,693
TOMMY:
Lindsey!

1093
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:53,736
- ALLYSON: Marion!
- LONNIE: Marion!

1094
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,492
You guys be careful, okay?

1095
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:01,202
Keep your heads up.

1096
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,914
Oh, shit, Tommy.

1097
00:56:08,584 --> 00:56:10,753
Oh, fuck.

1098
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:14,257
(Tommy and Lonnie gasp)

1099
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:17,468
Oh, God.

1100
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:34,986
Fuck me.

1101
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:36,904
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

1102
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:39,157
We found something.

1103
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:42,076
Oh, God.

1104
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:47,415
Oh, I'm sorry.

1105
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:49,917
- That's Marion, Lonnie.
- He did this.

1106
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,920
(crying):
Oh, God, Marion.

1107
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:55,548
Tommy, what the fuck?

1108
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,301
I'm gonna get you.

1109
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:00,803
Come and get it, man.

1110
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:04,307
(whimpering nearby)

1111
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:08,811
Over here.

1112
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:11,064
She's over here.

1113
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:13,650
LINDSEY (crying):
I saw his face.

1114
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:14,859
I saw everything.

1115
00:57:14,901 --> 00:57:16,110
He's still out there.

1116
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:17,695
- She's lucky to be alive.
- I saw him.

1117
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:18,946
TOMMY:
You saw his face?

1118
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:21,115
LINDSEY:
He's still out there, Tommy.

1119
00:57:21,157 --> 00:57:23,117
LONNIE:
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

1120
00:57:23,159 --> 00:57:24,661
You're gonna be okay.

1121
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,288
LINDSEY:
He's still out there.

1122
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,335
Frank.

1123
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,589
Frank, are you awake?

1124
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,849
Do you remember that night?

1125
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:49,185
At the bar?

1126
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:52,689
You know, I-I never
said anything,

1127
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,066
'cause I couldn't be sure.

1128
00:57:57,902 --> 00:58:00,238
I was so messed up.

1129
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:09,330
But you helped me.

1130
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:15,211
I always liked you.

1131
00:58:15,253 --> 00:58:17,338
♪ ♪

1132
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:21,175
- You so crazy.
- (Laurie sighs)

1133
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,177
Fuck you.

1134
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:24,429
(chuckles)

1135
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:27,890
Hi.

1136
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:30,893
Hi.

1137
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:34,605
I remember that night.

1138
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:36,441
Yeah.

1139
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,861
I kissed you.

1140
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:41,863
Yeah.

1141
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,740
I remember.

1142
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,034
You held my hand.

1143
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,203
That was it.

1144
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,123
Now, I was hoping for more.

1145
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,753
But I knew you were sweet for...

1146
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:58,838
(groans softly)

1147
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,132
Ben Tramer.

1148
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:06,262
(Hawkins groans)

1149
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:07,680
Frank.

1150
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:12,518
We got him.

1151
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:16,105
We killed Michael.

1152
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,691
You ki...

1153
00:59:21,486 --> 00:59:23,446
Well, it's about time.

1154
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:25,239
(laughs) Ow.

1155
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:27,867
- Ow. Don't make me laugh.
- (door opens)

1156
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:30,328
NURSE:
Oh, good. You're awake.

1157
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,121
(Hawkins groans)

1158
00:59:32,163 --> 00:59:33,998
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

1159
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,793
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

1160
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:38,294
Number 11.

1161
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,838
NURSE:
This will make the pain go away.

1162
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,257
(groans)

1163
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:44,592
Laurie.

1164
00:59:44,634 --> 00:59:47,387
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

1165
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:49,931
Help out my friend here.

1166
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:52,517
Make it a double.

1167
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:55,019
TOMMY:
You stood up to that monster.

1168
00:59:55,061 --> 00:59:57,063
LINDSEY:
I tried, Tommy.

1169
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:59,107
You know, when we were kids,

1170
00:59:59,148 --> 01:00:01,109
we used to all dare each other

1171
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,111
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

1172
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:04,612
(Tommy chuckles softly)

1173
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:07,949
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

1174
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:09,742
LONNIE:
I lied.

1175
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:13,621
I never made it inside.

1176
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,707
When they arrested
Michael that night,

1177
01:00:15,748 --> 01:00:18,376
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

1178
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:21,379
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

1179
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:23,464
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

1180
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:25,800
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

1181
01:00:25,842 --> 01:00:28,052
- I-I don't know.
- I've been waiting here for over an hour.

1182
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:30,013
Who the hell's in charge here?

1183
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:31,556
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

1184
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:33,308
There's not enough medical
or security help.

1185
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:34,809
- He's going to kill everybody!
- You need to relax.

1186
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:36,394
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

1187
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:37,895
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

1188
01:00:37,937 --> 01:00:39,230
but no confirmation.

1189
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:41,149
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

1190
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:43,192
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

1191
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:44,360
Uh, I got a call.

1192
01:00:44,402 --> 01:00:46,070
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

1193
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:47,447
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

1194
01:00:47,488 --> 01:00:48,948
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

1195
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,325
It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I.

1196
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:51,743
TOMMY:
Clear the hallway, please.

1197
01:00:51,784 --> 01:00:52,785
Somebody help!

1198
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:54,162
Please, emergency.

1199
01:00:54,203 --> 01:00:55,330
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

1200
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:56,914
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

1201
01:00:56,956 --> 01:00:58,207
He's still out there, Tommy.

1202
01:00:58,249 --> 01:00:59,959
- Be careful.
- TOMMY: Karen.

1203
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,711
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

1204
01:01:01,753 --> 01:01:03,254
- How's Laurie? Is she okay?
- Where's my daughter?

1205
01:01:03,296 --> 01:01:04,672
She's okay. She's fine.

1206
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:05,757
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

1207
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,966
No, no, but he's coming here.

1208
01:01:07,008 --> 01:01:08,259
She's not supposed
to be with them.

1209
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:10,219
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

1210
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:13,097
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

1211
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:15,683
- All right, listen, folks. Listen!
- (clamoring)

1212
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:17,185
Folks, please.

1213
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:18,853
- The Boogeyman is at large.
- (clamoring quiets)

1214
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:21,689
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

1215
01:01:21,731 --> 01:01:23,524
He is an apex predator.

1216
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,860
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

1217
01:01:25,902 --> 01:01:27,362
There will be no empathy.

1218
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:30,031
This ends when Michael is dead!

1219
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:32,241
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

1220
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:35,286
and it will not go
without witness!

1221
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:38,623
We need all of you.

1222
01:01:38,665 --> 01:01:41,084
- Evil dies tonight!
- (shouts of assent)

1223
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,126
Evil dies tonight!

1224
01:01:42,168 --> 01:01:44,045
All right, everybody, calm down.

1225
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:45,171
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

1226
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:46,297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1227
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:47,632
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1228
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:49,300
We have watched
your department fail...

1229
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:50,969
- fail tonight!
- WOMAN: Tommy's right!

1230
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,261
This is Haddonfield.

1231
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:54,222
This is our town.

1232
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:57,141
He killed my daughter
40 years ago

1233
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:59,143
and desecrated her body.

1234
01:01:59,185 --> 01:02:00,395
Evil dies tonight.

1235
01:02:00,436 --> 01:02:01,896
BARKER:
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1236
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:04,065
I am the law, not you.

1237
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:06,234
- MAN: Fuck off, Barker.
- Jonesy, get over there!

1238
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:07,485
- Robin, I need you up there.
- (clamoring)

1239
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:09,153
I need you over here.
You two...

1240
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:10,530
- (groans)
- TOMMY: Laurie!

1241
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:12,115
- KAREN: Tommy, you can't go in there!
- Tommy?

1242
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:13,825
- Tommy, you can't go in there!
- Laurie. Laurie.

1243
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:15,410
- KAREN: Tommy!
- Tommy.

1244
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:17,370
- Laurie. He killed Marion.
- Tommy.

1245
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:19,998
- And he attacked Lindsey, too.
- What? Karen.

1246
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,166
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1247
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:24,627
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1248
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:26,629
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1249
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,590
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1250
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:32,093
- when I was a kid, you protected me.
- Yeah.

1251
01:02:32,135 --> 01:02:34,554
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1252
01:02:34,595 --> 01:02:36,931
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1253
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:38,975
but could you get out, please?

1254
01:02:39,017 --> 01:02:40,893
Like, get out now!

1255
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:43,271
We had him.

1256
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:44,772
How did he escape?

1257
01:02:44,814 --> 01:02:46,274
I don't know. I don't know.

1258
01:02:46,316 --> 01:02:47,942
TOMMY: What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1259
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,610
We fight.

1260
01:02:49,652 --> 01:02:50,862
We always fight.

1261
01:02:50,903 --> 01:02:53,531
- Go! Find him, Tommy!
- Yeah. I will. I will.

1262
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:55,491
- LAURIE: I... No. (groans)
- Mom, don't. Don't.

1263
01:02:55,533 --> 01:02:57,035
I need you to listen to me.

1264
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:58,745
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1265
01:02:58,786 --> 01:03:02,165
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1266
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:04,042
Ray is dead.

1267
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,626
So many people are dead.

1268
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:07,128
We're not equipped.

1269
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,964
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1270
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:12,133
People are losing their minds.

1271
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:14,719
There are authorities
who are trained

1272
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:17,722
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1273
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:20,266
There's a system.

1274
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,478
Well, the system failed.

1275
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:25,396
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1276
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:27,315
- Don't. No. No.
- No, no, no. Get away.

1277
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:28,483
- What are you doing?
- Karen, no!

1278
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:29,525
- Stop right now!
- Get away!

1279
01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:31,110
I am not gonna let you do this.

1280
01:03:31,152 --> 01:03:32,487
- No. Mom.
- Get out of my way.

1281
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:34,364
- Move!
- Mom, please, what are you doing?

1282
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:38,993
Do you even know what that is?

1283
01:03:39,035 --> 01:03:40,953
(panting)

1284
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:42,872
It makes the pain go away.

1285
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,875
(screams)

1286
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:49,212
(syringe drops to floor)

1287
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:50,838
Let him come for me.

1288
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,048
No.

1289
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,342
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1290
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:57,095
- No.
- Maybe the only way he can die

1291
01:03:57,136 --> 01:03:58,262
is if I die, too.

1292
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,015
- No.
- Karen, you and Allyson

1293
01:04:01,057 --> 01:04:02,725
should not have to keep running

1294
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:06,437
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1295
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:09,023
So you just have to let me go.

1296
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,109
- Karen, move!
- Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1297
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,486
Listen. Mom.

1298
01:04:15,863 --> 01:04:18,533
Stop.

1299
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:21,786
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1300
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:24,038
(panting)

1301
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,124
We want to get married.

1302
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:28,292
Um...

1303
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:31,421
Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away.

1304
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:33,214
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1305
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:36,384
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1306
01:04:36,426 --> 01:04:38,386
They share the information
where the flower is

1307
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:40,221
with the rest of the colony.

1308
01:04:40,263 --> 01:04:44,267
They communicate
the precise location

1309
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:45,727
by shaking their butts.

1310
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:47,812
(chuckles)
What is in that honey?

1311
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:50,189
WOMAN (on TV): Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1312
01:04:50,231 --> 01:04:53,318
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1313
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,194
Right. Jewish.

1314
01:04:55,236 --> 01:04:58,740
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1315
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:03,036
I'm sorry.

1316
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:04,746
I'm sorry, baby.

1317
01:05:04,787 --> 01:05:06,956
(knocking)

1318
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,919
And now they're
at the back door.

1319
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:15,089
Halloween's over, kids!

1320
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:17,383
(knocking)

1321
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,847
I'll handle it.

1322
01:05:25,183 --> 01:05:26,976
(turns off TV)

1323
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:34,275
Knock it off!

1324
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:35,610
(crickets chirping)

1325
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:37,945
(knocking)

1326
01:05:39,697 --> 01:05:42,450
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1327
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:49,415
(sighs)

1328
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:51,959
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1329
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,795
(Big John sighs)

1330
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:05,682
John.

1331
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:09,310
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1332
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:10,979
Huh?

1333
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,064
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1334
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:14,899
We don't want to get sued.

1335
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:19,028
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1336
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:23,032
Did you lock the back door?

1337
01:06:23,074 --> 01:06:24,742
Uh...

1338
01:06:24,784 --> 01:06:26,035
I'll check.

1339
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,748
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1340
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:35,712
(shudders)

1341
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:47,640
Big John?

1342
01:06:48,391 --> 01:06:50,018
Big John?

1343
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,065
Yes, Little John?

1344
01:06:57,692 --> 01:07:00,320
(whispers):
Someone's in our house.

1345
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:03,072
And it's not a child.

1346
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:11,080
Fuck that.

1347
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,596
I got this knife.

1348
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:33,728
I got this knife.

1349
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:38,983
(slow, heavy footsteps)

1350
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:47,325
- (clamoring)
- LEIGH: Fuck off, man.

1351
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,494
Get out of my face.

1352
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,287
Lonnie, where are you?

1353
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:53,081
I'm at the hospital right now.

1354
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,874
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1355
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:58,628
(whispers):
Is that him?

1356
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,923
(whispers):
I saw that guy on TV.

1357
01:08:01,964 --> 01:08:04,008
Back, back, back.

1358
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:06,135
(indistinct chatter)

1359
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:13,309
You know what I mean?

(clamoring)

1361
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,771
I have no answer for you.

1362
01:08:17,772 --> 01:08:19,816
Help me.

1363
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,527
Help me!

Tommy, what's happening?

1366
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:30,410
- I don't know.
- Who is it?

1367
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:31,786
Um...

1368
01:08:31,828 --> 01:08:34,080
- Help me!
- TOMMY: Who is it? Is it Michael?

1369
01:08:34,122 --> 01:08:36,040
- Is it him? - I don't know.
- WOMAN: It's Michael.

Michael's here.

He's not wearing his mask!

1372
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:40,545
- TOMMY: It's Michael.
- Michael!

1373
01:08:40,586 --> 01:08:43,131
Michael! Stop!

going near him.

- I'm gonna go.
- No, you're not.

1378
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:50,513
Block the doorway!

1379

Don't let him leave!

1380
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:55,018

- Tommy, get him!
