00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,220
My name's Charles Bronson.

to be famous.

I knew I was made

for better things.

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,410
I had a calling.

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,590
I just didn't know

7
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,550
what as.

8
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,550
Weren't singing.

9
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,470
Can't fucking act.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,680

Right, how else can I explain it?

( Baby cooing )

35
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,090
There was nothing wonky
about my upbringing.

36
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,630
My parents were decent,

37
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
respectable and upstanding
members of society.

38
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,390
I went to school.

39
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,390
I kept my head down.

40
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,640
So like most kids,

41
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,600
I got into trouble.

42
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,480
You bastard!

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,350
I liked it.

( doorbell rings )

47
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,580
Oh, Michael.

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Mrs. Peterson, I really must
talk to you about Michael.

49
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,420
But I wasn't bad.

50
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,380
I wasn't bad bad.

51
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,010
And I still have my principles.

52
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,890
I took the first job
I could get my hands on.

53
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,690
Bring the fries, Peterson.

54
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,230
I suppose the crumpet
wasn't bad.

55
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,470
( Doorbell rings )

56
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,930
Mrs. Peterson,

57
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,850
we'd like to have
a word with your son.

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,480
Michael.

59
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,610
Michael Peterson.

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
Right.

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, before I forget,

62
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,540
I did come into this world
as Michael Peterson.

63
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,960
But I'll go out
with my fighting name...

64
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
Charlie Bronson.

65
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,380
Which is my alter ego.

66
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,430
( Screaming )

67
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,560
1974...

68
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,690
tough time
to be young in England.

69
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,610
Not a lot of opportunity around.

70
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,120
Still, life moves on.

71
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,750
Irene and I got hitched.

72
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,580
- ( Baby crying )
- It was all right.

73
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,420
We didn't have it bad
for a couple from the chippy.

74
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,510
But they don't give you
a star on the walk of fame

75
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,300
for "not bad," do they?

76
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,090
( Crying )

77
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,140
( metal clangs )

78
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,600
Michael, what is that noise?

79
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,730
For God's sakes.

80
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,200
So this is the post office

81
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,080
I did over.

82
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,740
This is what I got away with.

83
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,870
( Coins rattling )

84
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,540
And this is what they gave me.

85
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,750
Seven years!

86
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,050
Mother:
Don't worry, son.

87
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,430
You won't do the seven.
You'll be out in four.

88
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,340
( Door locks )

89
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,560
( crying )

90
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,950
- ( laughing )
- ( audience laughing )

91
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,080
I had you going, didn't I?
Huh?

92
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,210
Go on!
I had you going!

93
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,460
I've always fancied myself
as a bit of a comedian.

94
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,840
But seven years

95
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,930
is a long time.

96
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,020
( laughs )

97
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,270
Now I'm not gonna
stand here, right, and tell you...

98
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,770
tell you that prison

99
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,770
is "not bad."

100
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,570
No, that would be
misrepresenting myself.

101
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,570
And I think enough of that
has been done already,

102
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,530
don't you?

103
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
No.

104
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,330
You see, I didn't see
a cell, a cage

105
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,090
or a box.

106
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,840
To me, it was a hotel room.

107
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,260
- ( Chains clanging )
- ( indistinct screaming )

108
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,150
Don't get me wrong.

109
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,820
For most people,

110
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,530
prison is tough.

111
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,780
A monotonous nightmare.

112
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,120
24 hours a day,

113
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,580
seven days a week,

114
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,080
365 days a year

115
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,840
of pure, unadulterated,

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800
living, breathing hell.

117
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,220
( Man wailing )

118
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,770
Charles:
But for me,

119
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,140
prison was finally a place

120
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,810
where I could sharpen my tools,

121
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,110
hone my skills.

122
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,610
It's like a battleground,
isn't it?

123
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,070
It was an opportunity

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,410
and a place where soon
every native

125
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,740
was gonna know my name.

126
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,550
What's the matter, Charlie?

127
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,090
Do you want me to take
you through it again?

128
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,470
No, we don't do work
in long-term prisons.

129
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,310
It's vocational training
so you can get a job when-.

130
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,560
Fuck off!

131
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,570
( Sewing machines rattling )

132
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,870
What's the problem, Peterson?

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,210
Problem?

134
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,130
I said, what's the problem,
Peterson?

135
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,760
I don't know.
I don't have a problem.

136
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,220

- Please.

- Two.

Nothing closer to my heart
than a good cup

of British char.

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,930
- Milk and sugar?
- No, I like it dark.

159
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,140
Oh.

160
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,610
That's an impressive set
of guns you have there.

161
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,490
You must be handy in a brawl.
Bam-bam,

162
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,490
knockout, ding-ding.

163
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,250
Very nice.

( Humming )

165
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,760
( Charles laughing )

166
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,310
But time stops for no man,
ladies and germs.

167
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,220
And my time was coming up.

168
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,390
Parole!

169
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,820
And just when I was about
to make a name to be reckoned with.

170
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,650
- ( Crowd groans )
- Man: Oh, yeah, as what?

171
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,610
As what?

172
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,040
You don't wanna be trapped
inside with me, sunshine.

173
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,500
Inside, I'm someone
nobody wants to fuck with.

174
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,380
Do you understand?

175
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,430
I am Charlie Bronson.

176
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,260
I am Britain's
most violent prisoner.

177
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,980
Charles:
Prison was,

178
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,320
honestly, brilliant!

179
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,440
I liked it personally.
Fuck that. I loved it!

180
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,110
It was exciting.
It was on the edge.

181
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,790
It was madness as its very best.

182
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,160
- ( Clothes ripping )
- ( glass shatters )

183

( horse whinnies )

185
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,470
The problem is
once you get comfortable,

186
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,680

00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,440
to suck up the free air

368
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,200
and see what the world
had to offer me.

369
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Very funny, boys.

370
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,780
Right.

371
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,080
It's been a pleasure.

372
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,730
Look at you. Dad.

373
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,320
Hi, son.

374
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,830
( Door rattling )

375
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,630
( knocks )

376
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,010
( door lock jiggling )

377
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,490
Come on in, son.

378
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,040
That's right.
I'll show you your room,

379
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,330
and then we'll have
a nice cup of tea.

380
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,340
Come on, son.

381
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,680
That's right.

382
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,060
Oh, look, it's me.

383
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,520
I was very small.

384
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,830
Where's all my stuff?

385
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,790
We couldn't bring
everything, Michael.

386
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,250
That was Luton.

387
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,880
What, all of it?

388
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,430
We kept some.

389
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,680
Where's my bed?

390
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,850
No, not this one.
The other one,

391
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,480
what I had when I was a child.

392
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,900
We couldn't keep
everything, Michael.

393
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,690
We don't have the room.

394
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,380
Is my bed still in Luton?

395
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,210
Luton...

396
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,880
never changes, does it?

397
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,350
Now my mom once said,
"Stick with what you know."

398
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,060
And I knew two things.

399
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,810
I knew Luton
and I knew Uncle Jack.

400
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,520
And Uncle Jack knew everyone.

401
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,150
And anyone he didn't know
wasn't worth knowing.

402
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,790
Going on holiday?

403
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,080
No.

404
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,840
Something better than that.
I'm gonna make a name for myself.

405
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, yeah, doing what?

406
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,260
I'm gonna kill the queen.

407
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,930
So you're off to London then?

408
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,680
No.

409
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,810
Luton's where it's at.

410
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,780
( Door rattling )

411
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,540
( animal chitters )

412
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,370
( knocking )

413
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,250
( buzzer sounds )

414
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,220
( door opens )

415
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,400
Well, fuck me inside out.

416
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,570
Come in, my dear boy.
You're just in time for cocktails.

417
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,380
Uncle Jack:
Hello.

418
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,210
Hello.

419
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
Luton calling.

420
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen
in ladies' attire,

421
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,600
allow me to present
my favorite nephew,

422
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,680
newly relieved
of Her Majesty's pleasure,

423
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,180
Mickey Peterson.

424
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,350
Sit down, my dear boy.

425
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,610
I'll sit there.

426
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,690
How are you?

427
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,940
Miss gorgeous here

428
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,780
will get you a cocktail.

429
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,740
Michael.

430
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,500
It's very exciting to meet you.

431
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,630
Our Jack here, he says
you're quite a celebrity on the inside.

432
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,800
Mmm.

433
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,260
Oh. Thank you.

434
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,560
It's a complete turnoff.

435
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,100
Mm-hmm.

436
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,150
Your face rug.

437
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,780
Be like kissing a fanny.

438
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,900
Ooh.

439
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,780
That's an outstanding
set of mustaches.

440
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,120
I admire your dedication.

441
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,740
Mmm.

442
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,420
I always knew you had
an artistic bent.

443
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,260
Woman:
So, big boy,

444
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,090
what does the future hold
for Michael Peterson?

445
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,930
Ooh.

446
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,170
Ambition is the virtue

447
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,210
of all great men.

448
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,600
He's going to stay here with us.

449
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,220
All right, my pets?

450
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,690
Say the more the merrier.

451
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,650
For as long as you like.

452
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,980
( Slurping )

453
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,370
That's very strong.

454
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,960
It's wonderful.

455
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,550
Charles: Uncle Jack always had
his ear to the ground.

456
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,800
And it turns out, there was an old prison
mate of mine in Luton too.

457
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,010
( Dance music playing )

458
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,730
- Peterson.
- This your gaff?

459
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,140
Yes.

460
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,690
How much you get?

461
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,190
10 years.

462
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,980
Fucking hell.

463
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,990
Make Mickey a cup
of tea, please.

464
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,200
( Mumbling )

465
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,500
Let's fuck.

466
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,760
So are you interested?

467
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,340
Of course I fucking am.

468
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,890
You're looking good, Mickey.

469
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,560
Fit, strong,

470
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,690
powerful.

471
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,190
You can make some money.

472
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,190
Serious money.

473
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,490
All you need's a name.

474
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,910
What's wrong
with Mickey Peterson?

475
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,660
No, you need a fighting name.

476
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,830
Like a movie star.

477
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,170
Oh, right.

478
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,680
( Sighs )

479
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,850
Charlton Heston.

480
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,600
Look, love,

481
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,310
nobody gives a toss
about Charlton Heston.

482
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,940
The man's a cunt.

483
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,490
You're more
the Charles Bronson type.

484
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,240
Charles Bronson.

485
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,370
Yes, "Death Wish."

486
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,660
That's you down
to a tee, perfect.

487
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,870
Charlie...

488
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Fucking Bronson.

489
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,340
Hmm.

490
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,590

I can feel you
looking at me, Charlie.

504
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,390
Do you want me to do your nails?

505

No.

Fight.

508
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:53,530
And that one?

509
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,950

You're very muscley, aren't you?

512
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,170
Mind if I hold your arm?

00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,180
Oh my God.

00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,270
It's huge.

You-you shouldn't-.

00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,830
What, Charlie?

520
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,290
You shouldn't mess around with boys
what are bigger than you.

521
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,300
- Oh, really?
- ( murmurs )

522

- Shit.

524
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,150
Lucky man.
Lucky cunt.

525
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,420
Oh, yeah!

526
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,050
Hey! All right.

527
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,350
Hey!

528
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,180
Yeah.

529
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:44,730
Do you want some
fucking murder, yeah?

530
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,610
Who wants some fucking murder?

531
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,690
You don't look well, mate.

532
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,570
All right, you fucking cunt.

533
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,200

a fucking laugh, ain't you?

535
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,000
Spare me the Oliver
Twist routine.

536
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,830
Charlie, love, you need to build
your audience.

537
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,340
I gave you fucking magic
in there.

538
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,920
Magic?
You just pissed on a gypsy

539
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,630
in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

540
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,930
It's hardly the hottest
ticket in town, darling.

541
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:19,890
All right, when is the next one?

542
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,690
( Moaning )

543
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,360
( snarling, barking )

544
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,480
Let him fucking go.
If he wants to go,

545
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,810
let him fucking go!

546
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,940
- Come on!
- Have at him!

547
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,130
I love you.

548
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,380
What?

549
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,060
I love you.

550
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:21,740
- It's been nice.
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,160
But I love Brian.

552
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,790
Who's Brian?

553
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,170
He's my boyfriend.

554
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,180
And he's got a motorbike.

555
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Brian.

556
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,400
Yes, sir, can I help you?

557
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,860
Yeah, well...

558
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:07,160
I want to take a butchers
at that ring there.

559
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,790
That ring there, sir?
That's a £1,000 ring, sir.

560
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,750
Right. Fuck off!

561
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,460
- Don't fucking move!
- ( gasps )

562
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,010
Or I'll kill you, all right?

563
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,840
Don't fucking move!

564
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,180
And don't call the police

565
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,350
- for 10 minutes.
- I won't.

566
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,600
All right?

567
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,900
15 minutes.

568
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,070
Happy Christmas.

569
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,880
I've been thinking...

570
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:08,800
You're a very
sweet man, Charlie.

571
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,760
...about-about you.

572
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,140
Yeah, but you've
got no ambition.

573
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,640
You know what I mean?

574
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,070
Bought you this.

575
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,700
Eh?

576
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,420
Eh?

577
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,590
Thank you.

578
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,930
Brian and me
are getting married.

579
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,390
( Exhales )

580
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,270
( sniffs )

581
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:04,610
Right.

582
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,570
Well...

583
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,280
congratulations.

584
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,120
Eh?

585
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,960
See you later, Charlie.

586
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,900
Fucking charming.

587
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,270
Onwards and upwards.

588
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,240
That's what I always say.

589
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,450
Everything happens
for a reason, don't it?

590
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,330
Hear hear.

591
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,460
Magic.

592
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,960
Well, it turns out

593
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,300
that lovely lady
in the jewelry shop

594
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,640
waited exactly 15 minutes.

595
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,140
But it didn't take them
15 minutes to find me.

596
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,600
We'd been expecting them.

597
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,360
( Chains clanging )

598
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,480
Well well well.

599
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,440
Charles Bronson is it now?

600
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,740
An American Mongolian pop star.

601
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,700
Film star, sir.
"Death Wish."

602
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,740
Bloody good, as it happens.

603
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,160
Yeah, I'm sure, Webber.
I'm sure, thank you.

604
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,460
So...

605
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,500
69 days, was it?

606
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:32,300
69 days all to yourself.

607
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,180
Another of your prison
records broken.

608
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,430
So tell me, Charles Bronson,

609
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,100
what exactly did
you do with yourself

610
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,690
for these 69 days?

611
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,770
I was building an empire.

612
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,700
You're ridiculous.

613
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,180
( Door opens )

614
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,640
Good morning, Charlie.
Something to read?

615
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:30,400
Got another Jilly Cooper.

616
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,570
Tell me how you got on
with "Who Dares Wins" then.

617
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,740
I've heard it's really good.

618
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,400
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- No problem, Charlie.

619
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,870
Shut the fuck up, you cunt!

620
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,290
Shut it!

621
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,340
Right.

622
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,720
Now I've got
a librarian up here.

623
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,720
And he's in a lot of trouble.

624
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,350
So I think you should send
someone up

625
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,350
to help him out, don't you?

626
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,570
Man: For fuck's sake,
he's at it again.

627
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,400
Man ♪2: He's got a hostage.
Get the governor!

628
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:19,200
Right.

629
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Sit down.

630
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,580
Not there! On the fucking
karzy, you cunt!

631
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,600
What happens now?

632
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,900
Um...

633
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,900
I don't know.

634
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,910
Well, I guess we'll
just have to...

635
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,870
we'll have to wait.

636
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:10,870
I can wait all day.
I'm not going anywhere.

637
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,130
You're not going anywhere,
you fucking cunt.

638
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,380
We'll just fucking wait.
I'll wait.

639
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,050
( Guards running )

640
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,060
( telephone ringing )

641
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,290
- Hello.
- Hello, Charlie.

642
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,750
- Can you hear me?
- Of course I can fucking hear you.

643
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,260
There's nothing wrong
with my hearing, you cunt.

644
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,510
What is it, Charlie?

645
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,140
What is it, Charlie?

646
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,140
Well...

647
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:12,140
I am sitting here with...

648
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,560
what's your name?

649
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:17,400
- Love.
- Love?!

650
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,400
- Andy Love.
- Oh, Andy Love.

651
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,070
Yeah?

652
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,990
All right, I'm sitting here

653
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,570
with Andy Love.

654
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,780
And I'm gonna snap
his fucking neck

655
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,830
and stick his head up
his ass if I don't get what I want!

656
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,330
What do you want?

657
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,420
What do I want?

658
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,970
What have you got?

659
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,010
Well...

660
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,850
that's entirely up to you,

661
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,850
isn't it?

662
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,560
We're done. You can fuck off.
I've had enough.

663
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,070
All right...

664
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,370
Andy Love.

665
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,160
Are you a family man?

666
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

667
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:19,920
- I got two kids.
- Two kids, yeah?

668
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:23,050
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

669
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,920
What does it fucking look like
I'm doing, you cunt?

670
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,430
- Look, let's-let's talk.
- No, I'm done talking.

671
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,220
Fucking pointless.

672
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,680
- Wait-
- Wait for what?

673
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,640
Right.

674
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,400
- That's it.
- What are you gonna do now?

675
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,650
What am I gonna do?

676
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,820
I'm gonna put my
fucking body paint on.

677
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,940
That's what I'm gonna do.

678
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,820
Get my body armor, all right?

679
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,910
Fucking hell.

680
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,740
Let's have it.

681
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,830
Go on, get some of that rubbed on
my back, you cunt.

682
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,330
- What?
- Get it on my fucking back.

683
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,540
Rub it in, you slag!

684
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,590
Go on, rub it in.
That's right. We ain't got all day.

685
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,260
Rub it right down my back.

686
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,340
Down my back and my legs.

687
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,930
Back of my legs, on my ass.

688
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,890
On my ass cheeks.
On my ass.

689
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:14,850
Not in my ass, you fucking homo!
On it.

690
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,060
Quickly. Quicker.
Quicker. Quicker!

691
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,980
Quicker! Quicker!
Quicker! Quicker!

692
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,900
Quicker! Quicker!
Fuck off!

693
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,230
Sit down in the corner.
Don't move, cunt!

694
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,280
Now hang on
to your fillings, right?

695
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:33,120
'Cause it's gonna
get fucking hairy.

696
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,580
- Come here.
- Fuck off, you cunt!

697
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,170
( Shouting )

698
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,360
( door opens )

699
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,120
Governor:
All right, Charlie Bronson.

700
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,580
I'll get straight to the point.

701
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,120
We have been sailing rather close
to the wind of late,

702
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:23,500
and I detect a rocky patch.

703
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,340
I had hoped that you coming

704
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,710
onto the special unit
with us might make you want

705
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,800
to stop this hostage
taking business,

706
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,970
this attacking of my officers.

707
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,760
We can handle this prick, sir.

708
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:39,270
Webber, will you please
take the rest

709
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,930
of the afternoon off?
Thank you.

710
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,140
Be in my office at 6:15 sharp
tomorrow morning.

711
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,310
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Yes, sir.

712
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,160
Look, I'm not in the habit

713
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,660
of making deals with prisoners.

714
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:58,490
For your recent escapade,

715
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,870
you will be punished again.
Block.

716
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,210
If you have absolutely
no interest whatsoever

717
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,710
in yourself,

718
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,470
then you leave us at a loss
with regards what to do with you.

719
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:20,770
What would you like us to do,

720
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,310
Charlie Bronson?

721
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,610
Fuck off.

722
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,610
You're pitiful.

723
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,330
You know that?

724
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,660
And I can promise you this,

725
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,370
if you further this
mindless behavior,

726
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,880
if you continue to act
in this nihilistic and godless fashion,

727
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,550
you will die inside.

728
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,880
( Moans )

729
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,680
Un, dos, tres.

730
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,060
( Murmurs )

731
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,610
( whistles )

732
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,900
Cuatro.

733
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,990
Como esta?

734
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,280
- What?
- What's this?

735
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,450
- A painting.
- Good for you.

736
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,160
Now what do you mean?
Talk to me.

737
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:08,040
Sun, sea, sand,
naked women, perfect.

738
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,250
- Whose is this?
- Eh?

739
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,460
Whose is this?

740
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,760
Come on, own up.
Who did the crime?

741
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,100
Bombs away.

742
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,970
Not your art teacher
for nothing, you know?

743
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,650
Very interesting, Charlie.

744
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,750
Interesting?

745
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:51,920
Yeah, it's interesting.

746
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,840
What does that mean?

747
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,130
What does interesting mean?
Interesting's good.

748
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,630
Bravado!

749
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,800
You know?

750
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,850
Yeah, you can't pin it down,
can't compute.

751
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,600
You can't tie that up
in a nice little pink bow.

752
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:15,690
No, you can't pin me down, mate.

753
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,190
- Pajaros!
- You fucking what?

754
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,150
Birds. Birds, Charlie.
I'm leaning Spanish.

755
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,200
- Español.
- Oh.

756
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,780
Are you?

757
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,410
Olé!

758
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,450
( laughs )

759
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,750
Lot of birds
in your work, Charlie.

760
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,830
I don't really get
to see much through...

761
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,790
bit of birds

762
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,920
and bars.

763
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,010
Pajaros.

764
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,640
Pajaros.

765
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,010
I know, mate.

766
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,100
Here's an idea for you.

767
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,600
Find that piece of you, Charles.

768
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,440
That piece that
doesn't belong here.

769
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,270
( laughs )
Fucking hell.

770
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:13,460
( Classical music playing )

771
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,270
Prisoner BT1314, Bronson, sir.

772
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,780
Good afternoon, Bronson.

773
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:27,610
Well, Mr. Danielson
here tells me

774
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,620
that you've been doing
extraordinarily well

775
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,580
in your creative endeavors.

776
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,000
Champion's a budding Magritte.

777
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,080
That's right, yeah.

778
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:43,960
You know, we've been
holding these artist materials for you,

779
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,970
sent in by your cousin Lorraine.

780
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,140
Well, now that we're rather sadly having
to consider the future

781
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,180
of the arts facility,

782
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:57,190
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't
be allowed these materials now.

783
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,940
Should help tremendously
with your work.

784
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,570
Mr. Danielson really has
got great confidence

785
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,490
in your cooperation,

786
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,700
your responsibility,

787
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:11,160
your ability to interact
within the group.

788
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,030
I strongly advise

789
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,330
that you continue
to follow this path.

790
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,370
And I look forward to seeing some
of this wonderful work

791
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,210
I've heard so much about.

792
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,710
Governor, Charlie's
actually brought something

793
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,050
for you to have
a look at now if you'd lik...

794
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,300
Charlie, give me that.

795
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,510
That's for you.

796
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,350
Thank you.

797
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,440
If you give it to Webber,

798
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,270
I'll be able to have
a look at it later.

799
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,230
Governor:
Thank you.

800
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,110
Webber: Right then, Bronson.
What are you waiting for, son?

801
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,360
Let's go, move it!
Move it!

802
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,740
I said, let's go.
Move it!

803
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,790
Sorry, Webber.
That's for you, mate.

804
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,510
Danielson:
He's a star fucker, that one.

805
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,600
I'll make sure he looks
at that painting, mate.

806
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,720
Don't you worry about that.

807
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,230
Review the unit-pfft!

808
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:23,560
Honest to God, though,
Charlie, and I'll tell you this straight,

809
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,730
I wouldn't be surprised if they started
to discuss your release date.

810
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,440
I mean, look,
it's just my opinion.

811
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,320
It's not necessarily
the opinion of others.

812
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,610
But you know,
if there's one thing I am,

813
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,410
I am a very good judge

814
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,120
of character.

815
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:40,000
Yep.

816
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,460
Sí sí.
Sí sí sí.

817
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:46,460
You'll get a call, mate.
You will.

818
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,960
You know why?

819
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,130
You're a brilliant artist.

820
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,180
Bueno.
Buenísimo.

821
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,600
I'm so excited, mate.
I'm proud as punch,

822
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,520
'cause you are a fucking star.

823
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,600
Gov's a cunt.
He is. Fuck him.

824
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,600
Can't stand the wanker.

825
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:07,650
Just keep your head down
and I'm absolutely positivo

826
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,570
that we can do this.

827
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,740
We can, mate.

828
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,580
What do you mean we?

829
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,790
We-no.
I'm just saying-.

830
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,750
No no no, Charlie.
Charles.

831
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:24,620
Don't misunderstand me, mate.

832
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:28,290
What I'm saying is you...

833
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,800
you are finally gonna get

834
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,550
what you've always wanted.

835
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,810
What do you know
about what I fucking want?

836
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:46,230
( laughs nervously )

837
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,320
( thunder rumbling )

838
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,630
What happened to my tea, Phil?

839
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,640
Sorry, mate. I'm such a cunt.
I completely forgot.

840
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:25,600
Two for you.

841
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:28,560
Two for me.

842
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,570
And then we have a cup of tea.

843
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,450
( Audience laughs )

844
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:41,700
( applauding )

845
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,030
( applause stops )

846
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,620
Governor:
Charlie.

847
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:08,620
What is it you want now?

848
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,170
Music.

849
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,430
I don't see how
that's gonna help the situation.

850
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,020
I'll fucking kill him!

851
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,730
I swear it!

852
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:38,230
Bennett.

853
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,070
- Get me some music on now, please.
- Yes, Gov.

854
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,040
( Opera playing )

855
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:22,210
Here, Charlie.

856
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,880
Not feeling very well now, mate.

857
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,390
( Music continues )

858
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,690
Oh, yeah.

859
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,360
That's a fucking piece of me.

860
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,000
Right, that's enough!
He's had enough.

861
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:50,420
Get him out of here.

862
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,760
Go on, get him the fuck out of here.
He's had enough.

863
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,010
Come on, you fucking cunts.

864
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,350
No class tomorrow, eh?
( shouts )
