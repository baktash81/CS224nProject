00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,404
Car number six. We are moving.

00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,607
4-Alpha. Repeat, 4-Alpha.

00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,909
Window seat.
His team's on all sides.

6
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,344
Copy that.

00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,906
[sighs]

8
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,606
Speed?

9
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,075
Two thirty-eight kilometers
per hour and holding steady.

10
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,411
You all right over there?

11
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,747
I do love capping me
some bad guys.

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,162
Wait! Wait! Civilian in play.

13
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,964
I repeat, civilian in play.

00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,266

00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,435

[spotter] Clear.
Confirm.

18
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,451
Confirmed. Clear. Go to green.

19
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,360
Shit.

20
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,163
[breathes heavily]

21
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,931
Are we shipping
to the same place?

22
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,032
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,667
All right.

24
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,104
That was your best ever.
I was impressed.

25
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,572
Where'd I hit him?

26
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,040
Neck.

27
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,443
On a moving train.

28
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,012
You took a video?

29
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,414
Yeah, I took video.
Me and everybody else. Look.

32
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,491
Delete it.
Henry.

33
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,293
Come on, listen.

34
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,263
Four shooters whiffed
on this guy before
you got the call, all right?

35
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,632
Four. All of 'em studs.

36
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,800
And you ring him up! [laughs]

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,403
It was beautiful, all right?
I got emotional. A tear fell.

38
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,771
Delete it.

39
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,774
I'll delete it.
I'll delete it. All right.

00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,444

[cell phone buzzing]

43
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,223
[man] Can't do this.

44
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,858
[chuckles]

45
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,027
What's happening, brother?
[sighs]

46
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,096
You all right?

47
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,268
[Henry]  I got him in his neck.
But I was aiming at his head.

48
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,005
Other lines of work,
you can lose a step.
Not this one.

49
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,041
You're still the best we got.
Best anyone's got.

50
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,343
Believe me, I keep track.

51
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,078
Not a soda. Not today.

52
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,046
Meaning?
Give me a beer.

53
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,348
Are you sure?

54
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,283
Are you really retiring?
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,651
Then I'm sure.

56
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,019
Okay.

57
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,389
[groans, chuckles]

58
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,558
A lot of guys can shoot, Del.

59
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,927
[exhales] They aren't you.

60
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,662
They don't have
the history you do.

61
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:06,399
Yeah, I think the history
might be the problem.

62
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,934
Oh, Henry.

63
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,137
We've been through
a lot together, you and me.

64
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,773
[grunts]
Made the world safer.

65
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,609
I'm just not gonna trust
a new guy like I trust you.

66
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,014
There was a kid, um...

67
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,650
beautiful little girl,

68
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,652
right next to him.

69
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,656
If I'm six inches off...

70
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,426
she's dead.

71
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,829
Understand?
[sighs]

72
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,131
This time...

73
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,134
I got lucky.

74
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,070
I didn't feel the shot.

75
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,006
Not like I should have.

76
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,276
Seventy-two kills, Del.

77
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,679
That shit starts to
mess with you a little bit.

78
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,717
Deep down, it's like...

79
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,421
my soul was hurt.

80
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,424
I just want some peace.

81
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,562
So what do I do now?

82
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,599
Wish me well.

83
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,488
[clerk] Good morning.

84
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,656
Hey. Where's Jerry?

85
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,157
Jerry retired.

86
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,426
Couldn't take any more
of this bustling pace.

87
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,727
I'm Danny.

88
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,063
How you doing? Uh, Henry.

89
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,668
I owe you, uh, $23.46.

90
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,036
All right. Thank you, Henry.

91
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,773
So what are you fishing for?

92
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,175
[Henry] Eh, peace and quiet.
[chuckles]

93
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,944
And mackerel.

94
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,279
Heading out to Breecher's Point?

95
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,914
Oh. Is that what you recommend?

96
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,016
Well, seems like
a nice enough day for it.

97
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,152
[insect buzzing]

98
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,390
[shoe scraping]

99
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,927
Not much of a
"live and let live" guy,
I take it.

100
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,263
I'm deathly allergic to bees.

101
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,100
You a student
or just a fish whisperer?

102
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,269
Um, working my way
through grad school.

103
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,737
Marine biology.

104
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,206
Mm. UGA, Darien?

105
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,342
Go Dawgs.

106
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,810
Well,
you be careful around here.

107
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,980
There's some, uh,
dogs out on these docks too.

108
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,916
Nothing I can't handle.
[chuckles]

109
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,067
Well, I guess I don't have to
ask how business is.

110
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,137
Could've been yours.

111
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,573
I only asked you ten times.

112
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,741
[laughs]

113
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,279
Hey, brother.

114
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,016
It's good to see you, Henry.
You too, Jack.

115
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,253
What are you doing there?
Feeling sexy?

116
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,788
[both laugh]

117
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,390
[Jack] Thanks for coming
so quickly.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,792
Of course. You still married?

119
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,362
Yep. Wife's on
a shopping trip to Paris.

120
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,198
Son's in boarding school.

121
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,400
You?
Nope.

122
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,036
No wife, no kids, no Paris.

123
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,372
Here's to the next war,
which is no war.

124
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,640
...which is no war.

125
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,008
[bottles clink]

126
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,078
[swallows, exhales]

127
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,213
So what you got?

128
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,621
Recognize him?

129
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,024
Who's asking?

130
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,360
Your old friend who's afraid
you're in trouble.

131
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,796
Do you?

132
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,566
I AMF'ed him in LiÃ¨ge.

133
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,068
They tell you who he was?

134
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,004
Valery Dormov, terrorist.

135
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,472
No.

136
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,642
Valery Dormov,
molecular biologist,

137
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,711
who worked here, in the States,

138
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,646
for 30 years.

139
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,582
I read his file.

140
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,384
Bioterrorist.

141
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,019
The file was spiked.

142
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,488
I don't know by who.

143
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,324
Why?
I don't know that either.

144
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,393
Where are you getting this from?

145
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,029
A friend...

146
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,931
from the other side.

147
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,699
All right, well,
I need to talk to him.

148
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,967
Oh, sure.

149
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,637
Uh, Skype? FaceTime?

150
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,740
I need to talk to him, Jack.

151
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,543
Oh, what the hell.
[typing]

152
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,845
He owes me.

153
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,352
I hope I'm wrong.

154
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,756
I just want you to be careful.

155
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,200
It's to make up for
all the things I didn't do
in my DIA years.

156
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,405
You think you didn't do that
in your DIA years?

157
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,173
[both chuckle]

158
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,909
This guy.

159
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,250
[Jack]
They tell you who he was?

160
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,486
[Henry]  Valery Dormov,
terrorist.

161
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,688
[JackNo.

162
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,757
Valery Dormov,
molecular biologist,

163
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,795
who worked here,
in the States, for 30 years.

164
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,232
You took a real risk
contacting me.

165
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,600
I wish you hadn't.

166
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,169
What was I supposed to do?

167
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,171
I love you, brother.

168
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,973
You too.

169
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,477
It's a pity.

170
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,779
I always liked Henry.

171
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,549
Henry is DIA, Clay.
He's one of mine.

172
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,050
He knows you lied to him.

173
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,285
We have a tail on him.

174
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,420
Standard protocol
for retirement.

175
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,555
He'll be contained.

176
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,857
Contained? Henry Brogan?

177
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,094
He has Dormov's contact.

178
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,062
He's gonna pull on that thread

179
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,932
until he's pointing a gun
at our faces.

180
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,168
What about his handler,
the bald guy?

181
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,671
Patterson? He won't be happy,
but he won't cross me.

182
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,239
He'll fall in line.

183
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,174
I'll tie this off.

184
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,310
Make it look like
a Russian op.

185
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,911
You'll do nothing.

186
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,613
I'll tell my team that
Henry's gone rogue.

187
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,981
I can handle this.

188
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,050
What, after you whiffed
four times on Dormov?

189
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,518
No. You need Gemini.

190
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,654
I will not let you do hits
on American soil.

191
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,791
You don't have anyone
who can take out Henry Brogan.

192
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,993
I do.

193
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,197
We'll clean up our own messes.
Thank you.

194
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,967
Everything that we've worked for
is at stake,

195
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,401
thanks to your failures.

196
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,772
You have one chance
not to screw this up.

197
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,340
Please...

198
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,243
surprise me.

199
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,456
Any luck?

200
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,961
Okay.

201
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,296
Most guys try flowers

202
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,298
or a playlist they think
I'll find romantic.

203
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,833
Are you DIA?

204
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,069
That depends. What's DIA?

205
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,238
Dance Instructors of America.

206
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,540
Did Patterson send you
to surveil me?

207
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,443
Patterson.
Del Patterson?

208
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,112
Funny coincidence,
he was just here.

209
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,115
Look, you're burned.
Your cover's blown.

210
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,619
Okay, well,
I was just in the middle
of a Marvin Gaye song,

211
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,920
so I'm gonna go back to that.

212
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,456
Name three buildings
on the Darien campus.

213
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,392
Really?
Come on, marine biologist.

214
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,662
Rhodes Hall, McWhorter Hall,
Rooker Hall.

215
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,997
Now I know you're DIA.

216
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,899
Civilian would've told me
to piss off.

217
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,168
Not a polite civilian.
[chuckles]

218
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,837
You're good. You're good.

219
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:32,905
Where do you live?

220
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,240
What?

221
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,342
I want to see your place.

222
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,544
Excuse me?

223
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,282
Where I'm sure I won't find
a single book on marine biology,

224
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,852
but I'm certain I'll find
a big old folder
on Henry Brogan.

225
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,387
[man] Excuse me?

226
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,590
Okay, this has been fun,
but I kind of have to do my job.

227
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,758
Sorry, sir. Um--

228
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,260
Yeah, I got
the 30-foot bowrider.

229
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,761
Okay.
Need some gas and--

230
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,663
Sir. One second.

231
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,431
Um--

232
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm sorry. Uh--

233
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,102
Can I buy you a drink?

234
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,138
Why, so you can keep
interrogating me?

235
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,875
No, I'm probably gonna spend
the whole time apologizing.

236
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:14,046
Pelican Point?
Sunday nights they have
a great band.

237
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,582
Please. What time
do you get off work?

238
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,255
Seven.
I'm gonna also need
a 12-volt bilge pump.

239
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,457
Twelve-volt...
All right,
I'll see you at 7:00.

240
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,894
Just leave the crazy
at home, please.

241
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,229
All right.

242
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,500
[rock music playing]

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,783
Aw.
[laughs]

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,918
Sorry about earlier. Bad habits.

245
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,154
I don't trust people easily.

246
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,022
But I'm sure you don't either.

247
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,425
Why would you say that?

248
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,602
Where did you get that?

249
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,671
Twenty-five years
of faithful service,

250
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,606
you make some friends.

251
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,043
Well, now I'm burned.

252
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,746
Toast.

253
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,015
Is Patterson running you?
[footsteps approaching]

254
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,984
[waitress]
All right, here y'all go.

255
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,357
[Henry] Thank you.
[waitress] You're welcome.

256
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,995
Boilermaker's a cop drink.
You got cops in your family?

257
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,263
My dad was FBI.

258
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,799
And, uh, pretty big
on serving your country.

259
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,735
Uh, "was"?

260
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,338
Yeah, he died off duty,
trying to stop a bank robbery.

261
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,607
Ah. Sorry about that.

262
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,712
File says you were
four years navy,
Fifth Fleet, Bahrain.

263
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,647
Yeah, I did love the sea.

264
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,184
Didn't love being stuck
in a tin can with
a couple hundred sailors though.

265
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,121
Hmm. Hey, beats a bunker
in Mogadishu.

266
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,589
Mm. [chuckles]

267
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,027
So, then DIA,

268
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,362
Defense Clandestine Services,

269
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,664
recruiting, running assets.

270
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,200
Not a single demerit.

271
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,369
[laughs] I mean...

272
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,572
So then the inspector general
sticks you on a dock

273
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,575
to watch a guy
who just wants to retire?

274
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,045
That doesn't bother you?

275
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,286
Well, this is adios, Henry.

276
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,555
It's been nice surveilling you.
[laughs]

277
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,158
I'll probably be sent
somewhere else tomorrow.

278
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,393
Well, you want a ride home?

279
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,296
No, thanks,
my apartment's just
right over there.

280
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,501
Henry, why are you retiring?

281
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm finding myself
avoiding mirrors lately, so...

282
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,146
I'm gonna take that as a sign.

283
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,183
You watch your six out there.

284
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,484
You too.

285
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,420
Night, Toast.

286
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,191
[car alarm chirps]

287
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,896
[waves lapping]

288
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,365
[woman] You should come look
at the stars, Jack.

289
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,436
[thud]

290
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,523
Oh-- [grunts]

291
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,294
[groaning]

292
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,816
[boy grunting]

293
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,584
We have to work on your kick.
Charlie!

294
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,219
Concentrate, Henry.
Come on!

295
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,255
You're five now,
and this isn't hard.
[young Henry panting]

296
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,790
Now, try again.
[young Henry inhales sharply]

297
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,161
[Charlie, mother arguing,
indistinct]

298
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,436
[buzzing, distorted]

299
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,474
[cell phone buzzing]

300
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,152
[door opens, closes]

301
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,255
[Henry panting]

302
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,424
[cell phone beeping]

303
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,864
[line ringing]

304
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,908
Hi, this is Jack. I'm sailing.

305
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,446
[cell phone buzzing]

306
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,916
Please tell me this means
we're back in business.

307
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,751
[Henry]  Where are you?

308
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,687
Ah, just some goddamn
surveillance.
[Henry]  Get out of there, now.

309
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,456
Do not go home.
Do not go to your girl's house.

310
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,391
Go to the bus station.
Get a ticket in cash.

311
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,360
Shit.
Do not use an ATM.

312
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,128
Go somewhere where
nobody knows you.

313
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,197
[Marino]  You sure?

314
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,532
They're outside my window.

315
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm sorry, man.
I made you a loose end.

316
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,803
Come on, man. I'll be fine.
How do I get in contact
with you?

317
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,005
You don't.
Don't contact anybody.

318
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,540
Especially anybody from the DIA.

319
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,308
And get rid of your phone now.

320
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,978
Nah, come on, Henry, man. Stop--
[glass shatters]

321
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,680
Marino?

322
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,252
[breathes heavily]

323
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,728
[gunfire]
[man groans]

324
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,443
[breathes heavily]

325
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,178
[Henry] It's not gun time.

326
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,780
It's coffee time.

327
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,815
Do you have a burn bag?

328
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,584
First tell me
what you're doing here.

329
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,287
[Henry] Somebody just sent
a team to kill me.

330
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,555
And you're still asleep.

331
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,824
So that means you didn't
know about it, correct?

332
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,861
No, of course not.
I would've told you.
[coffeepot clatters]

333
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,033
That means you're next.

334
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,934
Get dressed.

335
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,940
All the boats have dupe keys
in the office, right?

336
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,076
Got a fast one?

337
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,454
Feeling the call of the sea?

338
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,793
Where is he?

339
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,861
You can tell me now--

340
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,296
[groans]

341
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,731
Hey! Drop-- [grunts]

342
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,867
Bitch!

343
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,003
You can tell me now,

344
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,238
or you can tell me in
five minutes minus your teeth.

345
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,773
But you're gonna tell me.

346
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,241
[groans]

347
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,811
[both grunting]

348
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,824
[gunshots]

349
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,159
[Danny] I counted three.
How many did you bring?

350
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,961
[grunting continues]

351
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,438
[straining]
[screams]

352
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,286
Who sent you? [panting]

353
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:12,624
You can tell me now,
or you can tell me in
five minutes minus your teeth.

354
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,798
[Henry] You good?

355
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,768
It's Lassiter.
How do you know?

356
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,039
[teeth clattering]
[sighs]

357
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,950
[Henry] If you get on this boat,
you're leaving behind

358
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,153
everything and everybody
you've ever known.

359
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,721
Do you understand that?

360
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,130
[breathing heavily]

361
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,434
[grunts, pants]

362
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,536
Scared is good.

363
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,671
It means you're alert.

364
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,706
Never had anybody
try to kill me before.

365
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,009
Yeah, well, the important thing
is he didn't.

366
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,014
What scares you?
Other than bees.

367
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,516
Drowning.

368
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,113
[Clay] So this is you
cleaning up your own messes.

369
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,548
Spare me the lecture.

370
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,217
It's like watching
the  Hindenburg

371
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,751
crash into thTitanic.

372
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,587
Tell me what we're going
to do about Henry.

373
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,189
Henry Brogan is like
any other soldier.

374
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,825
When they're young and stupid,
they believe anything
you tell them.

375
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,261
Then they get older.
They wear out.

376
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,830
Grow a conscience.

377
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,068
This is why we need
a new breed of soldier.

378
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,938
Gemini will handle this.

379
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,208
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.
I'm not asking your permission.

380
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,810
You want to go to your bosses?

381
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm sure they'd love to hear
about our little rogue project.

382
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,884
I'll make it look like
a Russian hit.

383
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,052
You give Henry a state funeral.

384
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,823
Flag on the coffin,
21-gun salute.

385
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,592
You give a nice speech.
Everyone cries.

386
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,561
He'll be remembered as a hero.

387
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,429
Life goes on.

388
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,365
Not for Henry.
Oh, come on.

389
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,735
Mutts like Henry were born
to be collateral damage.

390
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,470
Let's not pretend otherwise.

391
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,273
[Lassiter] Do you have
an asset in place?

392
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,608
[Clay] I have the perfect asset.

393
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,848
All right.
Just--

394
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,216
[muffled] All right, I'm good.

395
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,088
You hungry?

396
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,325
Yeah, I'm starving,
but those things expired
three years ago.

397
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,861
Really?

398
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,163
Still taste good.

399
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,968
While he still had teeth,
that guy said you were
the rogue.

400
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,137
And you believed him?

401
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,674
99% sure he was lying.

402
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,310
That 1% sucks, doesn't it?

403
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,318
Henry, has this ever happened
to you before?

404
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,752
Which part?

405
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,854
Your own government
trying to kill you.

406
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,224
Nah, that's new.

407
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,160
You've been Agency a while.

408
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,329
Can't you guess
what this is all about?

409
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,132
Trust me, if I could,
I would not be on this
lovely vacation with you.

410
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,169
Well...

411
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,738
when I'm head of the Agency,

412
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,740
we're gonna handle retirement
very differently.

413
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,808
[chuckles]

414
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,310
[airplane approaches]

415
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,394
My man.

416
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,367
[pilot laughs]

417
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,205
Baron Tours here to pick up
Brogan, party of two!

418
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,008
[laughs]

419
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,645
Good to see you, man.
You too.

420
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,813
Danny, meet the Baron.

421
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,350
Middle-aged reprobate
and best pilot I've ever known.

422
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,652
Danny, Baron.

423
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,186
Hey, Toast.

424
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,790
Got your burners, as requested.

425
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,726
For now, you can hole up
in my place in Cartagena.

426
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,228
You'd be anonymous and safe.

427
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,398
Uh, yeah, we're kinda
in the shit here, man.

428
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,034
I think Jack is dead.

429
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,271
Jesus.
Yeah.

430
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,207
Anyone follow you?
Nah.

431
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,076
They will. Let's go.

432
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,577
Can I have one of
those crackers?

433
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,246
Sure.
Thanks.

434
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,058
[man]  Does he do this at home?

435
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,226
I don't think so. I don't know.

436
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,594
Do you?
No.

437
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,496
[administrator]
If it's inappropriate
to do at home...

438
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,898
[cell phone buzzing]

439
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,299
...why would you think
it's appropriate to do it

440
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,667
in your science class?

441
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,103
I don't know. Probably because
science is so wicked boring.

442
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,606
[buzzing continues]

443
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,042
[students chattering]

444
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,444
Hello.

445
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,978
[Henry]  Guess you really
didn't want me to retire.

446
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,481
Henry, you're okay! Thank God!

447
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,582
Stop it.

448
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,484
Is Marino dead?

449
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,286
[Del]  Yes.

450
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,189
Jack Willis?

451
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,791
It wasn't me.
None of this was me, Henry.
I swear it.

452
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,159
I trusted you, Del.

453
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,362
You still can.
Let me call you on another line.

454
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,900
604-555-0131.

455
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,435
You got 30 seconds.

456
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,541
Um, hey, excuse me.

457
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,311
Could I borrow your phone
for five minutes if I give you,
like, a hundred bucks?

458
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,980
[cell phone beeps]

459
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,381
We'll start with
whose idea it was

460
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,751
to send a team to
Agent Zakarewski's apartment.

461
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,952
Was that necessary?

462
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,353
Also not my call.

463
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,355
She's working for
the inspector general, not me.

464
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,325
Is she with you?
Yes. Not voluntarily.

465
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,962
Okay, listen.
This is not something
I want to say over the phone.

466
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,097
I'm at my kid's goddamn school.

467
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,032
What the hell is all of this?

468
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,003
We have a problem.

469
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,372
Gemini.

470
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,609
Your old friend,
working with Janet Lassiter
and her people.

471
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,277
I can't stop them.

472
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,348
Okay. Dormov.

473
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,550
Did he have something
to do with Gemini?

474
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,788
Dormov, the guy that
you had me pop on the train

475
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,123
because you said
he was a Russian terrorist.

476
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,092
Was he working for Gemini?

477
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,728
Once upon a time.

478
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,232
So you got me pulling triggers
for Clay Verris.

479
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,836
Henry, I regret my lack
of candor, but listen--

480
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,038
How many other times
you do this to me, Del?

481
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,207
How many times you spike a file,

482
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,110
send me off to AMF somebody
who didn't deserve it?

483
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,012
Never ever. This was a one-off.

484
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,347
I swear on my son's life.

485
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,288
All right, look,
Agent Zakarewski
is not a part of this.

486
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,857
Henry, we can fix this, I swear.

487
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,526
But I need both of you
to come back.

488
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,929
To what, Del?

489
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,934
Okay. Gemini.

490
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,302
What do you know about it?

491
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,437
Privatized paramilitary
owned by Clay Verris.

492
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:43,141
Agency does a lot of business
with them. Is there more?

493
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,710
Baron and I served under Verris
in the marines.

494
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,079
Uh, Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

495
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,749
After he left the military,
he started Gemini
and tried to hire us.

496
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,218
We both told him no.

497
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,553
Except I was smart enough
to move 1,500 miles away.

498
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,988
Yeah.

499
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,423
I blew that one.

500
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,133
[chattering in Spanish]

501
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,275
[Henry]  Verris gets
billions of dollars a year

502
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,979
to take out targets
any way he sees fit.

503
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,747
That's Gemini.

504
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,150
Off-book kidnappings, tortures.

505
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,723
They're who you call when
you need 12 Saudi princes
to quietly disappear

506
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,026
or you want somebody
to train your death squads.

507
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,096
Six weeks into sniper school,

508
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:41,566
Clay Verris takes me out
on this boat about five miles.

509
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,302
Ties these weights to my ankles,
tosses me overboard,

510
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,138
tells me tread water
as long as I can.

511
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,874
And he didn't know about
your fear of--

512
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,976
Of course he did.
That was the point.

513
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,178
So what did you do?

514
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,252
I tread water
for as long as I could.

515
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,323
And then I drowned.

516
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,626
Dead.

517
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,132
He fished me out,
paddled my chest.

518
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,637
Told me I was now ready to serve
under his command.

519
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,510
[Baron] A toast.

520
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,617
To the next war,
which is no war.
...which is no war.

521
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,952
[Danny] No war.

522
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,553
[Henry] We'll figure it out
in the morning.

523
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,255
Right now we could use
some shut-eye.

524
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,891
Sure. Uh, you folks want
one room or--

525
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,192
Two.

526
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,396
Two. Two.

527
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,468
Well, yeah. I can put him
in the garage if you want.

528
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,303
[Henry] All right,
two rooms will be fine.

529
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,406
[Baron] Just giving you options.
Okay, right this way.

530
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,177
[male announcer

531
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,650
[scoffs, chuckles]

00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,391
[chirping stops]

534
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,450
Sniper. Rooftop.
I leave, he's gonna follow.

535
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,620
I need you to go with Baron
someplace safe. All right?

536
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,260
Shooter. On the roof.

537
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,830
You're a shitty houseguest,
you know that?

538
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,399
How the hell did they find us?

539
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,267
She's good. She's really good.

540
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,236
She just doesn't know
what she doesn't know.

541
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,138
Take care of her, all right?

542
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,706
All right.

543
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,595
[gunshots]

544
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,107

[gunshot]

547
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,844
[Henry] Stop right there!

548
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,714
Who are you?

549
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,417
I don't want to shoot you!

550
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,220
Fine.

551
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,322
Don't shoot me.

552
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,957
Mind if I shoot you?

553
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,228
I could've killed you
on the roof!

554
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,964
[assassin]
Maybe you should have.

555
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,468
Did they show you
a picture of me?

556
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,505
Yeah. You look old.

557
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,946
Kid, you take one step closer,

558
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,581
you're gonna leave me no choice.

559
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,438
[panting]

560
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,391

[man shouts in Spanish]

566
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,500

570
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,012

00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,746

[Henry] Out of the way!

582
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,585
Stop! Stop! Stop!

583
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,999
[siren wailing]

584
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,106

[policeman speaks Spanish]

587
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,755
Who the hell was that?

588
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,935
[keys jangling]
[footsteps approaching]

589
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,637
[door opens]

590
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,672
[guard] Brogan.

591
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,917
Thank you, sir.

592
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,919
Thank you, Captain.
No problem.

593
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,723
Your place is burned.
Get me somewhere
I can see him coming.

594
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,461
[Baron]  I wanted to go
in there guns blazing,

595
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,464
but she thought
the diplomatic approach
made more sense.

596
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,867
Yeah, gunfire
might've been kinder.

597
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,369
Great work in there.

598
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,637
[Baron] What now?

599
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,906
I need you to get me
to Budapest.

600
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,608
What's in Budapest?
What's in Budapest?

601
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,511
Jack's informant, Yuri.

602
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,748
Uh, these guys aren't
trying to kill me
because I want to retire.

603
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,919
They're coming after me
because they think Jack
told me something classified.

604
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,621
Yuri ought to know about it.

605
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:14,158
I'm sorry, partner,
my Aztec doesn't have
that kind of range.

606
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,927
Well, I was hoping we would
borrow something that does.

607
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,196
Maybe a G?

608
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,864
Whoa.

609
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,700
Taking someone's Gulfstream?

610
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,936
I mean, you'd really have to
love a guy to do that.

611
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,140
I know just the feller.
Give me a minute.

612
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,776
[Henry chuckles]

613
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,245
[man singing] âª  Well  âª

614
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,815
[Baron singing along
to Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman"]

615
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,950
âª  Way over town  âª

616
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,019
âª  That's good to me  âª

617
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,355
âª  Oh, yeah  âª

618
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,991
âª  I got a woman  âª

619
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,393
âª  Way over town  âª

620
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,129
âª  Good to me  âª

621
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,665
âª  Oh, yeah  âª

622
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,067
âª  She gives me money  âª

623
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,770
[singing continues, muffled]
[Henry inhales sharply]

624
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,676
[Danny] Henry?

625
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,244
Hmm?

626
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,912
Did you ever have a kid?

627
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,315
No. Why?

628
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,018
Guy on the motorcycle.

629
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,954
Did you notice anything
funny about him?

630
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,289
I noticed he was very good.

631
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,958
[Danny] Right.

632
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,027
And the face?

633
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,163
Similarity?

634
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,200
Yeah, I noticed that too.

635
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,301
[Danny] So...

636
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,371
You never had
a long-term relationship?

637
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:37,041
No. Not unless we count you.

638
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,179
Is it possible that
you could've had a kid
without knowing it?

639
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,247
[Henry] No.

640
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,915
Mm-mm.

641
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,117
Then how do you explain--
Danny.

642
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,188
All right?

643
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,262
[groaning]

644
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,934
Thank you, by the way.

645
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,336
For?

646
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,039
For leaving Baron's apartment
so I wouldn't be a target.

647
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,577
Coming to get me in Georgia
when you could've just
run for your life.

648
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,881
I just wanted to put you
on a private plane

649
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,250
and give you a free trip
to Hungary.

650
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,120
Where I'm gonna find...

651
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,189
Hungarians.

652
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,258
Right.

653
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,797
When I saw him...

654
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,501
it was like
I was seeing a ghost.

655
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,938
A ghost with a gun.

656
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,477
Like... every trigger
I've ever pulled.

657
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,815
[sighs]

658
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,461
[creaking]

659
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:16,774
[footsteps approaching]

660
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,879
I told you to stay in Colombia
and await orders.

661
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,016
I wanted to talk to you.

662
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,565
He's very good.

663
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,034
He's the best.

664
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,270
That's why I sent you.

665
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,910
He knew every move of mine
before I made it.

666
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:57,981
I'd have him, right there,
and I'd take the shot...

667
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,984
and he'd be gone.

668
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,221
Like a ghost.

669
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,057
Did you get a look at his face?

670
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,426
Not really.

671
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,763
I saw him up the stairs,
through a dirty mirror.

672
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,231
I thought you were on the roof.

673
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,167
I was. He got a line on me.
I had to jump down.

674
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,069
What do we always drill?

675
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,371
You hold the high ground.

676
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,341
You put his back
against the wall,
and you don't let him go.

677
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,144
I know that.

678
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,716
The whole thing was weird.

679
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,484
It was... wiggy.

680
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,253
How?

681
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:41,291
I don't know, it was as if
I were watching it all.

682
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:43,627
Who is he?

683
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,097
Junior, this thing
that you're struggling with,

684
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,067
this strangeness, it's fear.

685
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,336
Don't hate it.

686
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,271
Lean into it.

687
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,207
Embrace it and then overcome it.

688
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:01,245
You are right
on the threshold, son.

689
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,381
This close.

690
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,620
You hungry?

691
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,423
Um, yes, sir.

692
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,360
Bowl of cereal sound good?

693
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,328
[chuckles]

694
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:19,997
Yes, sir.

695
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,638
[footsteps departing]

696
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,048
[clamoring, shouting]

697
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:44,922
[soldier] Go!

That's it! Back up!

709
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,234
[instructor] Hurry up!
Everybody back to one.

710
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,036
[instructor 2]
Everybody back to one.

711

Back to one! Let's go!

00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,551
Lots of new faces.
Yep.

714
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,221
They'll be the first boots
on the ground in Yemen.

715
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,391
Do they understand
the rules of engagement,

716
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:57,627
or just, whatever moves,
they shoot it?

717
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,231
They're elite.
They're disciplined.

718
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,700
And if they get a clean shot
at their target

719
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,336
through an apartment window,
they'll take it.

720
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,108
You should think about that
on your way to Budapest.

721
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,711
Henry's just landed there.

722
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,215
You're moving out.

723

724
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,502
[Danny] Aniko?

725
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,172
Thank you for your time.

726
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,042
Here are the samples.

727
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:54,084
This I can do for you
in two days.

728
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,790
This I need in two hours.

729
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,729
We got a meeting with Yuri.

730
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,098
He agreed to sit with us.

731
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,267
You all right?

732
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,137
I think I know why
he's as good as you, Henry.

733
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,707
He is you.

734
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:20,844
What?

735
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:24,681
There's a DNA lab here.
I gave them samples.

736
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,818
Yours and the baseball cap
he was wearing.

737
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,587
He just--
He looked so much like you,

738
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,656
I thought he had to be
your son, so I...

739
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,626
They did three tests.

740
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,261
Your DNA and his.

741
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,198
All three came back identical.

742
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,733
Not close. Identical.

743
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,236
As in "the same person."

744
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,807
He's your clone.

745
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,012
They thought I'd made a mistake,
given them samples of
the same person,

746
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,414
but I didn't.

747
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,851
He is you.

748
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,319
How's that even possible?

749
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,588
It's complicated,
but it's doable.

750
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,257
All you'd really need
is a surrogate mother
and a DNA sample.

751
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,426
If they could clone a person,

752
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:13,163
you'd think they'd clone
more doctors or scientists,

753
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,132
not me.

754
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,600
They could've cloned
Nelson Mandela.

755
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,069
Nelson Mandela couldn't
kill a man on a moving train

756
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,737
from two kilometers away.

757
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,858
[Baron] Yuri.

758
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,560
[footsteps approaching]

759
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,363
Mr. Brogan.

760
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,376
[Yuri] Before we begin,
I must confess,

761
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:02,312
I have admired your work
for many years.

762
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,616
Wait. So you know who I am?

763
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,651
[Yuri laughs]

764
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,619
A longtime listener,
first-time caller,

765
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,521
as they say in your country.

766
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,660
I would congratulate you
on your retirement,

767
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,697
but your last job
has loose ends, yes?

768
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,433
Yeah, well,
my government lied to me
then tried to kill me,

769
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,734
if that's what you mean.

770
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:25,702
Yes.

771
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,672
In Russia,
we call that "Tuesday."

772
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,975
But Americans,
it hurts your feelings.

773
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,678
So...

774
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:37,080
So why was Dormov
trying to go back to Russia

775
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,615
and why was I sent to kill him?

776
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:42,152
Yes, down to business.
Ooh. Very American.

777
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,887
You are a busy man.

778
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,225
We were both friends with Jack.

779
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,793
He was a good man.

780
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,796
I'm mourning his death,
like you.

781
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,234
But the reason you are here
and I have not killed you...

782
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:58,902
yet...

783
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,871
is we share a common enemy.

784
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,940
Clay Verris.

785
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,411
He lured Dormov to the West,
funded his lab.

786
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,881
And now you have met
the fruits of their labor.

787
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,018
[Henry sighs]
Dolly the sheep
was cloned in '96.

788
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,587
But in '95--
I was the sheep.

789
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,489
Take it as a compliment.

790
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,691
And you are the only one.

791
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,895
With your DNA,
Verris raised the boy
as his own son,

792
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,932
trained him to be
the perfect assassin.

793
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,202
So why was Dormov
trying to leave?

794
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,304
For years,
we tried to lure him back.

795
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,572
Nothing.

796
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,841
Then last year,
they had a falling out.

797
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,210
Dormov got scared,
reached out to me.

798
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,711
So, I--

799
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,014
That still doesn't explain
why I was sent to kill him.

800
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,551
We have indications
Dormov made a breakthrough.

801
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,121
Modified human DNA.

802
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,822
A path to mass production.

803
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,993
But Dormov wanted soldiers
to be stronger, smarter.

804
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,461
Verris...

805
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,398
Verris wanted something else.

806
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,868
What something else?

807
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,636
Mr. Brogan,

808
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,972
you are the best at what you do.

809
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,376
But still you get tired.
You have fears, doubts.

810
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,945
You feel pain, perhaps remorse.

811
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,648
You have a conscience.

812
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,384
This makes you human,

813
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,054
but suboptimal as a soldier.

814
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,655
Less than perfect.

815
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,791
Less profitable.

816
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:34,064
Clayton Verris
is playing God with DNA.

817
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,866
He must be stopped.

818
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,071
If it's that dangerous,
why not send a missile?

819
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,073
Blow up his lab.

820
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,675
That is what we're doing.

821
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:50,013
Except you are the missile.

822
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:52,916
I wish you luck.

823
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,553
Oh. One last thing.

824
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,389
Your escape from home
two days ago?

825
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,392
[exhales] Amazing work.

826
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,627
I was on the edge of my seat.

827
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,564
Wait. What?

828
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,532
How the hell do you know
about that?

829
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,903
I'm a big fan.
What can I say?

830
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,344
[Danny]  If even half
of what he's saying is true,

831
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:22,812
we gotta talk to this kid.

832
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,848
You're not gonna be safe
until you do.

833
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,217
Oh, so you think if your
50-year-old self showed up

834
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,986
and told you you were her clone,
that would make you calmer?

835
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:30,920
Fifty-one.

836
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,456
What?
Just saying.

837
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,425
You know you're 51, Henry?

838
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,760
I'm rounding.
Right.

839
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:40,063
He's the mirror you don't
want to look into, Henry.

840
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,500
But he's our best shot
at getting to Verris.

841
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,506
[soft rock playing on speaker]

842
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,777
[cyclist] Janet Lassiter?

843
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,712
Who wants to know?

844
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,814
Got a message for you, ma'am,

845
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,382
from a man
who transferred $1,000

846
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,785
into my Feathercoin account
just to make sure you got it.

847
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,953
Does this person have a name?

848
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,056
His name is "$1,000
Into My Feathercoin Account."

849
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,827
"Hello, Janet.

850
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,129
Before you try to kill me again,
consider this:

851
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,566
Your home address
is 1362 Carrol Grove.

852
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,569
The security alarm code is 1776.

853
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,538
You awaken at 6:12 every morning

854
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:25,875
and stop for your
decaf soy latte
with an extra shot by 6:42.

855
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,611
Every night you stand
in front of your
huge living room window,

856
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,680
sipping a Jose Cuervo margarita,

857
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,816
with  Forensic Files  on the TV,

858
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:36,186
wearing your nice,
comfy sweatpants."

[cell phone rings]

860

[cell phone beeps]

861
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,192
This is Lassiter.

862
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,227
[Henry]  There are shooters
at your ten and two.

863
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,297
Get up off of that chair,
you will be AMF'ed.

864
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,266
Now, if I thought
the world needed another me,

865
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,601
I would've had a kid.

866
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,571
The program predates
my arrival at the Agency.

867
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,039
You must know that.

868
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,242
Yeah, perfect DC answer:
Something goes wrong, duck!

869
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,111
Tip the bike guy.

870
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,080
You can go.

871
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,384
Now, I have your agent with me
against her will.

872
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,753
Danielle Zakarewski.

873
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,255
She wants to come in.

874
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:14,190
Fine.

875
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,493
Like me, she is a patriot.

876
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:20,497
Unlike me,
she still wants to spend
the next couple decades

877
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,866
scoring touchdowns
for you assholes.

878
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,768
Her safety is nonnegotiable.

879
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,904
Ten and two, Janet.

880
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,106
[male barista] Decaf soy latte
with an extra shot for Janet.

881
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,008
The only person
I'll turn her over to

882
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,811
is the guy you sent after me
in Cartagena.

883
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,280
Don't even think
about sending anybody else.

884
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,049
Family reunion. Very sweet.

885
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,284
Yeah. Keep it up.

886
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,220
You'll be the first person
I ever killed for free.

887
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,723
How quickly can you
get him to Budapest?

888
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,692
Five minutes?

889
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,663
Good.

890
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,132
She'll be in the courtyard
of the Vajdahunyad Castle

891
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,667
at midnight tonight.

892
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,302
Enjoy your latte.

893
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,272
What's AMF?

894
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,907
"Adios, motherfucker."

895
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,743
How the hell does
he know we're here?

896
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,223
This is gonna work, right?

897
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,358
Yes.

898
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,260
How do you know?

899
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,196
I know his taste.

900
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,567
Wait, are you saying
you're attracted to me?

901
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,203
Me? Now? Hell, no.

902
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:38,074
But the younger,
less-mature version, maybe.

903
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,776
[chuckles]

904
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,417
When I came for you in Georgia,

905
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,253
I didn't have to
think about that.

906
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,088
It was instinct.

907
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,991
He was born with that too.

908
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,127
Besides, he wants me.

909
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,139
[door slams]

910
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,891
[man whistles]

911
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,065
[Junior] Right.

912
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,707
[Danny] Lovely courtyard.

913
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,543
I'm sorry, ma'am.

914
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,379
Before we go any farther,
I'm gonna need you to strip.

915
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:26,516
Beg your pardon?

916
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,752
Need to be certain
you're not wearing a wire.

917
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,457
Okay, first of all,

918
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,625
"ma'am"?

919
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,795
I was raised to
respect my elders.

920
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,863
[scoffs]

921
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,099
Take your clothes off, please.

922
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,916
[belt buckle jangling]

923
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,295
Turn around, please.

924
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,860
I see you like to be thorough.

925
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,096
Caution has kept me alive.

926
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,969
Call his burner.

927
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:59,075
[cell phone beeping]

928
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,812
[line ringing]
Thank you.

929
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,782
Brogan.

930
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,085
In 12 minutes,
I'm putting two bullets
in the back of her head.

931
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,521
Your orders are
to deliver her safely.

932
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,623
My orders are to kill you.

933
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,793
Are you familiar with
the Quartz Chamber
of the catacombs?

934
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:20,797
Negative. We're doing this
someplace visible,
where I can see you.

935
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,565
Now you have 11 minutes.

936
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,001
[cell phone beeps]

937
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,004
Get dressed.
We're taking a ride.

938
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,485
[Danny] Cab was a smart move.

939
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,121
Where are you from?

940
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,191
Your formality, it's Southern.

941
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,798
You know, if you're gonna use me
as bait and possibly murder me,

942
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,868
then the least you can do
is indulge me in
some conversation.

943
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,538
[Junior] Just outside Atlanta.

944
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,474
[Danny] You two have
a lot in common.

945
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,877
I doubt that.

946
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,412
[Danny] You'd be surprised.

947
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,049
You know,
I started following him too.

948
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,483
Just like you're doing.

949
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,853
Then I got to know him.

950
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,922
He's got a big heart, like you.

951
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,893
What do you know about my heart?

952
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,163
I know that you have one.

953
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,832
And I know that it's telling you

954
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,501
that something about the job
you've been given isn't right.

955
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,237
A job is a job, ma'am.

956
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,952
[Danny] I wonder how much
you paid the custodian.

957
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,321
Wow.

958
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,457
Left.

959
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:58,928
Undo the chain.

960
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,667
Basement.

961
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,903
You must really know the city.

962
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,704
[Junior]
I watch a lot of Nat Geo.

963
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,107
It says "Off-Limits."
Ma'am.

964
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,247
[Danny sighs] Ooh.

965
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,716
Wonder how many people
are buried down here.

966
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,218
[Junior] Stand over there.

967
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:52,949
[Junior] Go.

968
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,385
[Danny] If you knock out
all the lights,

969
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,754
how are you gonna see
your own trip wire
on the way out?

970
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,290
A grenade is no joke.
I mean, I get the idea.

971
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,059
Darkness neutralizes
his biggest strength,

972
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,827
and close quarters
favors you, right?

973
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,296
I mean, he can't throw a grenade
without killing me too.

974
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,231
But what if he tries gas?

975
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,534
You know?
Or some sort of sedative agent?

976
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,337
Way ahead of me.
Gas mask and night vision.
Very smart.

977
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,172
Over there.
And zip ties!

978
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:18,074
These must be for me.

979
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,709
But can I ask you something?

980
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,878
Would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer?

981
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,380
How much do you know about him?

982
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,415
Anybody tell you
why they wanted him dead?

983
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,683
Guy cracked.

984
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,052
Killed eight ops in
a single night and his spotter.

985
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,921
That's what they told you?
That's what he did.

986
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,723
No. No, not exactly.

987
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,659
I was there the night
all those operatives were hit.

988
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,762
They'd been sent to kill him,
and me, by Gemini.

989
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,398
And not that it matters,
but his spotter was shot
in Virginia,

990
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,700
and the rest of those men
went down in Savannah.

991
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,173
Henry can shoot long-distance,
but he can't shoot that long.

992
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,880
Come on. Just think.
Does that make any sense to you?

993
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,082
[tape rips]
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

994
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,384
It doesn't--

995
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,386
[Junior] Better.

996
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,820
Fuck you!

997
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,722
[explosion]

998
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,202
[clattering]
[grunting]

999
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,174
[panting]

1000
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,250
[Henry] Get up. Go.

1001
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,699
Stay right there.

1002
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,403
[pocketknife clicks]

1003
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,806
[tape rips]

1004
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,709
[sighs] Thank you.
Here.

1005
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,244
You know how to light
one of those?

1006
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,712
Oh, Jesus, Henry.

1007
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,489
Hey, thanks for the tip
on the grenade.

1008
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,725
You were talking to him
the whole time.

1009
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:50,793
[Henry] Yeah.

1010
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,596
You either search somebody
or you don't.

1011
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,866
And for the record...

1012
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,468
I do not want to kill you.

1013
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,471
But I absolutely will
if I have to.

1014
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:06,175
What did Clay Verris
tell you about me?

1015
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,346
Okay. Well,
let me tell you about him.

1016
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,549
Because I know Mr. Verris
very well.

1017
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,784
How'd he start you?

1018
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,786
Hunting birds? Rabbit?

1019
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:20,022
About 12 years old,
moved you up to deer?

1020
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,925
I'm guessing 19, 20 years old

1021
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,561
the first time he ordered you
to shoot a person.

1022
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,497
Any of this ringing true?

1023
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:30,766
Yeah.

1024
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:33,869
He told you to
"lean into your fear,"

1025
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:38,707
because you were "a warrior,
blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak."

1026
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,645
But he couldn't stop
the noise...

1027
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,381
that secret part of you
that always felt

1028
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,616
a little different
than everybody else.

1029
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,420
Part that felt like a weirdo.
[chuckles]

1030
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,688
You don't know shit.

1031
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,491
Kid, I know you inside out
and backwards.

1032
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,894
You're allergic to bees.
You hate cilantro.

1033
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,896
You always sneeze four times.

1034
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,966
Everybody hates cilantro.

1035
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:06,802
You're meticulous.

1036
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,538
Thorough. Disciplined.
Relentless.

1037
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,574
You love puzzles.

1038
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,411
You're a chess player. Right?

1039
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,479
Good, too, I bet.

1040
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,583
But you suffer from insomnia.

1041
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,585
Your mind never lets you sleep.

1042
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,787
And even when it does,
it attacks you with nightmares.

1043
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,356
I'm talking 'bout those
three-o'clock-in-the-morning,

1044
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:30,759
somebody-please-save-me
kind of nightmares.

1045
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,862
And then there's the doubts,
and those are the worst.

1046
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,599
You hate 'em,
and you hate yourself
for having 'em.

1047
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,367
They make you feel weak.

1048
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,003
A real soldier
doesn't doubt, right?

1049
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:46,008
The only time you ever
truly feel happy

1050
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,645
is when you're flat
on your belly
about to squeeze a trigger.

1051
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:53,849
And in that moment,
the world makes perfect sense.

1052
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,453
How do you think
I know all of that?

1053
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,822
I don't give a shit
how you know anything.

1054
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,291
Look at me, dummy!

1055
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,493
Look at us!

1056
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:09,198
Twenty-five years ago,
your father took my blood
and he cloned me.

1057
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,167
He made you from me.

1058
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,570
Our DNA is identical.

1059
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,305
He's telling you the truth.

1060
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:18,007
Shut up.

1061
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,942
[Henry] He chose me
'cause there's never been
anybody like me,

1062
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:23,412
and he knew one day
I was gonna get old
and then you'd step in.

1063
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,714
He's been lying to you
the whole time.

1064
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,716
He told you you were an orphan.

1065
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,419
And of all the people
in the world
to come after me,

1066
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,587
why would he send you?

1067
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,322
Because I'm the best.

1068
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,825
You are obviously not the best.

1069
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:41,430
[scoffs]
You got a hard-ass head.

1070
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:46,368
Guess this was supposed to be
your birthday or something.

1071
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,171
I had to die,
and you had to do it.

1072
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,572
As long as I was alive,

1073
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,842
somehow Clay's little experiment
was incomplete.

1074
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,545
That's the maniac
you're pulling a trigger for.

1075
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,714
Shut your mouth about him.

1076
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,182
You're just trying to rattle me.

1077
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,984
I'm trying to save you!

1078
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:06,355
[sighs] What are you, 23?

1079
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,490
Still a virgin, right?

1080
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,459
Yeah.

1081
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,828
Dying to be in a relationship
and connect,

1082
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,731
but terrified to
let anybody near you.

1083
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:21,503
Because what if somebody
actually saw who you are?

1084
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,639
How could they love you?

1085
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,742
So everybody's just targets,

1086
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,011
and you're just a weapon.

1087
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,048
Hey. Hey!

1088
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:38,420
[grunting]

1089
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:42,057
[groans]

1090
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,398
[both grunting]

1091
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:00,109
[grunting continues]

1092
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,410
[Danny] Hey!

1093
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:03,379
[groans]

1094
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,415
[panting]

1095
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:10,052
[both grunting]

1096
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:19,395
[Junior shouts]
[Henry groans]

1097
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,863
[Henry] Don't shoot him!

1098
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,103
[grunting continues]

1099
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,848
[Henry] Don't shoot him!

1100
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,065
[grunts]

1101
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,068
[groaning]

1102
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,011
[shouting]
[grunts]

1103
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,727
[groans]

1104
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,336
[Danny] Don't! No!
[groaning]

1105
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,604
[Danny] Drop it!

1106
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,706
Drop it! I will shoot you!

1107
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,142
[grunting]
No, you won't!

1108
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:46,048
[groans]
[panting]

1109
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,988
[both shout]

1110
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,049
Get your hands off of him!

1111
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,986
Let him go!

1112
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:27,556
Right now!

1113
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,092
[groans, pants]

1114
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,261
[grunting]

1115
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,563
[gasps]

1116
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,932
I'm not you!

1117
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,668
You hear me, old man?

1118
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,638
I'm not you!

1119
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,543
Where is he?
[panting] He's gone.

1120
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,811
Did you hit him?
I think so, yeah.

1121
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,714
[groans] Where?
Shoulder, I think.

1122
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,685
Then he'll recover.

1123
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,321
Is that a good thing?

1124
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,990
[both panting]

1125
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,507
[groans]

1126
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,142
You know, it's not
every day you see

1127
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:23,111
a guy get his ass kicked
on two continents

1128
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,746
by himself.

1129
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,350
[groans]

1130
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,055
Where to?

1131
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,257
Georgia.

1132
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,659
It's where Verris is.

1133
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,141
[Henry sighs] Man.

1134
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,244
That poor kid.

1135
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,947
He must be terrified.

1136
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:03,218
And he's going home,
walking into a buzz saw.

1137
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,392
I need to get some sleep.

1138
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,194
You too.

1139
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:16,131
Mm-mm. Not me.
That's where the ghosts are.

1140
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,667
Sleep.

1141
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,122
[door lock clicks]

1142
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:45,293
[Clay] Tell me something.

1143
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:49,264
Why is it so hard for you
to kill this man?

1144
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:56,071
You know how much I hate
Big Hammock Park, Pop?

1145
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:58,907
What?

1146
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,611
Ever since I was about
12 years old...

1147
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:07,449
we would shoot turkeys there
for my birthday.

1148
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,253
And I always hated it.

1149
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,222
But I was an orphan, right?

1150
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,893
So, how would we even know
when my birthday was?

1151
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:23,065
But you never seemed to notice,
so we just keep going.

1152
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:26,802
Okay, so, next year
we'll try Chuck E. Cheese.

1153
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,705
Yeah.

1154
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,907
You, me,

1155
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:35,010
and the lab guys who made me.

1156
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,481
Oh.

1157
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,018
Yeah.

1158
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,123
I, um...

1159
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,060
always believed...

1160
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,865
you'd be happier not knowing.

1161
01:18:57,799 --> 01:18:59,334
[Junior scoffs]

1162
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,736
Happy.

1163
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,172
You know when I'm happy, Pop?

1164
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,342
When I'm flat on my belly,

1165
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,078
about to squeeze a trigger.

1166
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,149
It's the only time I'm happy.

1167
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,453
And this wasn't even a mistake.

1168
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,923
It's not like
you got someone pregnant

1169
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:25,494
and then had to man up
and raise me.

1170
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:29,264
No, you made a decision

1171
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:33,602
to have a scientist make
a person out of another person.

1172
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,936
No, that's not what it was.

1173
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,072
That's exactly what it was.

1174
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,075
Then you sent me...

1175
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,344
to kill him.

1176
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,112
Of all the shooters
in the world,

1177
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,781
why would you send me?

1178
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,451
He's your darkness.
You had to walk through this
on your own.

1179
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,355
Maybe you're my darkness.

1180
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,160
That lie you told me...

1181
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,496
that my parents...

1182
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,934
dumped me at a fire station.

1183
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,437
And I believed that.

1184
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,041
Do you know how
that made me feel?

1185
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,110
It was a necessary lie.

1186
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,446
None of this shit is necessary!

1187
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:20,882
You made a choice
to do this to me.

1188
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:23,852
Can't you see how not okay I am?

1189
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,420
Bullshit!

1190
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,023
You forget who
you're talking to, Junior.

1191
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,925
I've seen battle.

1192
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,560
I've seen soldiers
go over the edge

1193
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,695
because more was being
asked of them
than they could give.

1194
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,197
That's not you.

1195
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,799
Your world is stable
and dependable.

1196
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,201
I made sure of that.

1197
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,937
You have something
that Henry himself never had.

1198
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:45,974
You have a loving, dedicated,
present father,

1199
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:47,409
who tells you every goddamn day

1200
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,811
that you are precious
and that you matter.

1201
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,780
Jesus, the whole point
of this thing

1202
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,515
was to give you
all of Henry's gifts

1203
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,051
without his pain, and I did.

1204
01:20:56,751 --> 01:21:00,355
Don't doubt, Junior.

1205
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,159
You're better than that.

1206
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,496
[whimpering]

1207
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,071
Come here.

1208
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,041
[Clay sighs]

1209
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,378
I love you, son.

1210
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,217
Just don't let yourself down.

1211
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,488
[sobbing, clears throat]

1212
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,907
[thuds]

1213
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:54,910
[Henry sighs]

1214
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,881
[Baron] Like so many
of my encounters,

1215
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,850
it was short but sweet.
[kisses]

1216
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,385
Thanks, baby.

1217
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,633
[Baron] There should be
a truck here somewhere.

1218
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,571
[gunshot]
[Henry groans]

1219
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:29,144
[Junior] Don't move.

1220
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,314
[Henry panting]

1221
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,984
[Henry gasps]
What was in that?

1222
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,519
Bee venom.

1223
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,323
[gasping]

1224
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,591
No. No, you can't do that.

1225
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,094
You can't do that.
He's allergic!

1226
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,363
[Baron] Henry, can you breathe?
[gasping continues]

1227
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,131
[Baron] Henry, try to breathe.

1228
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,033
You okay?
Please.

1229
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,569
[Baron] Henry.
Henry, can you breathe?

1230
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,837
[Danny] Please!

1231
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,139
[Baron] Try to breathe.
Henry! Henry!
[gasping]

1232
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,542
[Baron] Breathe!

1233
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,978
[Danny] Why are you doing this?
[Baron] Come on, Henry.

1234
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,583
[Danny] Why are you doing this?
[Baron] Henry.
Henry, breathe. Come on!

1235
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:10,885
Hey, hey.

1236
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:12,487
Breathe, Henry.

1237
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,200
Epinephrine antihistamine.

1238
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,804
[Henry groans]
[Junior] You'll be fine.

1239
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:32,340
[coughs, gasps]

1240
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,076
I'm sorry.

1241
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:37,178
I had to be sure.

1242
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,214
No, it's all good.

1243
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,250
This whole shit's been
a little difficult.

1244
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,252
[Baron] I hate to break up
the party,

1245
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,755
but how the hell do you
always know where we are?

1246
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,525
[Junior] They're tracking you.

1247
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,230
Do you trust me?

1248
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:22,390
They chipped you...
during your surgery
three years ago.

1249
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,263
Verris.

1250
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,366
[Junior] You know him too?

1251
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,602
Panama. Kuwait. Somalia.

1252
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:36,838
Can you take us to him?

1253
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,142
We need to shut him down.

1254
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:42,777
Both of us.

1255
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,591
You grew up in Philadelphia,
right?

1256
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,294
Yep. Place called "The Bottom."

1257
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,729
The Bottom.

1258
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,233
Tell me about my mother.

1259
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,971
Helen Jackson Brogan.

1260
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,407
Worked two jobs for 40 years.

1261
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:15,143
That woman used to whup my ass.

1262
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,813
Did you deserve it?
Usually.

1263
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,748
Does being angry and stupid

1264
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:24,252
and never really
trying at anything
mean you deserve it?

1265
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,790
Our father wasn't around much.
He left when I was five.

1266
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,660
And I think every time
she looked at me,
she just saw him, so...

1267
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,797
I had to get the hell
out of there.

1268
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,799
Joined the corps.

1269
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,969
First time I ever made
any real friends.

1270
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,304
[Baron] Oorah.
[Henry chuckles]

1271
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,807
Met Clay Verris there.

1272
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,777
Found something
I was really, really good at.

1273
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,781
Time I left,
I had medals on my chest,

1274
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:58,153
she was gone, and...
I had become this.

1275
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:03,625
You gotta walk away
while you still can.

1276
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:07,896
This is all I know.
No, this is all he taught you.

1277
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:12,233
Stop now, you can still
become something else.

1278
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:15,069
Sure.

1279
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:18,306
A doctor? Lawyer?

1280
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,909
Husband. Father.

1281
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:24,812
All the things
this job gives you
the excuse not to be.

1282
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,216
I threw all of that away.

1283
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,954
It'd be a shame to
waste these gifts
a second time around.

1284
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,627
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1285
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:43,398
It's always been Junior.

1286
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,466
Clay Junior.

1287
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,803
I don't really know anymore.

1288
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:52,373
That's another
really good reason to quit.

1289
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,348
[Junior] You sure about this?

1290
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:02,784
[Henry] I need to talk to him.

1291
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,288
So, what happens
when we get to him?

1292
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,457
He's not gonna surrender.

1293
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:12,961
[brakes squeal]

1294
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,497
[device beeping]

1295
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,067
It's him.

1296
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,535
[Baron] Can I talk to him?

1297
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,937
I want to be the one to tell him
we're all BFFs now.

1298
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:25,640
[beeping continues]
Take it.

1299
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:28,443
This is Junior.

1300
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:30,211
[ClayAre you with Brogan?

1301
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:32,647
Why would I be with him?
You sent me to kill him,
didn't you?

1302
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,649
Doesn't matter. Just run.

1303
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:37,552
What?

1304
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,988
Run. Get away from him, now.

1305
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,290
Junior, I just want you safe.

1306
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,491
[Junior] Why?

1307
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,493
Because I'm your
favorite experiment?

1308
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:49,030
No, because I'm your father
and you need to listen to me.

1309
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,398
Run!

1310
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,202
[Junior] Get out of the car!
[Henry] Go, go!

1311
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:55,770
[missile incoming]

1312
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,010
Baron! [pants]

1313
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:02,977
No!

1314
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:15,290
[vehicle approaching]

1315
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,058
[Danny] Come on!

1316
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,028
[both panting, grunting]

1317
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,968
I'm sorry, Henry.

1318
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,805
[grunts]
[brakes squeal]

1319
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:34,509
[soldier] Move out. Go! Go!

1320
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,377
[Clay] Chief Mitchell?
Go ahead.

1321
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:38,346
Clay Verris.
I need your units to stand down.

1322
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,114
[sirens approaching]
Sir?

1323
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:41,683
We're engaging
with a terror cell

1324
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:44,619
that has a weaponized
biological capability.

1325
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,988
All units,
fall back immediately.

1326
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:51,993
Federal authorities have been
notified and are en route.

1327
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,462
Affirmative.
Keep me posted, Clay.

1328
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:55,530
[Clay] Yes, sir.

1329
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,065
[metal clangs]

1330
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:59,934
You gotta stand
your men down now.

1331
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:02,804
You did the right thing, Junior,
walking away from him.

1332
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,173
I did what a coward would do.

1333
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,674
Makes me sick!

1334
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:08,843
I was asking too much of you.

1335
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:10,845
I can see that now.

1336
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:14,415
He deserves better
than a missile shot
into his car, Pop.

1337
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,317
It doesn't matter
what he deserves.

1338
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:18,019
He has to die.

1339
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,726
Are you gonna call
those goons off now?

1340
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,062
No. But you can.
[indistinct radio chatter]

1341
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,931
Just fire that. Take command.
[soldiers shouting]

1342
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:05,933
[Henry]
Armor is weak at the joints.

1343
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:08,236
Eyes and neck
are the kill shots.

1344
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,804
Take right, I take left.

1345
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:17,745
Muzzle discipline.

1346
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,515
Watch your round count.
You set, I spike.

1347
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,150
Ready?
Roger that.

1348
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,125
[gunfire continues]
[soldiers shouting]

1349
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,035
[Danny] I'm out.
[Henry] Take cover.

1350
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,445
Set!

1351
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,224
Frag out!

1352
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,563
[Junior grunts]
[soldiers continue shouting]

1353
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:14,702
[groans, gasps]

1354
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:17,839
[grunts]

1355
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:25,680
I am trying to make you a man!

1356
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,784
I should've cloned myself.

1357
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,690
[gunshot]
[Danny groans]

1358
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:40,895
"Loving, dedicated,
present father."

1359
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,131
[soldier] Right side!

1360
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:50,905
Go ahead.

1361
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:53,207
Do it.

1362
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,918
[panting, gasping]

1363
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,753
How many rounds you got left?

1364
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,258
One.

1365
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:12,159
Okay.

1366
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:22,436
I'm sorry.

1367
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,171
For what?

1368
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:25,673
For getting you into this.

1369
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:27,375
I was the one surveilling you.

1370
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,709
Yeah.

1371
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,746
Anyway, sorry.

1372
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,816
Now let's fight our way
out of this thing.
[panting]

1373
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,687
[metal clanking]

1374
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:43,858
[door opens]

1375
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:10,117
[breathing heavily]

1376
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,587
You're a great partner.

1377
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,223
[laughs]

1378
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,631
[gunshot]
[body thuds]

1379
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:43,184
[Henry] Thank you.

1380
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:45,086
Sorry I ran.

1381
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,221
Yeah, well,
it's been a rough night.

1382
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,589
How many more out there?

1383
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:50,324
I didn't see any.

1384
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:51,959
Verris?

1385
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,861
Out of commission.

1386
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,963
But still alive?

1387
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,001
Yes.

1388
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:03,304
[footsteps]

1389
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,865
Here.

1390
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,366
[Junior] How bad is that?

1391
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,701
I'm fine.

1392
01:34:35,136 --> 01:34:36,303
You're not.

1393
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:40,207
Hold the elevated position.
We're gonna secure an out.

1394
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:41,342
[glass shatters]

1395
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,867
[grunting, groans]

1396
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:48,909
[shouts]

1397
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,780
Back off!

1398
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:07,862
[gunshot]

1399
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,306
[gunshot]

1400
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,943
[gunshot]
[reloads]

1401
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,517
[Henry breathing heavily]

1402
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:52,473
[breathing raggedly]

1403
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,593
[ragged breathing continues]

1404
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,835
Don't you feel pain?

1405
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,325
[exhales]

1406
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:55,035
I don't know
why you're so angry, Henry.

1407
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:08,215
You were the inspiration
for all of this.

1408
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,556
[bangs, clatters]

1409
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,630
You know where I got the idea?
Are you okay?

1410
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,201
Khafji.

1411
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:30,037
Watching you go house to house,

1412
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,039
wishing I had
a whole division of men

1413
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:33,974
all as good as you.

1414
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,310
Wondering if that
could be possible.

1415
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:38,545
You should be flattered.

1416
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:40,080
[chuckles]

1417
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:42,983
You should be dead.

1418
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,119
[Clay] You saw
what happened over there.

1419
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:47,655
Atrocities.

1420
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,792
Friends being sent home
in a pine box.

1421
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:55,629
Why should we accept that
if there's a better way?

1422
01:38:58,799 --> 01:39:01,235
And look what we created.

1423
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,542
He's got both of us in him.

1424
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:14,448
Don't you think
your country deserves
a perfect version of you?

1425
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:17,151
There is no
perfect version of me.

1426
01:39:17,918 --> 01:39:20,087
Or him. Or anybody.

1427
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:21,422
[Clay] No?

1428
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:23,490
He was on his way to Yemen.

1429
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,592
Now, thanks to you,
his place is gonna be taken

1430
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,227
by someone with parents.

1431
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:30,297
Someone who feels pain, fear,

1432
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,299
which we had edited out of him.

1433
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:35,002
Someone with
just as many weaknesses

1434
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:36,570
as the terrorists
that we're trying to kill.

1435
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:38,439
And you're gonna tell me
that's better?

1436
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,409
So why not make
a whole army of them?

1437
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:43,844
Yeah. Why not?

1438
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:47,448
Think how many American families
we could spare.

1439
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:50,150
Nobody's son or daughter
would ever have to die.

1440
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:53,954
No vet comes home with PTSD
and kills himself.

1441
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:58,258
We can keep the whole world safe
without any actual grief.

1442
01:39:58,258 --> 01:40:00,995
So... who would I be hurting?

1443
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:04,164
You're talking about
people, Clay.

1444
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,867
Henry.

1445
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:09,903
This is the most humane thing
that Gemini's ever done.

1446
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,374
How many more of me
are running around out there?

1447
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:16,777
There's only one you, Junior.

1448
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,147
He was a weapon.

1449
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,383
You're my son.

1450
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:26,120
And I love you...

1451
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:30,557
as much as any father
ever loved any kid.

1452
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:36,730
I don't have a father.

1453
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:39,666
Goodbye, Clay.

1454
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,201
[Henry] Hey, hey.

1455
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,104
Uh-uh.

1456
01:40:48,675 --> 01:40:51,211
So what the hell
are we gonna do, huh?

1457
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:54,448
Gonna turn him in?
They're not gonna try him.

1458
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,283
They're not gonna
shut down his lab.

1459
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:58,752
We have to end this right now.

1460
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,054
[Henry] Hey.

1461
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:02,489
Look at me.

1462
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,592
Look at me.

1463
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:08,495
You pull that trigger,

1464
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:11,465
and you're gonna break something
inside of yourself...

1465
01:41:12,866 --> 01:41:15,202
that'll never get fixed again.

1466
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:25,079
Don't.

1467
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,552
Let it go.

1468
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:33,854
Give it to me.

1469
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:41,562
You don't want those ghosts.

1470
01:41:42,196 --> 01:41:43,697
Trust me.

1471
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:17,831
[soft rock playing on speaker]

1472
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:25,539
[Henry] You should
know better than that.

1473
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,675
Surprised you give a shit.

1474
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:32,312
Well,
we can't be friends anymore.

1475
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:35,716
Because you did let them
try to kill me.

1476
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:38,785
But doesn't mean I want to see
you drink yourself to death.

1477
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:43,423
The Gemini lab's
been dismantled.

1478
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:45,792
Cloning program is history.

1479
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,263
And Junior?

1480
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:50,998
[Del] He's untouchable.

1481
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,700
No one will bother him, ever.

1482
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:57,704
And we checked--
There are no more clones.

1483
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:00,174
What about you?

1484
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:02,409
[Del] IG called.

1485
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:03,777
I'm looking at charges,

1486
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:07,481
but if I bury Janet,
I can make a deal.

1487
01:43:08,015 --> 01:43:09,850
Well, she earned it.

1488
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,923
I'm really sorry, Henry.

1489
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,328
Take care, Del.

1490
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,663
Yeah, you too.

1491
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:24,932
And happy retirement.

1492
01:43:33,006 --> 01:43:34,741
[door closes]

1493
01:43:37,244 --> 01:43:39,379
[opens can]

1494
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,396
[Danny] Hey.

1495
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:01,468
Hey.

1496
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:04,538
Good to see you.

1497
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:06,540
Uh, congrats on the promotion.

1498
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,908
I hear they got big plans.

1499
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:10,978
Well, after you, pretty sure
I can handle anything.

1500
01:44:10,978 --> 01:44:12,145
[both laugh]

1501
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:14,114
How have you been?
Good.

1502
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:16,617
I just, uh,
settled Baron's estate,

1503
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,885
scattered his ashes
in the Caribbean.

1504
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,922
I don't know.
All I want to do now is

1505
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,590
put some good in the world.

1506
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,492
I just got to figure out how.

1507
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,061
Yeah, you will.
Mm-hmm.

1508
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:29,830
You, uh, sleeping okay?

1509
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:31,331
Ah, better.

1510
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:34,167
No ghosts?
Not like before.

1511
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:36,803
Oh, and I actually
looked in a mirror
the other day.

1512
01:44:36,803 --> 01:44:39,506
Really?
It wasn't horrendous.

1513
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,074
[chuckles]

1514
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,709
Speaking of mirrors...

1515
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:46,780
[speaking indistinctly]

1516
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:57,858
[Junior] Catch you later.
[male student]
See you later, man.

1517
01:44:57,858 --> 01:44:58,959
Hey.

1518
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,635
[laughs]

1519
01:45:11,738 --> 01:45:12,806
What's this?

1520
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,641
This is you.

1521
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:18,278
Passport, birth certificate,
driver's license.

1522
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:20,247
Apparently you got
pretty good credit.

1523
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:21,515
[Junior chuckles]

1524
01:45:21,515 --> 01:45:23,450
I love the name you chose.

1525
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:25,686
Jackson?
It was my mother's name.

1526
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:28,121
Hey, she was my mother first.

1527
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:29,589
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

1528
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:31,892
Don't you "yeah, yeah" me,
young man.

1529
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:35,362
Come on.
I know a great place for lunch.

1530
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:40,734
So you settled on a major yet?

1531
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:42,636
Oh, leaning towards engineering.

1532
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:44,504
Engineering?
Uh...

1533
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:46,373
Yeah, you should listen to her.

1534
01:45:46,373 --> 01:45:48,108
Uh, if I were you,

1535
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:50,110
which I sort of am,

1536
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,678
I'd go with computer science.

1537
01:45:51,678 --> 01:45:53,980
Save that for grad school.
You want to start in humanities.

1538
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,882
Okay, don't listen to her.
Don't listen to him.

1539
01:45:55,882 --> 01:45:57,617
You need a grounding
in the classics.

1540
01:45:57,617 --> 01:45:59,519
Look, excuse me,
I'm trying to talk
with myself here.

1541
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:01,822
Yeah.
You're talking to yourself,
but you're not talking to him.

1542
01:46:01,822 --> 01:46:04,291
Look, I just made a lot of
mistakes when I was young--

1543
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,294
And I'd actually like to make
some of those mistakes myself.

1544
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:10,163
What I'm trying to say is,
I made them already
so you don't have to.

1545
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:11,365
Yeah, but he's not you.

1546
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:14,968
Okay. Everybody,
chill the hell out.

1547
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:18,038
I'm gonna be okay.

1548
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:24,444
If you're okay...

1549
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:27,013
I'm okay.

1550
01:46:29,282 --> 01:46:31,017
[chuckles]
What?

1551
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:34,521
I just can't believe
that in 30 years,

1552
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:36,390
I'm gonna look like you.

1553
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:40,127
What? Please. You wish.
[Junior chuckles]

1554
01:46:40,127 --> 01:46:43,463
Boy, you better hope
you look like me in 30 years.

1555
01:46:44,364 --> 01:46:46,600
This is 50-year-old,

1556
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,336
mature man meat
you're looking at.

1557
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:50,537
[laughs]

1558
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:51,772
[Danny] Fifty-one.

1559
01:46:51,772 --> 01:46:55,275
[Henry] I brush. I floss.
I work hard.

1560
01:46:55,275 --> 01:46:57,844
When you're 50,
I bet you won't be
dragging your ass

1561
01:46:57,844 --> 01:47:00,480
around the track
every morning like I do.

1562
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:03,750
In fact, we can race now.

1563
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:06,953
We can race right now.
We'll take it to
the corner right now.

1564
