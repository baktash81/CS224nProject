going to get angry. Do you see?

Lord of the Flies.

"Do you think you know
better than I do?"

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,601
Okay, so we have civilization
versus savagery,

10
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:40,803
and reason versus impulse.

11
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,808
So many exciting themes
in one little book, right?

12
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,713
Over the break, I want you to
read the next three chapters.

13
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,716
That's three chapters, and
I want you to write two pages...

14
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,250
on either one of our themes,
your choice.

Demerius.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,923
Care to read us out to the bell?

17
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,690
No, no, no, not that one.

18
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:03,793
The one that you have on your
lap there. What is it?

19
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:06,630
Uh... Demon Sword Z.

21
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:12,103
Okay, let's hear it. Oh, come
on. Let's finish class strong.

This is 26% stronger than
anything else on the market.

28
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,823
It lasts up to four hours.

29
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,892
Not only are the lips fuller...

30
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,860
they're the most fantastic
color.

31
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:41,031
Slight tingle at first,
but it's so worth it.

32
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,999
Better than collagen.

33
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,434
Where is this from?

34
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:49,104
The Orient... a lot of the
formulas are secret.

35
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,373
I own the North American rights.

36
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,041
Oh, that's lovely.

37
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,311
And this would be an exclusive
for Harold's.

38
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,781
Hm.

39
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,817
That's really starting to work.

40
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,085
What kind of comic is this?

41
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,086
It's not a comic, it's manga.

42
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:06,255
"Put your demon powers in me,

its dicks.

Mr. Moss. Hello.

49
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,768
We found some surprising
thematic similarities...

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,137
between Lord of the Flies...

52
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,344
Okay, all right.
You owe me two pages.

53
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,780
Have a really good break.

54
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,148
Where is this from?

55
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,149
Asia.

56
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:38,223
D-P-R-K... isn't that
North Korea?

57
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:44,761
You're trying to sell Harold's
a North Korean product?

58
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:45,762
Maybe.

59
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,329
The North Korea against which...

60
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:50,333
the United States has
an embargo?

61
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,369
Now, that embargo is kind
of like Cuba, you know?

62
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,205
It's sort of symbolic.

63
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,808
20 years, Kate. Seen it all.

64
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,076
Right.

65
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,113
Well, maybe not sex
with an octopus.

66
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,981
That was a first.

67
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,782
That was mine, too.

68
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:07,750
Please.

(CLEARS THROAT)

70
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,254
I wanted your help to strategize
a big picture issue...

71
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,288
because I see something
we both share.

72
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,524
A deep love for this school.

73
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:17,994
Go Falcons.

74
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:20,196
I wanna do a little
right-brained thinking...

75
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,930
about a left-brain problem.

76
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:23,866
Are we talking about the ARB
test scores?

77
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,102
I'm talking about empowerment.

78
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:29,272
I'm saying let's be the change.

79
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:35,011
Let's not squander our energy
on acrimony and recriminations.

80
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:38,180
Um... are you firing me?

81
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:39,281
What?

82
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,949
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,985
I'm trying to ground floor
the discussions...

84
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,120
so we don't waste our school's
resources on arbitration...

85
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,422
and severance packages.

86
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:49,191
Those things threaten the school
that we love.

87
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,994
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

88
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,363
Sometimes a school can avoid
all that heartache...

89
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,566
if a teacher simply vacates
his or her post.

90
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,434
You want me to quit?

91
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,304
No. That's a personal decision.
What I want doesn't matter.

92
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,273
But I will say this...

93
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:08,077
I see you flourishing in a
slightly less urban teaching...

94
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,215
environment or perhaps in an
altogether different...

95
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,185
Can I admit something?

96
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:18,124
You always have great hair.

97
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,324
Perhaps you'd be happy
cutting hair.

98
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,293
Look, I took this meeting...

99
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,361
because Lucas spoke
highly of you.

100
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,197
He better have.

101
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,533
But I don't think this
is a good fit for Harold's.

102
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,834
Best of luck.

103
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:34,070
Seriously? That's it?

104
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,339
Just because of where
a product's made?

105
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,942
A bit racist, don't you think?

106
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:41,077
Okay, we're done.

107
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,111
No, you're done.

108
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:46,315
Because I'll take my business
elsewhere.

109
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:47,550
Where's the bathroom?

110
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,188
Uh, there.

111
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,793
Oh my god. Oh...

112
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:03,301

00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:33,228
What is happening?
Did you sell it?

121
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,567
Party bump!

122
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,303
Meg, did you sell it?

123
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,305
Can we finally get rid of all
these boxes?

124
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,507
Remember all those little
North Korea stickers...

125
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,209
we peeled off the bottles?

126
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,610
Yeah, of course. There were,
like, 10,000 of them.

127
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:53,382
Well, it turns out
there's 10,001.

128
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:55,685
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

129
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:59,187
I am totally and thoroughly
fucked.

130
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,457
On the other hand my car
got towed.

How was your day?

132
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,694
Meg, it's...

133
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,329
I can't.

134
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,500
I don't even wanna talk
about it.

135
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:15,271
Wow, how much did you spend?

136
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:17,072
Oh, I'm gonna-I'm gonna
bring it back.

137
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,942
But I'm gonna keep some socks.

138
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,176
How was school?

139
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,947
Great.

140
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,716

What?

He thinks that I'd be happier
cutting hair.

143
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,656
Did you point out that
he's bald as fuck?

145
00:06:35,293 --> 00:06:37,360
No, I didn't tell him
he was bald as fuck.

Are you getting fired?

00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,163
Excuse me.

148

I gotta get going.

149
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,666
Okay.

150
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,168
Can I get my clothes?

151
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,670
Oh, right.

- Pants, pink underwear...

- Hi.
- Nope, that's mine.

00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,182
Thanks for the lift.

pants around his ankles...

by the first commercial.

177
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,668
Well, it's a game.
They're playing strategy.

<i>...actually satisfy me
on a day-to-day basis.</i>

good on this show.

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,577
(LAUGHS)

181
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,178
What's that supposed to mean?

182
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,680
You're hardly competitive, dear.

183
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:07,617
You don't have an aggressive
bone in your body.

184
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,786
Against these girls, you'd have
to put on your big-girl pants...

185
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,721
or they'd have you for lunch.

186
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:13,589
<i>I think I'd describe myself as
definitely thinking outside...</i>

187
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,358
Whatever.

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,591
[BACHELOR] <i>I march to the beat
of my own drum.</i>

189
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,127
Ugh.

190
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:20,195
<i>A really nice day for me
is wak...</i>

191
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,197
I actually like the whole
construction worker thing.

192
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,765
You know, the whole, like,
works with his hands,

193
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,368
salt-of-the-earth motif.

194
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,603
The only thing salty about him
is his balls.

195
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,404
Lovely, Meg.

196
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:31,173
<i>Doesn't that just, like,
roll of your tongue-</i>

197
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,709
You can have him, if I can have
the fireman from last season.

198
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,511
Oh, that fireman.

199
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,813
He was a panty-dropper.

200
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,152
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,824
And for the record, just because
I don't sleep around...

202
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,225
doesn't mean I couldn't compete
against a group of women...

203
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,527
Did you just take a shot at me?
Was that a drive-by?

204
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,831
You drive-by-ed me.
"Big-girl pants"?

205
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,435
That was a slick move.
She's definitely getting a rose.

206
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:01,704
[BACHELOR] <i>I know it's crazy
to give out roses before...</i>

207
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:06,275
<i>the first rose ceremony,
but I don't care.</i>

208
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,845
You know, it's been a long day.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

209
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,583
I just opened a new bottle.
Come on, let's finish it.

210
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,251
[KATE] No, I'm going to bed.

211
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,488
No morning re-cap.
I'm watching the rest.

212
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,455
[FEMALE CONTESTANT]
<i>These girls mean nothing to me.</i>

213
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:23,161
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

214
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,863
Kate? Kate, wake up.

215
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,464
What, is there a fire?
No, there's no fire.

216
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:31,267
What's wrong? What's going on?

217
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,736
We're screwed up. Our lives,
things aren't going well.

218
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,438
Is it really 4:15?

219
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,406
Remember in the ninth grade
when you got stung...

220
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,474
by that jellyfish and I peed
on you and you got really mad?

221
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,209
Did you take one of my pills?

222
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,645
You were really mad until it
stopped hurting, right?

223
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:44,479
Yeah.

224
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,148
When you're faced with a
life-threatening problem...

225
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,518
which we are, you step away
from the problem...

226
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,854
and in a calm, adult way,
you self-medicate...

227
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,824
until the solution presents
itself.

228
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,358
Okay.

229
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,230
Preferably on a beach
with a margarita.

230
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:01,363
Okay, let's talk about it.

231
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,531
Yes! That's my girl.

232
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,932
Can we plan this in the morning?

233
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,334
No, we gotta go.

234
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,669
What? Where?

235
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,470
Fort Lauderdale...
I used your Sky Miles.

236
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,772
Today?

237
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,873
Now! Our flight's in three
hours.

238
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,943
Meg, absolutely not,
that's crazy.

239
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,478
I'm not going on vacation right
now. You're completely insane.

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,946
[KATE] We are going
to miss this flight!

241
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:19,781
This is completely insane!

242
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,783
Why even ask me, if you're
gonna just make us...

243
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:22,818
miss the goddamn flight?

244
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,752
[MEG] Sir, we can get out here.

245
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,253
[KATE] Stop. Stop. Stop!

246
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,555
[MEG]
Don't yell at the poor guy.

247
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:27,924
[KATE]
Thank you, thank you, sir.

248
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,492
You pay the driver,
I'll get the bags.

249
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:32,695
Oh my god. Look at this line!

250
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,598
We are going to miss
this flight!

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,632
I cannot believe this.

252
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,768
I kept telling you that we had
to leave.

253
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,938
[KATE] This happens every single
time. Look at this line!

254
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,605
There's no way we are making
this flight.

255
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,973
These are non-refundable
tickets.

256
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,742
I told you you can
take a bath...

257
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,911
or you can poach an egg
and not both.

258
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,814
Meg. Meg. What're you doing?

259
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,583
- Hold on.
- Get in line!

260
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,550
Excuse me.

261
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,520
My friend and I are about
to miss our flight.

262
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,689
Is there any way we can come
in this line?

263
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,857
Are you first class
or an Elite Club member?

264
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:05,795
We're first-class ladies.

265
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,897
Actually, I think I am
an Elite Club member...

266
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,364
if it didn't expire.

267
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,702
Hold on, let me check.

268
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,238
Ugh.

269
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,575
No, it's not... ugh.

270
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:23,345
Shoot. I guess not.

271
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,916
Sorry about that.

272
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,383
(SIGHS)

273
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:31,686
Thanks for your help.
And thanks for keeping us safe.

274
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:33,424
I just do check-in.

275
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:41,597
Why do you always do that?

276
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,268
- Do what?
- It's embarrassing.

277
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:52,211
Told you.

278
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:57,412
You can't just cut in front
of all these...

279
00:11:57,414 --> 00:12:01,383
Sorry. Ugh, sorry.

280
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:05,688
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

281
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,958
Oh my god, you are the sweetest
thing.

282
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,959
Don't worry about it.

283
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:15,564
You hungry?

284
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,436
You could have checked your bag.

285
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:21,671
I was trying to save some money.

286
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,738
- You okay?
- Yeah.

287
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,741
You got your headphones, pills,
neck pillow...

288
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,012
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be epic.

290
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,314
Yeah.

291
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,651
Deep breath.

292
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,919
Ma'am, no liquids
above 3.4 ounces.

293
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,454
You can dispose of it in that
trash can right there.

294
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,826
You want me to get rid of it?
Sure thing.

296
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:55,907
Whew!

297
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,078
It's easier when it's a beer.

298
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,046
Have a good flight.

299
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,948
Deep breath, girl.

We're going to Florida.
It's gonna be so much fun.

301
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,589
Think of the beach,
think of the sunshine.

302
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,424
Here's your neck pillow.

303
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,959
Six hours in the air.
Up and down.

304
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,361
Please don't say "down".

305
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,862
We're still on the ground.

306
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,031
Yeah, I know, but we're high
enough already.

307
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,965
Middle seats are for suckers,
right?

308
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,068
You know what? I actually think
it'd be better if we switched.

309
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,403
I would, but I need extra
legroom.

310
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,073
It's sort of a Gandalf-Bilbo
situation.

And I'm the hobbit?

00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,611
Oh my... I'm just saying,
I'm taller.

Here, take a pill.

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,980
- I already took a pill.
- Take another.

00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:40,749
Okay.

00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,118
- I'll get you a water.
- No, I don't need any water...

317
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,554
Excuse me, can she
get a water...

318
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:47,589
so she can take her
anti-anxiety pill?

319
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,724
Certainly.

320
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,459
Can we please keep this
to ourselves?

321
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,695
I was just trying to help.

your social.

Just quit with the flirty
routine...

I wasn't. Geez.
Take a deep breath, girl.

326
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,536
I'm surprised you didn't show
him your bra.

327
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:04,540
I think he might try and wear
it, am I right? Uh-oh.

- Take it.
- Stop it!

- Take it.
- Oh my god!

335
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,685
I got one more comin', too.

336
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,759
Excuse me. I think
I'm in the middle there.

So what is it, Ryan?
Business or pleasure?

It's a wedding, actually.

like work, right?

Mm.

don't they?

00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:26,955
How about you?

354
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,891
- What brings you out?
- I have...

355
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,261
A girl's trip. I kinda hate that
expression, but it's true.

356
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:35,730
We are on a trip and we are
girls.

357
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:36,965
Okay, so you two are together?

358
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,800
Yeah, we're best friends.

359
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:41,036
We're just sitting in these
seats because, you know...

360
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,671
middle seats are for suckers.

361
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:47,478
Ah, my, uh, reputation
precedes me.

362
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,080
I love weddings.

363
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,549
As long as they're other
people's.

364
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,816
Yeah, that's the truth, right?

to meet you.

- She's fine. She's just...
- Smarly...

- Terrified of flying.
- M-marley.

She took some pharmaceuticals.

- Stay there.
- I'm jealous.

385

It's gonna be all right.

525
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:30,511
Hey there, you ladies here
for Jewel Con?

526
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,546
No, uh, we're just... we're
meeting some friends.

527
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:36,084
Yes, yes, you are... us.
<i>Namaste.</i>

528
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:38,586
I'm Craig, precious gems
are my specialty.

529
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:41,989
Chuck here is in, uh, high-end
watch repair.

530
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:44,191
Shahar does imports.

531
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:46,594
"Shahar" is Hebrew
for "sunrise"...

532
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:50,665
which you will experience
tomorrow morning in my bed.

533
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,500
That was smooth.
That was very smooth.

534
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:53,501
She didn't refuse, that's good.

535
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,304
- Yeah, well...
- I have cocaine.

536
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,305
Whoa, Chuck, put it away.

537
00:22:57,307 --> 00:22:59,007
He's very excited he has
cocaine.

538
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,409
He's been showing it to
everybody.

539
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:03,577
I smuggled it on the plane
in my underpants.

540
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,515
Enough about us, and you guys
are...?

541
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,449
Undercover federal agents
investigating...

542
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,184
a counterfeit diamond ring.

543
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,720
So you can either step aside
and let us do our job...

544
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:15,023
or I'll give Kate here the green
light to shove her taser...

545
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:16,424
in your ass and light you up.

546
00:23:16,426 --> 00:23:18,526
Okay, sorry, officers.

547
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,163
Let's go.

548
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:35,443
Hey. I glommed on to
some fellow travelers.

549
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:38,279
This is Roger and Nancy,
Kate and Meg.

550
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,681
Oh my god, you look like
a fucking princess.

551
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:43,184
Thanks, it's a sari.

552
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,988
Honey, you got nothing to be
sorry about.

553
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,123
Roger and Nancy are celebrating
their anniversary.

554
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,659
Ten years and I think
I'll keep her.

555
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,661
Aw.

556
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,062
That's sweet.

557
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:58,100
Shit. Category four?

558
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,700
[NANCY]
So much for losing steam.

559
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:01,335
[ROGER] No one's getting out
of here tomorrow.

560
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:03,337
I'm not gonna make
the rehearsal dinner.

561
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,173
Oh, come on, don't think
like that.

562
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,677
Yeah, hurricanes are notoriously
unpredictable.

563
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,514
That's why they name them
after women, right?

564
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:15,683
It was a slam-dunk case, see
this guy didn't have a prayer...

565
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,120
but he did have this gorgeous
defense attorney.

566
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,721
Gorgeous and <i>gifted</i> defense
attorney.

567
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,090
[NANCY]
All charges were dropped.

568
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:23,592
Well, not entirely...

569
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:26,128
I did manage to negotiate
into the plea bargain...

570
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,696
that Nancy go on a date with me.

571
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:31,432
First time in my career,
I got two men off in one day.

572
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:33,067
More than once, as I recall.

573
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,469
I could have you dis-barred,
you know?

574
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,505
Yeah? I could have you mounted.

575
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,774
- [NANCY] I'll mount you.
- [ROGER] Did you bring the cuffs?

576
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:40,741
- I'll blindfold you first.
- Oh, interrogation.

577
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,811
Or Q & A? Mm.

578
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:46,314
I think we lost them.

579
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,382
What about you guys?
What do you do?

580
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,251
I'm a CEO.

581
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:51,585
Wow.

582
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,788
I sell a line of skin care
products.

583
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,556
You know Michelle Obama?

584
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,824
Is she a client?

585
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:59,326
Well, obviously I can't talk
about it...

586
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,761
but how about her skin?

587
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:05,132
Damn. Damn.
What about you, Kate?

588
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:07,536
I'm a teacher...
I teach high school.

589
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,403
Oh, nice.

590
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,672
Special needs high school.

591
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:14,776
Wow. Is that hard?

592
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:18,212
You know what's hard is not
being with them right now.

593
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,115
A lot of people think that
I teach them... but...

594
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,717
but really, you know,
they teach me.

595
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,318
Yeah.

596
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,189
The blind teach me how
to listen better...

597
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:29,458
and the mute teach me...

598
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,796
you know, not to talk so much,
so I'm gonna stop.

599
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,700
Man, I can't compete with you
two. I'm just a firefighter.

644

- Night.
- Night.

645
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,599
Hey.

646
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,433
- Yeah?
- What's up?

647
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:00,701
You know, since we're gonna be
stuck here tomorrow...

648
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,836
it may be nice to see the city.

649

St. Louis magnet for the fridge?

I uh, I'm actually gonna
ride up with you.

656
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:18,053
The uh, the ice machine on our
floor is broken, so...

657
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,821
- Oh.
- What do you need ice for?

658
00:29:19,823 --> 00:29:21,555
Ice water.

659
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,824
Wait, you can't go.
I need you to open our door.

660
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,459
We... we both have keys.

661
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,995

00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:28,595
- I think that's the bell...
- Well here, whatever...

663
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:29,898
you can... you can just
take mine.

664
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,433
You know what?
I'll just go with you.

665
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,568
Don't be silly, you don't need
two people to get ice.

666
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,937
Thank you.

667
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,706
I just thought it would be
easier for you.

668
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,773
Elevator's closing, good luck
with the ice, guys.

669
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:40,040
- Oh, goodnight!
- Goodnight!

670
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,344
[MEG] Ice? Really?

671
00:29:42,346 --> 00:29:43,611
At least I didn't pull
my boob out.

672
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,946
Do you think I did that
on purpose?

673
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:46,448
I know that you did.
You have great tits.

674
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,649
That's insane!

675
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,351
Listen, I know you wanna
do your thing...

676
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:51,952
- Not the great tits part.
- But I actually like him.

677
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:55,023
- Well, I love him.
- You love him?

678
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:56,391
Yes, I love him.

679
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:58,026
You don't even know
his last name.

680
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,628
So? Do Romeo and Juliet know
each other's last name?

681
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,797
Yes! Montague and Capulet.

682
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:07,134
Oh, I'm an English teacher.

683
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:09,603
I want him.

684
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,707
Not this time.

685
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:15,043
You want me to choose?

686
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,878
Whichever, we're totally cool
with it.

687
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,947
Yeah, totally. I'm cool, too.

688
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:22,717
Well, I mean, they say the
St. Louis art museum's pretty...

689
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:25,652
great, but what a day to hit
the botanical gardens, right?

690
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:26,720
Or door number three.

691
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:31,025
Boom! A hot air balloon ride!

692
00:30:31,027 --> 00:30:33,161
- Now that is rad.
- A balloon?
