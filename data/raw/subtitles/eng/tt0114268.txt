you know, with us kind of
on the fence about it
a little bit.

You know,
to actually experience

359
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,449
having a few kids around

360
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,625

365

[SCOFFS] Of course not.

366
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,562
Yeah.

367
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,174
You think we can just
rent some kids

368
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,566
and return them
when we're through?

369
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,916
Well, I just think that
it might help us decide

370
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,571
if having a family is something
we really want to do.

371
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,748
But, they wouldn't be our kids.

372
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,272
Exactly.

373
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:49,188
But, after a week,
if we still want a family,

374
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,451
then we must really
want a family.

375
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,148
Well, what if we got
a bunch of kids we hated?

376
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,584
Kids that would never
be like ours

377
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,064
if we raised them on our own.

378
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,240
Well, I guess we'd mix that
into the equation

379
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,155
and we'd try again.

380
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,766
But if we keep renting
and we keep having problems,

381
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,074

a valuable lesson.
