1
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,949
That's kissin'!

2
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,150
More champagne!

3
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,868
Give the boys another 20 bucks.

4
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,836
When you start running low, holler.
There's more where that came from.

5
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,231
Open up a bottle for yourselves too.

6
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,356
It ain't every day when Goldie opens
a joint in Denver and gets married to boot.

7
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,189
Wish we could get off the train with you.
That's one wedding I'd like to see.

8
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,676
- Yes, sir, yes, ma'am. Sure would.
- I wish you could too, boys.

9
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,995
- Right, girls?
- Yeah!

10
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,159
Did you ever see such a bunch
of beautiful bridesmaids

11
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,316
in your whole damn life?

12
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,069
Penny for your thoughts, lad.

13
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,556
They ain't worth it.
I was just thinking, better get some sleep.

14
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,070
We got a busy day in Denver tomorrow.

15
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,919
Busy wedding day!

16
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,876
Good night, baby.

17
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,556
- What's the next stop?
- Purgatory.

18
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,195
- Purgatory?
- Mm. Mining town. It ain't much.

19
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,515
Wake me when we get to Purgatory.

20
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,076
- Just me, not Miss Goldie.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,479
Man!

22
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,150
- The midnight on time, Ez?
- See what I'm writing, don't you?

23
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,512
- The midnight on time, Ez?
- I don't know more than you, Mr Barton.

24
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,916
But it seems kinda high class
to write down that she is.

25
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,237
Don't look like you're wearin' a gun
under that coat. Smart.

26
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,830
Ever heard of a man gettin' into trouble
mindin' his own business, Ez?

27
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,430
How am I expected to mind
my own business? I sent the telegram.

28
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,915
Telegrams are supposed to be private.

29
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,951
From the telegrapher?

30
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,833
I sure would feel a lot better
with weight on my hip, Pa.

31
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,953
If that party mentioned in the telegram
shows up, you'd best be unarmed.

32
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,231
Ez, I told you to mind...

33
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,510
- The Sidewinder!
- Your sister's name is Patience.

34
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,312
Patience!

35
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,079
You stay out of this, Pa.

36
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,638
- What the hell are you doing?
- Teachin' them jackass miners a lesson.

37
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,757
Oh, you give me that!

38
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,155
I've told you not to shoot at people!

39
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,953
They had it comin'.
One of them said something vile.

40
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,152
He said "Does your mother
know you're out, Cecilia?"

41
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,999
You consider that grounds
for shootin' up the town?

42
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,714
- I knew what he meant.
- I sure as hell don't.

43
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,149
They are trying to ruin my good name.

44
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,751
I have sworn to go to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York,

45
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,838
for young ladies of good family.
Nothing's gonna stop me!

46
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,791
Except you killin' somebody.

47
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,309
- I only shoot at riffraff.
- You shot at us.

48
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,512
- I missed you.
- You couldn't hit a bull with a banjo.

49
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,949
- Watch that smart mouth.
- Hit him, Pa.

50
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,039
If I hit anybody, it's gonna be you.
Take her home, Oriville.

51
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,914
- Take your damn hands off me.
- Don't let her stop for a beer.

52
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,795
- She gets mean when she drinks.
- How come you called that girl Patience?

53
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,953
Can hear her a long way off
when the wind's right.

54
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,038
Ain't enough late
to make it worthwhile changin' the board.

55
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,515
Sounds downright peaceful, don't it?

56
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,269
Calm before the storm,
if that certain party is on board.

57
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,913
Yeah.

58
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,795
Well?

59
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,593
We'll say we know
you didn't get off at Purgatory.

60
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,158
We don't know where you did get off,
but we know it wasn't Purgatory.

61
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,911
Don't open up, boys. Nothing but mail
for Purgatory. No passengers gettin' off.

62
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,795
It's bad manners to call the conductor
a liar, so let's not. No sense openin' up.

63
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,195
Nobody's gettin' off at Purgatory.

64
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,477
Evenin'. Or mornin', rather.
It's one in the morning.

65
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,149
- I got a watch.
- Just get off the train?

66
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,513
Ever hear of an eagle pickin' up a grown
man and carryin' him across country?

67
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,598
- No, I can't say that I have.
- Well, you have now.

68
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,280
I come by eagle.

69
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,951
That's him, Pa. If only I had my rifle,
I'd nail him between the shoulder blades.

70
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,436
That'd be murder.
And it might be the wrong man.

71
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,758
It's gotta be him. Big, mean and ugly,
and sneakin' off the train. What's next?

72
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,316
Give him time to get a room,
then ask some questions at the hotel.

73
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,671
Let's wait in the Chinaman's back room.

74
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,357
- Pa, she's gonna get her another beer.
- So am I!

75
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,954
Can't you read? That sign says
"Take a key, go to bed. "

76
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,757
- That sign?
- That sign... must've gotten a few strays.

77
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,270
We got lots of shooting in this town.
Here, register.

78
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,473
- Your handle and your hometown.
- Already did.

79
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,832
Smith. Is that your real name?
Not that I'm nosey.

80
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,157
- Give me a room.
- Ah, keep your shirt on!

81
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,035
Oh, say, that's real silk, isn't it?

82
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,754
You must be rich. Well?

83
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,236
- Well, what?
- You rich? Not that I'm curious.

84
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,716
- Is there another hotel in this town?
- Ah, keep your shirt on.

85
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,796
Your silk shirt.

86
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,151
That's a good one!

87
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,236
Come on.

88
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,391
Just as good a service as in
the Palmer House in Chicago. Come on.

89
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Watch your step here. Come on.

90
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
<i>Your silk shirt!</i>

91
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,839
If you hear a lot of screamin',
don't pay no heed.

92
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,192
One of the miners
has delirium tremens every now and then.

93
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,073
His name's Smith too.

94
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,555
Maybe you're related!

95
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,351
There's two ways you can have
the windows - open or closed.

96
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,871
Closed is hot.
Open, there's flies that eat you alive.

97
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,639
- Let me help you unpack.
- Never mind.

98
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,593
No trouble. No trouble at all.

99
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,554
What's them?

100
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,830
I grabbed the wrong suitcase.

101
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,357
- What are these things?
- That's a Kewpie doll.

102
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,950
I won one at the state fair
the time I went to Denver all by myself.

103
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,514
- And got rolled by some floozie!
- Oh, shut up.

104
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,792
Now, stop it. Let's go ask
Martha Perkins about this man.

105
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,598
- Have you got change for a $100 bill?
- No, I haven't.

106
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,554
I'll get it changed someplace
and pay you when I get back.

107
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,910
Patience Barton, you get away from there!

108
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,589
I could tell by that stupid face
he would have no imagination. Smith!

109
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,271
You couldn't expect him to go around
signing his own name in his business.

110
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,631
Ah! Patience Barton,
you give me my key back.

111
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,591
Mister!

112
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,029
Wanna buy a pair of spurs?

113
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,832
No. I wonder...

114
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,952
These ain't hardly been used.
Gotta lot of wear left in 'em.

115
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,036
Outlast a dozen horses.

116
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,355
I don't ride.

117
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,798
Has this town got a doctor?

118
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,277
Big husky fella like you.
What do you need a doctor for?

119
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,951
Well, I'll tell the doctor that. If I tell you,
I'd just get tired of repeatin' it.

120
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,752
Has this town got a doctor?

121
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,796
I don't know what I'm gonna say
to the man when he sees this suitcase.

122
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,878
- You'll think of somethin'.
- Might have a secret compartment.

123
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,755
I been through it three times.
I told you, he got the wrong suitcase.

124
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,668
Oh... I'm telling you,
the man got the wrong suitcase.

125
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,512
You let go of me!

126
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,234
Hey, Pa, make him let go!

127
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,351
I got him! I got him, Pa.

128
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,268
Did you promise to marry that girl,
or somethin' of the sort?

129
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,358
Not even somethin' of the sort.
I don't rightly know the lady.

130
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,075
I stand with a bunch of fellas
in front of the saloon. She walks by.

131
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,795
I said "Does your mother know
you're out, Cecilia?" Witty, like.

132
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,789
She was gonna blow us to kingdom come.
So many fast-weavin' cowboys.

133
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,037
She just likes to shoot people.

134
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,594
It seems to be all clear.

135
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,157
- Where did you say that doctor was?
- I still don't see what a big, healthy fella...

136
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,628
He's probably shootin' pool in the saloon.

137
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,877
- At one in the morning?
- This is a real upside-down town.

138
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,515
They've got three shifts of miners
and they come on and off work all day.

139
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,235
- He answers to the name of Doc Schultz.
- Thanks.

140
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,514
- Sure you don't want to buy the spurs?
- No.

141
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,870
Hey, a cowboy's got to be pretty down
to be willin' to sell his horse irons.

142
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,197
My horse went first, then my saddle.
But I'm sober now.

143
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,996
What I've got left is these here spurs...
and a mighty empty belly.

144
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,549
Oh, well, here. You eat on me, huh?

145
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,111
Thanks, friend. The name's Jug. Jug May.

146
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,631
- Latigo Smith. Now, you enjoy your food.
- I can't thank you enough.

147
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,389
Don't cry.
Money's the least of my troubles.

148
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,951
$100? Mister, you gave...

149
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,470
I ain't never even seen one.

150
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,753
I...

151
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,110
I ain't never even seen a...

152
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,192
If I hadn't been hurried, I could've
gotten him right between the eyes.

153
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,791
- You don't take after your sainted mother.
- I hate this town.

154
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,959
If I don't get back east to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York,

155
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,312
I am gonna hate it a whole lot more,
and everybody in it!

156
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,318
Well, you ain't exactly loved
by one and all around here.

157
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,318
- Enough, Oriville!
- Can't you do anything with her?

158
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,788
This is a family matter, Martha Perkins.
I'll thank you to stay out of it! Come along.

159
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,551
18, black and even. Everybody wins
again. Care to place a little bet, sir?

160
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,114
- You lookin' for trouble, mister?
- No, sir.

161
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,232
Do I look dim-witted enough
to play that game?

162
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,388
Against the house rules
to answer that kind of question, sir.

163
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,150
Howdy. Do you play pocket billiards?

164
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,078
- Not now. Are you Doc Schultz?
- Says so on my licence.

165
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,509
Toss me that piece of chalk.
Thank you.

166
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,679
Listen. If a man tells his lawyer
that he killed a gent or two,

167
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,836
the lawyer can't tell anybody?

168
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,474
I don't see how that concerns me,
but you're right.

169
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,034
The relationship is a sacred one.

170
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,473
The same with a doctor. A doctor
can't tell anybody what anybody's got.

171
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,398
You must have a very interesting disease.

172
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,911
- It's worth $500 to you.
- Getting more interesting by the minute.

173
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,919
Of course, I'll have to blow
your head off if you tell.

174
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,669
I ain't never seen leprosy.
If that's what you've got, I wouldn't know.

175
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,078
It ain't leprosy, but can't we go
someplace where we could be alone?

176
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,355
Well, that sounds like a sound idea.
My office is right up the street there.

177
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,630
Gonna change your mind about a bet, sir?

178
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,877
Have to be an idiot to play roulette.
Do I look like an idiot?

179
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,719
- No, sir.
- And don't you forget it.

180
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,509
Fire in the hole!

181
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,119
- What the hell was that?
- Third shift.

182
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,232
First and second set
the dynamite charges and fuse them.

183
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,798
Third does most of the blasting.
Sometimes this goes on all night.

184
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,073
Purgatory sits on the top of two mines.

185
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,475
Barton owns one, Colonel Ames the other.

186
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,639
Been fightin' each other trying to tunnel
to the mother lode for two years now.

187
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,150
- The mother lode?
- Centre of town, according to geologists.

188
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,748
Like buildin' a railroad
from east and west.

189
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,077
Whoever gets there first
gets to drive the golden spike.

190
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,556
- And the other one gets the shaft.
- Gets the shaft.

191
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,112
Yah!

192
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,153
She shoots at people, too.

193
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,272
Nicest girl in town.

194
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,552
I sure am curious
about that ailment of yours.

195
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,471
- This is your office?
- I doctor pack mules too.

196
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,354
Got a pain in the ass?
Come and see Doc Schultz.

197
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,912
This is better now. Well...

198
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,996
What's your problem?

199
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,750
Doc, you promise
you won't tell anybody, huh?

200
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,553
On my hypocritic oath.

201
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,479
- In all my born days!
- I was a little drunk at the time.

202
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,797
I could've guessed that.
Where's the young lady now?

203
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,356
Never mind. Can you take her off, Doc?

204
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,677
- You mentioned $500.
- Cash.

205
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:02,636
Well, if I ever knewed anything
about tattooin', I've forgotten it.

206
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,992
I'll have to read up on the subject.
You're gonna be around a few days?

207
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,271
Just long enough to get this thing off,
then I'll be long gone.

208
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,630
You ain't runnin' away from the lady?

209
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,796
No, of course not.

210
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,117
But if she should show up,
you haven't seen me, huh?

211
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,756
- How would I know her?
- She's got a lot of this gold-coloured hair.

212
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,113
She's got a lot of everything, but mostly
she's got a lot of this gold-coloured hair.

213
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,708
- What shall I do?
- Come back in a couple of days.

214
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,470
- That'll give me time to read up.
- Well, you're the... doctor.

215
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,030
Just a minute, I'd like to speak to you.

216
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,391
I don't know you, mister,
and I don't see any reason to start.

217
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,114
I want to offer you
very profitable employment.

218
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,800
I'm in business for myself.

219
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,674
Doc! Who is that fella?

220
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,157
None of your business. Speaking of which
all you mine-owners are a despicable lot.

221
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,716
You hire people to kill people that
other people hire to kill your people.

222
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,278
And you go elsewhere with your medical
business and I have to doctor jackasses.

223
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,630
Get outta here. I got business to attend to.

224
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,150
Anybody ever tell you
you've got a rotten bedside manner?

225
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,159
- Out!
- You talk too much. I can't understand.

226
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,478
<i>Hey...</i>

227
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,151
Like to place a bet, sir?
Sorry, sir, I didn't know it was...

228
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,158
Ask me that one more time,
I'll put a plate in your skull.

229
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,396
Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.

230
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,675
- Sarsaparilla.
- What?

231
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,238
I would write it down but I don't figure
you could read it. Soda pop.

232
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,229
- Don't hardly anybody want soda pop.
- Don't you drink?

233
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,797
Only to be sociable.
And I don't feel sociable right now.

234
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,069
Dimwits.

235
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,760
- Who?
- Idiots playing roulette.

236
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,309
- Oh! Some people like it.
- Suckers. The worst kind of suckers.

237
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,317
The house gets the best of it.

238
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,672
No, they oughta take all the roulette
dealers out and string 'em up.

239
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,033
House got eight per cent the best of it,
even if the wheel is straight, and it ain't.

240
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,077
Eight per cent! That means that one out of
every 12 times you haven't got a chance.

241
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,594
Anybody who plays roulette oughta have
their head examined. Just lock 'em up.

242
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,314
They oughta burn all roulette wheels.

243
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,670
$4600 on number 23.

244
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,115
- Mister, I can't take that kinda money.
- 4600 on 23.

245
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,196
Boss!

246
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,631
Boss, this fella just bet $4600
on number 23.

247
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,316
Spin her.

248
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,674
Number 22. The man loses.

249
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,357
It just comes over me every so often.

250
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,358
Nothing I can do about it.

251
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,552
Number 23 just pulls at me.

252
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,988
Well...

253
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,351
- They say money isn't everything.
- Is if a man's hungry.

254
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,349
That reminds me. How much
you got left of that $100 I gave you?

255
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,391
- None.
- None?

256
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,593
I ate up $20 of it. I bought a girl some
wine. She had a sick mother in Salt Lake...

257
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,359
- You gave her the money?
- Seemed like the thing to do.

258
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,508
You idiot! That's the surest way
to make an enemy out of a woman.

259
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,313
- It is?
- I learned that a long time ago.

260
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,592
- You did?
- Well, let's take a walk.

261
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,280
I need the air and time to think.

262
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,833
- Young man, about that job...
- I told you not to bother me, mister.

263
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,351
- The man said something about a job.
- I don't like to work. It tires me out.

264
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,359
- How are we gonna eat if we don't work?
- We?

265
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,357
I figured we'd ride together.

266
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,710
- Ride? Horses?
- Yeah.

267
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,469
I told you, I don't ride. I'm a train man.
At least carriages.

268
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,354
A man has got to be numb on both ends
to earn his livin' sittin' on a horse.

269
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,032
- I just don't like horses.
- That's close to treason in these parts.

270
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,752
Lively place.

271
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,877
This is a two-shaft town.
Only one of them works full time.

272
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,312
- Half the jackass miners drink in places...
- A woman run that saloon?

273
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,716
- Hm?
- Does a woman run that saloon?

274
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,796
Miss Jenny.

275
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,794
You still got them spurs
you was trying to sell me? Give me them.

276
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,797
- You threw one away.
- I did just that.

277
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,033
- Open up another table.
- Yes, Miss Jenny.

278
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,913
- Miss Jenny?
- That's right.

279
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,796
I brought you this.

280
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,835
- From Slim.
- Is this a joke?

281
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,679
Ma'am, I rode over 300 miles
to bring you that spur.

282
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,429
It's hardly a jokin' matter,
a poor boy dyin'.

283
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,476
Just me and him out on the prairie all
alone, the wolves howlin' in the distance.

284
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,875
"Lat" he said to me.

285
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,231
"There's nothing I got left in this world
except this one spur. "

286
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,352
"I want you to take it to my only true love,
Miss Jenny. "

287
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,199
Of course, I knew
who he was talking about right off.

288
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,031
All those lonely nights on the trail, he'd
hardly ever talk about anything but you,

289
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,950
- and what a heart of gold you had.
- I kinda remember.

290
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,469
There must've been a Slim.

291
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,876
Oh, bartender!
Give this gentleman a drink.

292
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,437
- Is that other boy with you?
- Yes, ma'am, I am. My name's Jug May.

293
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,438
Give them both a drink, and I'll have one.

294
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,951
About this Slim.
He was in love with me, is that it?

295
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,153
Ma'am, there was never
a truer love, nor nobler.

296
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,477
Of course, I can understand
why the boy felt that way.

297
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,750
- Oh?
- Yes, ma'am, I can understand.

298
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,317
"Miss Jenny," he said,
"she's not like other women. "

299
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,629
He said that real often. "Miss Jenny,
she's kind and generous to a fault. "

300
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,230
"Just give a man her last dime. "

301
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,955
- You're not lyin' to me?
- May I be struck down if...

302
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,639
- You all right?
- If that's the third shift, I am.

303
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,116
Sorry. Sometimes it comes
without warning.

304
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,756
Getting back to Slim. He really said
those nice things about me?

305
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,477
Yes, ma'am. Even dying,
he said them nice things, and more.

306
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,354
- I'm touched.
- Not as much as you're gonna be.

307
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,669
There's a name for a man like that.

308
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,439
- Mornin', Patience.
- Mornin'.

309
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,428
- Looks nice.
- Thank you.

310
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,876
Try this.

311
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,277
Oh, I like it. We'll take this one.

312
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,155
You sure got good taste in pickin' hats,
Miss Jenny, just like everything else.

313
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,034
It'll embarrass me, you paying.
Let me have the money.

314
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,915
You just stand there and be embarrassed.
I'll pay the man.

315
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
- Boy, have you got brass.
- Hm?

316
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,998
Asking a woman for money like that.

317
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,159
- You think that's wrong, huh?
- The way I was brung up...

318
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,430
- A woman brought you up, didn't she?
- Yeah.

319
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,152
You see?

320
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,316
I mean, it ain't generally done.

321
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,356
Did you ever know a woman to show
any slowness in askin' you for money?

322
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,119
No, now that I think about it.

323
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,469
I just made one mistake, though.

324
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,037
Askin' her in the daylight.
Come across much easier at night.

325
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,832
Hm...

326
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,514
- Morning.
- Morning.

327
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,996
- You buyin' yourself a new hat?
- No, the lady's buyin' him one.

328
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,632
Is it gonna make or break your day
if I do or don't buy a hat, stranger?

329
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,513
Oh, I don't want to be a stranger to you.

330
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,031
My name's Colorado. Colorado McGee.

331
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,914
Well, you said that like you expected
I should have heard of you.

332
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,508
I never have, so what do you want?

333
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,438
I wanna know if you're as fast
as they say you are, Swifty.

334
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,677
- What'd you call me?
- Swifty.

335
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,633
I'll call you Mr Morgan if you like.

336
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,638
I'm goin' out in that street
and wait for you to come out.

337
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,276
If you don't, me and everybody else
in town is gonna call you a yellow dog.

338
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,870
- Gunfight?
- You catch on.

339
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,753
Well, you just go on out there.
I'll be out on the count of ten.

340
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,273
- You hit that fella from behind.
- Just as hard as I could.

341
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,912
- Get me one of those irons over there.
- What's that gunfighter got against you?

342
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,679
I never saw him before in my life.

343
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,077
Oh, Miss Jenny. I'm awful sorry that a lady
like you had to see a crude thing like this.

344
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,193
Let's go up to the hotel and get some
smelling salts and you can lay down.

345
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,189
From the way this guy is wearing his gun
in his holster, looks like he's left-handed.

346
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,552
It was his right trigger finger you busted.

347
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,912
Miss Jenny,
would you turn your head, please?

348
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,600
Give me the iron.

349
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,915
If I'd known you were gonna send
this pipsqueak against Swifty Morgan.

350
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,998
- Look, Mr Barton...
- Don't take offence, lad.

351
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,636
But you've never killed anybody outside
of this county. You're just local stuff.

352
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,991
Swifty Morgan is known
from Canada to the Mexican border.

353
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,680
If you've got a better idea, Taylor,
let's have it.

354
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,634
- Buy this Swifty Morgan.
- Ames has already bought Morgan.

355
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,309
All gunfighters have a price.
They're a low order of humanity. Lice.

356
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,273
- Look here, Mr Barton.
- Shut up!

357
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,790
We offer Morgan enough money
to make him double-cross Colonel Ames.

358
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,195
- That sounds good.
- Now, wait a minute.

359
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,073
How can you be sure
that Colonel Ames sent for Morgan?

360
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,431
I have a way of knowin'
what goes on in the Colonel's house.

361
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,758
- He's sparkin' his old-maid sister.
- Why, you young...

362
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,670
I seen you out bicycle-ridin' with
his sister propped up on the handlebars.

363
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,156
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves,
actin' like that at your age.

364
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,558
Set an example for young people instead
of carryin' on like a randy old goat.

365
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,955
Her lookin' like a winterkilled persimmon.

366
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,039
- Get him outta here.
- Kid, get out.

367
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,068
All I can say is I'd hang my head in shame
was I kin to you...

368
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,114
Pipsqueak!

369
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,630
I figure we can hire Swifty away
from Colonel Ames for $5,000.

370
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,398
That's a lot of money.

371
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,592
We'll lose a lot more
if we don't get to the mother lode first.

372
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,757
We'll never get there
if we don't get back down to diggin'.

373
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,919
As treasurer of the company, this calls
for a meeting of the board of directors.

374
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,033
- We are the board of directors.
- I move that we spend the 5,000.

375
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,789
- I second the motion.
- You can't, you're chairman of the board.

376
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,993
- There is parliamentary procedure.
- Ames ain't worrying about procedure.

377
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,954
He's got four gunmen sittin' on top
of our mine, keeping us out of the ground.

378
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,868
He'll keep keepin' us out
till we start fightin' fire with fire.

379
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,956
Taylor!

380
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,639
Look.

381
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,834
- Colonel Ames.
- He walks like he owns the town.

382
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,111
He will if we don't hire Swifty Morgan.

383
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,638
Last time I wore that dress was
at the governor's ball 20 years ago.

384
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,991
This hat... There wasn't
a man nor a bird dog in Purgatory

385
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,634
that didn't point
when I walked down the street.

386
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,355
Do you think
I look like a lady of the evening?

387
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,156
- What's a lady of the evening?
- Miss Abigail, you do lead a sheltered life.

388
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,477
Do you think I could pass
for one of those girls at Miss Jenny's?

389
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,831
- You mean a dance-hall girl?
- Dance-hall girl.

390
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,397
- I wouldn't know. I've never seen one.
- They go past your window every day.

391
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,717
I always keep the shades drawn
when they do.

392
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,354
- Where am I gonna put this?
- There's room back...

393
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,552
- What on earth?
- I'm gonna do me some blasting.

394
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,148
- In Jenny's place?
- In Jenny's place.

395
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,831
- You're not gonna get yourself in trouble?
- No, but I know somebody who is.

396
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,916
Wait.

397
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,996
For you know who.

398
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,476
Miss Abigail, I don't know why
you're so dead set on marryin' my pa.

399
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,353
He ain't very smart
and he snores somethin' awful.

400
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,316
Don't be indelicate, dear. Your father has
characteristics that you don't recognise.

401
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,197
Also, such a marriage would give
my dear brother apoplexy. Drat his soul.

402
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,992
Abigail?

403
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,758
Speak of the devil.

404
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,192
The servants tell me that Barton's horrid
daughter has sneaked into this house.

405
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,757
- Open up!
- She's not in here, brother.

406
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,348
Stop banging on that door.

407
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,631
I insist that you open this door, Abigail.

408
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,399
Oh, very well.

409
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,273
Satisfied?

410
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,313
I will be when you stop sneaking off
with Barton, riding that damn bicycle.

411
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,910
We haven't been riding in over a week.
Taylor's got a flat.

412
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,555
- He'll have more than that.
- You touch one hair on his head...

413
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,478
One grey hair. He's an old man.

414
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,755
- Snow on the roof but there's fire...
- Abigail! Have you no shame, woman?

415
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,031
What about you, keeping
Taylor's workers out of the mine?

416
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,799
How else will I get
to the mother lode before he does?

417
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,196
His shaft is right in town.
I have to tunnel twice as far.

418
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,438
- That doesn't give you the right...
- Right? I'm talking about gold.

419
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,391
Gold! That's all you ever think of.

420
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,229
All Taylor Barton thinks about
is courting you so he can spy on me.

421
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,272
And I tell him everything
he wants to know.

422
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,837
- He's using you, Abigail.
- He sure is!

423
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,393
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

424
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,750
- Who are you?
- I'm the new girl.

425
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,873
- You is?
- I just got in this morning from Frisco.

426
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,036
In fact, that's my name - Frisco.

427
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,508
<i>Well, it's nice work. It has its ups
and downs, but it is nice work.</i>

428
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,752
- Beat it.
- Put 'em up.

429
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,269
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Kill you.

430
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,674
With that?

431
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,360
I'm a rotten shot and
I'm tired of missing you.

432
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,313
Do you mind tellin' me
why you're shootin' at me?

433
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,035
So I can go to Miss Hunter's College
on the Hudson River, New York.

434
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,789
- Put 'em up, I'm gonna kill you.
- Why should I put my hands up for that?

435
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,275
I don't feel right
about killing you in bed.

436
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,713
Do you think you could jump up and grab
me, then I'd get mad and light the fuse?

437
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,799
It's your Christian duty
to tell me why you're going to blow me up.

438
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,593
- The mine.
- The mine?

439
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,508
If my pa don't get to the mother lode,
we won't have any money.

440
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,475
If we don't have any money, I can't go
to Miss Hunter's College, understand?

441
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,033
No.

442
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,278
- What's all that got to do with me?
- Don't play the innocent, Swifty Morgan.

443
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,269
- You know Colonel Ames sent for you.
- You think I'm the famous Swifty Morgan?

444
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,391
You're getting me angry.
If I get angry, I'll light this fuse.

445
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,956
I don't want to do that,
but I am not Swifty Morgan.

446
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,835
Liar! Now, my pa is sparking
Colonel Ames' old-maid sister.

447
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,599
She told him that Colonel Ames
sent for you, Morgan.

448
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,759
- What's this, a hold-up?
- Show her the inside of one of the boots.

449
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,075
- Huh?
- The inside of the boots.

450
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,876
I had those boots made in Amarillo
over a year ago. Now, look inside.

451
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,956
Go on, look.

452
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,828
"Latigo Smith"?

453
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,714
$60 boots. A man certainly
would have his name in 'em.

454
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,550
Well, you probably took them off
some poor, dead fella that you shot.

455
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,353
Why, you're the Barton girl!
What you doin' here?

456
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,268
Your sainted mother was
one of the nicest ladies in the Baptists.

457
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,631
Down the back stairs with you
before anybody sees you.

458
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,117
You have not seen the last of me yet,
Mr Swifty Morgan.

459
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,953
Hello, ladies' man. "I love Goldie. "

460
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,436
- I warned you about that.
- Not to mention it to anybody else.

461
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,314
Well, I've studied up on tattooing.
I think I can do the job for you.

462
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,273
But in easy stages.
Gonna take a couple of weeks.

463
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,235
Whatever you say.
Doc, does that 500 have to be in cash?

464
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,113
Well, Miss Jenny's certainly got 500.

465
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,949
Then again, she's had
a lot of experience with men like you.

466
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,517
- What do you mean, men like me?
- Give you anything but cash money?

467
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,235
Well, there's one thing
that don't change about women.

468
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,352
That's the fact that they're changeable.

469
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,393
- Where'd you learn about women?
- I worked at it.

470
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,314
- Hello, Patience.
- What's wrong with him, Doc?

471
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,637
You know a doctor can't talk
about his patients, Patience.

472
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,469
Doc, you and me are the only friends
each other's got in this scurvy town.

473
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,114
What would happen
if we got mad at each other?

474
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,232
Oh, he's just got a little trouble
with his chest.

475
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,918
Him?

476
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,113
- He looks strong as a horse.
- You've taken a dislike to him, ain't you?

477
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,358
- I hate professional gunslingers.
- Him a gunslinger?

478
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,473
- That's Swifty Morgan.
- And I just started taking a likin' to him.

479
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,479
I'd have had him shot by now
if Pa hadn't taken my Winchester away.

480
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,353
Patience, you gotta stop
shooting at people.

481
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,155
If you wasn't such a miserable shot,
there wouldn't be a young male here.

482
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,431
I heard you took a shot
at Elmer Price yesterday.

483
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,519
- Why, he asked me to marry him.
- That's reason enough to shoot at a man?

484
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,154
Doc, you seen Elmer? Ugh!

485
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,469
- Good morning, Doc.
- Mornin', Elmer.

486
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,796
Mr Morgan.

487
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,513
- What'd you call me?
- We know you're Swifty Morgan.

488
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,676
We have a proposition for you.

489
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,439
We want you
to double-cross Colonel Ames.

490
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,791
- There's $5,000 in it.
- Well, look...

491
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,070
$5,000?

492
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,156
- Cash?
- Cash.

493
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,073
So, you think I'm Swifty Morgan?

494
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,229
I look to you like the best gunman
in the whole Southwest?

495
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,798
I knew it the minute I saw you. That
sharp, hawk-like gaze, the way you stand.

496
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,869
I hate to say this,
but that's Swifty Morgan.

497
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,239
Uh... Swifty, come over here.

498
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,956
Come on, come over here.

499
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,352
These gentlemen know who you are,
there's no use denying it.

500
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,077
Now that's settled, he would appreciate it
if you didn't bandy his name about.

501
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,317
He's modest, Swifty.
These gentlemen have a proposition.

502
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,638
I suppose it's all right if I handle
the business details like I usually do.

503
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,312
You just go ahead and finish your game
while I talk to these gentlemen.

504
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,476
It's all right. Go ahead.

505
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,790
- Keen eye.
- Killed 50, they say.

506
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,435
Exaggeration. 32, to be exact.

507
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,633
Suppose you spread your cards
on the table, gentlemen. And the cash.

508
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,995
The cash is in my safe. And it's best
if we aren't seen together too much.

509
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,238
You slip out and bring the money
to my room in about 15 minutes?

510
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,630
- You called me Swifty.
- Short and friendly for Swifty Morgan.

511
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,312
That's who they think you are. They're
willin' to pay to back up that mistake.

512
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,195
I'm supposed to pretend
I'm Swifty Morgan? Goodbye.

513
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,392
They're willing to pay.

514
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,909
- How much?
- A thousand dollars.

515
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,874
We'll split it 50-50.
That means 400 for you.

516
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,760
Seems fair. But I think...

517
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,279
No, you don't.

518
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,313
That's part of the deal. I do the thinkin'.
You stand around and look tough.

519
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,959
Stop that! I told you, you're not
to reach for that gun, no matter what.

520
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,470
If somebody spits in your eye,
somebody casts doubts on your mother,

521
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,034
you refer the matter to me.

522
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,230
If I'm Swifty Morgan,
I've got my reputation to consider.

523
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,828
I've got me to consider.

524
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,916
Pride.

525
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,033
If you start thinking, the deal's off.

526
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,116
No $400.

527
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,074
I'm getting better. You watch.

528
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,796
If it ever comes to gunfightin',
you'll never last.

529
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,878
- Sure you ain't fast?
- No, I'm slow.

530
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,390
It's just you're even slower.

531
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,359
They come sneakin' in,
lookin' at the register,

532
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,516
tryin' to find
the room number of Mr Smith.

533
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,949
I tried to tell 'em I got four Smiths.

534
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,356
Thank you. We wouldn't
want to keep you from your work.

535
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,789
I suppose, the way they come sneakin' in,

536
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,278
you're another one of them gunfighters
that these jackass miners keep hirin'.

537
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,359
I suppose they're gonna hire you so
you can shoot some other mother's son

538
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,914
and then some other mother's son
can shoot you.

539
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,271
Martha, for the love of heaven,
unhinge your jaw and depart.

540
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,555
You see now why I demand
my rent in advance every day?

541
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,515
Another Smith. Just more of 'em comin'
all the time, gettin' themselves killed off.

542
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,915
- The money, gentlemen?
- Is Swifty in there?

543
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,396
Yes. The money?
Before we go and talk to Mr Morgan.

544
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,476
A little superstition of his.

545
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:11,233
He leaves all the money matters to me. I
thank you not to mention the transaction.

546
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,668
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you, Swifty.

547
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,158
That was close. Don't ever
come up on my blind side like that.

548
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,316
<i>No, sir, Mr Morgan.</i>

549
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,115
That's close enough. What do you want?

550
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,630
- I came to see the killings.
- What killings?

551
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,638
You for one. And those others.

552
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,236
It should be quite a show. After all, there's
four of you and one of Swifty Morgan.

553
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,275
- I thought Morgan was on our side.
- There have been some changes made.

554
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,436
Morgan, he took the Colonel's money,

555
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,109
then turned around and took money
from the other mine-owners.

556
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,470
It don't sound like fair dealings to me.

557
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,070
I know you fellas will teach him
that honesty's the best policy.

558
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,637
- You all look like mighty brave men.
- When's he coming, this Swifty Morgan?

559
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,911
Well, he should be along at any minute.

560
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,875
Here he comes.

561
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,951
You boys stay here.
I'll circle around, slip in behind him.

562
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,072
- I'll go with you.
- Hey, wait for us.

563
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,317
They ran away, Mr Morgan.

564
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,671
All four of 'em ran away
when they heard you were comin'.

565
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,950
<i>Act like you're disappointed.</i>

566
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,595
Ran away, did they?
Well, I'm sure disappointed.

567
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,350
- They went thataway.
- I'll let 'em go. They learned their lesson.

568
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,631
I'm a peaceable fella, really.

569
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,832
- Unless I'm riled.
- Bravo.

570
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,430
- Here comes Mr Barton.
- You did it, Mr Morgan. You did it.

571
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,473
First time I saw you, I said "He is more
than the stupid cowhand he looks like. "

572
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,192
I heard you say it.

573
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,031
Three cheers for Swifty Morgan who
saved this town from that octopus Ames.

574
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,357
Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip, hurray!

575
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,789
Hip, hip, hurray!

576
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,074
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gentlemen, start your jackasses.

577
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,156
Let's go to work.

578
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,112
Swifty.

579
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,835
- Swifty! I'll see you around, huh?
- Where are you goin'?

580
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,796
- I gotta get somethin' off my chest.
- What if them four fellas come... back?

581
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,720
Don't crowd my gun, son.

582
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,428
- How long has he been like that?
- Ever since he heard about the gunfight.

583
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,519
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Come on, Doc. Drink it down.

584
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,359
- Don't you think he's had enough?
- It's his own remedy.

585
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,950
Has me keep it behind the bar
in case he's needed when he's drunk.

586
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,038
Drink it down, will you, Doc?

587
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,435
"That no life lives forever;
That dead men rise up never;

588
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,830
And even the weariest river

589
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,833
winds somewhere safe to sea. "

590
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,236
Boys, put him in my bed.

591
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,233
Be as good as new in a couple of hours,
then he can take care of you.

592
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,036
Say, what is this strange sickness
you got? Do you mind my askin'?

593
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,550
Just enough to bust you in the mouth
if you ask again.

594
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,830
- Evening, Elmer.
- Howdy.

595
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,310
Silver dollars, Charlie.

596
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,556
And a pink lady.

597
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,196
Hear tell Taylor Barton's gonna throw a
big wingding at the mine tomorrow night.

598
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,074
Gonna have dance-hall girls,
music, the works.

599
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,670
- That's how I ruined my best Colt .45.
- Huh?

600
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,076
Man started talkin' to me
when I didn't wanna be talked to.

601
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,430
Bent the barrel over his head.

602
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,516
Excuse me.

603
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,675
<i>16, red and even.</i>

604
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,439
Ball rolls. Place your bet, sir.

605
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,599
Number 14, red and even.

606
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,508
Place your bet, sir.

607
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,989
All bets down.

608
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,789
Six, black, even.

609
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,629
Boss!

610
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,196
He just bet $4600 on number 23.

611
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,236
Spin her!

612
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,109
Hey!

613
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,471
You missed one.
That post there. You missed it.

614
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,835
Why don't you get married?
Keep you off the streets.

615
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,397
You can go right ahead. I know just how
you feel. I do the same thing often myself.

616
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,071
- You beat your head against posts?
- Not posts. Mostly the walls in my room.

617
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,749
Sometimes it's a tree, occasionally a rock.

618
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,077
- Do you play roulette?
- No. It's on account of this town.

619
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,478
Sometimes I feel like I'll never get out
of it, and then I wanna curl up and die.

620
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,559
When I feel like that, I just want
to beat my head against something.

621
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,989
- You don't like this town?
- Do you?

622
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,078
No, I don't like anything
west of Riverside Drive.

623
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,395
- Where's that?
- New York City.

624
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,637
- On the Hudson River?
- Yeah, I was born and raised there.

625
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,149
- Tell me about it.
- Tell you what about it?

626
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,350
All.

627
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,914
Well, let's see. They don't carry guns.

628
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,511
They got a cop on every street corner
to keep people from shootin' one another.

629
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,757
And they don't ride horses.

630
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,193
No, they got carriages and streetcars.
I think I'm getting homesick.

631
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,198
- Me too.
- You've never even been there.

632
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,197
I'm homesick for it.

633
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,518
I don't understand how you could leave
there to come to this damn, rotten West.

634
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,596
- My mother's fault.
- Your mother?

635
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,792
"Go west, young man" she said.
She said it a thousand times.

636
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,472
I'd always been told a boy's best friend
was his mother, so... here I am.

637
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,594
Frisco, Dodge, Lodestone, Denver.
Sure wish I was back there, though.

638
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,870
I thought you came out west
for your health.

639
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,116
- My health?
- Your chest.

640
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,800
- My chest?
- Doc told me about it.

641
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,309
- He did?
- Me and Doc, we're real close friends.

642
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,878
- He wouldn't have told anybody else.
- You better not tell anybody else or I'll...

643
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,072
I'll kill Doc and you won't have
another friend in this town.

644
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,829
I don't know why you're so sensitive.
A lot of people have the same thing.

645
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,873
- They do?
- People come out west for weak chests.

646
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,150
You don't cough
as much as most of them.

647
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,714
No, I don't...

648
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,919
Fire in the hole.

649
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,068
Would... Would you like to take
a walk, Miss Patience?

650
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,556
Oh... Are you sure the night air
wouldn't be bad for your...?

651
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,591
Not bad at all.

652
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,154
No, not bad at all.

653
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,674
- Sure is romantic, ain't it?
- Yeah, it sure is.

654
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,556
Uh... Latigo.

655
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,873
That thing you have, is that contagious?

656
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,310
I mean, could I catch it from you?

657
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,555
No.

658
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,877
Not unless you...

659
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,959
- No, you couldn't catch it even then.
- Good.

660
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,476
I never thought I'd get to kiss a man
who'd been to New York City.

661
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,876
I mean, actually, in person, New York City.

662
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,152
Say, did you hear bells?

663
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,798
Yeah.

664
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,270
I don't know what Miss Abigail sees in Pa.
He's as dull as dishwater.

665
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,590
"Good night, sweet prince. "

666
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,594
Good evening, sweet prince.

667
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,875
It ain't good manners to spy on people.

668
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,629
Is it good manners for you to pay
clandestine attention to my sister?

669
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,593
My intentions are nothing
if not honourable.

670
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,474
We share the same ancestors
as far back as Adam and Eve.

671
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,038
I desire no closer relationship to you
than that. Take him inside.

672
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,992
If Pa gets killed, I'll never get to Miss
Hunter's College on the Hudson River.

673
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,634
On top of which he'll be dead.

674
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,311
I see a situation here
where an honest man could make a dollar.

675
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,948
- Come on.
- Where are you goin'?

676
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,231
Among my other bad habits,
I'm a Peeping Tom.

677
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,552
- Stop it! Take your hands off me.
- She kicks like a mule.

678
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,150
Taylor! My darling,
what are they doing to you?

679
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,716
Nothing so far.
And what we do depends on you.

680
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,116
Oh, I wish I hadn't bought you
that book on Napoleon.

681
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,598
- Colonel, this is ridiculous.
- Indeed it is.

682
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,918
But not for long, because
one of two things is going to happen.

683
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,793
First, you will get
your workers out of the ground

684
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,559
and promise never to see my sister again.

685
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,958
- Or second, the other thing will happen.
- What other thing?

686
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,200
My boys will take you out in the swamp
and put a bullet through your thick head.

687
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,153
- That's murder.
- I've studied law.

688
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,998
Of course it's murder.

689
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,112
What are you gonna do?

690
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,472
I'm gonna save your father's life
and make an honest dollar.

691
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,790
that book five years ago Christmas.

692
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,829
- Where do you think you're going?
- In there.

693
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,394
- You ain't.
- How are you gonna stop me?

694
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,750
Like this.

695
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,713
Let me give you some advice,
my ugly friend.

696
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,593
Swifty Morgan's pal.

697
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,190
Sorry. I didn't know who you was.

698
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,880
Excuse me, will you, mister?

699
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,911
- Latigo.
- Evening.

700
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,758
Your window was open.

701
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,510
I couldn't help overhearing all the jabber
you folks were tossing back and forth.

702
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,915
So I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

703
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,275
Light me. Me and Swifty Morgan will take
over this trouble you miners are havin'.

704
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,554
The way I see it, the race
to the mother lode is just that. A race.

705
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,069
Now, me and Swifty,

706
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:52,117
we're gonna be around just to see
that everything is run fair and square.

707
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,712
Let me get this straight. You and Swifty
Morgan, by the power of Swifty's gun,

708
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,389
are gonna tell us
what we can and cannot do?

709
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,672
Long-winded way of sayin' it,
but that's about it.

710
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,316
You're laughing.

711
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,274
- I just thought of something very funny.
- Are you agreein', or what?

712
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,039
I don't see what else
I can do for the moment.

713
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,233
What about Miss Abigail and Pa? You're
not gonna let the Colonel separate them?

714
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,115
Me and Swifty Morgan
stand foursquare in favour of love.

715
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,511
You're laughin' again. Don't you think
you oughta let the rest of us in on it?

716
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,598
In due time, young man.

717
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,915
In due time.

718
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,913
- Morning.
- Morning.

719
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,996
I've been up all night worrying.

720
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,031
- What about?
- Swifty Morgan.

721
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,358
What if he finds out I've been pretending
to be him and comes lookin' for me?

722
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,755
- That ain't gonna happen.
- What if it does?

723
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,078
Jug... you let me worry
about Swifty Morgan.

724
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:13,110
Butcher, what would happen if during that
wingding Barton's throwing at the mine

725
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:19,793
a dynamite jackass was unloaded
in an elevator and accidentally blew up?

726
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,118
- The shaft would cave in.
- Take time to dig it out, wouldn't it?

727
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,153
- Probably hold up operations for a week.
- Maybe more.

728
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,317
What if Swifty Morgan catches us?

729
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,477
You let me worry about Swifty Morgan.

730
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,915
- Morning.
- Good morning.

731
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,474
You have to wait. This gentleman is first.

732
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,556
No hurry.

733
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,270
You have much sadness
in your face, señor.

734
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,791
Just stop to think. You always get
darkness just before the storm.

735
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,310
On the other hand,
it never rains but it pours.

736
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,477
Every cloud got a silver lining.

737
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,591
Troubles never come singly.

738
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,678
<i>- Are you gonna shave me or not?
- Si, señor.</i>

739
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,870
The squeaky wheel always gets the...

740
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,995
- Jenny!
- Goldie!

741
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,357
- If you aren't a sight for sore eyes.
- This is call for a celebration.

742
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,235
A bottle of champagne, Fred.
Private stock. Sit down.

743
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,955
- What you doin' in town, dearie?
- I'm lookin' for a man.

744
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,036
The woods is full of them, the mines are,

745
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,277
and the lone prairie
is lousy with cowpokes.

746
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,313
- So take your choice.
- This one was very special.

747
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,396
Here's to us!

748
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,149
- Where is this man?
- I don't know. That's the trouble.

749
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,397
- He run out on you?
- That or he got misplaced.

750
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,511
It's hard to misplace 'em.

751
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,316
- This one was special, huh?
- Bottled in bond, 14-carat, the best.

752
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,556
Mine answers the same description.

753
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,719
From the minute this man walked
into my place carryin' a spur...

754
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,070
- Spur?
- Just one.

755
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,398
<i>He says
"Ma'am, I've brung this a long way. "</i>

756
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,152
<i>"From Slim - boy from Texas, dies
in the prairie with your name on his lips. "</i>

757
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,034
- How did you know he said that?
- Because he said the same thing to me.

758
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,914
Goldie, your man is my man.
They're one and the same!

759
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,918
You mean he's here in Purgatory?

760
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,828
Let's think of a nice, clean way
to get him murdered.

761
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,195
- Ladies.
- It's him!

762
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,834
- It's my Lat.
- Let's keep the record straight.

763
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,511
I'm not your Lat. I'm neither one's Lat.
I'm sorry if I caused you any grief.

764
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,599
I'm sorry if I took your money.
But I'm gonna tell you something.

765
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,794
It's about love.
Love don't work unless both people give.

766
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,150
You gotta give till it hurts.

767
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,352
Fight!

768
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,674
Fire in the hole.

769
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,716
What's goin' on?

770
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,150
Lat!

771
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,748
Lat...?

772
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,836
Oh, Lat...

773
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,353
Boy, I tell you, Latigo, I just get plum sick

774
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,792
that the Sidewinder almost bushwhacked
you when you first come to town.

775
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,118
Not to mention hittin' you
with that there chair. You hear that music?

776
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,518
Boy, there's people just dancin' in the
streets over what you done for this town.

777
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,030
A man should spread happiness
as he walks through life. Ow!

778
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,755
- Hey, y'all just as good as new now.
- Thanks a lot, Doc.

779
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,953
Lat, I got drunk last night to get up
the nerve to have to tell you somethin'.

780
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,355
Somethin' I should have
told you from the start.

781
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,517
I was gonna put
jackass liniment on your chest.

782
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,916
Make you think that tattoo
was comin' off, even though it wasn't.

783
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,554
- But when Patience got involved...
- Involved?

784
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,274
I just couldn't cheat the man
she was gonna marry.

785
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,356
- Marry?
- The Sidewinder?

786
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,677
- That's what she told me.
- Well, she told you wrong.

787
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,756
Ow! Damn it!

788
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,996
Marry?

789
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,918
The Sidewinder?

790
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,515
Lat?

791
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,953
I thought I oughta see you face to face.
I hope I didn't hurt you too much.

792
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,355
I'm all right. The doc just said so.

793
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,995
- I just couldn't help feeling the way I did.
- I understand.

794
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,114
I mean, what if we'd kept going together,
gotten married, and you'd been killed,

795
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,471
and then I'd gone to identify the body?
I'd have looked a fool.

796
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,196
There you'd be, laid out, with
some other woman's name on your chest.

797
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,993
- Wouldn't that be awful?
- I understand. Let it go.

798
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,793
Or went to a picnic
and you got some ants in your shirt

799
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,789
and you had to rip it off
and everybody would see your chest?

800
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:45,389
I wish you did have TB
instead of that damn, rotten tattoo.

801
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,199
I'll be damned. That's the first time
I ever seen the Sidewinder cry.

802
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,710
Well, she's a sensitive girl.

803
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,359
- Everything under control, Mr Morgan?
- Better be.

804
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,313
Or I'll know the reason why.

805
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,155
Oh, darling, isn't it wonderful? No more
trouble between you and my brother.

806
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,478
I wish you'd known him before he started
reading that blasted book about Napoleon

807
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,068
and sticking his hand in his coat.

808
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,191
Let's dance.

809
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,516
You sure you know about blasting?

810
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,871
I got all my fingers and don't talk
in a high voice. Let's get at it.

811
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,878
I don't like this.
What happens if Morgan finds out?

812
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,152
You let me worry about Swifty Morgan.
Take us down.

813
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,355
- You're not dancing, Mr Smith?
- That makes two of us, Colonel.

814
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,268
- I should be. This is a happy occasion.
- It is?

815
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,790
It isn't every day
you get to meet Swifty Morgan.

816
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:26,711
- Could you point him out to me?
- There he is, right over there. That's him.

817
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:36,076
I'm surprised you didn't recognise him
by the cold, deadly look in his eye...

818
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,672
- Thought of somethin' funny again?
- As a matter of fact I did, yes.

819
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,999
- Colonel, isn't it time you let me in on it?
- It's precisely the time.

820
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,318
- So that's Swifty Morgan?
- In the flesh.

821
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,398
But that gentleman
has a beautiful head of hair.

822
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,751
Swifty Morgan is bald as an egg.

823
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,879
- An egg?
- An egg.

824
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,958
Surely, sir, you jest.

825
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,198
What action do you suppose Swifty would
take when he uncovers that fraud?

826
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,154
That cow-nurse
who is using his famous name? Oh!

827
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,236
I'll have to think it over.

828
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,876
I never sent for Swifty Morgan.

829
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,195
Just wrote out a few telegrams
pretending to,

830
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,633
because I knew my fool sister would tell
Barton I'd retained the famous gunman.

831
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,876
But I sent him a telegram today,

832
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,632
telling him an impostor was
representing himself as Swifty Morgan.

833
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:42,669
- Why aren't you laughing, young man?
- Somehow I just can't seem to make it.

834
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,196
My shaft!

835
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,679
- Take a week to dig that out.
- Maybe longer.

836
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,634
By that time, the real Swifty Morgan
will be in Purgatory.

837
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:09,914
- What the hell does that mean?
- Tell them what the hell it means, Smith.

838
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,759
Good night, gentlemen. Good luck.

839
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,876
Latigo?

840
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,870
Look, Mr Barton, I know
what you're thinkin' and... you're right.

841
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,754
There's a train pullin' out
to Denver tomorrow night. Be on it.

842
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,836
Both of you!

843
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:38,516
Like I said, a man should spread
happiness as he walks through life.

844
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,791
I think we've been spreadin' it
a little thick.

845
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,950
Tickets. Tickets, please.

846
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,636
Ma'am?

847
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,471
- You got a ticket, mister?
- In my hat.

848
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,635
Say, aren't you Swifty Morgan?

849
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,318
That's right.

850
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,591
It sure is a pleasure
to have you aboard, Mr Morgan.

851
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,359
Where are you headed?

852
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,799
Purgatory.

853
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,277
- Hey, you.
- Me?

854
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,958
You.

855
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,116
Give me a cigar, Charlie.

856
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,148
- Light me.
- There you go.

857
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,236
Stay out of this.

858
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,555
Light me or I'll stomp you.

859
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,155
- You're gonna let that...?
- I know what you're gonna say.

860
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,236
Excuse me.

861
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,473
Hey.

862
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:57,115
I'm not reformed quite enough
to put up with slobs like you.

863
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,390
Bartender, sarsaparilla.

864
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:07,438
- I'm glad you done that. He told on you.
- He...

865
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,915
- He what?
- He told on you.

866
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,839
He told me
them mine-owners gave you $5,000.

867
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,999
- You told me it was just $1,000.
- You got a right to be sore.

868
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,031
- I ain't sore.
- You're not? Why?

869
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,789
When you come along, I was hungry.
You give me a $100 bill.

870
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,229
I hadn't even seen one before.

871
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,555
Two bits.

872
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,557
- I haven't got any money.
- On me.

873
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,789
- Thanks, Jug, that's real nice of you.
- You fed me when I was hungry.

874
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,354
- Let's drink up and get moving.
- Where to?

875
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,472
Anywhere as long as it's away from here.

876
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,628
I ain't leaving.

877
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,710
Now, Jug, you know full well that the real
Swifty Morgan is coming to this town.

878
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,594
He's gonna put bullet holes
in both of us no end.

879
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,235
Except for one of us - me.
I ain't gonna be here.

880
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,511
- I'll be here.
- Why will you be here?

881
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:12,156
- Cos if I run, people will think I'm scared.
- I'm scared. Ain't you?

882
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,874
Yeah, but I ain't gonna run.

883
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,116
What do you care what people think here?

884
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,791
- I got my pride.
- That won't stop a.45 slug.

885
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,549
You know somethin'?
You're the smartest fella I ever met.

886
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,274
- You are a minority.
- You aim high.

887
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,597
Saddle-poundin' jobs
have never interested you none.

888
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,837
That's what I'm gonna do. Aim high.

889
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,396
I know I may not have too much
of a chance with Swifty Morgan.

890
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,433
- But suppose I down him.
- Well, supposin' you don't.

891
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,630
The odds are about a thousand to one.

892
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,515
You'll just end up an unknown character
under a wooden cross on Boot Hill.

893
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,471
Everybody winds up dead.

894
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,398
The smart ones try to postpone it
as long as possible.

895
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,909
My mind's made up.

896
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,510
Jug, I don't want to be responsible
for gettin' you dead.

897
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,871
Now, let's blow this town
and live to be a ripe old age, huh?

898
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,719
My mind's made up.
It's my chance to be somebody.

899
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:13,359
No chance - that's what you've got. Swifty
Morgan is greased lightning with a gun.

900
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,110
I been practisin'.

901
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,318
You just snap your fingers
when you want me to draw.

902
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,829
Oh, come on, Jug.

903
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,033
I'm slow, Jug, but you're the slowest.

904
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,357
Well, I might get in a lucky shot.

905
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,314
I got a feeling you're goin' on a long trip.
Now, why not go alive?

906
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,351
You don't have to stay. You take off.

907
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,190
<i>As soon as that killer hits town, I'm
cuttin' out that back door. Muy pronto.</i>

908
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,035
- Excuse me, sir.
- Why?

909
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,720
You gonna do something
I might take exception to?

910
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,513
Oh, no, sir.
Not while I'm in my right mind, sir.

911
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,997
- I'm the stationmaster here.
- All right. So far, so good.

912
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,511
You're the stationmaster here
and you're in your right mind.

913
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,871
- I'm also the telegrapher.
- Congratulations.

914
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,235
I know about the telegram Colonel Ames
sent you and the telegram you sent back.

915
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,151
- How do you know who I am?
- Anybody could look at you and see.

916
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,398
There is a man that killed
40 other men in cold blood.

917
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,071
- It shows, huh?
- Plain as the hair on your... On a goat.

918
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:04,073
All right, I'm Swifty Morgan. Now what?

919
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,829
That telegram you sent saying you was
coming to deal with the impostor...

920
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,713
- What about that telegram?
- I took it to the Ames place.

921
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,310
But the Colonel's sister grabbed it,
ripped it open and yelled

922
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,715
"So that filthy rat is coming here!"

923
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,436
- Meanin' me?
- Begging your pardon, sir, meaning you.

924
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,869
She showed it to Miss Patience.
That's a girl.

925
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,798
- That figures.
- Miss Patience started yellin'.

926
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,593
"That filthy murderer, Swifty Morgan,
is comin' here,

927
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,030
and that boy that's been posin' as him
has to get out of town. "

928
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,472
So I suppose this impostor took off
as fast as a horse would carry him?

929
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,750
- No, sir.
- He didn't?

930
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,715
No, sir. Right now,
he is down to the Eagle shootin' pool.

931
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,877
Well, now, here's what you do.

932
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,189
You trot on down to the Eagle and tell
this faker to come out in the street.

933
01:20:55,320 --> 01:21:04,433
You tell him that the real, genuine, 100
per cent, dyed-in-the-wool Swifty Morgan

934
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,676
is waitin' for him.

935
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,635
Sir, I'd really rather not get mixed up
in this if it's all the same to you.

936
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,070
It is not all the same to me.

937
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,279
- He's out in the street.
- Who's out in the street?

938
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,517
Swifty Morgan is out in the street.
The real Swifty Morgan.

939
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,553
When you go out, he'll shoot you
so full of holes you'll look like a strainer.

940
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,309
He's real put out about you
takin' his name in vain.

941
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:56,910
Don't go out there, you idiot.
Let's go out the back door.

942
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,118
- It's that time, friend.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

943
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,156
Lat!

944
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,319
- There ain't no ladies allowed in here.
- I ain't no lady. I'm Patience Barton.

945
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,911
- Swifty Morgan's out there on the street.
- I know. I was on my way out to see him.

946
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,909
- He ain't after you, he's after him.
- I got him into this. I'll get him out.

947
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,636
Listen, Lat, if you get killed, I'm gonna
have to marry one of these local crumbs.

948
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,591
Patience.

949
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,474
There are some things
a man can't ride around.

950
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,075
Then again, maybe he can.

951
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,996
I've gotta see this.

952
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,070
I've gotta see this.

953
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,110
You there, in the saloon.
This is Swifty Morgan.

954
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,949
- Come on out.
- I already am.

955
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,148
What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

956
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,510
If I were you, I'd aim high.

957
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,679
If you hit this dynamite, you'll blow
the whole town up. You along with it.

958
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,030
You tryin' to make a fool out of me?

959
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,030
- No, I'm trying to kill you, Mr Morgan.
- You can't gunfight sitting on your ass.

960
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,153
As a matter of fact, it doesn't belong
to me. It belongs to Taylor Barton.

961
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,033
- I stole it.
- Like you stole my name?

962
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,914
- Sorry about that.
- Not as sorry as you're gonna be.

963
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,478
Swifty Morgan hits only
what Swifty Morgan shoots at.

964
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,797
I'm sorry about that too.

965
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,948
Any time you feel lucky, mister.

966
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,712
Fire in the hole!

967
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:52,509
I shot myself.

968
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,032
Don't let me die with my boots on, mister.

969
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,276
Lat!

970
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,350
- He did it! He did it!
- He struck the mother lode!

971
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,391
- We're rich!
- No, ma'am.

972
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,592
The claim belongs to Taylor Barton.
His mule done it.

973
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:41,272
- You hear that, Abigail? It's my ass!
- Mine too.

974
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,277
- Lat!
- He's all right, honey.

975
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,233
Take more than a little dynamite
to kill Latigo Smith.

976
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,876
- You said you couldn't ride.
- I said that whorehouse was a gold mine.

977
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,278
- The tattoo. It's gone. It's been blown off.
- The hell you say!

978
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,233
Now we can get married
and have a picnic.

979
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,351
Boss!

980
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:06,438
Latigo just put $10,000 on 23.

981
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,000
I'm backin' his play.

982
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,596
Spin her!

983
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,194
I'll be damned. 23.

984
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,955
Sure is good
to have Mr Latigo on board again.

985
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:03,713
Serve the champagne, Sam. But not till
the folks have time to catch their breath.

986
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,917
Now, the way this story ends,
those two go to Denver to get married.

987
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:15,068
Patience never gets to go to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York,

988
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,236
but seven of her daughters do.

989
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,273
Taylor Barton, he gets his flat fixed
and marries Miss Abigail.

990
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,712
The colonel goes broke. Swifty Morgan
is still tryin' to get his boots off.

991
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,398
And me?

992
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,513
I go on to become a big star
in Italian Westerns.
