00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,351
First off, I'm not gonna die.

156
00:11:55,432 --> 00:11:56,552
You're not

That's why
you want to come with me.

Listen.

Dreams make good stories,

happens when we're awake.

'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

162

Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,672
I did?

164
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:10,952
No.

Out of the question.

I've been training
my whole life.

176

What is the point

177
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,311
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

178
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,592
You know why, Paul.

179
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:08,672
You're the future

00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,792
Yes.

182
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:14,432
And look where that got him.

183
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:20,831
I need you by my side.

184
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,831
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

185
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,392
What danger?

186
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,271
The Fremen? The desert?

187
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:29,232
Political danger.

188
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:34,151
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

189
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,191
and this threatens
the Emperor.

190
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,392
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

191
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,472
he sets the stage for a war

192
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,591
which would weaken
both houses.

193
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,751
But if we hold firm,

194
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,831
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

195
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,111
we could be stronger
than ever.

196
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,751
What does that mean?

197
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,912
Mining spice,

198
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,432
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

199
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,672
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

200
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,111
No.

201
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:01,192
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

202
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,871
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

203
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:06,351
Here on Caladan,

204
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,831
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

205
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,592
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

206
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,431
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

207
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:18,831
Learn what I do.

208
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,591
What if I'm not, Dad?

209
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,511
Not what?

210
00:14:24,912 --> 00:14:27,392
The future of House Atreides.

211
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,071
[Leto sighs]

212
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,591
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

213
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:47,152
I wanted to be a pilot.

214
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,671
You never told me that.

215
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,591
Your grandfather said,

216
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:57,312
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

217
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:00,872
He's called to it,
and he answers."

218
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:04,312
And if your answer is no...

219
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:10,351
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

220
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,311
my son.

221
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:26,831
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

222
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,951
In their memory...

223
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,112
give it a try.

224
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:44,472
[grunting]

225
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,672
[Gurney] Don't stand
with your back to the door.

226
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,311
How many times
do we have to tell you?

227
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:50,751
[Paul grunts]
I could tell it was you

228
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,511
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

229
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,231
[Gurney] Someone
might imitate my stride.

230
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:56,511
[Paul] I know the difference.

231
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,111
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

232
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:01,791
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

233
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,191
Choose your blade.

234
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:05,951
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

235
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,991
Give us a song instead.

236
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:13,432
[smacks lips] That's rude.

237
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,911
[Paul grunts]

238
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:19,791
[powers up]

239
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,031
[device beeps]

240
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,671
[Paul groans]

241
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,152
[panting]

242
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:31,711
[Gurney] Come on.

243
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,752
Come on.

244
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:33,992
Old man.

245
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,191
[exhales forcefully]

246
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,031
[Paul grunts]

247
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,112
[device beeps]

248
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,631
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

249
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:53,192
[groans]

250
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,191
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

251
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,431
- Mood?
- Yeah.

252
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,591
What's mood to do with it?

253
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:00,351
You fight
when the necessity arises,

254
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,391
no matter the mood.

255
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,512
Now fight!

256
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,871
[both grunting]

257
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,751
Come on!

258
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,231
- [device beeps]
- I have you.

259
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,951
Aye.

260
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,631
But look down, my lord.

261
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,191
You'd have joined me in death.

262
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,071
I see you found the mood.

263
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,591
[Gurney panting]

264
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:39,671
[devices deactivate]

265
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,311
Will it be that bad?

266
00:17:43,392 --> 00:17:45,791
You don't get it, do you?

267
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,071
You don't really understand

268
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,712
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

269
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,471
For 80 years,

270
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,592
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

271
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:58,072
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

272
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,191
Can you imagine the wealth?

273
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,111
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

274
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,591
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

275
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,591
They're not human,
they're brutal!

276
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,511
You have to be ready.

277
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:21,231
[dramatic ominous music
playing]

278
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,872
[Rabban] Lord Baron.

279
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,911
[Vladimir] Rabban.

280
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,551
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

281
00:18:58,391 --> 00:18:59,831
It's done.

282
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,351
[Vladimir] Very good.

283
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:06,232
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

284
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,271
How can the Emperor

285
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,791
[shouting]
take everything we've built

286
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,071
and give it to that Duke?

287
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,391
How?

288
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:17,271
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

289
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,311
[breathes heavily]

290
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,991
What does he mean?

291
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:29,071
When is a gift not a gift?

292
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,151
The Atreides' voice is rising,

293
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,391
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

294
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,431
A dangerous, jealous man.

295
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,391
[ominous music playing]

296
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,111
[voices chanting indistinctly]

297
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,031
[voices continue chanting]

298
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:39,671
[voices fade]

299
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,151
Paul.

300
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,231
[softly] Paul, wake up.

301
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,791
What's wrong?

302
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,071
Get dressed and come with me.

303
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:24,991
What is this?

304
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,871
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

305
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,991
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

306
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,471
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

307
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,351
She would like to meet you.

308
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,471
Why?

309
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,791
She wants to know
about your dreams.

310
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,871
How does she know
about my dreams?

311
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:46,911
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

312
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:49,271
He only needs a moment.

313
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,271
[Dr. Yueh] Hello, young master.

314
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,951
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

315
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:00,951
What's happening?

316
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,591
[whispering in Mandarin] The Bene Gesserit say
they serve the greater good...

317
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,104
But, meaning no disrespect
to your lady mother...

318
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,225
they also serve their own designs.

319
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,783
What are you saying?

320
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:20,868
Go carefully.

321
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,311
[in English] His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

322
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,227
[in sign language]
Tell no one of this.

323
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:38,911
Paul...

324
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,175
[in sign language]
Remember your training.

325
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:11,151
[eerie voices] <i>Who are you?</i>

326
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,511
Defiance in the eyes.

327
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,191
Like his father.

328
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,790
Leave us.

329
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:21,831
[whispers]
You must do everything

330
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:23,231
the Reverend Mother tells you.

331
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:27,991
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

332
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,191
[Mohiam in distorted voice]
Come here.

333
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,790
Kneel.

334
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,591
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

335
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,871
[in normal voice] Put
your right hand in the box.

336
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:49,271
Your mother bade you obey me.

337
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:51,031
[Paul breathes heavily]

338
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:59,391
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

339
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:01,991
A poison needle.

340
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,310
Instant death.

341
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,791
The test is simple.

342
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:08,311
Remove your hand from the box

343
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,911
and you die.

344
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,511
What's in the box?

345
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,751
Pain.

346
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,350
- [scoffs]
- No need to call the guards.

347
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,990
<i>Your mother stands
behind that door.</i>

348
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,711
<i>No one would get past her.</i>

349
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:30,831
[Paul]
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

350
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,791
An animal caught in a trap

351
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,551
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

352
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,471
What will you do?

353
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:45,471
[high-pitched whirring]

354
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,590
[groans]

355
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,431
[exhales sharply]

356
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:01,911
[sobbing softly]

357
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:04,311
[shudders]

358
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:11,111
- [grunts in pain]
- Silence.

359
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,830
[Paul breathing raggedly]

360
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,511
- [Paul grunts in pain]
- [shuddering]

361
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,350
I must not fear.

362
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,551
I must not fear.

363
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,070
[stifles grunt, whimpers]

364
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,631
[suppressed groan]

365
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,511
Fear is the mind-killer.

366
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,711
<i>Fear</i>

367
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,070
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

368
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,670
- [whirring intensifies]
- [Paul grunts]

369
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,431
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

370
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:43,591
to pass over me
and through me.

371
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,511
[ominous music playing]

372
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,030
[dramatic lamentation music
playing]

373
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,271
[searing]

374
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,631
And when it has gone past...

375
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,710
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path. [gasps]

376
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:16,231
[sobs] And where the fear
has gone,

377
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,031
there will be nothing.

378
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,270
Only I will remain.

379
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,591
Enough.

380
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,791
- [panting]
- [whirring fading]

381
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,030
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

382
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:50,591
we sift people.

383
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,431
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

384
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,030
like an animal,

385
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:57,230
we could not let you live.

386
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,871
You inherit too much power.

387
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,030
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

388
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,790
Because you are Jessica's son.

389
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:06,390
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

390
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:08,951
Jessica?

391
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,951
You've been training him
in the Way.

392
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,750
Tell me about these dreams.

393
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:26,871
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

394
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:30,991
A girl.

395
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,671
On Arrakis.

396
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,071
Have you dreamt of her before?

397
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,271
Many times.

398
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,830
Do you often dream
things that happen

399
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,031
just as you dreamed them?

400
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:49,551
Not exactly.

401
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,591
Goodbye, young human.

402
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,911
I hope you live.

403
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,431
[Lady Jessica]
Did you have to go that far?

404
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:08,191
[Mohiam] You chose
to train him in the Way,

405
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,111
in defiance of our rule.

406
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,670
He wields our power.

407
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:14,430
He had to be
tested to the limits.

408
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,631
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

409
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,591
You were told
to bear only daughters.

410
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,990
But you, in your pride,

411
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:22,910
thought you could
produce the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

412
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,351
Was I wrong?

413
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,070
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

414
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,311
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

415
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,311
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

416
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,070
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

417
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:37,630
We have other prospects

418
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,991
if he fails his promise.

419
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,870
Do you see so little hope?

420
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:46,270
[Mohiam] On Arrakis,
we have done

421
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,910
all we can for you.

422
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,751
A path has been laid.

423
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,990
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

424
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,630
[voices murmuring
indistinctly]

425
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,310
[breathes heavily]

426
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,591
[Lady Jessica] Paul.

427
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,950
[Paul] What does it mean?

428
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,870
That I could be The One?

429
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,230
[Lady Jessica] You heard.

430
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:49,671
The Bene Gesserit serve

431
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,151
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

432
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,351
but there's more to it.

433
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,870
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

434
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,311
from the shadows.

435
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,951
I know.

436
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,390
You don't know everything.

437
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,670
For thousands of years,

438
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:07,270
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

439
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,390
- to bring forth...
- The One?

440
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,911
A mind...

441
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,750
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

442
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,271
Past and future.

443
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,391
Who can help us
into a better future.

444
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,110
We think he's very close now.

445
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,071
Some believe he's here.

446
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,831
All part of a plan.

447
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,950
[slow dramatic music playing]

448
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,950
[slow dramatic music
continues]

449
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,710
[spaceship lands]

450
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:51,271
Shield.

451
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,310
[metallic groan]

452
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,110
[metallic thudding]

453
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,190
[door opens]

454
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,791
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

455
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,790
Blown past falling sand..."

456
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,430
[bagpipe playing]

457
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,070
[band playing
patriotic music]

458
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:19,710
Thufir Hawat.

459
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,430
Young master!

460
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,710
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

461
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,630
Exciting, to say the least.

462
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,071
My lord.

463
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,710
How are you, old friend?

464
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,030
My advance team
has secured the city.

465
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,990
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

466
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,830
My lady.

467
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,991
[woman] <i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

468
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,310
[crowd clamoring]

469
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,990
[man] <i>Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

470
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,950
[woman 2] <i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

471
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,190
[crowd chanting]
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

472
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,110
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

473
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,990
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

474
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,950
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

475
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,270
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

476
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,151
They follow
their old masters' rules.

477
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,310
Mandatory attendance.

478
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,590
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

479
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,550
[crowd continues chanting]

480
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,350
Atreides!

481
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,870
[soldiers chanting]
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

482
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,550
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

483
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,990
Atreides! Atreides!

484
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,670
[Thufir] Let's get you
out of the sun.

485
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,150
The heat can kill
in this place.

486
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,190
[ornithopters powering up]

487
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,390
They were pointing at us.

488
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,630
What are they shouting?

489
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,470
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

490
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,150
It's their name for "messiah."

491
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,390
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

492
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,830
Planting superstitions.

493
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,590
Preparing the way, Paul.

494
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,910
These people
have waited for centuries

495
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,670
for the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

496
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,390
They see you,

497
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,030
they see the signs.

498
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,870
They see
what they've been told to see.

499
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,750
We're good to go.

500
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,750
[Thufir] Shield Wall.

501
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,630
Protects the city
from the weather

502
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,150
and the worms.

503
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,750
[eerie dramatic music playing]

504
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,790
[Gurney] The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

505
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,990
[Leto] Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

506
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,550
on our comms system.

507
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,030
It's so quiet.

508
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,990
[Gurney] Yeah.

509
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,870
That's what worries me, too.

510
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,030
[Leto] There's the spaceport

511
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,629
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

512
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,710
Our two
most vulnerable points.

513
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,030
I want you guarding them.

514
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,630
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

515
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,670
- we're dead here.
- [Lanville] My lord.

516
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,270
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

517
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,309
[Leto sighs]

518
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,870
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

519
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,310
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

520
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,870
That's what they say.

521
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,510
That's what they say.

522
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,470
[Thufir] Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

523
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,030
What is your name?

524
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,189
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

525
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,870
[Lady Jessica]
The rest of you may go.

526
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,030
Thank you.

527
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,110
Shadout.

528
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,910
It's an old Chakobsa word.

529
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,030
"Well-dipper."

530
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,790
[speaking Chakobsa]

531
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,030
[in English]
You know the ancient tongues?

532
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,510
I know many things.

533
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,630
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

534
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,230
[in sign language] Not now.
[speaking] If you mean to harm me,

535
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,710
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

536
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,190
it won't be enough.

537
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:09,270
The weapon is meant as a gift

538
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,270
if you are truly The One.

539
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:28,990
Do you know this?

540
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,829
It's a crysknife.

541
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,830
Do you know its meaning?

542
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,501
[in sign language]
Be ready for violence.

543
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,430
It's a maker...

544
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,230
[wailing]

545
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:49,670
A maker of the deep desert.

546
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,430
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

547
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,990
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

548
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:58,670
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

549
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,790
The mother and the son.

550
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,150
It is yours.

551
00:41:09,669 --> 00:41:13,150
Tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

<i>Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

554
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:48,750
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

555
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,830
[Paul] Hello.

556
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,710
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

557
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,950
They're out here.

558
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,549
[gardener] Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

559
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,510
They don't care
about heatstroke.

560
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,269
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

561
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,350
[gardener] Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

562
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,790
They can't survive without me.

563
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,030
Each one of these

564
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,589
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

565
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:31,230
Twenty palm trees.

566
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,910
A hundred lives.

567
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,950
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

568
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,390
No, no, no.

569
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,990
These are sacred.

570
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,590
Old dream.

571
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,230
[narrator over speakers]
<i>The largest and most dangerous</i>

[Paul] It's a hunter-seeker.

592
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,589
The operator must be nearby.

Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,189
You have my resignation.

600
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,510
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

601
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:13,750
Sire, my honor demands...

602
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,469
They tried to take
the life of my son!

I don't give a damn
about your honor.

604
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:20,549
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

605
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,789
Your Grace.

606
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:30,949
[Mohiam] The thing must leave.

607
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,429
[man] You can speak
without fear.

608
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,710
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

609
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:37,190
[Mohiam in distorted voice]
Get out.

610
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:43,110
[normal voice] It understands.

611
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:44,669
Activate silence.

612
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:51,946
[low, muffled speech]
What is the Emperor's message?

613
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:55,040
He will strengthen your hand.

614
00:45:57,179 --> 00:45:59,345
With his Sardaukar army.

615
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,829
[Mohiam] It must
never be known.

616
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,709
[Vladimir] There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

617
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,269
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

618
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,950
[Mohiam] On that matter,

619
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:13,069
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

620
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,030
But his wife
is under our protection

621
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,630
and by extension, her son.

622
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:20,110
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

623
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,029
[sighs]

624
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,949
House Harkonnen
would never dream

625
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,869
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

626
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,469
I give you my word.

627
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,150
We will not harm them.

628
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:54,029
If the Duke's son lives...

629
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:56,509
No Atreides will live.

630
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,909
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

631
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,030
She sees too much.

632
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,789
I said I would not harm them.

633
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,070
And I shall not.

634
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,349
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

635
00:47:06,509 --> 00:47:08,989
And the desert takes the weak.

636
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,189
My desert.

00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,550
[Gurney] Your first
strategy meeting.

641
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:26,790
Paul Atreides,

642
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:28,710
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

643
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:29,869

644
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,110
[laughter]

645
00:47:32,189 --> 00:47:34,269
[whispers] Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

646
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:35,589
Gotta keep an eye on you.

647
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:37,669
Attention!

648
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:46,670
Let's get started.

649
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,749
Thufir. Operations.

650
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:53,390
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

651
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:55,669
[men murmuring]

652
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:56,989
The Harkonnens were taking

653
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,390
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

654
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:03,029
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

655
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,549
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

656
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,909
[Thufir] We won't see profits
like that for a while.

657
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:09,069
Not with the equipment
they left us.

658
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,549
How bad is it?

659
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:18,949
[Thufir] These are spice silos.

660
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,229
We're meant
to fill every crate.

661
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,149
[Paul] All of them?

662
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,950
Every 25 standard days.

663
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:30,270
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

664
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,989
[Paul] But who's
meant to arbitrate?

665
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,229
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

666
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,550
to oversee the transition?

667
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:35,989
Who did the Emperor appoint?

668
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,749
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

669
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:40,269
Been here 20 years.

670
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:42,109
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

671
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:45,110
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

672
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,509
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

673
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,950
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

674
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,430
A meeting's long overdue.

675
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,630
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

676
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,150
A hostage. [chuckles]

677
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,469
I love it.

678
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:56,589
Hmm.

679
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,829
- [engine roaring]
- He's here, my lord.

680
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:21,710
[Duncan well-wishing
in Chakobsa]

681
00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:23,669
[in English] Take care
of them. They are friends.

682
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:24,669
[Paul] Duncan!

683
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,069
[Duncan] Ah! My boy!

684
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:29,189
[both laughing]

685
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:32,749
I swear you're getting taller.

686
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,429
[Paul] Well,
you smell much worse.

687
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:39,869
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

688
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:40,989
Hidden in the desert,

689
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:42,710
in a community
called a <i>sietch.</i>

690
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:44,029
Stilgar, the leader
of that <i>sietch,</i>

691
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,829
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

692
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:48,149
This <i>sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

693
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:49,270
It's underground.

694
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:51,229
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

695
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:52,909
How big was the place?

696
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,349
I'd say 10,000 people.

697
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,909
And there are
hundreds of <i>sietches.</i>

698
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,430
Millions of Fremen.

699
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:01,589
You were right.

700
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:04,869
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

701
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:07,069
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

702
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:08,549
I never saw them.

703
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,230
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

704
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,829
And I gotta tell you,

705
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,229
I have never come
so close to dying.

706
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:17,989
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

707
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:19,590
They fight like demons.

708
00:50:19,669 --> 00:50:21,469
Desert power.

709
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,469
Duncan.

710
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:26,949
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

711
00:50:27,029 --> 00:50:28,349
[man] Sire.

712
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:30,909
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

713
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,949
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

714
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:35,189
Let him pass.

715
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,469
[Gurney] Stop there.

716
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,150
Hey! Hey!

717
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,550
Mm.

718
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:00,470
[Leto] Stilgar.

719
00:51:01,389 --> 00:51:02,509
Welcome.

720
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:05,950
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

721
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,749
of any man that respects mine.

722
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:10,829
[inhales deeply]

723
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:11,909
[Stilgar] Hmm.

724
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:14,669
[inhales deeply]

725
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,469
[Duncan] Hold.

726
00:51:17,669 --> 00:51:19,509
[clears throat]
Thank you, Stilgar,

727
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:22,869
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

728
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,189
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

729
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,749
[Leto snorts]

730
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,909
[Leto] I'm glad you've come.

731
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,670
I believe your people and mine

732
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:37,989
have much
to offer one another.

733
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,389
No, no, you are Outworlders.

734
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,069
You come here for the spice,

735
00:51:41,149 --> 00:51:43,509
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

736
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,189
That's true.

737
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:50,829
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

738
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:53,349
Name what you want.

739
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,589
If it's in my power to grant,

740
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:56,069
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

741
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,909
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our <i>sietches.</i>

742
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,709
Do not trespass in our lands.

743
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:05,109
The desert was ours
long before you came.

744
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,909
So, come and dig your spice,

745
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:08,149
but when you have it,

746
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:10,270
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

747
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,069
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

748
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:14,829
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

749
00:52:14,909 --> 00:52:17,389
[Leto] Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

750
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:18,749
The Emperor

751
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:21,469
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

752
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,229
to rule and protect.

753
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:25,709
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

754
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,509
if duty compels me.

755
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,389
But your <i>sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

756
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:33,949
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

757
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:40,029
That's very honorable.

758
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,669
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

759
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:44,829
[Paul] Won't you stay?

760
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:46,229
We would honor you.

761
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:49,269
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

762
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:53,407
[speaking Chakobsa]
I recognize you.

763
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,669
I don't like him.

764
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,909
Our plan bears fruit.

765
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,349
But it will take time?

766
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:06,629
Yes.

767
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:09,749
It will take time.

768
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,709
Here, this is for you.

769
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:19,549
It's a paracompass.

770
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,029
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

771
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:24,629
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

772
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:26,749
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

773
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,429
[Paul] The Fremen make these?

774
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,269
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

775
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,709
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

776
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:33,669
[Gurney] What the hell
is a sand compactor?

777
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:36,829
[Duncan]
That's a sand compactor.

778
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:37,949
[all chuckle]

779
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:40,669
My God, man,
you've gone native.

780
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:41,989
You admire them.

781
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:44,669
I do.

782
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:47,309
They're fierce but loyal.

783
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,109
They're attuned to the desert.

784
00:53:49,189 --> 00:53:50,389
Part of it.

785
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:52,509
It's part of them.

786
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:53,709
You wait till you see it.

787
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:55,869
It's beautiful out there.

788
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,949
[announcer]
<i>Sunrise warning, all workers.</i>

789

[dramatic music continues]

795
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,229
The Judge of the Change, sire.

796
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:47,189
Dr. Liet Kynes.

797
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,629
My lord Duke.

798
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,909
Welcome to Arrakis.

799
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,989
[Paul] You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

800
00:54:53,068 --> 00:54:54,909
Thank you for the stillsuits.

801
00:54:54,988 --> 00:54:56,989
They are of Fremen make.

802
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,109
The best.

803
00:54:58,189 --> 00:54:59,429
With your permission, sire,

804
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:00,829
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

805
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:01,988
[Leto] Whoa.

806
00:55:02,668 --> 00:55:03,829
It's all right.

807
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,509
It's all right.

808
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:11,029
[chuckles lightly] Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

809
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,509
A stillsuit

810
00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:20,389
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

811
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:21,989
Even this early
in the morning,

812
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,748
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

813
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,789
It cools the body

814
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:31,549
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

815
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:34,789
Your body's movements
provide the power.

816
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,509
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

817
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:38,589
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

818
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,869
[Leto] Mm.

819
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,229
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

820
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:43,509
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

821
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:44,869
[Leto] Most impressive.

822
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,788
Let's have a look at you, lad.

823
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:51,389
You've...

824
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:52,629
worn a stillsuit before?

825
00:55:52,709 --> 00:55:54,269
No, this is my first time.

826
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,908
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

827
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,749
Who taught you to do that?

828
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:02,789
It seemed the right way.

829
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,483
[speaking Chakobsa] He shall know your ways as
though born to them.

830
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:11,229
[in English] Are you Fremen?

831
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:16,669
I am accepted
in both <i>sietch</i> and village.

832
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,309
Now, come and see
the spice sands

833
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:22,309
on which
your livelihood depends.

834
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:29,068
[dramatic music playing]

835
00:56:58,708 --> 00:56:59,869
What would you do

836
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,429
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

837
00:57:01,509 --> 00:57:03,549
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

838
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,148
It's worm territory.

839
00:57:07,669 --> 00:57:08,708
Dust cloud.

840
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:11,868
[Leto] I see it.

841
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,989
That's one of your harvesters.

842
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:18,549
[dramatic music continues]

843
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:33,388
[machinery clunking]

844
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:39,988
[Dr. Kynes]
You can see the spice

845
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:41,869
scattered over the surface.

846
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,229
A rich spice bed

847
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:46,708
by the color.

848
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:49,188
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

849
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:05,829
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

850
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:08,949
[Paul] Wormsign?

851
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:11,229
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

852
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:13,429
Worms travel deep
but get closer

853
00:58:13,509 --> 00:58:14,828
to the surface
when they attack.

854
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:17,028
If you are patient,

855
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,869
we should see one.

856
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:21,349
A worm always comes?

857
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:24,109
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

858
00:58:24,189 --> 00:58:26,188
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

859
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,668
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

860
00:58:28,749 --> 00:58:29,949
It attracts the worms

861
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:32,589
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

862
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:36,228
Is that a worm?

863
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,668
[Dr. Kynes] Big one.

864
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:51,988

They'll call a carryall

[tense music playing]

1070
01:15:23,988 --> 01:15:25,068
[whimpers]

1071
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:35,067
[Lieutenant] Sir. Sir.

1072
01:15:35,908 --> 01:15:37,628
The shield's come down.

1073
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:39,867
- [alarm blaring]
- [soldiers clamoring]

1074
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:48,028
[Gurney] God in heaven.

1075
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:50,947
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

1076
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:53,068
[soldiers shouting]

1077
01:15:53,147 --> 01:15:55,347
[dramatic music playing]

1078
01:15:56,908 --> 01:15:57,988
[missile whistles]

1079
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,867
Go! Go! Go!

1080
01:16:35,628 --> 01:16:37,348
[soldiers screaming]

1081
01:16:56,588 --> 01:16:57,747
[missile whistles]

1082
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:30,827
[grunting]

1083
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:34,148
[groans]

1084
01:17:34,227 --> 01:17:36,147
With me! With me!

1085
01:17:36,908 --> 01:17:38,747
[soldiers yelling]

1086
01:17:39,908 --> 01:17:41,907
[dramatic music continues]

1087
01:18:00,827 --> 01:18:02,467
[marching footsteps]

1088
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:04,987
[Lieutenant] Atreides!

1089
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:06,187
[guards] Atreides!

1090
01:18:10,027 --> 01:18:11,908
[all grunting in unison]

1091
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:15,468
[synchronized grunting]

1092
01:18:18,868 --> 01:18:20,148
[all grunting]

1093
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:36,148
- [Atreides guard 1] Sardaukar!
- [Atreides guard 2] Sardaukar!

1094
01:18:39,627 --> 01:18:41,108
[groaning]

1095
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,267
I'm sorry, my lord.

1096
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:05,827
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

1097
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,187
[Leto breathing raggedly]

1098
01:19:08,268 --> 01:19:09,228
Why?

1099
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:12,027
I had no choice.

1100
01:19:12,108 --> 01:19:15,788
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

1101
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:18,307
They take her apart
like a doll.

1102
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:21,308
I will buy her freedom.

1103
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:22,908
And you are the price.

1104
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:29,027
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

1105
01:19:29,707 --> 01:19:31,347
And you

1106
01:19:31,428 --> 01:19:33,228
will kill a man for me.

1107
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:40,827
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

1108
01:19:40,908 --> 01:19:45,627
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

1109
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:49,788
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

1110
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:52,467
It will be your last breath.

1111
01:19:52,548 --> 01:19:54,787
But if you choose
your moment well,

1112
01:19:56,027 --> 01:19:58,227
it will also be the Baron's.

1113
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:17,788
[tense music playing]

1114
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:36,227
[yelling]

1115
01:20:55,947 --> 01:20:57,387
[soldiers speak indistinctly]

1116
01:21:06,147 --> 01:21:07,227
[soldier groans]

1117
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:10,988
[grunts]

1118
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:29,147
Paul.

1119
01:21:39,268 --> 01:21:40,947
[door closes]

1120
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:44,497
[trooper 1 speaking Harkonnen]
We'll drop them in the desert.

1121
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:48,253
Let the worms have them.

1122
01:21:49,745 --> 01:21:51,893
[trooper 2 speaking]
Why don't we just cut their throats?

1123
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,185
[trooper 1 speaking]
We could face a Truthsayer.

1124
01:21:57,218 --> 01:21:59,773
We can say we didn't kill them.

1125
01:22:06,607 --> 01:22:09,209
[in sign language]
The scarred one is deaf.

1126
01:22:41,788 --> 01:22:43,708
[all grunting]

1127
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:50,267
[Duncan] To hell, dogs!

1128
01:22:52,027 --> 01:22:52,987
[grunts]

1129
01:23:10,188 --> 01:23:11,507
[alarm beeping]

1130
01:24:21,947 --> 01:24:24,627
[trooper 1 in English]
I've never had a highborn.

1131
01:24:26,907 --> 01:24:28,187
You?

1132
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:30,267
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

1133
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:33,988
[trooper 1]
She's highborn enough for me.

1134
01:24:34,067 --> 01:24:36,227
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

1135
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:38,227
And give her a long goodbye.

1136
01:24:38,307 --> 01:24:40,028
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

1137
01:24:41,427 --> 01:24:42,427
Don't talk.

1138
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:50,635
[in sign language]
Don't! You are not ready.

1139
01:24:50,987 --> 01:24:52,467
[Paul sighs]

1140
01:24:53,307 --> 01:24:54,747
[sternly] Remove her gag.

1141
01:25:02,507 --> 01:25:03,387
[retches]

1142
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:05,187
[trooper 1] Shut up.

1143
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:08,240
[in sign language]
Find the right pitch.

1144
01:25:08,427 --> 01:25:10,307
[panting]

1145
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:16,461
[trooper 1 speaking Harkonnen]
We're far enough.

1146
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:18,868
Let's throw the boy out.

1147
01:25:19,388 --> 01:25:20,908
[Paul breathing deeply]

1148
01:25:32,947 --> 01:25:34,147
[in distorted voice]
Remove her gag.

1149
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:41,147
[in distorted voice] Kill him.

1150
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:50,867
[in distorted voice]
Set us free.

1151
01:25:55,947 --> 01:25:58,307
[speaking Harkonnen]

1152
01:26:00,027 --> 01:26:01,187
[trooper 1 groans]

1153
01:26:02,187 --> 01:26:03,707
[Lady Jessica grunting]

1154
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:05,067
[in distorted voice] Stop!

1155
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:06,627
Cut the rope.

1156
01:26:09,227 --> 01:26:10,627
Give me the knife.

1157
01:26:11,227 --> 01:26:12,467
[stabs]

1158
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:15,667
[grunts]

1159
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:21,947
[in normal voice]
Your pitch was too forced.

1160
01:26:29,507 --> 01:26:31,027
[Paul] It's a fremkit.

1161
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:37,307
[man speaks Harkonnen
over radio]

1162
01:26:41,267 --> 01:26:43,387
[engine shuts off]

1163
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:44,627
They've crippled the ship.

1164
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:00,787
[distant explosions]

1165
01:27:09,227 --> 01:27:10,467
[gasping]

1166
01:27:15,267 --> 01:27:16,427
[sighs]

1167
01:27:31,387 --> 01:27:33,027
[explosions continue]

1168
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:51,907
[wheezing softly]

1169
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:55,787
[man] Mmm.

1170
01:28:01,627 --> 01:28:02,987
[Vladimir grunts softly]

1171
01:28:05,427 --> 01:28:07,427
[cutlery clinking]

1172
01:28:07,507 --> 01:28:08,627
[Vladimir grunts]

1173
01:28:13,347 --> 01:28:14,707
Ah.

1174
01:28:14,787 --> 01:28:16,027
[munching]

1175
01:28:16,107 --> 01:28:19,067
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

1176
01:28:20,067 --> 01:28:21,827
[wind howling]

1177
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:27,587
[Paul grunts]

1178
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:39,227
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

1179
01:28:39,307 --> 01:28:41,787
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

1180
01:28:41,867 --> 01:28:43,907
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

1181
01:28:43,987 --> 01:28:46,626
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

1182
01:28:50,347 --> 01:28:51,947
[wheezing weakly]

1183
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:54,667
My lord Baron.

1184
01:28:56,027 --> 01:28:57,147
Dr. Yueh.

1185
01:28:57,227 --> 01:28:58,826
[Vladimir] The traitor.

1186
01:28:59,987 --> 01:29:01,067
What do you want?

1187
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:04,347
I jammed their comms

1188
01:29:04,427 --> 01:29:06,347
and lowered their shields.

1189
01:29:06,427 --> 01:29:07,627
[Vladimir] Hmm.

1190
01:29:07,707 --> 01:29:09,867
[Dr. Yueh] I delivered
the Duke and his family.

1191
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:12,347
[Vladimir] The bargain
to the letter.

1192
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:14,827
And what was I to do for you?

1193
01:29:14,907 --> 01:29:16,987
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

1194
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:19,867
[Vladimir] Yes.

1195
01:29:22,187 --> 01:29:24,187
[slow sinister music playing]

1196
01:29:47,587 --> 01:29:49,387
[chewing loudly]

1197
01:29:51,947 --> 01:29:54,467
I said I'd set her free.

1198
01:29:54,547 --> 01:29:56,306
That you could join her.

1199
01:29:59,147 --> 01:30:00,187
[Dr. Yueh grunts]

1200
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:02,107
So, join her.

1201
01:30:02,186 --> 01:30:03,986
- [knife slices]
- [body thuds]

1202
01:30:10,627 --> 01:30:12,787
What do you think is next?

1203
01:30:16,307 --> 01:30:18,506
[Paul] It's a thumper.

1204
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:20,107
No stillsuits.

1205
01:30:20,187 --> 01:30:22,027
The one thing
we actually need.

1206
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:30,347
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

1207
01:30:31,507 --> 01:30:33,107
But no more.

1208
01:30:34,507 --> 01:30:38,587
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1209
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,426
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

1210
01:30:44,107 --> 01:30:47,067
And your bloodline
ends forever.

1211
01:30:48,826 --> 01:30:50,707
[Leto mumbling]

1212
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:00,707
What did you say?

1213
01:31:10,346 --> 01:31:11,746
[softly] Here I am...

1214
01:31:12,987 --> 01:31:14,707
<i>here I remain.</i>

1215
01:31:16,307 --> 01:31:17,667
[tooth crunches]

1216
01:31:17,747 --> 01:31:19,227
[exhales forcefully]

1217

[engine roaring in distance]

1223
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:54,866
[Duncan] Kynes!

1224
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:57,787
It's not safe for you here.

1225
01:32:57,866 --> 01:32:59,067
[Duncan] Will you tell
the Great Houses

1226
01:32:59,146 --> 01:33:00,547
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1227
01:33:00,626 --> 01:33:03,106
How the best of them
were murdered?

1228
01:33:03,187 --> 01:33:05,747
I am commanded to say nothing.

1229
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,306
To see nothing.

1230
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:12,347
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1231
01:33:12,426 --> 01:33:14,466
[lamentation music continues]

1232
01:33:35,707 --> 01:33:37,386

[coughing]

1235
01:33:58,587 --> 01:34:00,866
[Paul] There's spice
in the tent.

1236
01:34:08,867 --> 01:34:10,466
[coughing]

1237
01:34:11,307 --> 01:34:12,386
[clears throat]

1238
01:34:19,947 --> 01:34:22,106
[slow dramatic music playing]

1239
01:34:32,106 --> 01:34:34,347
[voices whispering
indistinctly]

1240
01:34:46,027 --> 01:34:48,186
[soldiers clamoring]

[slow ominous music playing]

1243
01:35:22,986 --> 01:35:25,827
That's the future.
It's coming.

1244
01:35:29,426 --> 01:35:31,427
[ominous music continues]

1245
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:41,906
Holy war
spreading across the universe

1246
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:43,227
like unquenchable fire.

1247
01:35:45,226 --> 01:35:47,227
[voices continue whispering]

1248
01:35:53,066 --> 01:35:55,547
[thunder rumbling]

1249
01:35:55,626 --> 01:35:58,427
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1250
01:35:58,506 --> 01:36:01,467
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1251
01:36:01,546 --> 01:36:03,586
[voices continue whispering]

1252
01:36:10,066 --> 01:36:12,467
Somebody help me, please.

1253
01:36:13,147 --> 01:36:14,266
Paul.

1254
01:36:16,466 --> 01:36:18,106
It's coming.

1255
01:36:18,187 --> 01:36:19,547
<i>I see a holy war spreading</i>

1256
01:36:19,626 --> 01:36:21,467
<i>across the universe
like unquenchable fire.</i>

1257
01:36:21,546 --> 01:36:24,426
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1258
01:36:24,507 --> 01:36:25,627
in my father's name.

1259
01:36:25,706 --> 01:36:26,587
[Lady Jessica] Paul.

1260
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:28,266
Fanatical legions worshipping

1261
01:36:28,347 --> 01:36:30,427
<i>at the shrine
of my father's skull.</i>

1262
01:36:31,227 --> 01:36:33,587
<i>A war in my name!</i>

1263
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,426
Everyone's shouting my name!

1264
01:36:35,507 --> 01:36:36,467
Paul.

1265
01:36:39,987 --> 01:36:41,986
Paul Atreides.

1266
01:36:42,067 --> 01:36:44,906
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1267
01:36:44,986 --> 01:36:48,347
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1268
01:36:48,426 --> 01:36:51,107
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1269
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,306
[in distorted voice]
Get off me!

1270
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:55,746
[normal voice]
You did this to me!

1271
01:36:55,826 --> 01:36:58,426
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1272
01:37:05,466 --> 01:37:07,466
[breathing heavily]

1273
01:37:15,667 --> 01:37:17,626
[Paul crying]

1274
01:37:22,507 --> 01:37:24,707
My father is dead.

1275
01:37:24,786 --> 01:37:26,746
[Paul sobbing]

1276
01:37:31,786 --> 01:37:33,986
[mournful music playing]

1277
01:37:54,026 --> 01:37:55,987
[device beeping]

1278
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,146
[Paul softly] Someone's near.

1279
01:38:02,027 --> 01:38:03,466
You need to drink.

1280
01:38:04,986 --> 01:38:07,186
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1281
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:16,386
Sweat and tears.

1282
01:38:19,906 --> 01:38:21,546
All right,
let's get out of here.

1283
01:38:25,067 --> 01:38:27,026
[device whirring]

1284
01:38:28,266 --> 01:38:30,226
[shield buzzing]

1285
01:38:39,587 --> 01:38:40,786
[shield buzzing]

1286
01:38:45,866 --> 01:38:47,466
[squeaks]

1287
01:38:50,346 --> 01:38:51,827
[whimpers]

1288
01:38:55,787 --> 01:38:57,786
[muffled whirring]

1289
01:39:02,107 --> 01:39:03,666
[grunting and panting]

1290
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:13,786
[squeaks]

1291
01:39:17,026 --> 01:39:18,306
[Paul grunts]

1292
01:39:19,227 --> 01:39:21,186
[Lady Jessica panting]

1293
01:39:21,266 --> 01:39:23,026
[engine roaring]

1294
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:33,466
That's Duncan.

1295
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,467
Duncan.

1296
01:39:41,546 --> 01:39:42,946
[panting]

1297
01:39:43,026 --> 01:39:44,186
My lady.

1298
01:39:44,266 --> 01:39:45,626
Paul.

1299
01:39:45,707 --> 01:39:47,986
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1300
01:39:48,066 --> 01:39:49,226
We know.

1301
01:39:51,067 --> 01:39:52,346
My lord Duke.

1302
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:06,506
Here.

1303
01:40:08,506 --> 01:40:09,946
Drink this.

1304
01:40:16,906 --> 01:40:19,187
[Duncan] Harkonnens hit
every population center

1305
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:20,666
on the planet at once.

1306
01:40:20,746 --> 01:40:22,786
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1307
01:40:22,866 --> 01:40:24,826
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1308
01:40:24,906 --> 01:40:27,346
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1309
01:40:27,426 --> 01:40:29,986
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1310
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,387
you know it.

1311
01:40:31,466 --> 01:40:36,026
[Lady Jessica sighs] So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1312
01:40:36,106 --> 01:40:39,106
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1313
01:40:39,186 --> 01:40:41,146
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1314
01:40:41,226 --> 01:40:43,106
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1315
01:40:51,226 --> 01:40:52,466
[thunder rumbling]

1316
01:40:57,346 --> 01:40:59,066
[man shouting]

1317
01:41:00,826 --> 01:41:02,666
- [thunder continues rumbling]
- [clamoring]

1318
01:41:02,746 --> 01:41:04,386
[worker] Storm's coming.

1319
01:41:07,346 --> 01:41:08,986
[workers shouting
indistinctly]

1320
01:41:17,706 --> 01:41:19,866
[Dr. Kynes] The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1321
01:41:19,946 --> 01:41:21,027
We'll be safe here.

1322
01:41:22,506 --> 01:41:24,666
Do you know
what this place is?

1323
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:27,067
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1324
01:41:30,306 --> 01:41:32,066
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1325
01:41:32,147 --> 01:41:34,466
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1326
01:41:37,346 --> 01:41:39,866
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1327
01:41:39,946 --> 01:41:41,026
The work had begun,

1328
01:41:41,106 --> 01:41:42,707
but then the spice
was discovered.

1329
01:41:42,786 --> 01:41:45,666
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1330
01:41:45,746 --> 01:41:46,906
Tanat,

1331
01:41:46,986 --> 01:41:48,506
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1332
01:41:48,586 --> 01:41:49,786
TANAT: Yes, Liet.

1333
01:41:49,866 --> 01:41:51,226
[Dr. Kynes] Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1334
01:41:51,306 --> 01:41:52,706
SHAMIR: Of course, Liet.

1335
01:41:53,746 --> 01:41:54,866
[door unlocks]

1336
01:41:54,946 --> 01:41:56,786
Who are you to the Fremen?

1337
01:42:21,306 --> 01:42:23,306
[indistinct chatter]

1338
01:42:32,586 --> 01:42:34,426
[wind howling]

1339
01:42:44,746 --> 01:42:46,426
[Paul] You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1340
01:42:46,506 --> 01:42:48,026
Dr. Kynes?

1341
01:42:49,226 --> 01:42:51,386
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1342
01:42:52,346 --> 01:42:53,466
The Sardaukar coming

1343
01:42:53,546 --> 01:42:55,186
and picking them off
one by one.

1344
01:42:58,026 --> 01:42:59,586
Only together
can they stand a chance

1345
01:42:59,666 --> 01:43:01,106
against the Imperium.

1346
01:43:03,066 --> 01:43:05,146
Would you bear witness?

1347
01:43:05,226 --> 01:43:08,226
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1348
01:43:08,306 --> 01:43:11,106
If they believe me,

1349
01:43:11,186 --> 01:43:12,826
there would be general warfare

1350
01:43:12,906 --> 01:43:15,026
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1351
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,626
Chaos

1352
01:43:16,706 --> 01:43:18,106
across the Imperium.

1353
01:43:18,186 --> 01:43:19,546
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1354
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:21,986
with an alternative to chaos.

1355
01:43:22,066 --> 01:43:23,906
The Emperor has no sons.

1356
01:43:23,986 --> 01:43:25,906
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1357
01:43:25,986 --> 01:43:28,666
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1358
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:30,426
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1359
01:43:30,506 --> 01:43:32,106
He brought you here
to kill you.

1360
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:34,586
What don't you understand?

1361
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:37,706
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1362
01:43:41,746 --> 01:43:44,386
The Fremen speak
of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1363
01:43:45,346 --> 01:43:47,106
Careful.

1364
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:48,306
The Voice from the Outer World

1365
01:43:48,386 --> 01:43:50,466
who will lead them
to paradise.

1366
01:43:51,746 --> 01:43:52,906
Superstition.

1367
01:43:57,506 --> 01:43:59,186
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1368
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:00,506
and lost him in battle.

1369
01:44:03,586 --> 01:44:07,146
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1370
01:44:12,186 --> 01:44:13,986
I've seen your dream.

1371
01:44:17,946 --> 01:44:19,106
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1372
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:21,026
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1373
01:44:21,106 --> 01:44:22,586
with a wave of my hand.

1374
01:44:24,986 --> 01:44:27,728
[man speaking Chakobsa]
Do you really think he is the Mahdi?

1375
01:44:28,736 --> 01:44:30,529
He looks young to me.

1376
01:44:31,826 --> 01:44:32,826
[man 2 shushing]

1377
01:45:08,586 --> 01:45:11,066

[suspenseful music playing]

1382
01:46:13,626 --> 01:46:14,626
Sardaukar!

1383
01:46:17,626 --> 01:46:18,785
No! Duncan!

1384
01:46:18,866 --> 01:46:20,066
[Lady Jessica] Paul, no!

1385
01:46:20,146 --> 01:46:21,385
- [Paul] Duncan, no!
- [Lady Jessica] No!

1386
01:46:22,506 --> 01:46:23,746
- [Paul] No!
- [Lady Jessica] Paul, no!

1387
01:46:24,906 --> 01:46:26,146
[Paul] Duncan, no!

1388
01:46:26,226 --> 01:46:28,586
- He's locked the door.
- [Paul] Duncan! No!

1389
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:33,586
[slow choral music playing]

1390
01:46:37,946 --> 01:46:39,786
[all grunting]

1391
01:46:41,786 --> 01:46:43,426
[tense music playing]

1392
01:46:58,946 --> 01:47:00,026
[Duncan groans]

1393
01:47:05,866 --> 01:47:07,266

1394
01:47:07,345 --> 01:47:09,066
[shield crackling]

1395
01:47:15,946 --> 01:47:17,466
He's gone.

1396
01:47:17,546 --> 01:47:18,585
[Paul] Duncan!

1397
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,186
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1398
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:21,986
[tense music continues]

1399
01:47:26,226 --> 01:47:27,386
[laser firing]

1400
01:47:27,466 --> 01:47:29,786
[Lady Jessica] Paul, go! Paul!

1401
01:47:42,746 --> 01:47:44,105
[Duncan yelling]

1402
01:47:47,906 --> 01:47:49,506
[Dr. Kynes] Come on.
Come on, come on!

1403
01:48:01,385 --> 01:48:03,305

[tense music continues]

1406
01:48:19,586 --> 01:48:21,186
[panting] Follow the light.

1407
01:48:21,265 --> 01:48:23,386
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1408
01:48:23,465 --> 01:48:25,266
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1409
01:48:25,346 --> 01:48:27,826
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1410
01:48:27,906 --> 01:48:31,866
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1411
01:48:31,945 --> 01:48:33,146
Are you not coming with us?

1412
01:48:33,226 --> 01:48:34,386
It only seats two.

1413
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,106
I'll go to the next station

1414
01:48:36,186 --> 01:48:37,826
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1415
01:48:37,906 --> 01:48:39,146
[Lady Jessica] How?

1416
01:48:39,866 --> 01:48:41,705
I'm Fremen.

1417
01:48:41,786 --> 01:48:43,905
The desert's my home.

1418
01:48:43,986 --> 01:48:45,026
Good luck.

1419
01:48:45,106 --> 01:48:46,266
[Paul] Good luck.

1420
01:48:52,665 --> 01:48:54,585

- [Jamis in English] They are weaklings.

1603
02:08:09,145 --> 02:08:10,824
[Stilgar] Jamis.

1604
02:08:10,905 --> 02:08:12,705
That was a brave crossing
they made

1605
02:08:12,784 --> 02:08:15,544
in the path of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1606
02:08:15,624 --> 02:08:18,625
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1607
02:08:19,624 --> 02:08:21,264
Nor did his father.

1608
02:08:21,345 --> 02:08:23,864
[Jamis] My thumper
saved his life.

1609
02:08:23,945 --> 02:08:26,305
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1610
02:08:26,384 --> 02:08:28,024
He's not The One.

1611
02:08:29,664 --> 02:08:30,584
[sighs]

1612
02:08:30,665 --> 02:08:32,264
We have powerful friends.

1613
02:08:32,345 --> 02:08:35,384
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1614
02:08:35,465 --> 02:08:36,664
you will be well rewarded.

1615
02:08:36,744 --> 02:08:39,425
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1616
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:40,985
in your flesh?

1617
02:08:43,664 --> 02:08:45,625
[Stilgar] Hmm...

1618
02:08:45,704 --> 02:08:47,265
The boy is young.

1619
02:08:47,344 --> 02:08:49,465
He can learn our ways.

1620
02:08:49,544 --> 02:08:52,065
He may have sanctuary.

1621
02:08:52,144 --> 02:08:54,385
But the woman is untrained...

1622
02:08:56,944 --> 02:08:58,385
and too old to learn.

1623
02:09:01,904 --> 02:09:03,904
[low tense music playing]

1624
02:09:10,664 --> 02:09:11,825
[sniffles]

1625
02:09:16,785 --> 02:09:18,064
[grunting]

1626
02:09:23,824 --> 02:09:24,784
[groans]

1627
02:09:28,464 --> 02:09:30,504
- [both grunt]
- [Stilgar] back, you dogs.

1628
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:34,185
She'll cut my throat.

1629
02:09:38,944 --> 02:09:41,344
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1630
02:09:41,425 --> 02:09:43,024
And a fighter?

1631
02:09:43,105 --> 02:09:45,184
Conversation ran short.

1632
02:09:45,265 --> 02:09:47,384
[Stilgar] Peace, woman.

1633
02:09:47,465 --> 02:09:48,744
Peace.

1634
02:09:49,504 --> 02:09:50,984
I judged hastily.

1635
02:09:54,905 --> 02:09:55,944
[sniffs]

1636
02:09:57,065 --> 02:09:58,624
[Stilgar grunts]

1637
02:09:59,618 --> 02:10:01,272
[speaking Chakobsa]
The sun is rising.

1638
02:10:02,085 --> 02:10:03,946
We must reach Sietch Tabr.

1639
02:10:05,686 --> 02:10:07,824
The fates of these strangers
will be decided there.

1640
02:10:13,341 --> 02:10:14,941
Until then...

1641
02:10:15,266 --> 02:10:17,377
they have my countenance.

1642
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:21,034
My word is on them.

1643
02:10:28,584 --> 02:10:30,904
[girl in English] <i>I would not
have let you hurt my friends.</i>

1644
02:10:55,144 --> 02:10:57,624
They say you're the <i>Mahdi.</i>

1645
02:10:57,705 --> 02:10:59,465
But you look
like a little boy.

1646
02:11:00,904 --> 02:11:02,304
You chose the hardest way up.

1647
02:11:02,385 --> 02:11:03,664
Follow me.

1648
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,732
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]
We must go!

1649
02:11:10,824 --> 02:11:12,344
[in English] Give it to me.

1650
02:11:18,984 --> 02:11:20,625
You will have
your own maula pistol

1651
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:22,545
when you've earned it.

1652
02:11:22,624 --> 02:11:23,625
Give it to me.

1653
02:11:29,144 --> 02:11:31,185
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1654
02:11:31,264 --> 02:11:33,785
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1655
02:11:33,864 --> 02:11:35,224
[Jamis] I will not have them.

1656
02:11:41,865 --> 02:11:43,225
[Stilgar] Jamis,

1657
02:11:43,304 --> 02:11:45,544
I have spoken. Be still.

1658
02:11:45,624 --> 02:11:47,144
[Jamis] You talk like a leader.

1659
02:11:48,104 --> 02:11:49,904
But the strongest leads.

1660
02:11:51,144 --> 02:11:52,864
She bested you.

1661
02:11:54,225 --> 02:11:56,424
I invoke the amtal.

1662
02:11:56,504 --> 02:11:58,824
[Stilgar] You may not challenge
a <i>Sayyadina.</i>

1663
02:11:58,904 --> 02:12:00,344
Then who will fight
in her name?

1664
02:12:00,424 --> 02:12:03,064
Jamis, don't do this.

1665
02:12:03,144 --> 02:12:05,144
Don't. The night is fading.

1666
02:12:05,224 --> 02:12:08,024
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1667
02:12:08,104 --> 02:12:10,064
Where is her champion?

1668
02:12:20,464 --> 02:12:22,384
I accept her champion.

1669
02:12:44,584 --> 02:12:46,624
[slow dramatic music playing]

1670
02:12:50,664 --> 02:12:51,784
[grunting]

1671
02:12:53,224 --> 02:12:56,984
[voices] <i>Paul Atreides
must die...</i>

1672
02:12:58,665 --> 02:13:03,185
<i>for</i> Kwisatz Haderach <i>to rise.</i>

1673
02:13:05,744 --> 02:13:09,304
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1674
02:13:09,384 --> 02:13:10,904
<i>Don't resist.</i>

1675
02:13:16,704 --> 02:13:18,584
<i>When you take a life,</i>

1676
02:13:19,464 --> 02:13:21,504
<i>you take your own.</i>

[breathing heavily]

1679
02:13:51,984 --> 02:13:54,345
I don't believe
you're the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1680
02:13:55,784 --> 02:13:57,744
But I want you
to die with honor.

1681
02:14:08,745 --> 02:14:11,464
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1682
02:14:14,584 --> 02:14:16,864
It's made
from a tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1683
02:14:16,944 --> 02:14:18,584
The great sandworm.

1684
02:14:20,145 --> 02:14:22,824
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1685
02:14:26,944 --> 02:14:29,224
[Jamis shouts]
Where is the Outworlder?

1686
02:14:33,384 --> 02:14:35,225
Jamis is a good fighter.

1687
02:14:36,144 --> 02:14:37,744
He won't let you suffer.

1688
02:14:39,144 --> 02:14:40,705
Chani...

1689
02:14:43,704 --> 02:14:44,704
Um...

1690
02:14:50,424 --> 02:14:51,464
[scoffs]

1691
02:14:52,424 --> 02:14:53,584
Never mind.

1692
02:15:05,704 --> 02:15:07,824
[slow dramatic music
continues]

1693
02:15:46,664 --> 02:15:48,744
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1694
02:15:56,224 --> 02:15:58,104
You should welcome my blade.

1695
02:16:01,464 --> 02:16:03,144
This world will kill you.

1696
02:16:06,384 --> 02:16:07,864
Quicker this way.

1697
02:16:14,944 --> 02:16:16,585
[spectators speak Chakobsa
in unison]

1698

[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

1702

The boy doesn't know our rule.

[yells]

1704
02:16:52,744 --> 02:16:54,264
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1705
02:16:54,344 --> 02:16:55,944
Only death is the test of it.

1706

- Is he toying with him?
- No.

02:17:07,144 --> 02:17:08,744
Paul has never killed a man.

[in English]
You're one of us now.

1724
02:19:22,664 --> 02:19:24,424
A life for a life.

1725
02:19:24,504 --> 02:19:26,464
Come with us to <i>Sietch</i> Tabr.

1726
02:19:26,544 --> 02:19:27,544
No.

1727
02:19:27,623 --> 02:19:29,104
Paul needs to get off-world.

1728
02:19:29,184 --> 02:19:31,184
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1729
02:19:31,264 --> 02:19:32,464
you have ships.

1730
02:19:32,544 --> 02:19:34,584
- [Paul] No.
- [Lady Jessica] You have...

1731
02:19:34,664 --> 02:19:36,664
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1732
02:19:38,024 --> 02:19:39,703
And my father came,

1733
02:19:40,584 --> 02:19:42,784
not for spice,

1734
02:19:42,863 --> 02:19:45,064
not for the riches,

1735
02:19:45,144 --> 02:19:47,184
but for the strength
of your people.

1736
02:19:50,064 --> 02:19:52,064
My road leads into the desert.

1737
02:19:54,624 --> 02:19:55,944
I can see it.

1738
02:19:58,343 --> 02:19:59,904
If you'll have us,

1739
02:20:00,784 --> 02:20:02,304
we will come.
