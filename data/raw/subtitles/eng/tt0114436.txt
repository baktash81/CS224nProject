1
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,660
Hop in, pard.

2
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,704
Where you going?

3
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,980
Vegas.

4
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,399
Come on.

5
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,251
This is your lucky day.

6
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,897
You can sit a little bit
closer if you want.

7
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,941
It was a bad idea.

8
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,527
- Chill, okay?
- I'm chilled.

9
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,239
I sure am glad you're going
to be such good company.

10
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,743
I don't like Garth Brooks.

11
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,036
Me neither.

12
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,039
I don't know anybody
that likes him.

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,045
You going to keep that thing
open all the way to Vegas?

14
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,674
You got a name?

15
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,179
Look, I'll just pull over.
You can get out, okay?

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,014
I've been driving all
the way from Kansas.

17
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,811
I ain't in the mood to get myself
pig-stuck for doing somebody a favor.

18
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,087
Okay?

19
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,605
So, I'll just pull on over.

20
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,072
All right?

21
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,247
So, you got a name?

22
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,833
I'm Jeff.

23
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,068
Nomi.

24
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,462
What kind of name's that?

25
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,256
My mom was Italian.

26
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,924
Italian, huh?

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,635
You one of those Mafia girls?

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,887
That why you got your blade?

29
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,433
What are you going to Vegas
for, you going to win?

30
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,269
I'm going to dance.

31
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,440
You going to be one of them
private escort dancers?

32
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,150
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,569
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,287
<i>KBID, you
never go to sleep in Vegas.</i>

35
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,122
There she is.

36
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,832
You been here before?

37
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,458
Sure.
I got an uncle,

38
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,586
he's a host at the Riviera.

39
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,380
You gamble?

40
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,614
No.

41
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,885
You got to gamble
if you're going to win.

42
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,887
I'm going to win.

43
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,181
Then use some of that Mafia
money you got in the suitcase.

44
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,080
Just leave your stuff
in the car.

45
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,415
I'll talk to my uncle,

46
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,834
see if he can
help you get a job.

47
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,631
What, ain't anyone
ever been nice to you?

48
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,099
Want to play a slot machine?

49
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,334
Yeah.

50
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,269
Here's 10 bucks.

51
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,229
You win, we split it up.

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,024
No holding out on me either.

53
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,234
I'm going to go see my uncle.

54
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,031
Meet you right back here.

55
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,672
Holy shit!

56
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,558
Look at you.

57
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,811
Want to try some silver dollars?

58
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,104
Sure.

59
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,431
Fuck!

60
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,492
You lose all your money, honey?

61
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,327
You want to make some more?

62
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,372
It won't take you any
longer than 15 minutes.

63
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,501
Sooner or later, you're
going to have to sell it.

64
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,159
Fuck!

65
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,436
Shit.

66
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,563
Fuck.

67
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,356
Fuck!

68
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,591
Fuck the fucker!

69
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,800
Fuck!

70
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,945
That's my car!

71
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,697
I want my fucking suitcase!

72
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,407
Get off my car!

73
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,788
Jesus.

74
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,332
- Hey...
- Leave me alone!

75
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,567
Hey!

76
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,307
So...

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,367
What was in your suitcase?

78
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,828
Nothing.
Just my stuff.

79
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,663
Everything I had.

80
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,107
Fuck!

81
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
I just got here.

82
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,174
Welcome to Vegas.

83
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,515
You know anybody here?

84
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,185
Got any family you can call?

85
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,188
I don't have any family.

86
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,109
Where are you from?

87
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,778
Back east.

88
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,655
From where back east?

89
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,534
Different places.

90
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,210
Look,

91
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,423
you can stay with me
if you need a place to crash.

92
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,259
It's not much.

93
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,594
Until you get a job?

94
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,726
Are you hitting on me?

95
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,546
No.

96
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,025
You're not a hooker, are you?

97
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,990
No.

98
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,662
<i>Andrew Carver, another smash,</i>

99
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,414
<i>Walk into the Wind.</i>

100
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,714
Check it out!

101
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,240
Wow.

102
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,593
They're great.

103
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,011
They're neat, huh?

104
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,596
They're neat.

105
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,681
Want to come with me?

106
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,683
We've got this new lead.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,435
She's really good.

108
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,687
I got to go to work.

109
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,689
Jerk, you don't
have to be to work

110
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,857
for three hours.

111
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,401
What are you going to do,
watch TV and eat chips?

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,635
Yeah.

113
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,030
Where are the chips?

114
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,573
I don't know.

115
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,733
You ate them, didn't you?

116
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:55,768
Yes, you did.

117
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,286
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

118
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,455
- You did!
- Stop.

119
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,208
Oh, come on, Nomi.

120
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,752
You can show off your nails.

121
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,837
They'll all be so jealous.

122
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,881
You think?

123
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,174
I think.

124
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,259
What am I going to wear?

125
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,387
Wear the dress
that I made last week.

126
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,622
The fringe one?

127
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,791
I'll put my hair up.

128
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,643
We don't have time.

129
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,187
I'll hurry.
I promise.

130
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,773
All right, let's go.
Let's do this.

131
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,775
Come on, you have two minutes.

132
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,235
Robes off.

133
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,778
Ladies, how are we doing?

134
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,904
- Annie.
- What?

135
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,405
You're naked.

136
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,531
What happened?

137
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,908
It just ripped.

138
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,243
It's almost done.

139
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,787
Molly, they'll see
a smiling snatch

140
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,163
if you don't fix
this G-string.

141
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,582
I'll be right there, Annie.

142
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,501
She wants to smile her snatch.

143
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,878
She probably cut
that string herself.

144
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,255
You're terrible, Julie.
Okay, you're done.

145
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,006
Come on, guys, move it.

146
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,091
What is that smell?

147
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,010
It's that damn monkey act.
He feeds them garlic.

148
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,303
Well, it stinks in here.

149
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,222
Want me to go on stage
without a G?

150
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,267
I am fixing it right now.
Give me one damn minute.

151
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,434
Jesus!

152
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,270
Who wants to see
her snatch anyway?

153
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,355
- I certainly wouldn't.
- We know that, babe.

154
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,190
Nomi, come on.

155
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,734
All right, you guys,
let's line it up.

156
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,903
You got four counts of eight.

157
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,446
Miss Connors.

158
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,240
Just set them over there.

159
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,742
There! All right,
let's move it!

160
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,077
Molly, my G!

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,311
Here.

162
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,164
Wouldn't it be great if one of these
nights she fell down the stairs?

163
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,166
Watch from the show room.

164
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,293
Can I go up there?

165
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,527
Sure.

166
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,755
You got two counts of eight.
What are you doing?

167
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,882
Brian, move your ass!

168
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,168
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

169
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,170
<i>the Stardust proudly presents</i>

170
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,088
<i>Miss Cristal Connors.</i>

171
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,159
We could've brought
anyone into this show.

172
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,955
Latoya, Suzanne, you name it.

173
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,957
We wanted Cristal.

174
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,336
Cristal Connors defines
what Las Vegas is all about.

175
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,755
She's dazzling, she's exciting,

176
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,799
and she's very, very sexy.

177
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,592
How does it feel
to be back in Vegas?

178
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,803
How did you feel
about the show tonight?

179
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,431
It's the best show
I've ever been in.

180
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,349
I only hope I can do it justice.

181
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,226
You did, and you will.

182
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,562
We're thrilled to have you here.

183
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,981
And I'm thrilled to be here.

184
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,107
You, too, now.

185
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,900
Mr. Karlman,
can we have one of you

186
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,194
handing Cristal the flowers?

187
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,489
Zack.

188
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,907
You do it.

189
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,077
This is Zack Carey, entertainment
director of the Stardust Hotel.

190
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,704
He's so smooth.

191
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,998
Your bouquet,
Ms. Connors.

192
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,708
Can I keep them?

193
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,712
Okay folks, that's it.
Thank you very much for coming.

194
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,172
That's all.

195
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,969
She's great, isn't she?

196
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,220
She doesn't suck.

197
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,264
Molly, we still need you.

198
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,582
Come with me.

199
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,934
You can be my assistant.
Come on.

200
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,234
Yes?

201
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,905
Yes, Miss Connors.

202
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,407
Cristal.
Please.

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,326
And you are?
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,660
Molly.
Molly Abrams.

205
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,412
Molly, this top is way too tight.

206
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,498
My breasts are just
getting crushed in here.

207
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,082
I can loosen it for you.

208
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,918
Okay. To about here.

209
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,711
No, no, a little less.

210
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,087
I want my nipples to press,

211
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:02,341
but I don't want them to look
like they're levitating.

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,510
- Okay.
- Thanks, darlin'.

213
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,094
You're welcome.

214
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,437
You were really
great tonight, Miss...

215
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,397
Cristal.

216
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,107
Thanks, darlin'.

217
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,361
Andrew Carver sent you these?

218
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,029
If that's what the card says,

219
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,697
then that's who sent it.

220
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,407
I just love him.

221
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,993
Oh. This is
my friend Nomi.

222
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,620
She's a dancer, too.

223
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,704
Is she now?

224
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,289
Yes, and she's really good.

225
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,625
Where do you dance at?

226
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,836
At the Cheetah.

227
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,549
I don't know how good
you are, darlin',

228
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,884
and I don't know
what it is you're good at,

229
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,886
but if it's at the Cheetah,

230
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,430
it's not dancing,
I know that much.

231
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,475
You don't know shit!

232
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,689
I'm, I'm really sorry,
Miss Connors.

233
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,982
Cristal.

234
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,443
I told you.

235
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,237
Cristal.

236
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,073
Your friend has nice nails.

237
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,242
She does them herself.

238
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,287
Maybe she can do mine sometime.

239
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,957
Hey!

240
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,334
Hey! Nomi!

241
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,504
I work here, okay?

242
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,090
I need my paycheck.

243
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,259
I do not want her
to be pissed at me.

244
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,677
I'm sorry!

245
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,807
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,684
Jesus, Nomi.

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,943
I'll drive you to work, okay?

248
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,361
I'm not going.

249
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,071
They'll fire you.

250
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,282
Fuck, I don't care.

251
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,326
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

252
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,938
Okay.

253
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,498
Let's go.

254
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,709
Where?

255
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,128
You know where.

256
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,323
She can dance, can't she?

257
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,283
She thinks she can.

258
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,830
I'm going to go dance with her.

259
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,165
Man, you can't do that.

260
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,399
You're working.

261
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,251
T.C.'s going to
have your ass.

262
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,837
T.C.'s at the Riviera
playing craps.

263
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,050
- You want to dance?
- I am dancing.

264
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,511
But do you want
to dance with me?

265
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,804
You good?

266
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,764
Yeah. I'm good.

267
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm going to have a drink.

268
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,289
You can dance.

269
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,833
I don't lie.

270
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,543
You can't.

271
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,962
Then what am I doing?

272
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,048
Teasing my dick.

273
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,592
You got potential.
I could teach you.

274
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,827
Yeah?

275
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah.

276
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,519
I'm not teasing it now, am I?

277
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,229
Watch it, buddy.

278
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,689
Be cool.
I'm a bouncer.

279
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,649
You be cool, buddy.

280
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,355
Nomi!

281
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,000
- Hey, you!
- Hey!

282
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,334
Hold her!

283
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,544
She started it.

284
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,628
Fuck you!

285
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,505
Fuck you, asshole!

286
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,509
Malone.

287
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,178
Yeah.

288
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,013
You're out of here.

289
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,474
Hey, your release papers.

290
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,058
Yo, what's up?

291
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,186
I bailed you out, girl.

292
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,980
Don't that even
give me a cup of coffee?

293
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,108
All I did was tell you
I'd teach you to dance.

294
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,444
I don't need nobody
to teach me to dance.

295
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,779
That's because
you're a bad-ass.

296
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,030
You got your arm straight out,

297
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,531
saying, "Back off,
motherfucker."

298
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,242
Yeah, you got that down.
Back off, motherfucker!

299
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:44,706
You know what?

300
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,917
My head hurts, my dick hurts,

301
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,503
and you got me fired
from my fucking job.

302
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,087
Shit happens, you know?

303
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,674
That's it? That's what
I get, fucking wisdom?

304
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,801
That's it?

305
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,093
Yeah, that's it.

306
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,470
You get wisdom.

307
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,807
You're not just a pain in my
head and a pain in my dick.

308
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,391
You're also a pain in my ass.

309
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,768
Life sucks, you know?

310
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,728
"Life sucks"?
"Shit happens"?

311
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,855
You get this stuff
off of T-shirts?

312
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,985
I just want a cup of coffee.

313
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,403
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,949
You got a quarter?

315
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,408
Sure. Here.

316
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
Buy yourself a cup.

317
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,957
Al is pissed.

318
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,543
He says if you
miss another night...

319
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,111
How did you get out?

320
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,046
Him. He bailed me out.

321
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,548
How come?

322
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,049
I kicked him in the nuts.

323
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,509
He liked it?

324
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,927
He must've.

325
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,245
Nomi.

326
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,310
Nomi, do my boobs
look any bigger to you?

327
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,647
Shit. Carmi thinks
she's pregnant again.

328
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,275
Girl, you missed
your period again?

329
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,359
I don't know.

330
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,069
I don't think so.

331
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,072
It's like a Japanese
convention out there.

332
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,782
Hey, mama!

333
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,870
Maybe you better get your little
weenie jokes cranked up there.

334
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,371
This thing isn't working again.

335
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,664
Come on, baby.

336
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,499
Come on, here we go.

337
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,210
One more time.
Harder. Harder.

338
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,628
Yeah!
Yeah!

339
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,463
Let me try it.

340
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,001
Hey, ladies!

341
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,036
Hey.

342
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,305
I want you to meet Hope.

343
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,640
Okay, cut it out.

344
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,101
This is Tiffany,

345
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,853
Farrah, Heather,

346
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,146
Henrietta.

347
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,024
My name isn't Hope.
My name's Penny.

348
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,654
They want class,
dumb-dumb.

349
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,323
They don't want to fuck a Penny.

350
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,659
They want to fuck a
Heather or a Tiffany.

351
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,037
Or a Hope, huh?

352
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,581
This is a class joint.

353
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,124
You got that?

354
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,793
Gentlemen and those
few ladies out there,

355
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,046
what you've all
been waiting for,

356
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,380
<i>Henrietta,</i>

357
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,216
<i>Queen of bazooms!</i>

358
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,067
Pull your dress up.

359
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,976
You could never handle me
with all these wrinkles of fat.

360
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,200
Why, you'd never
even find the thing.

361
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,205
I'd have to piss on you
to give you a clue.

362
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,001
You need more pink.

363
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,045
Thanks, Heather.

364
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,383
Have you ever done
a lap dance before?

365
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,659
No.

366
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,387
Got to talk them into it, okay?

367
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,681
50 bucks a pop, you
take them in the back.

368
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,100
Touch and go. They
touch, they go.

369
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,395
You can touch them.
They cannot touch you.

370
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,313
Oh, that's good.

371
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,273
If they come, it's okay.

372
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,901
If they take it out, come all
over you, call the bouncer.

373
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,569
Unless he gives you a big tip.

374
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,029
If he gives you a big tip,

375
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,406
it's okay.

376
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,075
You got that?

377
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,227
Okay.

378
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,665
And you.

379
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,209
Where the fuck
were you last night?

380
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,170
I was having my period, Al.

381
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,382
You don't want me to get
blood all over the place.

382
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,718
Do you?

383
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,929
I'm getting real tired
of your shit, kid.

384
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,099
If you want to last
longer than a week,

385
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,184
you'll give me a blow job.

386
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,479
First I get you
used to the money,

387
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,523
then I make you swallow.

388
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,028
Was he serious?

389
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,454
Here we are.

390
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,483
Hey.

391
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,170
Oh, look, baby,
you missed a spot.

392
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,571
Thank you.

393
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,426
<i>The farmer in the dell</i>

394
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,470
<i>I had a cherry once</i>

395
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,057
<i>And now it's shot to hell</i>

396
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,725
Hey, where you going?

397
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,727
<i>Get off the stage!</i>

398
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,814
You better shut your hole, honey!
Mine's making money.

399
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,442
You know what they
call that useless

400
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,903
piece of skin around a twat?

401
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,446
<i>What?</i>

402
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,615
A woman!

403
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,998
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

404
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,250
<i>the girl to tickle your pickle,</i>

405
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,752
<i>Heather!</i>

406
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,871
Yeah.

407
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,274
Take off your clothes.

408
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,219
Can I see it, baby?

409
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,346
Phil, what'd he say?

410
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,558
He says in America,
everyone's a gynecologist.

411
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,315
You like her?

412
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,483
I like you.

413
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,403
I'll buy her for you.

414
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,667
What the hell are you doing?

415
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,002
We got a bunch
of spenders out there.

416
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,503
Put your nightie on.

417
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,964
Tell him to go fuck himself.

418
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,304
I'll kick your ass out of here.

419
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,057
Tell him.
Do yourself a favor.

420
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,917
Okay,

421
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,977
I'll put my nightie on.

422
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,341
Hi. My name's
Heather.

423
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,028
Want a drink?

424
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,530
Hi, I'm Heather.

425
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,574
Would you like a
private dance with me?

426
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,910
Could I suck your tits?

427
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,329
You can't touch me,
but I can touch you.

428
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,747
I'd love to touch you.

429
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,041
I know where you can touch me.

430
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,710
Heather.

431
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,636
What's going on?

432
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,931
They want a private
dance with her.

433
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,519
So? Great,
get over there.

434
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,023
Hi. My name is Heather.

435
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,274
Hey, Nomi.

436
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,026
I love your nails.

437
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,404
We'd like you to have a private
dance with both of us.

438
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,240
We don't do that.
One at a time, no women.

439
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,184
$100.

440
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,412
Sorry.
That's the rules.

441
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,708
$200. You just do Zack,
and I'll watch.

442
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,405
$500.

443
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,200
Done.

444
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,888
I said done.

445
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:29,874
You guys just sit over there,

446
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,959
and I'll change the music.

447
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,505
What's this about, Cris?

448
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,739
It's about fun.

449
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,009
You sit there,

450
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,637
and I'll sit here.

451
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,282
Hey.

452
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,135
What are you doing here, man?

453
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,303
Nothing.

454
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,346
You want it, you pay for it.

455
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,602
Thank you.

456
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,472
500.

457
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,550
That was fun, wasn't it?

458
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,385
You're such a bitch.

459
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,387
Oh, but you love me.

460
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,621
Can you walk?

461
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,889
Yeah.

462
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,101
Good night, girls.

463
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,227
- Good night.
- Good night.

464
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,812
Get some rest.

465
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,527
Go out and celebrate.

466
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,613
We can go to my place
and smoke some dope.

467
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,449
You still got some
of the Thai stuff?

468
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,076
I love thighs. I almost
get off on thighs.

469
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,453
I like armpits, too.

470
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,537
You want to come, Nomi?

471
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:37,830
Not me.

472
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,081
I'll come.

473
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,209
Hey, you just got
500 off a lap dance.

474
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,420
Al, just stop.

475
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,673
You act like somebody died.

476
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,254
Hey.

477
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,150
Wait a minute.
Listen.

478
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,527
Just listen.

479
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,406
You got more natural
talent when you dance

480
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,575
than anybody I've ever seen.

481
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,703
I've seen a lot of dancers.

482
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,289
I studied in New York,
Alvin Ailey.

483
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,959
You burn when you dance.

484
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,337
Yeah, you said I couldn't.

485
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,756
You got to hold some of it in.

486
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,008
You got some shit to learn.
Dancing ain't fucking.

487
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,636
What's that, more wisdom?
I know that.

488
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,845
No, you don't.

489
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,306
You dance like when you
fucked that guy last night.

490
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,474
What guy?

491
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,309
That guy with the chick.

492
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,353
You took them in the back.

493
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,521
I didn't fuck him.

494
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,439
You fucked him and her.

495
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,024
Are you following me?

496
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,526
I didn't fuck anybody.

497
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,944
I saw you!

498
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,863
Man, everybody
got AIDS and shit.

499
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,282
What is it that
you think you do?

500
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,785
You fuck them
without fucking them.

501
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,537
Well, it ain't right.

502
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,789
You got too much
talent for that.

503
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,457
Get out of here!

504
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,460
Bitch, I'm telling you
the truth.

505
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,505
You want me to go,
I'm out of here.

506
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,514
I got an "A."

507
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,937
Four more classes and they'll
have to give me that degree.

508
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,171
Great.

509
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,483
I haven't gotten laid
in six months.

510
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,152
My right hand is so tired,

511
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,319
I can barely thread a needle.

512
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,863
Use the left one.

513
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:34,947
For threading a needle?

514
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,181
Yeah.

515
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,458
I like that.

516
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,251
I can make that.

517
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,961
Yeah?

518
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,505
Yeah. Let's go
to the fabric store.

519
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,343
I want to buy it.
I've got the money.

520
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,329
Why?

521
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,265
I don't know.
I just do.

522
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,771
I never had a dress like that.

523
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,816
It'll look great on me.

524
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,654
Won't it?

525
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,723
Yeah.

526
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,953
Ooh, what do you think?

527
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,789
Oh, my goodness.

528
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,274
Wow.

529
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,335
It looks quite good on you.

530
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,045
It doesn't suck.

531
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,050
I can't believe I bought it.

532
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,427
We'll celebrate.
I'll buy you a burrito.

533
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,472
I'll even buy you some fajitas.

534
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,932
Oh, fajitas.

535
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,519
Fuck, I can't.
I'm on early.

536
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,229
Al's on my back.

537
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,189
Don't worry.
I'll drive you.

538
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,423
Okay.

539
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,025
Oh, my God!

540
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,612
He's coming here!

541
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,738
Maybe you can meet him.

542
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,490
I wouldn't know what to say.

543
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,118
Say, "Andrew, I can't even
thread a needle anymore."

544
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,372
Baby, mama's waiting for you.
Come to me.

545
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,540
Stop!

546
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,333
I got to get tickets
to the concert.

547
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,414
Hey, come on.

548
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,999
Come on, baby.

549
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,042
Hey...
Fuck off!

550
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,377
Whoa. Sorry.

551
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,962
Remember me?

552
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,172
Phil Newkirk, Stardust Hotel.

553
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,677
Listen, there's a spot
open in the chorus line.

554
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,721
We're auditioning
tomorrow morning.

555
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,848
I think you should try out.

556
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,932
Me?

557
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,517
Yeah, you.

558
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,394
You came here to ask me?

559
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,355
When I saw you dance,
I thought, "Yes."

560
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,569
She sent you, didn't she?

561
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,404
No, nobody sent me.

562
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,115
Be there at 10:00.

563
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,245
<i>The queen of bazooms,</i>

564
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,748
<i>Henrietta!</i>

565
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,750
I want to see your ass.

566
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,211
<i>Oh, show me a home</i>

567
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,672
<i>Where the buffalo roam</i>

568
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:42,092
<i>And I'll show you a home</i>

569
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,802
<i>full of shit</i>

570
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,139
- Thank you.
- Good night.

571
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,354
Molly!

572
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,814
What?
What is it?

573
00:37:55,899 --> 00:38:00,235
I got... I got an audition.

574
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,330
Hey, Pollyanna.

575
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,564
What'd you call me?

576
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,959
I said you looked
like Pollyanna.

577
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,543
Okay, ladies,

578
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,879
I'm Tony Moss.

579
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,215
I produce this show.

580
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,635
Some of you probably
heard that I'm a prick.

581
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,220
I am a prick.

582
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,348
I got one interest here
and that's the show.

583
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,934
I don't care whether
you live or die.

584
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,728
I want to see you
dance and smile.

585
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,981
I can't use you
if you can't smile,

586
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,816
I can't use you
if you can't show,

587
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,236
I can't use you
if you can't sell.

588
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,407
Spread out.

589
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:47,992
Jesus Christ!

590
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,077
Marty, look at these tits.

591
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,996
What are these, watermelons?

592
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,289
This is a stage, not a patch.

593
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,833
See ya.

594
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,669
I've seen you before.

595
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,380
Yes, Mr. Moss, I auditioned
for you in January.

596
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,674
You told me to
get my nose fixed.

597
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,758
Nose looks good.

598
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,843
Thank you.

599
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,011
Nice smile, too.

600
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,053
Thank you.

601
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:11,015
But your ears are sticking out.
They are.

602
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,892
Come see me when
you get 'em fixed.

603
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,185
See ya.

604
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,647
Can you spell MGM backwards?
I bet you can't.

605
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,482
- M-G-M.
- I'm impressed.

606
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,236
Come back when you've
fucked off this baby fat.

607
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,613
I hope you got some
nice wigs, tennis ball.

608
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,906
I do.

609
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,783
What kind of classes
have you had?

610
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,201
Ice skating classes,

611
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,786
ballet classes,
technique classes,

612
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,248
stretch classes, jazz classes,
jazz technique classes.

613
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,792
This show is called Goddess,
it ain't called Classes.

614
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,085
See ya.

615
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,880
What kind of classes
have you had?

616
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,214
I haven't had classes.

617
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,841
What are you doing here?

618
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,010
I'm watching you be a prick.

619
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,889
Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

620
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,516
Gay, run them
through the routine.

621
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,852
All right, everyone
back up, find some space.

622
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,936
Start with your right leg,

623
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,940
slap it on, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

624
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,527
Go! 5, 6, 7.

625
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,820
Hit it!

626
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,284
Slam it!

627
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:15,979
Kick!

628
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,501
Go! Go! Go!

629
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,086
And...
Stay there!

630
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,921
Alright, relax guys.
You can take a break.

631
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,009
Okay, tennis ball, dark
hair in the back...

632
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,135
Hello, doll.

633
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,346
Hello. So how's
it going?

634
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,181
Pretty good.

635
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,415
Okay.

636
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,519
I want you to stay.

637
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,730
And ...you.

638
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,484
And you, too.

639
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,778
Goodbye, ladies, you
wasted my time and yours.

640
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,030
The other three, line 'em up.

641
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,869
Okay, show me your tits.

642
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,666
I got a topless show, for christ'sakes.
Let me see your tits.

643
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,559
Very nice.

644
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,437
Very nice, ladies.

645
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,023
Gay, go to the other music.

646
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,150
Marty, change the lights.

647
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,693
Cue Angel. Let's
come in at 20 seconds.

648
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,945
Jack, bring up the side spots.

649
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,363
All right!

650
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,411
I want to see some attitude!

651
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,247
I said attitude!

652
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,249
Come on, ladies!

653
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,544
Sell! Sell your bodies!

654
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,090
Cut it!

655
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,885
Try yoga, babe, or hanging
from the ceiling.

656
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,636
See ya.
Marty, ice.

657
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,599
You got something
wrong with your nipples?

658
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,683
No.

659
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,476
They're not sticking up.
Stick them up.

660
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,519
What?

661
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,730
Play with them a little bit.

662
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,028
Pinch them a little.

663
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,155
You want me to, I'll do it.

664
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,211
I'm erect.

665
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,296
Why aren't you erect?

666
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,302
Here, put some ice on them.

667
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,520
I called that one right.

668
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,272
See ya, Pollyanna.

669
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,859
That's it for today.
Thank you.

670
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,498
You got me the
audition, didn't you?

671
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,360
Why?

672
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,006
Maybe I like the way you dance.

673
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,550
Maybe I like you.

674
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,637
What difference does it make?

675
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,974
Did you enjoy that out there?

676
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,186
Yeah, darling, I think I did.

677
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,147
I hate you.

678
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,109
I know.

679
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,827
Here,

680
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,580
wipe your nose.

681
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,342
The orthodontist convention
is over there.

682
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,177
The realtors are coming in
in 20 minutes.

683
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,929
Let's line 'em up!

684
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,254
Hey!

685
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,840
Hey.

686
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,567
What are you doing here?

687
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,527
I just did an audition.

688
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,195
You want to be a showgirl?

689
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,073
Smith, what are you doing?
Move those bags.

690
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,577
Didn't go too good, huh?

691
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,496
Well, I'm glad about that.

692
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,332
I'm not in the mood!

693
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,750
Hey, Smith!

694
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,918
Smith, I'm talking to you.

695
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,714
You don't want to be
in this kind of show.

696
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,300
What you're doing,
at least it's honest.

697
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,345
They want tits and ass, you
give them tits and ass.

698
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,680
Here, they pretend
they want something else,

699
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,849
and you still show them
tits and ass.

700
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,352
Work her on your own time.

701
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,187
Go line up those bags.

702
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,022
I'm talking to her.

703
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,607
You're what?

704
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,985
I said I'm talking to her.
I'm not working her.

705
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,946
And you're interrupting my
conversation, and that's rude.

706
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,990
Get the fuck out of here!

707
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,950
Asshole.

708
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,869
You're fired!

709
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,788
Yeah?
Take this jacket.

710
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,290
Come on. Look
what you done.

711
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,417
You got me fired again.

712
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,962
You're a real bad-ass.
Ain't you got no shame?

713
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,465
You know what? What
a beautiful day it is.

714
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,635
The sun's shining, neon
blazing, money's flowing.

715
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,720
I'm going to cheer you up.

716
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,430
I'll get you
the best meal in town.

717
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,848
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

718
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,145
You like that burger.

719
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,816
Where are you from?

720
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,151
Different places.

721
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,822
You like talking about you, huh?

722
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:54,918
Where are we?

723
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,294
My place.

724
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,488
Why?

725
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,465
I want to show you something.

726
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,807
The best suite in town.

727
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,226
I had to beg
and plead to get it.

728
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,359
This what you wanted to show me?

729
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,820
What, this nice big bed here?

730
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,451
I wrote this number.

731
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,494
It's about you.

732
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,288
You don't know
anything about me.

733
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,582
I know you're a private dancer.

734
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,752
I only need three other girls.

735
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,964
We can put it on
at the Crave Club.

736
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,383
I'll show you.

737
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:46,219
Stand right here.
Watch me.

738
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,185
Wait a minute.
Slow down!

739
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,603
Like this?

740
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,396
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

741
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,411
Now, follow me.
I know you can.

742
00:48:32,085 --> 00:48:33,755
I have my period.

743
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:35,787
Yeah, right.

744
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,455
Check.

745
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,154
See?

746
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,012
It's all right.
I got towels.

747
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,101
You can fuck me
when you love me.

748
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,357
But I do love you.

749
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,026
Yeah, right.

750
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:09,195
You don't fool me.
I see you.

751
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,239
What do you see?

752
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,824
I see you hiding.

753
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,242
From what?

754
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,286
From you.

755
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,461
You got into some bad shit
someplace, didn't you?

756
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,296
Thanks for the hamburger.

757
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,530
Hey!

758
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,095
Where were you?
What happened?

759
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,723
Tony Moss called. He said
to call him right away.

760
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,892
Here's the number.
Call him.

761
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,519
Oh, Jesus.
I'll call him.

762
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,317
Tony Moss, please.

763
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,235
It's Nomi Malone.

764
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,847
Yes?

765
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,767
Yes.

766
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,186
Okay.

767
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,084
I got in.

768
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,128
<i>She's the yellow rose of Texas</i>

769
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,838
<i>She charges 50 bucks</i>

770
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,674
<i>She's the richest whore in Texas</i>

771
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,093
<i>And all she does is fucks</i>

772
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,011
- You're late.
- I'm gone.

773
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,805
I got another job.

774
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,640
Where you going?

775
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,767
You going to another club?

776
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,604
They giving you a better cut?
I'll match it.

777
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,107
I'm in Goddess at the Stardust.

778
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,655
What's so fucking funny?

779
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,032
She's going down
to the Stardust.

780
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:38,451
She's going to be in the show.

781
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,994
Good for her.

782
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,874
She'll be back.

783
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,418
No, I won't.

784
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,294
I'll never come back.

785
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,714
You're a fucking stripper.
Don't you get it?

786
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,881
I'm a dancer.

787
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:54,926
If you're a dancer, then
Henry here's the fucking Virgin Mary.

788
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,303
I got bigger tits
than the fucking Virgin Mary

789
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,597
and a bigger mouth, too.

790
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:05,311
You're the only one who could
get my tits popping right.

791
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,189
See ya, Al.

792
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,067
I'm not hiring you back.
You hear me?

793
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:14,320
Not even if you give me
a fucking blow job.

794
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,458
James!

795
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,792
Come on!

796
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,336
I got it!

797
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,588
Got what?

798
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,839
I'm in the show.

799
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,299
In Goddess.

800
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,718
Oh, man.

801
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,054
What about the number
I wrote for you?

802
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,766
I thought we were
working on something, you and I.

803
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,769
Oh, James.

804
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,947
She going to be in your number?

805
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,783
I'll be right there.

806
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,160
She can't dance.

807
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,914
Yeah, but you're going
to teach her, right?

808
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,833
She's got talent.
Right?

809
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,297
You know, you and me,
we ain't got no ties.

810
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,178
Dancing and fucking.

811
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,554
Right?

812
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,751
Yeah.

813
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,353
That's right.

814
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,272
See ya.

815
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,992
Who was that?

816
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,998
Just somebody that wanted
to be in the number.

817
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,001
You're not going to give
her my part, are you?

818
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,546
No, baby.
She can't dance.

819
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,780
No?

820
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,883
I wrote that number for you.
You know that.

821
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,893
Excuse me.

822
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,354
What can I do for you?

823
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,189
I'm supposed
to see Mr. Moss.

824
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,858
I'm Nomi Malone.

825
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,235
Okay. Go on in.

826
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,452
One day she looks
like Pollyanna,

827
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,663
the next day she looks like...

828
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,790
I don't know, Lolita maybe.

829
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,834
Nice dress.

830
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,211
Thanks. I bought it
at <i>Versayce.</i>

831
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,635
In The Forum.

832
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:45,430
Oh, yeah. <i>Versayce.</i>
I love <i>Versayce.</i>

833
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,848
Me, too.

834
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,141
Marty.

835
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,101
- Hi.
- Hi.

836
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,311
Gay's our line captain.

837
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,854
Hi.

838
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,189
If you let me down,

839
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,566
I could lose my reputation

840
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,152
for being such
an all-knowing prick.

841
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,821
I worked very hard
for that reputation,

842
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,156
so don't do it.

843
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,390
Deal?

844
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,725
Deal.

845
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,660
Gay will show you around.

846
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,329
Let's get going.

847
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,790
Nomi. We'll do a run-through
this afternoon.

848
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,250
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

849
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:17,462
They always say that in Vegas.
Just before they take your money.

850
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,839
You need to maintain
your weight.

851
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,425
Eat a lot of brown rice
and vegetables.

852
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,927
And stay indoors.

853
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,553
I don't want to see tan lines.

854
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,306
Your makeup and costumes
are your responsibility.

855
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,807
Don't take them home.

856
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:33,686
Whatever you do, don't ever,
ever go out on stage crying.

857
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,773
You do eat brown
rice and vegetables?

858
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,007
Sure.

859
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,258
Good.

860
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,986
This is your table.

861
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:43,780
If you're smart,

862
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,448
and I was smart,

863
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,867
you'll figure out
a job and a man

864
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,410
for later on.

865
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,621
How'd you find your guy?

866
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,665
I chipped my tooth
on a Quaalude.

867
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,416
He was my dentist.

868
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,169
You'll be running this
monster six times a night.

869
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,213
Hold on to the railing,
you don't want to fall.

870
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,839
I'll take you up to Personnel.

871
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,008
They want some information.

872
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,802
What kind of information?

873
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,387
Date of birth.

874
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,305
7-3, um, 73.

875
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,102
Place of birth.

876
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,229
New York.

877
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,480
New York, New York?

878
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,714
Yeah.

879
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,942
Nearest family members.

880
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,575
I don't have any family.

881
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,577
Deceased?

882
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:33,396
Yes.

883
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,833
Have you ever been arrested?

884
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,168
Charged with a criminal offense?

885
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,403
No.

886
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,509
Social Security number.

887
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,180
I don't know.

888
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,599
Let me check that for you, okay?

889
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:58,688
Hey.

890
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,023
You got it.

891
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,816
Nice going.
That's great.

892
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,193
Zack, this is Nomi Malone.

893
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,778
Sure.
I remember her. Hi.

894
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:06,863
I bet you do remember her.

895
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:09,032
Well, she's pretty memorable.

896
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,617
Glad you're on the team.
Nice dress.

897
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,369
It's a <i>Versayce.</i>

898
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,747
It's Versace.

899
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,440
What?

900
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,417
Versace.

901
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,544
It's pronounced Versace.

902
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,674
You got great taste.

903
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,759
You look beautiful.

904
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,177
Thank you.

905
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,456
Girls.

906
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,891
Up at the ceiling.

907
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,392
This is Nomi.

908
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,936
Nicky, Julie, Deena.
You know Gay.

909
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,898
They'll run through it. You just watch.
Then we'll blend you in.

910
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,858
Have you eaten anything?

911
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,818
What do you want?

912
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,445
Burger, fries, and soda.

913
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,789
Get her some brown
rice, vegetables,

914
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,906
and a bottle of Evian.

915
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,365
Okay. Line it up.

916
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,159
Nomi, no.
Come look.

917
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,288
Here we go!
5, 6, 7, 8!

918
00:57:06,473 --> 00:57:08,758
- You're gonna try it now. You ready?
- Yeah.

919
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,094
Try it now.
5, 6, 7, hit it!

920
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:13,454
Go!

921
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,725
Kick it! Work it!

922
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,185
Hold it!

923
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,062
What kind of turn was that?

924
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,523
Do a pique turn.
Come on.

925
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:26,025
That's it.
Okay. Music.

926
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:33,783
Higher.

927
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,451
Not that high.

928
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,830
Stay in sync.

929
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,791
1, 2, 3, 1!

930
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,670
Thrust it!
Thrust it!

931
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,213
Come on!
Thrust it!

932
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,631
Bam! Okay.

933
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,884
That's enough.
Thank you, ladies.

934
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,306
- Good job.
- Thank you.

935
00:57:57,391 --> 00:58:00,226
Gay, work with her on
her turns and balance.

936
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,146
How long before I can
do the show?

937
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,231
You're starting tonight.

938
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,234
- Tonight?
- You'll be fine.

939
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,697
How did she do?

940
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,532
She's no butterfly.

941
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,411
Tony, she's all pelvic thrust.
I mean, she prowls.

942
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:19,662
She's got it.

943
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,372
I wonder how she got it.

944
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,790
She certainly didn't learn it.

945
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,251
She learned it,
but not in class.

946
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,339
Wait. You need more orange.
Let me do it.

947
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,093
How do you feel?

948
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,262
Oh! Don't ask.

949
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,181
Who the hell took my makeup?

950
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,932
Monkey alert!

951
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,518
It's them again!

952
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,689
I told you if this
happened again...

953
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,399
They make babies.

954
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,067
Babies?

955
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,111
Oh! Oh, get out.

956
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,035
Grab her!
Grab her!

957
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,703
I've got one.

958
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,288
Thank you.

959
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,231
Julie, you fucking slut!

960
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,125
Take my makeup again,
I'll kill you!

961
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,128
Oh, I'm a slut? You
fucked that pizza kid.

962
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,254
You fucked the meter reader.

963
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:11,339
Bitch!

964
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,216
You're dead!

965
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,009
Come on, you two!

966
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,095
For Christ sakes!

967
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,972
Calm down!
Stop it!

968
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,807
It's done!
It's done!

969
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,001
Meow!

970
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,729
Showtime.

971
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,815
Move it! You got
four counts of eight.

972
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,734
Nomi, wait. Your wig.

973
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,362
You're fine.
Move up, you guys.

974
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,739
There's shit on the stage.

975
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,116
They always got the shits.
It's that damn garlic.

976
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,743
- Where is it, jack?
- Up left.

977
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,828
Guys, upstage left... Monkey shit.

978
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,498
You want some blow?

979
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,208
Last chance ice.

980
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,878
Go! Go!

981
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,005
Pick it up.
Let's go.

982
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,007
Move faster.
Pick it up.

983
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,634
Brian, go!

984
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,804
See ya.

985
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,431
All right, everybody, let's go!

986
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,100
Go! Go! Go! Go!

987
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,143
I love you.

988
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,813
Come on, you guys.
Keep it moving.

989
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,819
- Nomi, wait.
- What?

990
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,445
Two beats.

991
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,489
1, 2. Go!

992
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:30,710
Shit.

993
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,961
Yeah!

994
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,164
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

995
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,249
<i>the Stardust proudly presents</i>

996
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,792
<i>Miss Cristal Connors!</i>

997
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:05,955
Yeah.

998
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,400
Nomi, you got two minutes.

999
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,901
Change into a red wig.

1000
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,653
I got your costume.

1001
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:26,742
Nomi. Nomi.

1002
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,327
Slip this on.

1003
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,412
Did I do okay?

1004
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,996
Yeah. You did fine.

1005
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,415
Your right leg
extension needs work.

1006
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,958
It's eight steps
on the sweep, not six.

1007
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,419
I'll have someone work with you tomorrow.
Be here at noon.

1008
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,504
Put this on.
You're done.

1009
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,428
I didn't fall.

1010
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,971
You did.
You nearly fell.

1011
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:50,057
Yo. Can I talk
to you a minute?

1012
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,852
Come on. Please.

1013
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,045
Talk.

1014
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,522
Alone.

1015
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,382
I'll go get the car.

1016
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,192
I'll be right there.

1017
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,013
Yeah?

1018
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,240
Who sent you the flowers?

1019
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:09,910
None of your business.

1020
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,872
Okay. Look, I just
wanted to say...

1021
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,082
You and me ain't got no ties.

1022
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,381
I have a problem with pussy.

1023
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,967
I always have, and I'm
always gonna.

1024
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:26,886
But I meant what I said to you.

1025
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,013
I'm not interested
in your problems.

1026
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,682
I did write it for you,

1027
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,395
but I did tell her I'd teach
her and I did fuck her.

1028
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,147
Who you fuck is your business,

1029
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,274
and I'm not making it mine.

1030
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,571
It's not like I'm seeing any money
for writing that number.

1031
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,699
I may as well touch
a little pussy.

1032
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,746
You ain't got nothing to say?

1033
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,397
No.

1034
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,501
Thanks for the flowers.

1035
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,920
Tony said you did great.

1036
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,047
I never got flowers before.

1037
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,340
Really?

1038
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,092
Well, I'm sure
you'll get lots of them.

1039
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,263
He gave them to you?

1040
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,432
Yeah, he did.

1041
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,601
What is he, a pimp?

1042
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,271
Only people I know
got pimp cars are pimps.

1043
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,440
He's the entertainment director.

1044
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,651
That's exactly what I
said, he's a pimp.

1045
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,611
Hey, Nomes.
Let's go.

1046
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,033
Good luck with
your number, James.

1047
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,827
I'm sure you'll teach her
to be a great dancer.

1048
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,683
Hello?

1049
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,145
Anybody here?

1050
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,647
Back here.

1051
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,734
What are you doing here?

1052
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,570
What am I doing here?

1053
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,575
I'm doing some of the finest
cocaine in the world, darlin'.

1054
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,201
You want some?

1055
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,000
It's great for the muscles.

1056
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,089
I told Marty I'd work
on your turns with you,

1057
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,050
but I'm feeling a little
turned inside-out myself.

1058
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,594
Cut the shit.

1059
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,245
Okay.

1060
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,348
We got off on the wrong foot.

1061
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,603
You want to start
dancing all over again?

1062
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,171
Why?

1063
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,231
Why not?

1064
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,694
You want to walk down to
Spago, get something to eat?

1065
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,029
Where is it?

1066
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,031
Just down from Versayce.

1067
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,657
Versace.

1068
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,075
Oh, right.

1069
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,577
Versace.

1070
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:57,978
Yeah.

1071
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,080
Right this way.

1072
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,675
Enjoy.

1073
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,681
I don't know what
all this stuff is.

1074
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,516
I'll order for you.

1075
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:23,562
Don't they have brown
rice and vegetables?

1076
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,815
Do you like brown rice
and vegetables?

1077
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,050
Yeah.

1078
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,152
You do?

1079
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,363
Sort of.

1080
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:34,865
Really?

1081
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,079
It's worse than dog food.

1082
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,872
It is.

1083
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,918
I've had dog food.

1084
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:49,363
You have?

1085
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,716
A long time ago.

1086
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,302
Doggy Chow.

1087
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,847
I used to love Doggy Chow.

1088
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,267
I used to love Doggy Chow, too.

1089
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,199
I get a headache from champagne.

1090
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,535
Oh, this isn't champagne.

1091
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,496
This is holy water.

1092
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,459
I named myself
after this holy water.

1093
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,295
Chrissie Lou Connors used
to have dingy brown hair

1094
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,297
and little bitty tits.

1095
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,551
It's amazing what paint
and a surgeon can do.

1096
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,478
You have great tits.

1097
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,356
They're really beautiful.

1098
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,358
Thank you.

1099
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,486
I like nice tits.

1100
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,823
I always have.
How about you?

1101
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,659
I like having nice tits.

1102
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,496
How do you like having them?

1103
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,419
What do you mean?

1104
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,172
You know what I mean.

1105
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:21,889
I like having them in a
nice dress or a tight top.

1106
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,269
You like to show them off.

1107
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,066
I didn't like showing
them off at the Cheetah.

1108
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,361
Why not? I liked
looking at them there.

1109
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:39,740
Everybody liked looking
at them there.

1110
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,950
Made me feel like a hooker.

1111
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,827
You are a whore, darlin'.

1112
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,329
No, I'm not.

1113
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,789
We all are.

1114
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,583
We take the cash,
we cash the check,

1115
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,044
we show them what
they want to see.

1116
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,546
Maybe you're a whore,
but I'm not.

1117
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,426
You and me...

1118
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,387
we're exactly alike.

1119
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,066
I'll never be like you.

1120
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,114
Miss Connors.
Sorry to bother you.

1121
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,158
Would you sign this for me?

1122
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,202
I'd be happy to, darling.
What's your name?

1123
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,913
Frank.
I'm from Galveston.

1124
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,791
I'm just a farm girl
from Del Rio myself.

1125
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,876
I told you she was from Texas.

1126
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,419
Look at that.

1127
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,630
Could I have me
one just like that?

1128
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,925
You want a girl to use up
all her lipstick on you?

1129
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,010
You want to dance?

1130
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,136
Right now?

1131
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,429
It's now or never.

1132
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,431
That's what Elvis said.

1133
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:52,521
Know the best advice I ever got?

1134
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,984
You're up there onstage,
hoping on a spot.

1135
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,737
If someone gets in your
way, step on them.

1136
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,490
If you're the only one
left standing there,

1137
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:05,158
they hire you.

1138
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,829
That's about it. Thank you and
good night, ladies and gentlemen.

1139
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,914
Elvis has left the building.

1140
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,524
You see, darlin'?

1141
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,693
You are a whore.

1142
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,365
Bitch.

1143
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,288
I guess we're done.

1144
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,254
Right here.
Right here.

1145
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,839
Thank you.

1146
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,552
Nicky, can I talk
to you a second?

1147
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,680
Listen, after the show...

1148
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,059
Coming through.

1149
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,645
Mommy, can we see the monkeys?

1150
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,021
Not now.
They're busy.

1151
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:00,023
Please.
They're so cute.

1152
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,274
They have to work.

1153
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,776
What are they doing?

1154
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,778
I want to see the monkeys!

1155
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,363
Why can't we see the monkeys?

1156
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,907
Get these fucking
kids out of here.

1157
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,034
You said the "F" word.

1158
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,577
She said the "F" word.

1159
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,996
You said the "F" word.

1160
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,956
Shut the fuck up.

1161
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,919
It's okay.

1162
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,197
It's okay.
It's okay.

1163
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,299
Let's get out of here.

1164
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:30,679
Nomi. There's a boat convention
coming into town next week.

1165
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,014
They need a couple of girls.

1166
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,849
Nicky's doing it.
You interested?

1167
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,267
Pays $1,000.

1168
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,271
$1,000?

1169
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:40,881
To do what?

1170
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,733
Just represent
your hotel for a day.

1171
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:45,962
Wear your costumes and your smile
and they take your picture.

1172
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,031
$1,000?

1173
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:51,391
Yeah.

1174
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,326
Great.

1175
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,579
Cristal here recommended you.

1176
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,750
Thanks.

1177
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,793
My pleasure, darlin'.

1178
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,712
Just looking out for you.

1179
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,505
We got to talk about
that magazine layout.

1180
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,882
Later. Later.

1181
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,008
Don't do it.

1182
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,677
What? It's $1,000.
Why not?

1183
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:11,928
Molly, I need you.

1184
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,638
Yes, I'm coming.

1185
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,515
I know girls
who've done it before.

1186
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,309
Molly, I'm waiting.

1187
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,562
They didn't like it.

1188
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,736
Did you do it before?

1189
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,820
Yeah.

1190
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,238
Did you like it?

1191
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:31,907
Did I like it?

1192
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,658
Sure, I liked it.

1193
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:02,479
<i>Let's hear it for these two
beautiful girls from Goddess,</i>

1194
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,940
<i>the new smash at the Stardust.</i>

1195
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,301
Thank you.

1196
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,444
Pardon me.

1197
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,321
Hey, guys.

1198
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:12,614
Shit. Here he comes.

1199
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,782
How's it going?

1200
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:14,825
Fine.

1201
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,284
Tough gig, huh?

1202
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:17,702
Very tough.

1203
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,329
This is my good friend
Mr. Okida.

1204
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,081
He's from Bangkok.

1205
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,000
He's one of our very,
very high rollers.

1206
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,794
Ladies, we got a great idea.

1207
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,463
We want to take you girls
to dinner after the show.

1208
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:32,467
Have some lobster, hear Caesar sing.
Ever heard Caesar sing?

1209
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:34,636
Man, that guy's great.

1210
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,179
You'll love him.

1211
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:37,639
Caesar sing.

1212
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,890
Yeah. Caesar will sing,

1213
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,475
and we'll go back to my place

1214
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,769
and we'll sing, the four of us.

1215
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,605
How about it?

1216
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,152
We sing.

1217
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,699
Yeah. We'll sing
a lot of songs.

1218
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,892
Yeah?

1219
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,894
Okay.

1220
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,291
Okay. Good deal.

1221
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,461
Not me.

1222
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:10,964
Excuse me.

1223
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,257
Hey!

1224
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,051
Hey! Be nice.

1225
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,428
Get your hands off me!

1226
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,388
You're getting $1,000 for this.

1227
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,764
For this!

1228
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,082
This!

1229
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:23,018
Forget it.
Just forget it.

1230
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,353
No harm done.
No damage.

1231
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,606
Christ.

1232
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,900
Is that right?

1233
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,443
Okay. Tell me
another one.

1234
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,527
No, it's the truth.

1235
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,446
Just tell me one more.

1236
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,781
Zack.

1237
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:37,908
Yeah?

1238
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,784
I want to talk to you.

1239
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:41,936
Sure.

1240
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:44,956
Let's go upstairs.

1241
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,626
Did you have
a nice day, darlin'?

1242
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,195
No.

1243
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,925
I'm sorry to hear that.

1244
01:15:58,095 --> 01:15:59,262
Jesus.

1245
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,226
I'm sorry.

1246
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,020
Some people just don't get it.

1247
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,732
I'm on the stage.
Get me Phil Newkirk.

1248
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:12,525
Right.

1249
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,319
Thank you.

1250
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,862
I want you to stay.

1251
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,284
Yeah. The drop is up 33%
on those 58 machines.

1252
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,954
It'll make your
bottom line about 250.

1253
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,205
Right.

1254
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,273
Okay.

1255
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,418
I got an MBA for this.

1256
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,421
That's what this
business has come to,

1257
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,882
cost-analyzing
every slot machine.

1258
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,592
What's an MBA?

1259
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:41,179
- An MBA is a degree...
- Zack, you in here?

1260
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,414
Yeah.

1261
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:44,015
Excuse me.

1262
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,310
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

1263
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,604
I ever hear this again,
you're out of here.

1264
01:16:49,689 --> 01:16:50,772
Nothing happened.

1265
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,649
Something happened.

1266
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:53,942
She's jumping to conclusions.

1267
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,361
If that happens again
to anybody,

1268
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,364
you're going to jump
to your conclusion

1269
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,658
without your golden parachute.

1270
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,036
You owe her an apology.

1271
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:10,625
Nomi, I'm sorry.
I apologize.

1272
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,378
Yeah, fine. Okay.

1273
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,799
Get out of here.

1274
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:19,033
Yeah.

1275
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:20,738
Give me juice on three and four.

1276
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,887
An MBA's a degree
you pick up in college.

1277
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,682
It's mostly worthless
in the real world.

1278
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,101
Let's get an audio check.

1279
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,979
You go for it, don't you?

1280
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,148
Yeah, I try to.

1281
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,486
Showtime.

1282
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:41,156
That's for sure.

1283
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,159
Bring both of those back up.

1284
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,543
Phil, you dumb fuck,
get back up here.

1285
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,087
I know. I know.

1286
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,349
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

1287
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,101
So nice of you
to recommend me to Phil.

1288
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:12,145
What are friends for?

1289
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:14,606
Right.

1290
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,739
Molly. You were right
about the convention.

1291
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,992
Ooh. Sweet baby.

1292
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,662
Do that again, I'll break
your fucking fingers.

1293
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,415
I can't help it you don't
have a gay partner.

1294
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
Fuck you.

1295
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,669
He wants everybody to
see how hetero he is.

1296
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,463
Molly, bring your flashlight.

1297
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,090
I want to see how big it is.

1298
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:42,050
You want a knuckle sandwich?

1299
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,177
Aw, can I have mine anally?

1300
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,513
Come on, you guys.
Jesus.

1301
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,932
Everybody here?
Let's line it up.

1302
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,558
What are you looking at, bitch?

1303
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,311
All right. Let's go. Go, go, go!

1304
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,768
Oh, my God.

1305
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,798
Oh, my God. Are you okay, Annie?

1306
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,214
Don't move.

1307
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,274
Is it broken?

1308
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,317
They don't know.

1309
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,818
It's my leg.

1310
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,778
Tell me when you feel something.

1311
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:28,865
It's her knee.

1312
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,617
It isn't broken, is it?

1313
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,494
Daryl, what happened?

1314
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,995
My foot went out from under me.

1315
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,229
Hey!

1316
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,249
This is what happened.

1317
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,838
I wonder how those got up there.

1318
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,340
They probably
came off a costume.

1319
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,760
We'll take you to the hospital.

1320
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,262
Jesus. Poor Annie.

1321
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,181
Tough break.

1322
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:55,099
Let us through, please.

1323
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,146
Okay. See you
later.

1324
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:02,774
It's my decision.
I'm the producer.

1325
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,526
I hired your show.
You're my producer.

1326
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,946
She was my understudy.
I want a voice in this.

1327
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,490
You can have a voice in this,
but I'm making the decision.

1328
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,325
It is broken, kids.

1329
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,078
Shit. That'll
be three months.

1330
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:16,955
At least.

1331
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,500
Bad karma, huh?

1332
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,086
Nomi, your mother's
waiting for you.

1333
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,088
My mother?

1334
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,174
Well, for your sake,
I hope she's not.

1335
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,762
If a light sleeper can
sleep with a light on,

1336
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,223
can a hard sleeper
sleep with a hard-on?

1337
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,308
What do you call a tiger?

1338
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,353
Henry!

1339
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:46,943
I can get shit on, but I
don't like getting spit on.

1340
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,362
Hi.

1341
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:50,655
Hi, Al.

1342
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,199
You look like shit.

1343
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:56,661
She looks better than a 1
0-inch dick, and you know it.

1344
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,998
So, you like it here?

1345
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,792
You think she's
going to miss you?

1346
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,377
Yeah. Why not?

1347
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,129
We miss her.

1348
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:08,673
She misses us like
that lump on my twat

1349
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,425
I had taken off last week.

1350
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,843
Jesus, Henry.

1351
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,477
I saw the show.

1352
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,689
You were good.

1353
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,067
Thank you, Al.

1354
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,198
Real good.

1355
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,038
You take care, kid.

1356
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:49,255
Must be weird not having
anybody come on you.

1357
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,388
Nomi. You want a ride?

1358
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,601
I got one.

1359
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,853
Okay.
Good night.

1360
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,381
Wait.

1361
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,987
You ever been in one of these?

1362
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,222
No.

1363
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,574
I always wanted one.

1364
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,744
Some car, isn't it?

1365
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,579
It doesn't suck.

1366
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:23,898
All right.
Where we headed?

1367
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,209
You have to give me directions.

1368
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,670
To your place.

1369
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,066
Do you like Cristal?

1370
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:52,902
I like a lot of
different champagnes,

1371
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,655
but I always stick
with champagne.

1372
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,784
What's Andrew Carver like?

1373
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:01,619
You nervous?

1374
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,287
Don't be.

1375
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,206
I'm not.

1376
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,630
I liked it when you came.

1377
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,760
I liked your eyes.

1378
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,660
Hey. Stay with me.

1379
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,289
I'll drive you back
in the morning.

1380
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:34,874
It is morning.

1381
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:36,751
Please.

1382
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,669
I've got a taxi coming.

1383
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:40,504
Send it back.

1384
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,304
Cristal needs a new understudy.

1385
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,349
There's an audition at noon.

1386
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:53,017
You want to try?

1387
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,521
Would you have told me about
it if I hadn't come here?

1388
01:27:58,065 --> 01:28:00,316
It wasn't my idea to come here.
It was yours.

1389
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,573
I want to see you again.

1390
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,993
We'll see how it goes.

1391
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:16,499
What, the audition?

1392
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:28,219
$10,50

1393
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:30,888
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1394
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:38,771
Hello.

1395
01:28:41,528 --> 01:28:42,858
I hate you.

1396
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,404
- Who was he?
- Zack.

1397
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:47,863
Oh, my God.

1398
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,533
Did you tie him up?

1399
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,535
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1400
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,662
I forgot to untie him.

1401
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:00,501
Are you high?

1402
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,086
Maybe a little.

1403
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,506
Oh. I can't go to sleep now.

1404
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:07,299
I've got an audition at noon.

1405
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,302
- Where are the Sugar Snaps?
- In the cupboard.

1406
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:13,472
Nomi, don't get sucked into it.

1407
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,935
Look what I found.

1408
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:22,732
Okay. Whatever,
Nomes.

1409
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:54,305
Julie.

1410
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,557
She's not hot enough.

1411
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,892
She's got it down.

1412
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,186
You can teach them
to get it down.

1413
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,562
She doesn't have Cristal's heat.

1414
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,981
None of them have
Cristal's heat.

1415
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:06,442
I do love you, Gay.

1416
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,652
Nomi's got heat.

1417
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,489
Does she now?

1418
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,908
Yes, she does.

1419
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:17,411
Oh. In a totally
different way, of course.

1420
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:18,579
Come on.

1421
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,247
She's going to take the lead?

1422
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,124
This is a hotel show.

1423
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,442
This isn't the Cheetah.

1424
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,252
Nobody's taking
my lead, darlin'.

1425
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,171
I haven't missed a show
in eight years.

1426
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,590
You're not getting
any younger, darlin'.

1427
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:30,841
Eat me.

1428
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:32,760
Want to do it with just Nomi?

1429
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:33,844
No.

1430
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,846
Yeah, I do.
Set it up, Marty.

1431
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,640
This is bullshit.

1432
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,809
It's about your dick.

1433
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,811
Nicky, Julie, thank you.

1434
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,354
What do we know about her?

1435
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,106
Nothing. I'm not even
sure she gave us

1436
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:46,273
the right Social
Security number.

1437
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,441
Find out, would you?

1438
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:49,110
Find out what?
Everything.

1439
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,918
You fucked her, didn't you?

1440
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:08,921
That piss you off because
you're jealous, Cris,

1441
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,758
or because I beat you
to the punch?

1442
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:34,888
You fuck him for the spot

1443
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,907
or because you wanted to?

1444
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,746
I say you did it for the spot.

1445
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,749
Is that what you did, Cristal?

1446
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:50,254
You don't want to piss me
off now that we're friends.

1447
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:53,549
No. You shouldn't
get pissed off.

1448
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,843
It makes you look older.

1449
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,416
Nomi.

1450
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,834
Yeah?

1451
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:05,853
You got it.

1452
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:07,271
- I do?
- Yeah.

1453
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:10,566
Marty and Gay are going
to work with you.

1454
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,693
I'll talk to Phil. We'll
get some glossies taken.

1455
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,236
You did good.

1456
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,489
I'll call you for dinner.
We'll have some lobster.

1457
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,783
Did you ever hear Caesar sing?
You'll love it.

1458
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:32,446
What?

1459
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:36,175
Congratulations.

1460
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,469
I see you have many talents.

1461
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,846
I thought she did good.

1462
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,787
I didn't even know
about the audition

1463
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:06,497
until afterwards.

1464
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,669
Do you like my nails?

1465
01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:25,516
Not as nice as yours.

1466
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:33,732
Maybe I'll help you
with yours sometime.

1467
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,613
If you want.

1468
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,661
Isn't that nice of you, darlin'?

1469
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:48,205
What are friends for?

1470
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:58,215
On second thought...

1471
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,511
I'm not sure I want
you to do mine.

1472
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,558
I'm getting a little too
old for that whorey look.

1473
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:11,228
I'll think about it.

1474
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:13,714
Okay.

1475
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,151
Close the door on your way out.

1476
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,625
<i>Hey! Bring on
the real dancers!</i>

1477
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,553
<i>Get off the stage!
Shit! Get off there!</i>

1478
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,973
<i>All right! All right!
Enough of this stuff.</i>

1479
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,517
<i>Let's dance!</i>

1480
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,819
Hey!

1481
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:43,195
Hey.

1482
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:44,655
I loved it.

1483
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,198
It was good.

1484
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,075
What are you doing here?
Slumming?

1485
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,201
Heather!

1486
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,435
Hope!

1487
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:52,496
Were we good?

1488
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:53,789
You were great.

1489
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:55,791
She dances like a truck.

1490
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,376
I do not!

1491
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,236
Do you want something to drink?

1492
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,338
Yeah, get me a beer, bitch.

1493
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:04,466
Look what I got.

1494
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,220
It's beautiful.

1495
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,472
I stole it from my grandmother.

1496
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:13,517
You did not!
You got it at a pawnshop.

1497
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:24,361
We're getting married.

1498
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,532
You love her?

1499
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:31,994
I don't know.
She's having a baby.

1500
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,709
What about this?

1501
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,295
We ain't any good.
You heard them.

1502
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:44,214
"Get outta here!
Get off the stage!"

1503
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,634
What are you gonna do?

1504
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,721
Work in a grocery store.

1505
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,890
Her mother owns it.

1506
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,893
We'll get a discount
on baby food.

1507
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:09,072
See ya.

1508
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,620
Shit happens, you know?

1509
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:17,581
Life sucks.
I'm a student of T-shirts.

1510
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,511
Hey, Nicky.

1511
01:37:57,789 --> 01:37:59,414
Hey, excuse me.
Wait! You cannot go...

1512
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:00,541
What's going on?

1513
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,251
Fuck! What do you mean,
"What's going on?"

1514
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:03,627
Hey, cool it, all right?

1515
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:04,962
Cool it?

1516
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:07,381
You told me I got it,
then sent me this?

1517
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,175
I didn't have a choice. She threatened
to walk, brought her lawyers in.

1518
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:11,218
So what?

1519
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,845
So she's a star.
You're not worth it.

1520
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:17,307
I'm sorry, Nomi.
I tried.

1521
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:19,084
Fuck!

1522
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,562
My G-string snapped.

1523
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:24,565
So there I was, dancing buck
naked for five minutes.

1524
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,817
I mean, my poor partner.

1525
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,489
Hey, I thought
about it, darlin'.

1526
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,451
You think you could
do my nails now?

1527
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:43,525
Okay.

1528
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,669
Maybe some other time.

1529
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,428
Come on, slave girl.

1530
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:06,518
Let's go! Go!

1531
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,396
Run, run, run! Go!

1532
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,606
Go! Go! Run!

1533
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:20,699
You guys, let me through!

1534
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,451
Oh, my God!

1535
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:23,869
Shit!

1536
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,479
Cristal, can you hear me?

1537
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:29,166
Somebody get Marty here!

1538
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,417
Marty!

1539
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:36,673
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

1540
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,759
Somebody get
an ambulance. Now!

1541
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:40,302
Who was behind her?

1542
01:41:40,386 --> 01:41:41,553
I was.

1543
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:43,847
What happened?

1544
01:41:44,766 --> 01:41:47,559
I don't know.
She just went down.

1545
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,895
She slipped.

1546
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,229
I saw it.

1547
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,066
Nomi wasn't even close to her.

1548
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:14,461
Tough break, huh?

1549
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:18,632
What's the matter?

1550
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:19,966
Nothing.

1551
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,488
All right.
Thanks.

1552
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,156
Keep me informed.

1553
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:46,034
Well, she's got a concussion.

1554
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:47,494
That'll be all right.

1555
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:49,579
But she's got a compound
fracture of the right hip.

1556
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:50,831
Oh, Christ.

1557
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,416
You know how long
those take to heal?

1558
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,502
We got to shut the show down.

1559
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,421
Not a chance.
The show goes on.

1560
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:02,092
The Stardust is never dark.
It's never been.

1561
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,262
It never will be,
not while I'm alive.

1562
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:08,682
Who was her understudy?

1563
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:10,417
Well, we had a girl who...

1564
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,019
What's funny?

1565
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:15,355
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam.

1566
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:17,691
You can't just replace her.

1567
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,322
Couldn't we bring somebody in

1568
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,699
while she's recuperating?

1569
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,158
She could be out a year.

1570
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,493
Like who?

1571
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:30,829
Janet Jackson.
Paula Abdul.

1572
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:31,872
Paula Abdul.

1573
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:32,956
- Jesus, Phil.
- In my show?

1574
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,667
We're not gonna pay those
kinds of salaries.

1575
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:39,379
In that case, we do
what we do in Vegas.

1576
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:43,091
- What?
- We gamble.

1577
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:47,387
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1578
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,848
<i>the Stardust proudly presents...</i>

1579
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:51,808
<i>Miss Nomi Malone!</i>

1580
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,211
We could've brought
anyone into this show,

1581
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,546
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul.

1582
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:07,467
Nomi Malone is what
Las Vegas is all about.

1583
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:12,222
She's dazzling, she's exciting,
and very, very sexy.

1584
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:13,473
Thank you, Zack.

1585
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:14,557
Yes, sir.

1586
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:17,352
How did you feel
about the show tonight?

1587
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,563
I just hope I can be
as good as the show.

1588
01:45:20,648 --> 01:45:22,232
You are, my dear.

1589
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,734
You are the show.

1590
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:27,946
Miss Malone, please.

1591
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:29,781
Come on, come on,
over here, Nomi.

1592
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,408
That's great, Nomi.
One more.

1593
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:32,575
Please, please.

1594
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,577
- This way, please.
- Congratulations.

1595
01:45:37,123 --> 01:45:39,040
Hey, you ready to party?

1596
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,250
Where?

1597
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:42,335
The Paradiso. I rented
out the bungalows.

1598
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,087
- For what?
- For you.

1599
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,718
Hurry up.
I got a limo waiting.

1600
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,177
I don't have anything to wear.

1601
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:52,929
Yes, you do!

1602
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:56,641
Andrew Carver's coming. He saw the
show, thought you were great!

1603
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:58,810
Did you hear that?

1604
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:00,729
Andrew Carver is
going to be there!

1605
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:02,313
Yeah, I heard.

1606
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,065
Hey.

1607
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,776
What's wrong with you?

1608
01:46:08,654 --> 01:46:10,697
You pushed her, didn't you?

1609
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,140
No.

1610
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,285
How can you talk
that shit to me?

1611
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,453
Julie saw it.

1612
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:17,704
She couldn't have seen it.

1613
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:20,999
I saw Julie. And her
back was to you.

1614
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:27,338
She saw it.

1615
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,451
Wow.

1616
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:34,287
Okay.

1617
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:37,599
Have fun at your party.

1618
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:41,311
Molly. Molly!
Come here, Molly!

1619
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,314
You got to come.
Andrew's going to be there.

1620
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:45,982
I don't care.

1621
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:49,652
Molly...

1622
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:53,907
it ain't a party without you.

1623
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:58,161
Let go of me.

1624
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:02,207
Miss Malone! Miss Malone!
Miss Malone! Miss Malone!

1625
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:03,441
One more!
This way!

1626
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:13,635
This way, Nomi!

1627
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:18,473
<i>To the one and only</i>

1628
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:19,766
Surprise!

1629
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:25,605
<i>Beautiful girl in the world</i>

1630
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,280
One minute.

1631
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:42,705
Oh, my God.

1632
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:44,524
So...

1633
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,961
What I want to know is...

1634
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,714
Where's Andrew?

1635
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,639
Look.

1636
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:13,027
I love your outfit.

1637
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,529
Thank you.

1638
01:48:16,282 --> 01:48:17,490
Nomi...

1639
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,994
Think I could be
your understudy?

1640
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:24,497
I'll see what I can do, okay?

1641
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,083
Thanks, darlin'.

1642
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:30,628
Hey, Andrew Carver's here.

1643
01:48:30,713 --> 01:48:32,255
Come on.
I'll introduce you.

1644
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:33,840
Andrew's here!

1645
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,121
Zack.

1646
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,350
Andrew Carver,

1647
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:45,518
Nomi Malone.

1648
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,562
How you doin'? You were
sensational tonight.

1649
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:49,606
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1650
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,024
Zachary...

1651
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,901
Wherever did you find her?

1652
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:54,135
I'll never tell.

1653
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:58,406
I like your songs.

1654
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:59,532
Thank you.

1655
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:00,992
You know, uh...

1656
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:02,660
I like your ass.

1657
01:49:02,912 --> 01:49:04,120
Call me.

1658
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,209
Molly Abrams,

1659
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:10,919
Andrew Carver.

1660
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:12,337
Hi, Molly.

1661
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:16,132
Andrew. I can't even
thread a needle anymore.

1662
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:19,219
Sorry?

1663
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:21,721
Molly's one of
your biggest fans.

1664
01:49:22,223 --> 01:49:24,641
Well, then, let me
get you a drink.

1665
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,476
Okay.

1666
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,810
Come on.

1667
01:49:31,482 --> 01:49:32,815
Oh, my God.

1668
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:35,860
Enjoy.

1669
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,655
You look beautiful tonight.

1670
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:44,744
<i>Should we walk into the wind?</i>

1671
01:49:46,372 --> 01:49:50,500
<i>Maybe fall when autumn falls</i>

1672
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:54,754
<i>Let's walk into the wind</i>

1673
01:49:57,883 --> 01:50:01,678
<i>You have to learn to touch
by touching</i>

1674
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,975
<i>Touch me, touch me, if you dare</i>

1675
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:11,854
<i>We will reach
the end of the beginning</i>

1676
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:16,276
<i>In this beatnik love affair...</i>

1677
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,541
What's going on?

1678
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:37,213
Just want to party, baby.

1679
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:40,466
Let me go!

1680
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,285
Get her!

1681
01:50:43,887 --> 01:50:45,722
- Let me go!
- Shut the fuck up!

1682
01:50:47,558 --> 01:50:49,309
Throw her down!

1683
01:50:53,022 --> 01:50:54,188
Pussy!

1684
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:56,566
Fuck her, man!

1685
01:50:56,775 --> 01:50:59,193
Fuck her!

1686
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:00,820
Fucker, let me go!

1687
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:02,071
Fuck her!

1688
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:13,583
I could fall in love with you.

1689
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:51,913
Molly.

1690
01:51:57,795 --> 01:51:59,545
We have her sedated.

1691
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:01,297
She's in shock.

1692
01:52:02,091 --> 01:52:05,385
She has a broken nose,
vaginal tears.

1693
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,388
She'll be here
three or four days.

1694
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:11,849
Zack, Zack.

1695
01:52:38,627 --> 01:52:41,754
Look at this.
And look at this.

1696
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:43,214
Later.

1697
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,445
- Where are the police?
- They're not here.

1698
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:48,303
- Why the fuck aren't they here?
- Because they're not coming.

1699
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,516
Don't do it.

1700
01:52:54,143 --> 01:52:55,309
Polly.

1701
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:04,861
How did you find out?

1702
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:08,072
You were busted for disturbing
the peace at the Crave Club.

1703
01:53:08,157 --> 01:53:10,533
The police took
your fingerprints.

1704
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:12,535
I'm not listening to this.

1705
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,203
Yes, you do.

1706
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:19,417
Polly Ann Costello.

1707
01:53:19,793 --> 01:53:22,962
Your father killed your
mother, then killed himself.

1708
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,299
You ran away from a foster home
in Oakland, December 1990.

1709
01:53:26,383 --> 01:53:28,759
Arrests, Denver, soliciting.

1710
01:53:28,844 --> 01:53:30,470
- Stop it!
- San Jose, soliciting.

1711
01:53:30,554 --> 01:53:33,055
Cheyenne, soliciting.
Shall I read you the rest of them?

1712
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,224
Possession of crack cocaine.

1713
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,810
Assault with a deadly weapon.

1714
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:40,688
Tell me something.

1715
01:53:40,772 --> 01:53:42,648
Why did you stop hooking?

1716
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:46,235
You had your future pretty
well mapped out for yourself.

1717
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,739
I did what I had to do.

1718
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,909
Just like you did with Cristal.

1719
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,996
I'm not a whore.

1720
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:00,441
No.

1721
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:02,710
You're not.

1722
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:06,339
You're going to be a big star.

1723
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:10,718
Your face is going to be
up on billboards.

1724
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:14,805
And you're going to make a lot
of money for the Stardust.

1725
01:54:30,113 --> 01:54:33,282
You're not going to let
them get away with this.

1726
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:36,035
Andrew Carver is
at the Paradiso this year.

1727
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:37,870
But he might be
at the Riviera next year

1728
01:54:37,955 --> 01:54:40,248
or the Stardust the year after.
He's part of the team.

1729
01:54:40,332 --> 01:54:41,707
So are you.

1730
01:54:44,962 --> 01:54:46,629
What about Molly?

1731
01:54:47,172 --> 01:54:48,756
You like her? I'll see he
gives her enough money.

1732
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,841
She can have a dress shop.

1733
01:54:54,513 --> 01:54:56,180
Tell me something.

1734
01:54:57,391 --> 01:54:59,141
What did you charge?

1735
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:02,395
Hooking.

1736
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,467
50.

1737
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:10,444
100 sometimes.

1738
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:13,573
You got low
self-esteem, baby.

1739
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:15,658
You're a fantastic fuck.

1740
01:55:25,836 --> 01:55:28,045
I was paying you a compliment.

1741
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,041
It's showtime.

1742
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:20,222
Andrew Carver, please.

1743
01:56:27,648 --> 01:56:28,939
- Hello, baby.
- Hi.

1744
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,539
Lookin' good.

1745
01:56:30,734 --> 01:56:32,652
- He's ready for you.
- Thank you.

1746
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:47,833
Didn't take you long.

1747
01:56:48,585 --> 01:56:49,735
No.

1748
01:56:57,761 --> 01:56:59,845
I like you better topless.

1749
01:57:01,682 --> 01:57:03,974
Wait till you see me bottomless.

1750
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,690
I'm waiting.

1751
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:48,185
Take the rest off.

1752
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:51,213
Sure.

1753
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:01,157
You make a sound,
I'll fucking kill you!

1754
01:58:01,742 --> 01:58:03,492
Okay, okay, okay.

1755
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:09,832
Oh, man, no.

1756
01:58:18,592 --> 01:58:19,759
Fucker!

1757
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:21,093
Fuck off!

1758
01:58:32,898 --> 01:58:34,940
He says he wants to sleep.

1759
01:58:35,025 --> 01:58:36,609
Tired him out, huh?

1760
01:58:36,693 --> 01:58:37,843
Yeah.

1761
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:57,129
She's still out.
It's the medication.

1762
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:01,008
Is she okay?

1763
01:59:01,218 --> 01:59:02,551
She's okay.

1764
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:17,983
Molly.

1765
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:26,742
I just went to Carver.

1766
01:59:27,953 --> 01:59:30,079
I kicked the shit out of him.

1767
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:37,378
I love you.

1768
01:59:50,559 --> 01:59:51,725
Cristal Connors, please.

1769
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:53,102
Room 319.

1770
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:04,154
You know the best advice
I ever gave you?

1771
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:07,616
If you're the only one
left standing up there...

1772
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:09,451
They'll hire you.

1773
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:15,499
Thank you... And good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

1774
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:18,544
Cristal has left the building.

1775
02:00:20,881 --> 02:00:22,381
I'm sorry, Cristal.

1776
02:00:22,465 --> 02:00:25,593
Yeah, I know just
how sorry you are.

1777
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:30,973
How do you think
I got my first lead?

1778
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:36,937
There's always someone
younger and hungrier

1779
02:00:37,022 --> 02:00:39,356
coming down the stairs
after you.

1780
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:43,736
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1781
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,487
Oh, hell, darlin'.

1782
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:47,489
I needed a rest.

1783
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:51,619
Besides my lawyers got me
a real nice settlement.

1784
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:56,916
I gotta go.

1785
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,294
Aren't you going to come
here and give me a big kiss?

1786
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:46,375
Bye, darlin'.

1787
02:02:10,368 --> 02:02:12,616
Come on!
Hurry up!

1788
02:02:20,709 --> 02:02:22,251
Hop in, pard.

1789
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:24,837
This here's your lucky day.

1790
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:28,048
Right.

1791
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:32,177
Let's go.

1792
02:02:39,227 --> 02:02:40,894
So did you gamble?

1793
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:45,107
Did you win?

1794
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:50,821
What'd you win?

1795
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,810
Me.

1796
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,038
Oh, fuck.

1797
02:02:59,956 --> 02:03:01,206
It's you.

1798
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:04,752
I want my fucking suitcase,

1799
02:03:04,836 --> 02:03:05,878
asshole!

1800
02:03:05,962 --> 02:03:09,381
Hey! Wait a minute! I'm driving here!
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1801
02:03:09,466 --> 02:03:10,549
Watch the fuckin' road!

1802
02:03:10,633 --> 02:03:12,051
Be cool, be cool.

1803
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:14,511
I'll get your suitcase.
Mellow out.
