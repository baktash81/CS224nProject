1
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,301
<i>You're not concentrating. I can tell.</i>

2
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:40,706
You're thinking about e-mails or text
messages or handbags.

3
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:46,278
You don't know that. You don't know what
I'm thinking about.

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,646
Lautner.

5
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,581
Okay, I might not know the specifics

6
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,617
but I know it's some kind of useless racket

7
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,218
that's keeping you from concentrating.

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,122
I could be thinking about
the cure for cancer.

9
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,558
In fact, I may have just cracked it.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,294
And now you're trying to get me
to erase it from my hard drive.

11
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,163
You couldn't cure a UTI

12
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,065
if you owned a cranberry farm.

13
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,667
Hey! I have never had
an infected urinary tract.

14
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,402
Oh, really?
No, I have not.

15
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,104
And you've never had HPV either?

16
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,305
No!
All right.

17
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,406
No human papillomavirus?

18
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,541
Watch your mouth!

19
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,142
Hey!
Watch your mouth.

20
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,344
I smack too. I was vaccinated.

21
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,080
I was vaccinated.

22
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:24,083
'Cause, unlike you, I was born after
the polio vaccine.

23
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,584
What are you talking about?
I am five years older than you.

24
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,453
How do I know that?

25
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:31,123
I see no documentation of that.
For all I know you're 45.

26
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,126
Listen to me!
I am 35 years old. Okay?

27
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,128
You're 45! You're gray!

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,796
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Buddy, don't grab my hair.

29
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,232
It's thin. I don't like when you pull my hair.

30
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,767
Then let go of my wrist.

31
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,602
Okay.

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,571
On three. Truce? Okay.

33
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,606
Three, two, one.
One, two, three.

34
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,108
Okay. Don't grab my hair again, okay?

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,843
Okay. Well, then don't hold me down.

36
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,245
It makes me self-conscious.
That's my only way to defend myself.

37
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,580
I'm being serious though.
Will you please concentrate?

38
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,215
Yes.
Okay.

39
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,784
That's it.

40
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,653
Take three deep breaths.

41
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,266
This is the only moment
you need to be worried about.

42
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,236
There's no yesterday.

43
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,737
There's no tomorrow.

44
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,672
There's just right now.

45
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,609
You're not late for anything.

46
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,145
And you're not gonna miss anything.

47
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,614
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

48
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,718
And you're exactly who
you're supposed to be.

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,821
You're absolutely perfect.

50
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,191
And whatever happens today

51
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,560
is exactly what's supposed to happen.

52
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,533
And if you want

53
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:50,235
I'll spend every moment with you
for the rest of your life.

54
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,308
Okay, I want.

55
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,788
You're gonna have
a wonderful day today.

56
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,590
You don't have to be
nervous about anything.

57
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,292
Okay, I'm not.

58
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,593
You promise?

59
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,262
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

60
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,936
You're so terrible on the eyes.

61
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,339
I don't know why I share a bed with you!
You're disgusting!

62
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:35,314
That's a lot! That's a lot of space.
Forget it. I've got a friend.

63
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,416
Hey, you! Is Charlie awake yet?

64
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,251
'Cause I've got to pick him up.
We've got a meeting in town.

65
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,485
I thought I'd swing by and grab him.

66
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,753
Yeah, he's inside.

67
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,422
Right. You doing all right?

68
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,424
Yeah.
Yeah, good!

69
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,825
Are you okay, Randy?

70
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,428
No. No. Why?
Why? What's wrong?

71
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,830
You're just a little sweaty.
But it's not a big deal.

72
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,399
Okay, well, I'm sorry. That happens.

73
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,834
I hate it. You don't need to apologize.

74
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,236
Okay. Okay.

75
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,870
Bye, Randy.

76
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,239
You too!

77
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,709
Yes. I'll do that. I'll...

78
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,777
Someone's calling.
Hold on, hold on. Just a second.

79
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,346
God damn it! Son of a bitch.

80
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,383
Damn it!

81
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,418
Damn it!

82
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,455
Oh, shit! Fuck!

83
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,889
Hey. Hey. No!

84
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,859
Fuck! No! No!

85
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,411
Oh! Oh! No! Kids!

86
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,346
Oh, God!

87
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,955
What the fuck!

88
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,494
Mom!

89
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,828
Oh, no! Kids!

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,763
Mom!
No!

91
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,071
When I tell you to stay in park
you fucking stay in park!

92
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,307
You stay in park or I will break you!

93
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,641
Hear me?

94
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,343
Hey!
What are you doing?

95
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,911
What the fuck are you doing, Randy?

96
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,413
Nothing!

97
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,581
What do you mean nothing?
I look out my window

98
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,583
and you're ghost riding your van
in the backyard, man!

99
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,352
You're blasting holes in everything!

100
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:24,323
Shut the fuck up, Charlie!
Shut the fuck up!

101
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,526
I'm sorry, ma'am. Wait! Let me get
my badge! Don't worry!

102
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,028
No! Don't go anywhere! I got my badge!
This car is malfunctioning!

103
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,331
Randy! You blew her window out!

104
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,099
You've got to be more careful than that!

105
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,935
Would you shut the fuck up? I'm trying to
explain to this lady what happened!

106
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,804
Hey! Why don't you explain to me, man?

107
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,406
It's my yard you're driving through!

108
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,543
You're assaulting a minivan with a firearm?
Jesus, Randy!

109
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,378
I had a fucking accident!

110
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,382
Okay? I had a fucking accident!
All right? I'm embarrassed!

111
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,385
Okay? Are you happy?
I spilt my coffee all over me!

112
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,020
Listen, I didn't know
you spilt your coffee, okay?

113
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,422
Yeah, it spilt on
my shirt and on my pants!

114
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,459
I'm sorry. Listen, it's all right.
Are you okay?

115
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,662
Yeah. I think so.

116
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,097
So you spilt your coffee?

117
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,132
Yeah. I spilled it on
my shirt and on my pants.

118
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,668
And then you fell out of your van?

119
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,538
Or were you firing first and then you fell out?

120
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't want to talk about it out here.

121
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,908
Okay.
Okay.

122
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,076
You want to come inside?

123
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,479
Get me out of this yard, man!

124
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,880
You were really firing that gun, man.

125
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,048
Okay. Next subject.

126
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,052
Hi, Annie. Take a seat.
I'm just finishing this up.

127
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,854
Thanks.
Oh, take your time.

128
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,798
What's that?

129
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,969
Uh, I was just taking
a couple of deep breaths.

130
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,904
Someone recommended
I try it when I'm nervous.

131
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,572
You know what else works?

132
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,941
Xanax. Oh. It's so good.

133
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,576
All benzos, really.

134
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,912
But that one works extremely well.
Very fast-acting.

135
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,481
Huh? I never take Xanax.

136
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,150
Well, you should really try it.

137
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:01,420
If you mix it with wine or beer it sort of
supercharges it.

138
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,187
I should try that.

139
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,157
Why are you nervous?

140
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,161
I know, you know, it's the
end of the semester

141
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,996
and I also know
there's budgetary issues.

142
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,465
And that you have to
let a few professors go.

143
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,866
And so when I got the note in my box,

144
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,470
I think I just assumed the worst.

145
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,907
Would you be afraid to get fired
if your job was to clean the floor

146
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,142
at one of those coin-operated jack-off booths?

147
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,644
You know, where you're the one
holding the mop.

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,080
Um, fired from a jack-off booth?

149
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,882
Where the truckers go and masturbate.

150
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,084
Yeah. I know what you're talking about.

151
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,453
Well? Would you?
Um...

152
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,522
No. I would not.

153
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,692
And yet, you're here at Milton Valley,

154
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,594
the jack-off booth of academia.

155
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,229
I'm not sure what your point is.

156
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,732
You're too smart and passionate
to work here. So why do you?

157
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,202
You know, I created
my own major at Stanford.

158
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,038
I have a doctorate in Non-Violent
Conflict Resolution,

159
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,907
which no university offers as a major.
They just don't.

160
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,710
So I teach intro to soc classes.

161
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,713
And I'm... I'm also
in a relationship here.

162
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,215
I'm going to stop you.

163
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,751
UC is starting a conflict
resolution program.

164
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,121
I spoke to the head of
the Sociology Department.

165
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,025
And she's extremely interested
in hiring you to run that program.

166
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,794
No way.

167
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:19,130
Now, she's meeting the other
applicant on Wednesday

168
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,866
and she'll need to
make a decision that day.

169
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:21,700
Their semester starts in a week.

170
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,902
You're meeting her on Wednesday.

171
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,937
Oh, my God!

172
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,508
Thank you so much! I'm so flattered

173
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,576
that you would even consider me!

174
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,946
I just have to check with my boyfriend
Charlie because he has...

175
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,749
He can't exactly leave, uh, Milton.
Annie.

176
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,552
Please. I went to state school.

177
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,522
I went to football games and blacked
out and got date raped.

178
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,124
I had abortions. I worried too much
about what my boyfriends thought.

179
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,993
I got what I deserved.

180
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,195
But that's not you.

181
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,531
You deserve so much more than this.

182
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,134
I hope your neighbor doesn't report

183
00:08:56,136 --> 00:09:00,805
Why? You're a marshal. You're allowed
to fire your weapon, aren't you?

184
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,075
Yeah, but I've had a couple incidences.

185
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,613
And this would be bad.

186
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,615
Although, I don't know what more
they could do to me.

187
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,184
This seems like the bottom of the barrel
as far as being a marshal.

188
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,720
Why did you get stuck
with witness protection?

189
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,024
Because I accidentally
discharged my weapon.

190
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,927
Once at a gas station and another
time at a baseball game.

191
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,828
At a baseball game? Yes.

192
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,999
No! Nobody. Are you kidding me? No!
It wasn't even my fault!

193
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,568
I'm not kidding you.

194
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,036
You shoot your weapon
off at a baseball game

195
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:34,839
It's not crazy that I would assume
maybe someone got shot.

196
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,241
Listen, I asked for a revolver.

197
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,144
A revolver has a hammer that you pull back.

198
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:42,047
And a safety. But no. What do
they give me? Right.

199
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,049
Jesus Christ, man.
Be careful with that.

200
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,651
Yeah. Look at that.

201
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,019
Okay. Now, you heard stuff
going on. I mean...

202
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,724
I don't know. That's not even safe.

203
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,159
Randy, Randy, Randy, Randy.

204
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,660
Please, please,
please, please! Okay?

205
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,030
I'll just...

206
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,934
From now on, don't touch
my weapon anymore. Okay?

207
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,070
Listen, I wasn't... I know we're
friends and everything.

208
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,339
And it's kind of a gray area now
that we are friends.

209
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,741
But do not touch my weapon
again. It's unsafe.

210
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,942
Okay. I'm sorry.

211
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,812
I trained for two years
to be able to do this.

212
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,880
Okay. So please, do me a solid.

213
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,916
I'm not going to touch it.
I won't bring it up again.

214
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,250
I promise. I'm not going to touch it.
All right, thank you.

215
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,385
Okay.
Okay.

216
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:21,753
And it's not your fault. I know.

217
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,987
Oh, no. Did it not go good?

218
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,056
No, it went really well.

219
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,059
Then why are you upset?

220
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,328
You just look so stupid sitting there.

221
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,132
So impossibly cute.

222
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,668
And I don't even know
why you like me so much.

223
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,437
Oh, mama. I think you're stupid.

224
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,842
I should have oiled that.

225
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,216
So she didn't fire you?

226
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,289
Debby found me a job where I could
head my own department.

227
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,458
In my field.

228
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,193
And it would be the first one
like it in the country.

229
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,163
And it would be perfect.

230
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,299
Then why are you upset?

231
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,436
Because it's in L.A.

232
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,873
And I would have to
leave and move to L.A.

233
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,778
It's in L.A.?

234
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,247
That's the only place
this job exists? In L.A.?

235
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,316
No other place?

236
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,285
No, Charlie.
There's no other place.

237
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,353
It only exists in L.A.

238
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,025
And Debby told me that
if I didn't take the interview

239
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,394
she would fire me.

240
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,763
And I wouldn't even
have my job here anymore.

241
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,359
Will you say something, please?

242
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,428
What do you want me to say?
There's nothing to say.

243
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,798
Well, what are you thinking?

244
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,533
What am I thinking?

245
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,369
I think I'm pissed that the one thing
that makes me happy,

246
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,906
the one thing that makes this
shit-hole town bearable is leaving.

247
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,178
I didn't say I was leaving.

248
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,114
You're leaving!

249
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,817
Even if you wanted to stay,
I wouldn't let you.

250
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,486
I wouldn't forgive myself
and you wouldn't either.

251
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,293
That's not true.
If I stayed I wouldn't resent you.

252
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,249
Hey.
Where are you going?

253
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,284
I'm gonna go talk to Debby.

254
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,553
About what?

255
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,355
I'm gonna beg her to let me have my job back.

256
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,157
Okay, wait.
Slow down a second.

257
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,359
Are you sure
you want to do this?

258
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,528
If I wanted to go to L.A.,
I'd have to be outside

259
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,463
packing my car up to
get there by Wednesday.

260
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,936
Yeah. So you don't see me
packing up my car, do you?

261
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,604
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey.

262
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,074
This doesn't feel right.

263
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,576
I'll be back in an hour or two.

264
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,082
You have been dating this clown for one year.

265
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,418
It's only going to take you six months to get over him.

266
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Now, I want you to take one of these
when it gets unbearable.

267
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,523
Some Xanies in here.

268
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,093
And Lorazepam.
Oh! Dilaudid.

269
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,628
My gift to you.

270
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,096
Debby, I don't need it.
I don't need the pills.

271
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,297
Take it!

272
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,304
Look at Captain
Longdick out there.

273
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,440
Does this guy like to fuck, or what?

274
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,076
That's Charlie!

275
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,116
What are you doing here?

276
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,051
I'm here to take your fat ass to L.A.

277
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,520
You can't leave.

278
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,989
Yeah.

279
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,457
Look, I can't live here without you

280
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,525
and I'm not letting you stay.

281
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,360
So I suggest you get in.

282
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,630
You don't think
it'll be too dangerous?

283
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:36,467
No. I've been gone for four years
and L.A. is a big city.

284
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,436
We'll be fine.

285
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,381
I thought you said this car didn't run.

286
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,586
Sweetie, this car more than runs.

287
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,032
Whoa, whoa, buddy!
Where are you going?

288
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,233
To L.A.

289
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,468
I have to pack my stuff.

290
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,669
No. I grabbed
everything you'd want.

291
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,438
Where?

292
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,306
It's in the trunk.

293
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,742
Honey, everything I need for L.A. would not fit in the trunk.

294
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,311
Sweetie, this car also came as
a hardtop convertible.

295
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,014
The whole roof
slid into the trunk.

296
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,983
The trunk was designed
to hold the entire roof.

297
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,751
Believe me.
Your stuff fit in the trunk.

298
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,657
Oh, wait!

299
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,659
What? My teaching certificate.
It's at Gil's.

300
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,329
You're kidding me.

301
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,598
No. And I need it.

302
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,768
Oh, boy.

303
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,448
Be back in a sec.

304
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,787
Oh, my God.

305
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,629
Hey!

306
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:14,799
Anne?
What a fun surprise.

307
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,235
Um, listen. I think I accidentally left...

308
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,071
You caught me in the middle of
doing all my laundry.

309
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,240
Sorry about that. Um...

310
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,242
When I split up the photo albums,

311
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,411
I think I left the one with my
teaching degree here with you.

312
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,247
Oh. Okay, well.

313
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,649
That's an honest mistake.
You want to come in and talk about it?

314
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:35,153
No, Gil. I just want the album.
Can you grab it?

315
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,220
<i>Uno momento.</i>

316
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,792
<i>Uno momento.</i>

317
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,395
Nice buns!

318
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,798
Well, it looks like
we've got quite
a few options here.

319
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,334
We can spread them out...
No, that's fine.
It'll be in the back.

320
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,670
All right. Why, pray tell,
are you in such
a hurry to get this?

321
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,772
Um, because
I'm taking a job
in L.A. and I need it.

322
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,142
You're taking a job
in Los Angeles? When?

323
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:01,345
Uh, now, actually.
We're leaving right now.

324
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:02,547
We?

325
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,385
You're moving to
Los Angeles with a man
you barely know?

326
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,419
Bingo. Okay...

327
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,687
Hold on a second!

328
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,389
I'm not letting you
move 500 miles away

329
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,558
with a man named
Charles Bronson,
who you barely know

330
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,561
who happens to
be in the witness
protection program.

331
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,829
Do you know who goes
into witness protection?

332
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:23,301
Criminals who have
ratted out other criminals
to save their own ass.

333
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,703
Okay! First of all, I never
should have told you
anything about him.

334
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,539
I never should have.
Secondly, you don't
have the authority

335
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,641
to not let me
do anything, Gil.

336
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,277
And lastly, he was
given that name when
he entered protection

337
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,646
which he entered because
he witnessed a crime. Okay?

338
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,516
He's a good Samaritan, Gil.
Not a criminal. Give me!

339
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,718
You can't just
disappear with that scumbag.
All right? It's unacceptable.

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,819
He's probably
going to murder you

341
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:45,389
Give me the album, Gil!
Give me the album!
Annie. Annie!

342
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,625
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing, Gil?

343
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,895
Nothing. I was just
giving her the albums
that she asked for.

344
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,797
You're sunbathing, too?
What, you got your top off?

345
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,800
I was doing laundry.

346
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,735
Give her the
fucking books, all right?

347
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,572
And when he snaps,
you better hope to hell
that I'm there to save you.

348
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,507
Because he's
going to do it.

349
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,708
Okay, Gil. Take care.

350
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,344
Bye, Gil!

351
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:11,782
You got it?
Yeah.

352
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,322
G-L-8-7-9.
G-L-8-7-9!

353
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,292
What?

354
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,328
What's with this car?

355
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,631
What do you mean
what's with this car?

356
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:30,568
I mean...
It's kind of obnoxious.

357
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,570
Oh! You think this
car is obnoxious?

358
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,273
'Cause I think it's tits!

359
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,542
And I think
most people think
this car is tits.

360
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,243
It sounds like
it's gonna break.

361
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,778
No, it does not sound
like it's gonna break.

362
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,947
It sounds like
it has 700 horsepower.

363
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,484
Believe me,
all dudes love
how this car sounds.

364
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,718
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

365
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,522
I'm in a 700
horsepower dude lure?

366
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,690
That's right.

367
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,926
Apologies.
I had no idea.

368
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,528
You definitely told me
this car was broken.

369
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,764
It was when I was
talking about turning the
shed into a craft room.

370
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,332
Yeah?
Yeah.

371
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,433
So, why did you say that?

372
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,968
Why did I say that?

373
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,571
Holy shnikes,
look at this.

374
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,806
There's a parrot
driving this car.

375
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:11,209
Uh-huh.
A driving parrot!

376
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,544
Oh, man!
I'm gonna be rich!

377
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,613
I found the only
driving parrot!

378
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,515
I was hiding it
in the shed

379
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,816
'cause you're
not supposed to
bring anything with you.

380
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,686
I mean,
especially not a car.

381
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,222
But I spent a year and
a half building this
thing with my dad

382
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,757
and I didn't want to
just not have it anymore.

383
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,796
You wanted to
bring it because you
built it with your dad?

384
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,732
Yeah.

385
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,801
We weren't the
hottest communicators,

386
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,570
but we kind of
worked well together.

387
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,440
So he was into
off-road racing and
we did that together.

388
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,909
And then he was
into building old cars
and we did that.

389
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,678
I think it's sweet.

390
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,449
I want a burger.

391
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,484
Mmm! I want a burger too.

392
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,919
Let's get some beef!

393
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,821
Let's get some
beef up in us.

394
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,926
What are you doing?

395
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,328
I'm on my Pouncer app.

396
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,030
Yeah.
I understand it's an app.

397
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm saying when you
hit the Pouncer app
what happens?

398
00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:13,471
I hit Pouncer.
And it sends out my
exact location on this map.

399
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,874
And then I can see
who else has Pouncer
on the same exact map.

400
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,743
And I can chat with
them in real time.

401
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,611
And be like,
"Hey! Where are you?
What's going on?"

402
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,812
Oh.

403
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,416
You're the only one on here.

404
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,551
Yeah.

405
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,987
Well, we're in the
middle of nowhere.
There's no gays.

406
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,589
Have you used it
in another city?

407
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,957
Oh, my God.

408
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,660
Airports. Vegas.
You know.

409
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,029
Austin lights up like
a fucking Christmas tree.

410
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:42,333
Ten feet away.
Zero feet away.
Guys wanting to hook up.

411
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,602
For coffee? Or like...

412
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,437
No. To fuck.

413
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,807
Or hand jobs or blowjobs
or kissing. Whatever.

414
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,375
So wait, then like,
you just hit a button

415
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,644
and within five minutes
you and a stranger,

416
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,479
having sex?
Or having hand jobs?

417
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,849
I mean,
that's not the
intention of the app.

418
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:02,987
I think the intention
of the app is to see who's
straight and who's gay.

419
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,823
Like for you,
you're straight
so it's safe to assume

420
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,591
that you can
hit on anyone
or flirt with them.

421
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:10,094
And then I do that,
what happens?
Victim of a hate crime.

422
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,696
Yeah. Not cool.

423
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:12,697
Not cool at all.

424
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,764
Oh, Gil.

425
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,834
What?

426
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,036
Hey! Did you
change your mind?

427
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,938
It doesn't work
like that, Gil.

428
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,674
I can't have him
tailed or brought in.
He hasn't done anything.

429
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,445
I'm telling you, the guy
is a fucking Ted Bundy.
Okay, Terry?

430
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:29,947
He's probably going
to murder her and do
kinky shit to her body!

431
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,415
And that's
gonna be on you!

432
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,783
You're supposed to
be a fucking cop!

433
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,418
I am a fucking cop, Gil!

434
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,620
I don't need
you telling me
how to be a cop.

435
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,422
I know what I'm
fucking doing, okay?

436
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,858
You know what?
You still owe me 1,700 bucks!

437
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,626
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

438
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,562
I got you
out of that DUI.

439
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,831
That report said
you soiled yourself, Gil.

440
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,532
<i>Like a fucking</i>
<i>homeless man!</i>

441
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,134
You evacuated.
You shit your pants.

442
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,103
I fixed that!
Okay, Gil? Me!

443
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,005
Fine.
Forget the 1,700 bucks.

444
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,908
Just do it because
you're my brother. Okay?

445
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,011
Fine. What's the
plate number?

446
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,481
Thank you.

447
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,450
Uh, Galactica,
Libra, eight, seven, nine.

448
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,525
The plate's been
expired for three years.

449
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,427
And it's not
even in his name.

450
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,095
What's the name?
Who is it registered to?

451
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,931
Yul Perrkins.

452
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,566
Yul Perrkins?

453
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,602
<i>Yeah.</i>

454
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,004
Oh, my God! I bet
that's his real name!

455
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,473
<i>Yul!</i>

456
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,708
I've got to go.
I'll see you Sunday.

457
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,575
<i>Thanks, Terry!</i>

458
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,080
Yul Perrkins.

459
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,852
"Thirty-one year-old
Yul Perrkins will be
the key witness

460
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,889
"in the state's case
against Alexander
Dmitri and Noel Hodges.

461
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,657
"Three suspects are
accused of robbing

462
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,427
"First National Bank
in late August." You fuck.

463
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,995
"They have been awaiting
trial for six months

464
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,030
"while the state
finalized the plea
bargain with Perrkins."

465
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,199
Alexander Dmitri.

466
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,842
For the next 24 hours
I know where Yul Perrkins is.

467
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,007
They're saying
the Iraqi dinar

468
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,009
is gonna go to the value
of the Kuwait dollar.

469
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,512
What are you talking
about? Iraqi dinar?

470
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,181
It's trading at 1000 dinar per U.S. dollar.

471
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,650
Oh, shit. It's Randy.
Hold on one second.

472
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,688
<i>Hey. Where are y?</i>
<i>I picked somethig up for you.</i>

473
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,089
A new bowling ball.

474
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:56,627
Well, I was just thinking.
You're a really good bowler,
like naturally.

475
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,763
You're too good to
be using one of those
pitted-out house balls.

476
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,500
That was really nice of you.
Thanks, Randy.

477
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,001
So when are you
going to be back?

478
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,671
Um, well...
Here's the thing.

479
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,241
Annie got a really great
job opportunity in L.A.

480
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,276
So I'm gonna go
ahead and go with her.

481
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,011
<i>What? Are you</i>
<i>fucking kidding ?</i>

482
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,246
You know you
can't leave Milton!

483
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,181
<i>You cannot leave Milto!</i>

484
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,749
Well, I know
it's not advised,

485
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,551
but technically
I think I can leave.

486
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,221
Listen, if you do leave
you have to have a marshal
with you at all times

487
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,756
in case something happens!

488
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,858
And if something happens
to you, I am fucking fired!

489
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,060
Hey, look. I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to
get you fired, okay?

490
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,762
I'm leaving
witness protection.

491
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,664
So I'm no longer
your responsibility.

492
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,599
I mean, I think
I can leave. No?

493
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,134
You can leave.
But there's a whole process.

494
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,103
You've got to
fill out forms and shit.

495
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,138
Okay.
Where are you right now?

496
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,942
<i>Just stay right</i>
<i>where you're at</i>
<i>and I'm coming to you.</i>

497
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,578
No. No. Listen. Randy.
I've got to get her
to this interview.

498
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,680
<i>I would have told</i>
<i>you I was leaving</i>

499
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,016
but this whole thing
happened really fast.
And I'm sorry.

500
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,751
I'm on my way.
What's your 20?

501
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,153
<i>I'm gonna call you</i>
<i>when we get to L.A. Okay?</i>

502
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,621
<i>Nothing's gonna happen to me.</i>
<i>You just stay there.</i>

503
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:58,722
What the fuck?

504
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,958
Randy? I got to go, okay?

505
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,959
<i>Stay there! I'm comi.</i>

506
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,228
Fuck! All right...

507
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,569
Okay, you know what?
Randy's hell bent
on protecting me.

508
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,903
And I think that could
be very dangerous for us.

509
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,171
We should get on the road.

510
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,239
Okay.

511
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,812
Hey, chief,
is this your car?

512
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,080
Yeah, man.
You shouldn't touch.

513
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,582
Oh. It's so nice.

514
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,884
Thanks.

515
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,786
I bet this
thing's got nitrous.
This got nitrous?

516
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,589
No. Nitrous is for fags.
It's got cubic inches.

517
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,257
Cubic inches.

518
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,804
Did you just say "fags"?

519
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,606
Yeah.

520
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,808
But not in, like,
a homophobic way.

521
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,376
I used it
in place of "lame."

522
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,079
Why wouldn't
you just say "lame"?

523
00:26:56,381 --> 00:27:01,118
Well, same reason
I say "fuck"
instead of "frick."

524
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,188
It packs more punch.
It's basically the swear
word version of lame.

525
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,823
No. It's not.

526
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,959
It's a hate word used
to perpetuate homophobia.

527
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,694
It's used to
marginalize gay people.

528
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,263
You're acting like
you don't know me.

529
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,232
I voted to
legalize civil unions.

530
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,935
When I had friends,
I had a lot of gay friends.

531
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,403
Then you shouldn't say "fag."

532
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,306
I don't!
I don't use it in reference
to actual people.

533
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,707
I mean especially
homosexual people.

534
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,944
So then,
that makes it okay?

535
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:31,248
Yeah, I think so.
I mean morally,
I feel fine about it.

536
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,852
So as long as it's not
in reference to a person,
it's all right?

537
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,789
Like if I wanted
to start calling
my purse the N word.

538
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,824
"Honey, have you
seen my N word?

539
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,260
"I can't find my N word
anywhere. And it's the
expensive one."

540
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,196
Okay. I will
work on it.

541
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,298
Thank you.

542
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,403
Are you fucking
kidding me?

543
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,038
No. I'm not.

544
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
No, no.
Your ex-boyfriend
is behind us.

545
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,208
Gil is tailing us.

546
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,210
Oh, my God.

547
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,713
What the fuck is he doing?

548
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,915
You know what?
I'm going to put a stop
to this right now.

549
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,250
What are you gonna do?

550
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:12,389
I'm gonna pull
him out of the car and
beat the shit out of him.

551
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're not doing that!

552
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,292
That's not how
you solve things.

553
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,027
That's exactly
how you handle this.

554
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,896
Especially with
a turd like Gil.

555
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:21,865
I'm sorry. Which one of us
has a doctorate in
conflict resolution?

556
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,033
'Cause I think it's me.

557
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,002
Listen. I respect
your degree. I do.

558
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,403
But it's not how
we're getting out
of this situation, okay?

559
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,439
We don't have time
to bring in a mediator.

560
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,908
Charlie, I am not
going to live with
a man who says "fag"

561
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,876
and beats up guys
on the side of the road.

562
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,412
I'm not gonna teach
non-violence
at a university

563
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,147
and then marry
Dog the bounty hunter!

564
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,482
I won't do it!

565
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:57,935
What are you doing, Gil?

566
00:28:57,937 --> 00:28:59,403
Protecting someone I love.

567
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,407
What are you doing,
Yul Perrkins?

568
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,814
I don't know
how you know that name,

569
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,783
but if you say
it out loud again,
I swear to God...

570
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,184
"Yul" do what?

571
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,992
I love Annie.

572
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:25,462
Enough to move back
to L.A. for her where
I might get killed.

573
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:27,498
I love her so much
that I'm not beating
your fucking head

574
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,900
against the ground right now
because she asked me not to.

575
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,935
But if you do
something that results
in her leaving me,

576
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,971
I'm going to
beat you to death.

577
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm literally gonna beat
you to fucking death, Gil.
Do you understand that?

578
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,244
That name stays
between you and I.

579
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,914
You know we have
a mutual friend?

580
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,083
I mean, technically
he's a Facebook friend,

581
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,985
which is obviously
less significant than
a real friendship

582
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,353
but still kind of cool.

583
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,421
Alex Dmitri.

584
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,225
You know him?
Alex Dmitri?

585
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,337
I got you.

586
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,877
Thank you.

587
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,381
Thank you so much.

588
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:20,484
What did he say?
Is he going home?

589
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,920
Nope. No, he's going to follow us all the way to L.A.

590
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,524
So how do you want to handle this?

591
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,428
Well, sweetie, if you're not gonna let me kick his ass,

592
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,497
then you're gonna have
to let me run from him.

593
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,599
Okay.

594
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,501
I'm proud of you.

595
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,237
Thank you.

596
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,239
I'm sure I'll get there.

597
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,341
Yul!

598
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,376
Yul Perrkins!

599
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,179
What is he saying?

600
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,381
Oh, who gives a shit?

601
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,917
This is probably gonna
get pretty fucking radical.

602
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,086
But I don't want you
to get scared, okay?

603
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,956
I raced all growing up
and I even drove
professionally for a while.

604
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,624
Okay.

605
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,360
I trust you.

606
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,097
<i>Annie, hey!</i>
<i>This is Gil!</i>

607
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,032
I'm following you, okay?

608
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:51,568
<i>If he goes all psycho</i>
<i>and shit on you</i>

609
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,637
give me some kind
of hand signal. Okay?

610
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,451
Hold on!

611
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,047
Oh!

612
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,583
Oh, shit! Oh!

613
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,152
Oh!

614
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,323
Stop! Stop!
Oh, God. Stop!

615
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,126
Holy shit!
I think that was Randy!

616
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,220
Bye, Gil.

617
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,164
Oh, my God.

618
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,268
Hey! Randy?

619
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,505
Randy, are you okay, man?

620
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:10,674
No! I'm not fucking okay, Charlie!

621
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,376
I'm in the middle of a field
that you ran me into!

622
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:17,180
And my gun started going off, man!
No! I am not okay!

623
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,683
Hey! I'm sorry!
And I don't want
to be a dick,

624
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,219
but you didn't
have to jump your van
onto that field, man.

625
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,221
I got back in my lane
with plenty of time.

626
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,723
Bullshit! I know time.

627
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:29,493
We would have had
a fucking head-on collision!

628
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:32,829
Okay. You know what?
You're clearly shaken up.

629
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,732
And apparently you had another
incident with your firearm.

630
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,400
And I think you're
being a little defensive.

631
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,436
I just pulled over
to see if you're okay.
All right?

632
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,771
I am not defensive!
Are you shitting me?

633
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,307
What have I got
to be defending? Huh?

634
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,344
Nothing to defend!
You ran me off the road!

635
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,880
My gun went off
'cause of you,
almost killing me!

636
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:51,848
Hey, Randy?

637
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,483
Are you
really all right?

638
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,886
I am okay. I am okay.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

639
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,421
Yeah.

640
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,624
Do you want me to
call you a tow truck?

641
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,826
Obviously I have
a fucking cell phone!

642
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:06,196
I was in the
middle of a call when
you wrecked me! Okay?

643
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,898
Okay. Well,
you know what...

644
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,634
Wait, Charlie!
Don't go! Don't go, please!

645
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:13,336
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little embarrassed.

646
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,505
Don't go, okay?
'Cause I'll just
have to chase you.

647
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:20,177
I know you will, Randy.
But will you please be
a little more careful?

648
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:22,379
I mean,
it really worries me
when I look behind me

649
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,181
and I see your
van is airborne.

650
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:25,782
Charlie?

651
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,218
Bye, Randy!

652
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,753
Oh! Hey! Congratulations
on the new job!

653
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,588
Thanks!

654
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,666
when they could shop and
get whatever they wanted?

655
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,701
That's a good idea!
Oh, hey.

656
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,604
Leave a pit by itself
right in front of a store.

657
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:50,440
Well he's not a killer.
Look at that face.

658
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,710
That's what they all say.
Until they need stitches.

659
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,679
Like those
crazy bitches
that live with tigers?

660
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:57,380
What? What are
you talking about?

661
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:01,351
About the women
who get pet tigers
and then get eaten?

662
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,520
Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah!

663
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:07,290
You ain't ever gonna
catch no black bitches
living with no tiger.

664
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,692
That's some
white girl shit.

665
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,393
She hates
white bitches, right?

666
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,262
We don't like white
bitches either, do we?

667
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:16,333
You'll never catch me
doing some shit like that.

668
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,901
Yeah? I live with a tiger
and I ain't no white bitch.

669
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,269
Oh, really?
No.

670
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,537
I'm a tiger?

671
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,771
Yes, ma'am.

672
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,276
Just the water?
I don't think we have the right cookware for that...

673
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,744
Just the water?
Yeah! Mmm-hmm.

674
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,312
That'll be $1.69.

675
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,414
Oh, just a sec.
Hi, boss.

676
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,724
What's up?

677
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,859
Gonna have
a hell of a meal.

678
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,895
Well, the dog
food's not for me.

679
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,797
I'm just teasing.

680
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,600
But I don't think
your dog's gonna want to
eat that either, though.

681
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,802
He's lucky I feed him
anything at all after
he tore up my couch.

682
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,005
Mmm.

683
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:58,775
See? He ain't no lamb.
He's a tiger.

684
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,044
That's right, girl.
He's all tiger.

685
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,383
Well, maybe he thought
that couch was healthier

686
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,018
than the landfill
you're giving him.

687
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,954
Hey, dude?

688
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,456
How about you stop worrying
about what I feed my dog

689
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,359
and worry about surfboards,
or whatever the fuck it is
you think about?

690
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,361
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,867
how much better
the good dog food
is for your dog.

692
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,068
Yeah,
it's 10% more expensive.

693
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,770
But it's like
80% less poison.

694
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:27,971
I just...

695
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,775
You trying to get knocked
the fuck out, motherfucker?

696
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,510
No, no, no.
Huh?

697
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,844
'Cause you got the right guy.

698
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,780
I'll knock a nigger
out holding a baby.

699
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,320
Thank you for
shopping at Field's.

700
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:49,559
I'm just thinking about,
you know, the beautiful
little creature out there.

701
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,460
But I'm sorry.
Have a nice day, sir.

702
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,699
So, a little dog food?

703
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:56,666
Yeah. How are you doing?

704
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,767
Good.

705
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,073
Where the fuck
is your leash?

706
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,011
That fucking
son of a bitch.

707
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,954
Come on, buddy! Yeah!

708
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,458
Get you where we can
play around a little bit.

709
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,693
Yeah! How's that feel?

710
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,028
Right?

711
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,137
All right?

712
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,006
Let's eat some dog food.
All right, buddy?

713
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,141
Chill the fuck out, man!

714
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,843
No, I am chill.

715
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,511
Don't do nothing stupid!

716
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,847
You like this. You want it.
You said you liked it!

717
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,783
You said it's good!
Don't you remember?

718
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,719
It's high-priced fucking
chicken feet dog food!
Eat it, brother!

719
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,987
Baby, let's go, okay?

720
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,989
Yo! Get your man straight!

721
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,858
Hey, babe.
I'll be there in
a second, okay?

722
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,460
No, man!
Get in the car!
It's just dog food!

723
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,863
No! Babe, it's not just
dog food. That's my
whole point about this.

724
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,731
It's compressed
fucking sawdust

725
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,534
and we're not leaving here
until my man samples some.

726
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,603
You got it! Just eat it!
No! Just trust me!

727
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,004
I can't eat that shit, man!

728
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,439
Why not?
I can't! Man, I can't!
I'd rather die!

729
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,941
I can't eat this shit, man!

730
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,978
Do you understand
what you just said?

731
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,580
That you would rather
die than eat that shit?

732
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,149
You understand
how that supports

733
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,117
what I've been
trying to tell you
the past 15 minutes?

734
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,621
Other people,
lives in danger,

735
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:25,655
they eat
another human being.

736
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,157
But you?

737
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,958
You won't even
fucking eat this.

738
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,534
Fuck. That's some
profound shit, man.

739
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,436
That's some
fucking profound shit.

740
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,881
Hey!

741
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,516
Come on. Come on.

742
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,020
Now, I'm going to
take your dog.

743
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,922
But I'm going to
tell you something.

744
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,523
It's not cool to wear
those tank tops anymore.

745
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,995
Unless you're wearing it
ironically or something.

746
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,001
Fuck all y'all!

747
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,250
Fuck me.

748
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,554
Oh, shit.
Get some.

749
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,557
Damn!

750
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,560
That's a mean kitty!

751
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:38,628
Thanks.

752
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,662
What is it? A '75?

753
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,531
Uh, '67.

754
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,033
Is that what
they told you, huh?

755
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,669
Shit! Suicide doors.

756
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,172
Suicide...
Uh...

757
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,508
You can shut that.

758
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,610
Thanks.

759
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,744
Seeing if it worked, guy.

760
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,045
Oh.

761
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,282
That ain't
a stock power plant.

762
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,751
No. Not stock.

763
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,052
Yeah. How many ponies?

764
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,655
Seven hundred.
Damn!

765
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,124
How much?

766
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,193
It's 700!

767
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,563
No. Into the motor.

768
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,865
What's the price
tag on this build?

769
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,601
Reason I'm asking is 'cause
I might do a motor swap

770
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:19,736
with that late
model Ford over there.

771
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,973
Yeah.

772
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:27,644
I can't really
remember everything
that went into it. So...

773
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,280
Ballpark it.

774
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,215
You know what?
It was about 14 grand.

775
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,119
Damn. That's commitment.

776
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,021
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

777
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,123
That's what I always say.

778
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,691
And the South
will rise again.

779
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,562
God! You own that too?

780
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,730
You know what?
It's a rental, actually.

781
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,033
Aren't they all?

782
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:51,234
Oh.

783
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:02,278
Hey. Have you noticed
that there is a certain
type of person

784
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,247
that is attracted
to this vehicle?

785
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,318
Yeah. Like the guy
at the gas station?

786
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,654
Yes. Like the guy
at the gas station.

787
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,257
Like, if you spent two years
building your dream car

788
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:19,696
that is was also
the dream car of
a certain type of person.

789
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,665
Like people who are...
I don't know.

790
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,935
Let's just
call them rapists,
out of convenience.

791
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,639
If you started
to notice that your
peers were rapists,

792
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:32,275
what do you think that
says about the old you
who built this car?

793
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,179
Look. This car
is designed specific.

794
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,749
What appeals to me
is probably not what
appeals to other dudes. Okay?

795
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,685
I wanted something
that was as fast as hell,
seated six people,

796
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,988
and had a trunk
the size of an SUV's.

797
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,690
But why?

798
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,860
I feel like you're
insinuating that I have small
dick complex or something.

799
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,729
And I don't. We both
know that's not the case.

800
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,230
I have a lot of issues,
but not that one.

801
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,898
I'm just teasing you.

802
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,367
I don't think couples can
really tease each other.

803
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:58,968
I think everyone
pretends they can,

804
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,370
but really, there's
always some kind of

805
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:02,038
truth or judgment
in there somewhere.

806
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,140
Baloney.
Couples can tease.

807
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,175
Oh, yeah.
It's playful!

808
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:09,045
Well, of course.
I can say to you
you're too fat,

809
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:11,247
or you're too tall
and clearly I'm joking.

810
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,117
But anything else
I say I'm probably
hinting at something

811
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,718
that bothers me
about you.

812
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,287
But I'm framing it
as a joke, so that
when a fight ensues

813
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,189
I don't have to take
responsibility for it.

814
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,159
Do you want to
just go to this place?

815
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,827
Sure.

816
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,872
I feel like you just
got really upset, though.

817
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,173
And I honestly was
just teasing you.

818
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,441
Okay. I'll be back
in a second.

819
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,786
It's okay if you're
feeling sensitive
and I'll drop it.

820
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:52,455
The only reason
I want to talk about it

821
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,158
is so we can
figure out why.

822
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,729
I think it's just going
home after four years.

823
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,464
It's just bringing
up some weird shit.

824
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,767
What kind of weird shit?

825
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,303
I don't know.

826
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,272
Just weird shit, really.

827
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,375
Oh, my God!

828
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,144
Oh, hey!

829
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,746
Sorry!
Sorry about that.

830
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,081
Sorry. Very sorry.

831
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,182
Our bad. Sorry.

832
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:22,385
Oh, my God!

833
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,456
Get away from the door!

834
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,491
That was a real
life lemon party.

835
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:32,462
That was grannies and
grampies fooling around!

836
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,264
What you buying, baby?

837
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,301
I was just checking
my Facebook page.

838
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,305
I don't know why.
You ain't single and
you've got three friends.

839
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:43,973
What the fuck you be
checking on Facebook?

840
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,342
What are you checking on Facebook?

841
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,978
Maybe Allen put some
new photos of himself

842
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,947
naked in front of the mirror.
I have to stay abreast.

843
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,248
You don't want to miss that.

844
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,757
Get the fuck out of here.

845
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,924
What?

846
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,428
Get your shit.
We've got to go.
Where are you going?

847
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,830
We got to go. Come on.
Get your shit. We got to go.

848
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,466
That's what happens.
I talked to him
10 minutes ago!

849
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,369
No. He knows where he is.
All right? I'll see you soon.

850
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,971
Babe? You gonna
take care of the dogs?
Mmm-hmm.

851
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:16,105
Did you put the alarm on?

852
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,273
Yes.

853
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:24,514
Hey, honey?
What was Gil screaming

854
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:26,516
when you were
walking towards the car?

855
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:29,385
He sounded like he
was repeating something.

856
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,854
I don't know what the fuck
he was saying. He's nuts.

857
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:34,157
Well, obviously you heard
what he was saying.

858
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,192
He kept repeating it
over and over again.

859
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,094
He was just talking shit.

860
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:39,362
But what was it?

861
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,298
Huh?

862
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,234
Charlie?

863
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,970
What was he saying?

864
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,807
He was saying "Yul Perrkins."

865
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,341
He was saying "Yul Perrkins"
over and over again

866
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,277
so that you would hear
and then we would
be in this fight.

867
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,012
So he won.

868
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:58,948
We're not fighting.
What are you...
Who's Yul Perrkins?

869
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,486
That's my name.
That's my real name.
Yul Perrkins.

870
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,223
Perrkins. Yul Perrkins
is my real name.

871
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,928
Why on earth would
we fight about that?

872
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,096
I don't know.
I just feel like this
is gonna be a fight.

873
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,165
Like, why wouldn't I have
told you my name before?

874
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,834
Or that comment you
made about my car.

875
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,570
Or the old me.
I just, you know...

876
00:47:20,572 --> 00:47:23,306
I want everything to be
exactly how it's been
since we've met.

877
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:26,142
I don't want to have
to go all the way back
into my background

878
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,944
just because
we're going to L.A.

879
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,946
Can you calm down?
Come here.
Come here for a second.

880
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,481
Please come sit
on the bed with me.

881
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:48,064
I think Yul Perrkins
is a very cute name.

882
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:50,433
I think it sounds like a <i>Sesame Stree</i>character.

883
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,902
Yeah?

884
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,938
So did all the kids
on the playground.
It was not very cute.

885
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,076
My dad loves Yul Brynner.
He thinks he's a badass.

886
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,578
But no one
in my generation's
ever heard of him.

887
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,383
Can I ask you
one more question?

888
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,351
And you promise
you'll tell the truth?

889
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,019
Yeah.

890
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,559
Did they assign you
the name Charlie Bronson
or did you get to pick it?

891
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,328
I picked it.

892
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:25,101
Was it 'cause you
thought it sounded tough

893
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,336
and you were tired of
having a sissy name?

894
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,906
Yeah.

895
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,911
That is the most adorable
thing I've ever heard.
Come here.

896
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,084
And you loved
Charles Bronson movies?

897
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,925
I actually named myself
after that famous
English prisoner

898
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:52,328
who named himself after
the actor Charles Bronson.

899
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,999
And I found him
intriguing, I guess.

900
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,035
That's weird.

901
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,971
To find someone
like that intriguing.

902
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,673
It's weird.

903
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,975
Well, look,
I don't know...

904
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,077
It sounds stupid now that
I'm saying it out loud,

905
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,645
but at the time it seemed...

906
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,282
I didn't know you
then, Annie.

907
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:17,320
So I obviously
picked the wrong name.
And I'm sorry that I...

908
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,689
It's fine. Hey. Hey!
You can call me
whatever you want.

909
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:23,726
You're not on trial here,
okay? This is all
just new to me.

910
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,129
Come back here. Come back.

911
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:29,732
You want to drop it?

912
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,702
Yeah. I would appreciate that.
Okay.

913
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,712
127?
Are you kidding me?

914
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:45,181
Might as well tap me on
the shoulder and say,
"Fuck you."

915
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,790
Sir, are you okay?

916
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,126
Have you been
in an accident?

917
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,427
What?

918
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,030
No. I'm a U.S. marshal.

919
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,734
Okay. Sir, your vehicle
appears to be totaled.

920
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:42,038
And I clocked you at 127
miles per hour back there.

921
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,507
I'm a marshal.
And I've got someone
in witness protection

922
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:46,275
who needs my protection.

923
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,777
I totally understand, sir.

924
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:50,513
Is there any way you
could stay below 100?

925
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,648
I'm very worried
about this car getting
up into triple digits.

926
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,453
I suppose I could try
to keep it in the high 90s.

927
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,622
Thank you.
'Cause just like
it's your job

928
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:02,124
to be protecting
whoever you may
be protecting...

929
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,793
Um...
What? Hold on a second.

930
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:05,227
I'll be right back, sir.

931
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:05,761
I need to talk to you.

932
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:07,763
What?

933
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,066
What?

934
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,835
Okay. I wasn't snooping.
But your phone did vibrate

935
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:15,271
and so I checked it out and...

936
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,505
That's your Pouncer app, right?

937
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,240
Yeah.

938
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,309
Okay. So that dot popped up like
two seconds ago.

939
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,279
So, there's got to be
another gay guy within,
what, 100 feet of here?

940
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,347
Yeah.

941
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,283
I mean, it must be him.

942
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:33,489
Although I don't think
he's gay. He's like 50.

943
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,093
There's 50-year-old
gay people, Angella.

944
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:38,761
We don't grow out of being gay.

945
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,430
Oh, no. I didn't...
That's not what I meant. I just...

946
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,699
I just think you
should ask him out.

947
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,234
What do you mean...
Oh! Because he's gay

948
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:46,635
and I'm gay I should
just ask him out?

949
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:49,505
Are you instantly
attracted to every
straight person you meet?

950
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:50,739
No.

951
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,640
Come on.

952
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,514
I'm actually
gonna let you go.

953
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:00,182
But I do need to
see your phone for
a second please, sir.

954
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:01,550
Why?

955
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:04,320
A small request after
you were driving that fast.

956
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:05,654
Can I see your
phone please, sir?

957
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,190
Thank you very much.

958
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,461
Yeah. There we go.
That's what I thought.

959
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,863
Uh... Hi.

960
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:15,598
What are you doing?

961
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,135
I'm programming
my name and number
in here.

962
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,803
Just in case you
ever need "backup."

963
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,605
What are you...

964
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,173
Pouncer.
Oh.

965
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,342
I didn't know what...

966
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,344
Oh, you had no idea
what it was?

967
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,479
It's okay.
Don't be embarrassed.
I'm a fan of Pouncer.

968
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,214
I Pounce.
You Pounce too, I guess.

969
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,151
So, you should be
very flattered,

970
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,353
'cause I'm an eight
and you're a five, so...

971
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:38,587
You have a safe night.

972
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,689
Right.

973
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,765
Okay. Do you need to
call me back after you've
collected yourself?

974
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,934
No, no, no. I'm good.

975
00:52:51,936 --> 00:52:54,403
So I stopped off at
San Andreas and Jackson.

976
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,804
They were nowhere
to be found.

977
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,673
I don't think they could
have got as far as Planada.

978
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,376
So my guess is Mariposa.

979
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:02,778
We'll take a peek in Planada
on our way up to Mariposa.

980
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,447
Oh, great! Great.
Now, about the girl, Annie,

981
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,750
who's my girlfriend
and a victim in all this.

982
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,185
Uh, I want assurances...

983
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,953
Hello?

984
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,188
Did that drop
or did he just...

985
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,728
Hey, buddy, look.
They have shower caps.

986
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,363
Oh, yeah?
Your favorite.

987
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,365
Yep.

988
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,934
I'm gonna go get some
coffee for us, okay?

989
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:26,368
Okay.

990
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,270
I'll be ready to go in 10.

991
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:29,305
Have a good shower.

992
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:30,339
Thank you.

993
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,420
Come on!

994
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,411
Are you...

995
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,885
Fuck!

996
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,687
Fuck!

997
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:58,327
That fucking hillbilly from the gas
station stole my engine last night!

998
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,695
What?

999
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:01,797
From the Lincoln!
I just went out there
to start it.

1000
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,766
There's no engine inside.

1001
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,701
How do you steal an engine?

1002
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:08,304
Grind the motor mounts out
and pull it out with a cherry picker.

1003
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,438
It probably took
him 20 minutes.

1004
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,673
Fuck!

1005
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:11,974
Is there anything I can do?

1006
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,476
No. Just finish your shower.

1007
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,778
I'm gonna go to the lobby

1008
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,046
and see if they know
someone with a tow truck.

1009
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:19,848
Okay.
That was a $12,000 engine.

1010
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,719
Sorry your engine
was stolen, sweetie!

1011
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,659
Where is she?

1012
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,527
What the fuck are you doing?

1013
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,861
Where is she, man?

1014
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,663
You just fucking
broke my nose!

1015
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,999
I don't care!
I swear to God
if you already killed her...

1016
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,704
I'm not
a fucking killer, man!
What's wrong with you?

1017
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:45,441
You were
involved in a homicide!
I am not leaving without her.

1018
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:46,675
Get that fucking
club out of my face!

1019
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,077
Don't talk to me like that!

1020
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,446
Listen, man! She is fine!
Do you want to see her?

1021
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,614
Yes!

1022
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,650
Lower that shit and
I'll show her to you!

1023
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,951
All right! Open the door!

1024
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,020
What the fuck
are you thinking, man?

1025
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,988
Hitting me in the nose
with a golf club?

1026
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,423
I didn't think it
would hurt that bad!

1027
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:02,658
Jesus Christ!

1028
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:08,097
I've been through some shit.
I've never seen a
bitch move like that.

1029
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,933
Well, if you wouldn't
be such an asshole!

1030
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:13,702
You know what pisses me off
the most about you hitting me
with this fucking...

1031
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,037
No! I don't really
give a shit either.

1032
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,445
It's that you made me
break my promise to Annie.

1033
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,917
That was a shitty
thing to do, Gil!

1034
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,921
That was really
fucking selfish of you.

1035
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,092
Fucking selfish prick.

1036
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,559
Oh, fuck! Fuck...

1037
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,520
Honey!

1038
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:39,988
I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry! Honey?

1039
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,590
We have got to go right now.

1040
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:43,125
I will tell you
about it in the car, okay?

1041
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,227
What car? I thought
you said the car was...

1042
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:47,796
Baby, this is life or death.
I need you to get out of
the shower this second.

1043
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,630
Okay? Let's go.
Okay.

1044
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,775
I don't understand.
What happened to your face?
Why are you bleeding?

1045
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,777
Baby, will you please
just get dressed
and pack, okay?

1046
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,879
Yes.
The people I testified
against are in the lobby.

1047
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:04,980
We got to get out
of here right now.

1048
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,081
Should I call the police?

1049
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,549
There's no time for that.

1050
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,184
Why are you bleeding?
Did they hit you?

1051
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,819
Baby, just faster, okay?

1052
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,721
I'm going
as fast as I can!

1053
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,157
They are right out there.
Okay, go baby! Go, go, go!

1054
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,124
Okay, I'm going!
I'm going!

1055
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,565
Okay.

1056
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,501
I'll grab Yul.
You got the girl?

1057
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:28,170
You want me to
take the gun since you're
focused on the door?

1058
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,072
I think I can manage both.

1059
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,039
Okay. All right.

1060
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,013
All right.
We're gonna go on three.

1061
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:39,848
One.

1062
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,983
You all right?

1063
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,184
Yep. Here we go.

1064
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:43,919
One. Two.

1065
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,854
Three.

1066
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,122
Where the fuck is Yul?

1067
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,560
Hey! What are you
looking at, bro?

1068
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,829
Is Yul here?
Fuck!

1069
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,298
Come on! They're seniors.
It's the wrong room.
Come on. Go!

1070
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,901
Fucking embarrassing, man!
I know.

1071
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:00,068
That shit was disgusting!

1072
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,141
You got
everything you need?
Yes.

1073
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,209
We're good. We're good,
we're good, we're good.

1074
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,145
Damn it!

1075
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,114
Can you grab that?
Yeah, honey...

1076
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,051
Okay. Your purse.

1077
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,653
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1078
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,026
What is that?

1079
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,561
It's a remote keyless entry.

1080
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:26,795
For which car?

1081
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:27,763
It's kind of
a universal one.

1082
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:33,135
I just made it.
Mama, will you just throw
your stuff in the car?

1083
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:34,703
Let's go. Go, go,
go, go, go. Faster!

1084
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:38,907
Wait a second. I'm not
just going to get into
someone else's car.

1085
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,008
Sweetie,
it's not the time!

1086
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,112
Hey!

1087
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,220
Hurry up! Let's go!

1088
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,812
Did you just
steal this car?

1089
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:19,147
Yes, I did.
But only because
I absolutely had to.

1090
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,850
How did you steal it?

1091
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,819
If you lose
your keyless entry
and go to the dealership

1092
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:26,088
they use the
VIN number to get a new
code in their program.

1093
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,723
And I got a new code
and I programmed this one.

1094
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,091
But how?
How did you get the code?

1095
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,395
I have passwords for
the different dealerships.

1096
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,697
Why do you have
those passwords?

1097
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,699
Charlie?

1098
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,234
Look. If we have
this conversation

1099
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:42,704
I'm afraid you're
not gonna want to
be with me anymore.

1100
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:45,707
Okay, well, if we don't
have this conversation,
I can't be with you.

1101
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,342
I can't be
with someone
that I don't trust.

1102
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,710
So you're just going
to have to risk it.

1103
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,822
Asshole!

1104
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,858
You know
I witnessed a bank robbery
that went really wrong.

1105
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,159
Yeah.

1106
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,962
What I left out is that
I was kind of involved.

1107
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,665
Not in the violence part,
but in the getaway
driving part.

1108
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:10,999
I'm sorry I didn't
say that to you,

1109
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,134
but when I got into
witness protection

1110
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,735
I looked at it
as a new beginning.

1111
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:14,936
And I knew I wasn't going
to be that guy anymore...

1112
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,338
You're a bank robber?

1113
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,674
Charlie?

1114
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,309
No. I didn't actually
rob any of the banks.

1115
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,111
Alex and Allen
did the robbing

1116
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,747
and I did the
driving them to and
from the bank robbing.

1117
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:28,417
Banks? Plural?

1118
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:29,951
How many times did
you do that, Charlie?

1119
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,687
I don't know. A few.

1120
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:32,854
You don't know?

1121
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,056
Maybe 12 or 13.

1122
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,757
"Maybe"? Maybe a dozen?

1123
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,092
Maybe a baker's dozen?
You're not sure?

1124
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:38,727
No. It was 13.

1125
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:42,898
Yes, it was absolutely 13.
This is why I didn't
tell you about this.

1126
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,399
Because I knew you were
going to react this way.

1127
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,703
Who wouldn't react this way,
Charlie? A sociopath?

1128
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:49,738
Look, I have
a terrible past.
I'm sorry about that.

1129
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,773
But it has
nothing to do with us.

1130
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:54,042
How'd you do it?
How'd you get off, Charlie?

1131
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,411
You testified against
your friends to save
your own ass?

1132
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,180
They were gonna
charge Neve with
accessory to murder

1133
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:00,182
because she cased the job.

1134
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:03,752
So either I turned
on Alex and Allen,
who did the shooting,

1135
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:05,187
or Neve went to prison
for the rest of her life.

1136
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:07,189
Who is Neve?

1137
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,057
The black girl
in the station wagon.

1138
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,059
Why aren't they
in prison, Charlie?

1139
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,261
They implied I wasn't
a credible witness
because I was...

1140
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,998
You know,
engaged to Neve.

1141
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,837
You were engaged to a woman
who plans bank robberies?

1142
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,272
Who are you?

1143
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,841
Listen. Sweetie. Please?

1144
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:26,808
Don't.

1145
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,380
Pull the car over.
I think I'm going
to throw up.

1146
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:35,083
I can't pull over right now,
or Alex is gonna
shoot both of us.

1147
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,153
Then fucking
lose them, Charlie!
So you can let me out!

1148
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,468
Hey, buddy!
It's me from last night!

1149
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,837
Yeah! The minivan!
I could really use your help

1150
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,872
I'm at some
abandoned airfield.

1151
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,425
I cannot believe this is
a fucking station wagon!

1152
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:24,559
This shit is so fast!

1153
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,502
We might not make this!

1154
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,608
Watch out for Gil!

1155
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,324
Fucking shit!
Ah!

1156
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:57,659
Fuck!

1157
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,295
Fuck!

1158
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:04,566
Ah, damn it!
Pick up already.

1159
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,269
<i>Debby.</i>
<i>It's not a good time.</i>

1160
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:08,436
Oh! Am I fucking up
your massage?

1161
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,905
<i>'Cause you're</i>
<i>fucking up mine!</i>

1162
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:13,508
I got a call from UC.
Sandy's got some
emergency tomorrow.

1163
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,576
So you have to be
there by 4:00 p.m. today.

1164
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,545
That might be impossible.

1165
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:20,048
Are you kidding me?
I could leave Milton now
and be there by 4:00.

1166
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:22,150
<i>Deb, I don't think</i>
<i>you understand!</i>

1167
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,685
Annie, I am in the
middle of something.
Just get there!

1168
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:27,589
Don't be a pussy.

1169
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,961
Please pull over and
find a place to let me out.

1170
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:36,264
Annie? I want to talk
about this. Okay?

1171
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,600
Just let me drive you
to L.A. and we can talk it
out on the way.

1172
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:43,038
You are engaged!
You're a criminal!

1173
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,006
If you don't pull over,
I'm jumping out.
And I'm not kidding!

1174
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:46,041
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1175
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,086
Hold on a second, okay?

1176
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:03,191
Annie! Hey!
Where are you going?

1177
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:05,560
You're going
to walk aimlessly
through an orange grove?

1178
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,162
I did not lie to you!

1179
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:10,131
Omitting is lying, Charlie!

1180
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,734
What if I had sex
with a co-worker and
I didn't tell you that?

1181
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:15,170
You wouldn't
think that was a lie?

1182
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,538
No! That would be a lie!

1183
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,173
Because we're in
a relationship

1184
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:20,141
and we owe each other
those kind of details.

1185
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:26,181
Look, whatever you're
mad about happened
before we ever met, okay?

1186
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:29,184
Look! I have not
violated your trust
once since we met.

1187
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:32,320
Except for completely
lying about who you are.

1188
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,223
Look, you may have had
three-ways with dudes
or smoked cocaine!

1189
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:38,626
But if you had,
just because you didn't
disclose that to me,

1190
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,729
doesn't mean
you're a liar!

1191
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:43,198
I don't care what
you did before we met.

1192
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,000
All I care about
is who you are now!

1193
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,736
Really?
So if I was a pedophile,

1194
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:50,739
if I had raped children,
you wouldn't care about that?

1195
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:53,108
If I had been a member of
the Ku Klux Klan? No biggie?

1196
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:59,047
You wouldn't feel like
a complete idiot for having
fallen in love with me?

1197
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,784
Buddy, I...

1198
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,621
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1199
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,024
I was ashamed.
And I was embarrassed.

1200
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,094
And I thought we would
just live in Milton for
the rest of our lives

1201
01:07:13,096 --> 01:07:14,429
and be happy
and have babies.

1202
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,097
And I would be Charlie.
And that would be that.

1203
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,502
What if I did tell you?
Be honest.

1204
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,703
Would you have
fallen in love with me?

1205
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,173
I don't know!

1206
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,576
And I'm never gonna know,

1207
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,478
because you took that
decision away from me.

1208
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,483
But yes, Charlie!
I find it very difficult
to believe

1209
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,452
that someone who
justified robbing 13 banks

1210
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,821
would ever not be
that type of person.

1211
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:42,357
It's not exactly
the high profile
background you look for

1212
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,459
when you're choosing
someone to have a baby with.

1213
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,763
You know,
if I was an ex-drug addict
or an ex-alcoholic,

1214
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,132
I guarantee
you would be able
to look past that.

1215
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:52,300
That's not the point.

1216
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:54,235
The bottom line is
in any relationship

1217
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,538
you can either wallow
in the person's past,

1218
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,673
or you can look
at the person that's
right in front of you

1219
01:07:58,675 --> 01:08:00,775
and choose
to move forward.
But you can't do both.

1220
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,448
I agree.

1221
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,149
Then move forward with me.

1222
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,490
But the person in
front of me lied to me.

1223
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,494
Whether you want to call
it that or not, Charlie.

1224
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:27,535
I need to get to L.A.

1225
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,271
And I'm gonna do
that without you.

1226
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:34,742
How?

1227
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,441
Hey.

1228
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:07,542
Hey.

1229
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:10,879
Are you okay?

1230
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:13,581
Yeah. I'm fine.
Can you, um...

1231
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,483
Can you drive me
the rest of the way
to L.A., please?

1232
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,285
Of course.

1233
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:20,221
Or would you rather
go back to our house
and digest all this?

1234
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:22,323
No, Gil.
I just want
to get to L.A.

1235
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,893
I can do that.

1236
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,262
Why don't you hop in
and I'll gather
all your belongings?

1237
01:09:27,264 --> 01:09:28,296
Okay.

1238
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:35,537
Hey, asshole.
Do not even think about
tailing us. I'm serious.

1239
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,372
Or what? You're gonna
stab me with that knife?

1240
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,673
I could, if you charged me.

1241
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,575
Yeah? Okay.
I'm terrified.

1242
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:42,644
Yeah, well,
you're the aggressor.

1243
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:45,747
Listen. I still think
you're a fucking turd.

1244
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,749
But I'm sorry
that I clocked you

1245
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,851
and I appreciate you
taking Annie to L.A.

1246
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,687
You're welcome.

1247
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,789
Oh, and we know
who got the best
of who in that scuffle.

1248
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:56,858
So, if you forgot,

1249
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,594
just ask
your previous shirt.

1250
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,362
I will.

1251
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,338
GIL: You got
your seatbelt on?

1252
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:14,943
He's not answering.

1253
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,745
Oh, my God!
Uh, Pounce him!

1254
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,914
Use your app.
Your Pouncer app.
And Pounce him.

1255
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,984
Oh, my God!
You're brilliant. Okay.

1256
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,387
I see him!
He's on here!
Okay, um...

1257
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,355
Go straight.

1258
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,692
He's right there.
He's right there.
He's right there.

1259
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:31,793
Bingo.

1260
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,761
Oh, my God.

1261
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,407
What the hell happened?

1262
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,310
Was he executed?

1263
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:50,378
I don't know.

1264
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,415
Randy?

1265
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,020
Oh!

1266
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,389
I hit my head.

1267
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,661
Let's go!

1268
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:13,401
You okay?

1269
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,639
You want to pull over
and have a warm meal, or...

1270
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:18,940
Or would you
rather process?

1271
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:22,810
Okay.

1272
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:24,912
You process.

1273
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,447
Gil?

1274
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,524
You okay?

1275
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:37,825
Yeah. Ah!

1276
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,629
Hey!

1277
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,398
Don't even think about it!

1278
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,066
Let me go!

1279
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:46,701
Gil!

1280
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,972
Gil! What the fuck?

1281
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:06,821
Annie?
<i>Yul?</i>

1282
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,424
How you doing, buddy?

1283
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:11,392
Where are you right now?
Where's Annie?

1284
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:15,096
having some French
fries and onion rings.
Why don't you come down?

1285
01:12:15,098 --> 01:12:16,964
Don't be a fucking
asshole, Alex.

1286
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:21,536
I'd hurry up if I were you.
Neve's mad-dogging
the hell out of her.

1287
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:43,558
Wow.

1288
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,860
Wow!

1289
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,363
You look really good, Yul.

1290
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:53,835
You used to look older
than Alex, but now you
look younger. It's crazy.

1291
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:56,070
He looks good.
Doesn't he, babe?

1292
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,506
I don't know.
Who gives a shit?

1293
01:12:58,508 --> 01:12:59,540
Really, baby?

1294
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,112
Yeah, well,
I would have asked
for your permission,

1295
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:05,913
but you kind of fell
off the map, didn't you?

1296
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,415
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, man.

1297
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:13,121
Yeah, I do
fucking hate you.
You betrayed me.

1298
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,123
Okay? We were best friends
and you testified against me.

1299
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:21,562
You know what? Fuck you.

1300
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:24,399
You fucking betrayed me.
You fucking shot a dude, man!

1301
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,867
You put us all in
this shitty mess

1302
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:28,403
where I got to
pick between my fiancée
and my best friend!

1303
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,471
That's your fucking fault!
So fuck you!

1304
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:32,106
Oh! I'm sorry.
You were inside the bank?

1305
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:34,108
No.
I forgot about that!

1306
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,010
You were inside
the bank and you saw
the security guard

1307
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:37,545
pointing a fucking
gun at Allen.

1308
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:39,547
Oh, no!
No, you weren't!

1309
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:42,917
You were in the fucking car
trying to change the fucking
oldies station!

1310
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:46,888
I'm sure the $6
an hour fucking retard
was gonna shoot Allen.

1311
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,456
Are you kidding me?
He would have shot me!

1312
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,625
You don't fucking know!
Shut the fuck up, Allen!

1313
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:51,692
You don't get to do that.
What do you want?

1314
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:54,028
You're not in
this fucking circle.
Sorry, Allen.

1315
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,196
What do you want?
I want money.

1316
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,631
That's it, bro.
I don't want
anything else.

1317
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:58,166
You got it. Let's go
to my dad's right now.

1318
01:13:58,168 --> 01:13:59,634
Let her out of the car.
Let's go.

1319
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,436
No. She's gonna
come with. Let's go.

1320
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:02,670
Stay in the car.
Hold on a second, dude.

1321
01:14:02,672 --> 01:14:04,505
You're gonna fucking turn
this into kidnapping?

1322
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:09,444
Hey, no. I'm being serious.
Alex? Please listen to me.

1323
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:13,448
You're gonna risk going to
prison when I'm cooperating?
I don't get it.

1324
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,950
'Cause you
owe me, motherfucker!

1325
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:19,921
I want you to feel the
fucking uncomfortable
situation I was in.

1326
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,989
You got off!
What are you talking about?

1327
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:25,526
Oh, my God? Eight months!
Are you fucking crazy?

1328
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,862
I've been in Siberia
for four years!

1329
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:30,064
The fucking
arrogance of you, man!

1330
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:33,668
I don't understand? What?
You fucking didn't like
the gym equipment?

1331
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,836
There wasn't enough
time for you to read?

1332
01:14:34,838 --> 01:14:36,070
I got butt-fucked.

1333
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,878
I got
fucked in the butt
because of you.

1334
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,217
Yeah.

1335
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:52,487
That's horrible.
I did not realize
that happened in jail.

1336
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:53,988
I thought that
was a prison thing.

1337
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,189
Yeah, well...

1338
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,026
I guess it's not
exclusive to prisons.

1339
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,103
Well, I mean, you've never
been, like, a homophobe.

1340
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:11,739
It seems like something
you probably worked through.

1341
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,508
You're a strong dude.

1342
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,876
I don't think homophobia
has anything to do with it.

1343
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:17,945
The guy was disgusting.

1344
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,180
If I was gay
I would still want
to come after you.

1345
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,582
I'm really sorry.

1346
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:23,584
I'm really, really sorry.

1347
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,219
Was it a black guy?

1348
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,123
No, it wasn't a black guy.

1349
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,092
That's a pretty fucking
racist thing to say.

1350
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:34,128
You think that's racist?
Yeah.

1351
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,631
I think that's
the opposite of racist.

1352
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:38,966
I don't think it would
make a black guy gay
to fuck a white dude

1353
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,868
because we're such
pussies compared to them.

1354
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,737
What the fuck
are you even talking
about right now?

1355
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:44,906
I'm saying if I was
a black dude I wouldn't
feel the least bit gay

1356
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:48,175
I would think a white guy is
just like masculine chicks.

1357
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,778
Like, Ellen.
She's masculine,

1358
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,613
but I would
totally fuck her
if I were single.

1359
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,081
I wasn't fucked
by a black guy.

1360
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,050
Okay?

1361
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,218
Can we just go?
Okay.

1362
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,291
Was it a Mexican guy?

1363
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:04,325
No.

1364
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,338
Oh, man.

1365
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,109
Was it one of
those white guys?
Those fucking Nazis?

1366
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:25,613
No! It was not
a fucking white guy, either.

1367
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,182
Charlie?
It doesn't matter who
violated him. Okay?

1368
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:30,051
It could have been
any number of people.

1369
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:31,786
It doesn't matter
their race, okay?

1370
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:33,154
It could have
been Latino. It could
have been Tongan.

1371
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,756
It could have
been a Persian...
It was Filipino!

1372
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,993
I was butt-fucked by
a Filipino dude, okay?

1373
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:41,662
Does that fucking
solve your dilemma

1374
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:43,731
of what part of the world
my ass traveled to?

1375
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:44,599
Well...

1376
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,070
I mean, I don't think...
That's not so bad.

1377
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:52,740
I mean, just like
all black dudes
think of us as women,

1378
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:57,044
I think of all Asians
as women, you know?
Even the men.

1379
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:00,715
I feel like you
basically hooked up
with an Asian lady.

1380
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,950
Charlie, just...
No, I didn't hook up with
anybody, bro. I was raped.

1381
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:03,985
Okay, listen, I don't...

1382
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:05,086
Fucking hooked up?

1383
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:08,889
I feel partly responsible for this
and I'm really sorry.

1384
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:10,324
Well that's a weird angle, bro.

1385
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,402
Fucking back up, Randy!

1386
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:29,777
Gil, what the fuck
are you doing out here?

1387
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:32,013
They have Annie.
Alex Dmitri took her.

1388
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:33,280
Get in the van.
Ride with him.

1389
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,282
Let's go!

1390
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:49,730
<i>Hey...</i>

1391
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:59,807
Hey, you remember my dad
lives at 1805 Burns in Spicewood, right?

1392
01:17:59,809 --> 01:18:00,841
I don't remember a place

1393
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,376
I've been to 200 times, no.

1394
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,146
1805 Spicewood
in Burns, California.

1395
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:06,113
Write that down.
Write that down.

1396
01:18:27,904 --> 01:18:29,770
Look at this guy.
Ringing the doorbell
to his own house.

1397
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:35,142
What's wrong?

1398
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:38,446
I have not talked
to my dad since
I got arrested, so...

1399
01:18:38,448 --> 01:18:39,980
Yeah, but that's
not your fault.

1400
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:41,415
He knows you can't
contact your family.

1401
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,152
No. You can.

1402
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:47,722
Charlie, you told me
that you couldn't
contact your family.

1403
01:18:47,724 --> 01:18:49,757
I did not tell you that.
You might have assumed that.

1404
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:51,258
But I never said that.
Okay, fine. Forget it.

1405
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,261
Why haven't you
talked to your dad?

1406
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,898
I don't know, uh...

1407
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:02,403
Shame? Fucking
demoralizing shame?

1408
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,379
That's been
four years coming.

1409
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:14,048
And you deserve
more than just that.

1410
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,483
I know.

1411
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:18,753
Yeah, I don't know
what pisses me off
the most, Yul.

1412
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,888
The fact that
you got involved
in all that shit,

1413
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,424
or that you ran off
like a coward when
everything blew up.

1414
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,794
I didn't raise
that person.

1415
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:28,829
That's not my son.

1416
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:33,434
And you used the Lincoln.

1417
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,770
Our project car.

1418
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,538
Makes me sick!

1419
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,874
Yeah. Me too.

1420
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,079
Now, why are you
all together again?

1421
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:47,114
Not by choice.

1422
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,017
I buried something in
the pasture that Alex wants.

1423
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:51,252
Hey, Mr. Perrkins.
How are you?
Good to see you.

1424
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:52,253
Mr. Perrkins.

1425
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:54,488
Now, who's this one?

1426
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:59,260
This is Annie. She is my,
or was, my girlfriend.

1427
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,228
Prior to all
this being revealed.

1428
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,364
Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.

1429
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,968
Clint Perrkins.

1430
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,440
Good. Good. Good.
This feels right.
This feels right.

1431
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,842
Want to go to the pasture?

1432
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,279
Good to see you.

1433
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:20,147
You know I'm going to shoot
you in the back of the head

1434
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,515
if you don't
find this money?
You know that?

1435
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:23,017
What are you going to
do with this money, Alex?

1436
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:25,286
They know
the serial numbers
on half these bills.

1437
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:26,887
I don't think they're
gonna be caring
about serial numbers

1438
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:27,888
in Iraq, bro.

1439
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,558
Get the fuck out of here.

1440
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,593
You're going to buy dinar?

1441
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:34,028
How the fuck do
you know about dinar?

1442
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,163
If you buy $100,000
worth of dinar

1443
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:38,232
and it goes to the value
of the Kuwait dollar,
you're looking at

1444
01:20:38,234 --> 01:20:39,600
$300,000,000.
$300,000,000.

1445
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,303
Heaven forbid either of you
ever worked for something.

1446
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:44,405
Hey, Clint? Why don't
you think of this gun
as a microphone?

1447
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,507
When it's not in your hand
you shut the fuck up. Okay?

1448
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,612
It's none of my business,
but just so you know,

1449
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,582
the Charlie that...

1450
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:58,118
Yul, that I've known
for the past year

1451
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,387
I think is the one that
you were trying to raise.

1452
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,457
He's actually
a pretty good boy.

1453
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,326
Yeah.

1454
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:07,261
Hey, give me that shovel!

1455
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:09,296
Boy, you look like
a monkey fucking a football.

1456
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:10,464
Oh, I got it, Pops. Thanks.

1457
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:11,565
Allen. Let him do it.

1458
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,634
That is bullshit, though.

1459
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:16,437
Hey, uh...

1460
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,608
I'm sorry
I disappeared like that.

1461
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:24,478
I couldn't handle
letting you down on
top of everything else.

1462
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,313
It was just
too much for me.
And it was

1463
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,350
cowardly.
And I'm sorry.

1464
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,355
I'm racing Class 1 now.

1465
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:35,623
Get out of here.
Class 1?

1466
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:39,360
Yep. I bought a Tatum,
700 horse.

1467
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,495
You should drive it.

1468
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:43,564
Motherfucker will go over
or through anything.

1469
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:45,666
It's a...

1470
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,448
Good luck with the dinar.

1471
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,250
Oh, man.

1472
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,652
It's gonna be huge, Yul.

1473
01:22:04,654 --> 01:22:08,055
if you weren't
such a shitty
motherfucking friend.

1474
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,290
All right. Let's go.

1475
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:10,391
Don't touch me!
What, bitch?

1476
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:11,392
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1477
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,964
You want to see me act like
a fucking degenerate, bitch?

1478
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,433
Get off her! Alex, man,
you've got the fucking
money! Just go!

1479
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,001
Annie's coming with us.

1480
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,636
When the deal is made
and the cops aren't called

1481
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:26,373
No one's calling the cops.
Just please, take the money.

1482
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,508
I'm not fucking
asking you a question.

1483
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,564
Go! Go, baby, get him!

1484
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:51,598
Hey!

1485
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,133
Hey!

1486
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:54,969
Hey!

1487
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:00,674
Hey!

1488
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,010
Yul!

1489
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:11,552
In here?
Is this it?

1490
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,521
No, no!
That's not a Tatum!

1491
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,457
What a bone grow.

1492
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,558
Come on! Let's go!

1493
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,329
You open that door!

1494
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,163
Seatbelts! Seatbelts!

1495
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:27,735
Turn it on!

1496
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:29,336
Uh, okay.

1497
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,471
Jesus! Look at
all this shit!

1498
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,511
Start this
ridiculous vehicle!

1499
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,746
Okay! I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1500
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:40,414
You're gonna
catch a fucking stray!

1501
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,216
Power! I've got power!

1502
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,524
Come on, motherfucker!

1503
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,497
Go!

1504
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:19,820
What the fuck
just happened?

1505
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,395
What are you doing?

1506
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,130
I can't leave my
dad in that field.

1507
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:48,115
Looks like he's
got it under control!

1508
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:48,849
Yeah.

1509
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,615
Come on, motherfucker!

1510
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:45,606
Give me your gun!

1511
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,359
Get out of the car!
Lady! Grab some dirt!

1512
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,293
Get your fucking hands up!

1513
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,230
I got him!
I shot him! He's shot!

1514
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:12,299
He's shot. He's shot!
He's shot, look!

1515
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,940
I don't think they're
following us anymore!

1516
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,775
I can't see
a goddamn thing.
Are you sure?

1517
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:22,776
Yes.

1518
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,490
Okay, you know what?
It's 2:30.

1519
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:38,292
So I think we're just
gonna have to chance it.

1520
01:26:38,294 --> 01:26:42,262
Well, I mean, we've got to
get on the freeway to
get to UC from here.

1521
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:43,764
And this thing isn't
exactly highway legal.

1522
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:45,566
So I think we should...

1523
01:26:45,568 --> 01:26:47,901
I can call a cab.

1524
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:50,304
But you don't have
time to call a cab.

1525
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:53,807
Then I'll be late.
Or I won't make it.

1526
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:55,409
But I don't want you
getting arrested over this.

1527
01:26:55,411 --> 01:26:58,545
I don't care if
I get arrested, okay?

1528
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,781
I promised you that
I was gonna get you
to this interview,

1529
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,783
and I'm gonna do that.

1530
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,652
I don't have a job.

1531
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:07,454
I don't have any friends.

1532
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:09,690
You don't love me anymore.

1533
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,992
So my word is really
all I've got going for me.

1534
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,002
I don't not love you.

1535
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:30,577
I'm just terrified
that I don't know you.

1536
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,580
I mean,
between your fake name
and those were your friends?

1537
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:34,414
Annie, Annie,
Annie, Annie.

1538
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:38,819
You know me.

1539
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:42,656
You do.

1540
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:43,957
You know me
more than anyone.

1541
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,628
And I'm gonna be
the exact same person

1542
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,030
you met and fell
in love with for
the rest of my life.

1543
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,040
Do you think you can be
the exact same person

1544
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:02,776
except not say "fag"
when you really mean "lame"?

1545
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,918
And not buy into
get-rich-quick schemes

1546
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,320
that profit from
war-torn countries?

1547
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:14,488
Okay.

1548
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,325
I'll even throw in
stereotyping.

1549
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,297
Okay.

1550
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:28,068
Let's go.

1551
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:13,080
I'm gonna go ahead and call
horseshit on the 60 yards, Anderson.

1552
01:29:13,082 --> 01:29:14,915
Horseshit, my ass.
Yeah, horseshit.

1553
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:18,418
That shot was in excess of 60 yards, sir.
Okay.

1554
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,354
And you thought you could
use Big Red's revolver

1555
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,389
instead of your own Sig?
This whole thing stinks.

1556
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:24,091
I was out of ammunition
from a previous exchange.

1557
01:29:24,093 --> 01:29:25,525
Yeah, okay.

1558
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,027
I noticed that you
modified your vehicle too.

1559
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:31,732
A little bit more of an
underhaul, wasn't it?
Did you see that? Good God.

1560
01:29:31,734 --> 01:29:34,768
It was an extreme
pursuit where I was
temporarily airborne.

1561
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:37,637
You want to lay down?
Take a quick sit?

1562
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,106
You've clearly
got professional
health problems.

1563
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:41,375
My chest hurts
just looking at you.

1564
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:42,976
You've got total
disregard for equipment.

1565
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,112
But somehow...
Somehow

1566
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:48,682
you managed
to take down Dmitri
without any help.

1567
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:51,518
And that, my friend,
that's impressive.
Is it not?

1568
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,389
Well, I did receive
some vital backup
from Officer Rathbinn.

1569
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:56,857
Thank you.

1570
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,125
That's you, ginge?

1571
01:29:58,127 --> 01:29:59,025
Yeah.
Good God.

1572
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,428
I'm Terry.

1573
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,864
Hey. Pat Rickman.
Great job. Thank you.

1574
01:30:03,866 --> 01:30:05,532
You know, you're probably gonna
get out of witness protection

1575
01:30:05,534 --> 01:30:07,901
for this, big guy? Huh?
Maybe even air marshal.

1576
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,736
You like that?
You like the sound of that?

1577
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,872
Riding up front, first class,
gun at the ready?

1578
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:13,440
From your mouth
to Grant's ears.

1579
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:14,641
I'm gonna whisper
it right in there.

1580
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:15,976
I'm gonna see him this afternoon.

1581
01:30:15,978 --> 01:30:16,843
I'll make sure he knows everything.

1582
01:30:16,845 --> 01:30:18,512
Yeah, we are.

1583
01:30:18,514 --> 01:30:20,147
Hey. We'll even
throw your name in there.

1584
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:21,648
Really?

1585
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:22,749
Are you interested in
being a U.S. marshal?

1586
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:23,984
100%. I'm in.

1587
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:25,018
Well, good.

1588
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:30,891
Are you going
to borrow a condom
or can we go?

1589
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:31,825
We can go.
Okay.

1590
01:30:31,827 --> 01:30:33,560
Nice going.

1591
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:35,028
Mike's gonna be back
give you guys a ride
a little bit later.

1592
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,030
I'm proud of you!
Well done!

1593
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,094
Way to go green, asshole.

1594
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:09,629
It's bio-diesel, friend.

1595
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:12,799
Okay. You set?

1596
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,968
That was pretty amazing. Right?

1597
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:15,936
Will you acknowledge
how cool that was?

1598
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:17,471
Yeah. It was cool.

1599
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:18,939
Are you all right? Are you ready?
No.

1600
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:20,841
I'm not. I don't have
my teaching certificate.

1601
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:25,812
I am covered in mud.
I look like a transient.

1602
01:31:25,814 --> 01:31:27,948
Put your head back.
Close your eyes.

1603
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:29,182
Okay?

1604
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:30,684
Take a few deep breaths.

1605
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,190
This is the only moment
you need to worry about.

1606
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,895
You're not late
for anything. We made it.

1607
01:31:41,897 --> 01:31:43,830
You're not missing anything.

1608
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:46,233
You're exactly where
you are supposed to be.

1609
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:48,869
And you're exactly who
you are supposed to be.

1610
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:51,037
And you are
absolutely perfect.

1611
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:54,708
And if you're up for it

1612
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:57,244
I will spend every
moment with you for
the rest of your life.

1613
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:01,681
I'm up for it.

1614
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:09,656
Oh, buddy.

1615
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,793
Okay, buddy.
I've got to go
now because

1616
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:15,262
there's a job
in there that they
want to give me.

1617
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,030
Go get it.

1618
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:26,973
Good luck.

1619
01:32:26,975 --> 01:32:27,941
How do I look?

1620
01:32:27,943 --> 01:32:29,142
Amazing.

1621
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,781
You look great. Nice buns!

1622
01:32:34,783 --> 01:32:35,715
Shut up.

1623
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:42,022
Deep breath.

1624
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:45,659
No matter what happens today
you are an amazing person.

1625
01:32:45,661 --> 01:32:49,729
The test does not have
the power to define you
or validate you.

1626
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,665
What the fuck?
Why do you still have
your Pouncer app?

1627
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:53,066
Why are you going
through my fucking phone?

1628
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:54,801
I'm not!

1629
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:57,571
You are! You're snooping
because you have
major trust issues.

1630
01:32:57,573 --> 01:32:58,705
Yes, I've got
a lot of issues.

1631
01:32:58,707 --> 01:33:01,641
Okay? No shit.
And this doesn't help.

1632
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:03,977
I just didn't
erase it, okay?
Not a big deal.

1633
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:06,780
You promise?
Yes, I promise.

1634
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:10,684
Okay, you're going
to be great today.

1635
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:12,652
You're going to
be a great marshal.
I know. Let's go.

1636
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:46,620
No, thank you! Um...

1637
01:33:46,622 --> 01:33:47,754
I'm with somebody!

1638
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:48,688
Excuse me?

1639
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,789
On the phone!

1640
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:55,095
Come back later, please!
Office hours don't start
until next week!

1641
01:33:55,097 --> 01:33:57,097
I'm sorry. I can't
hear you through the door!

1642
01:33:57,099 --> 01:33:58,798
Having trouble hearing you.
Hi! I'm Annie Bean.

1643
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,301
Sandy Osterman.

1644
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,070
Please? Come in.

1645
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:13,980
I'm sorry.

1646
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:15,649
I have a medical condition.

1647
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:18,718
Are you okay?

1648
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,022
Did you sleep
in an outhouse
before you came here?

1649
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:25,925
No, I apologize. I know
I look unprofessional,

1650
01:34:25,927 --> 01:34:27,127
and I shouldn't have
been covered in dirt.

1651
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:29,095
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

1652
01:34:29,097 --> 01:34:32,032
I was deflecting
because I was embarrassed
about the smoke...

1653
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:37,737
My vaporizer was broke.
It's not important. Please,
just come over and sit down.

1654
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:40,273
My sister Debby told me
how wonderful you were.

1655
01:34:40,275 --> 01:34:41,441
Wait.
You're Debby's brother?

1656
01:34:41,443 --> 01:34:43,209
Yeah.

1657
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:46,913
That's funny.
She kept referring to you
as she and her.

1658
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:48,348
She has thought that was
funny since we were nine.

1659
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,419
That would make me
feel really marginalized.

1660
01:34:52,421 --> 01:34:54,120
<i>That's exactly how it felt.</i>

1661
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:56,790
I like you.

1662
01:34:57,925 --> 01:34:59,759
I think you should work here.

1663
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:02,095
I would love to! Yes!

1664
01:35:02,097 --> 01:35:03,296
<i>I mean, definite.</i>
