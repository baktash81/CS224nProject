1
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:57,381
In Amsterdam,
I dreamt I saw my mother again.

2
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,229
She was just as glad to see me
as I was to see her.

3
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,427
Same beautiful pale blue eyes.

4
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,339
Everything would've turned out belter
if she had lived.

5
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,451
As it was, she died when I was a kid.

6
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,115
And when I lost her...

7
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:37,094
I lost sight of any landmark
that might've led me some place happier.

8
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,396
You see. Her death was my fault.

9
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,542
Everybody used to tell me
that it wasn't,

10
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,708
that it was a terrible accident.

11
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,110
Which is all perfectly true.

12
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,779
And I don't believe a word of it.

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,988
It was my fault,

14
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,391
just like everything
that's happened since.

15
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,469
The painting.

16
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,600
The painting.

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,340
All my fault.

18
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,643
I lost something
that should have been immortal.

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,247
I didn't mean to do it.

20
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,624
Because what I've done cannot be undone.

21
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,795
It doesn't matter that I'm going to die.

22
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,300
But for all time...

23
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,105
for as long as history is written...

24
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:03,946
that painting
will be remembered and mourned.

25
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,214
As best we can tell...

26
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,238
he made his own way back

27
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,637
to his mother's apartment
from the museum.

28
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,236
He waited there for her all night
to come back and when she didn't.

29
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,212
He rang the emergency number
they were showing on TV.

30
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,875
When they realized his age,
they alerted us.

31
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,295
I don't know if you're aware,

32
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,152
but Theo's father left the family
about six months ago.

33
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,019
I wasn't aware.

34
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,992
My son and Theo were friends
in elementary school.

35
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,257
To my knowledge, they haven't seen much
of each other for a while.

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm afraid I don't quite understand.

37
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,336
Uh, right now...

38
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,535
he is a minor child
in need of temporary emergency care.

39
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,169
When we asked Theo
if he could think of anyone

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,906
that might be able
to help for a while,

41
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,445
he suggested you.

42
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,752
Come in, come in.

43
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm afraid Andy isn't up yet.

44
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,855
You can rest here if you like.

45
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,300
Let's get you squared away.

46
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,736
0h, here we are.

47
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,075
You'll be...

48
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,372
You'll be feeling awfully rough.

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,745
Hell of a thing to happen.

50
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,148
Good Lord.

51
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,822
In the circumstances,
I wouldn't see the harm in pouring you,

52
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,483
what my father used to call a minor nip,
if you should want some.

53
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,592
Chance.

54
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,390
Which of course you don't.

55
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,487
Quite unsuitable.

56
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,717
We're perfectly happy
to have you, Theo.

57
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,297
I hope you'll make yourself
as comfortable as you can.

58
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,153
What's happening?

59
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,821
Shh. That's Theo.
His mom passed away.

60
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,318
Someone to see you, Theo.

61
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,131
Wow.

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,163
Disturbing.

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,177
Yeah.

64
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,313
No, apparently no one
has any idea where he is.

65
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,873
He wasn't paying child support.

66
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,978
He leftdebts. He more or less
flew town without a word.

67
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,651
I don't think we had a choice.
We couldn't very well turn the boy away.

68
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,824
No. Just for a few weeks.

69
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,525
Do you sail, Theo?

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,824
No, sir.

71
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,369
That's a pity.

72
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,062
Andy had the most outstanding time

73
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,072
at his sailing camp
up in Maine last year.

74
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,301
They were the worst two weeks
of my life.

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,900
Nonsense.

76
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,673
You lack confidence. That's all.

77
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,746
Would you like me to ask Etta
to make you something else to eat, Theo?

78
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,747
I'm not hungry.

79
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,555
Thank you.

80
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,656
Where's his dad?

81
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,684
Good question.

82
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,750
Oh, my God!

83
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,600
Try this on, Theo.
It's an old one of Platt's.

84
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,572
It's so cold outside.

85
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,944
Outside?

86
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,610
I think you should
go back to school next week.

87
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,912
The sooner we get back
to a normal routine the better.

88
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,751
Keeping busy is the only thing for it.

89
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,290
Perhaps you could go this afternoon?

90
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,061
To your apartment.

91
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,227
I could come with you.

92
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,507
I meant to clean up
while I was waiting for her.

93
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,147
You get what you need.
I'll tidy this up.

94
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,616
Just your school things.
The rest can wait.

95
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:36,692
Also, basketball practice

96
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,549
has been moved to 4:00 on Thursday.

97
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,883
Tickets for next week's lacrosse final
are available in the admissions office.

98
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,320
Go Vikings!

99
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,827
Hey, Tom.

100
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,895
Hey.

101
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,231
I heard and all.

102
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,333
Yeah.

103
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,028
Yeah, tough luck.

104
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,728
That really bites.

105
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,148
The only reason
we were at the museum

106
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,232
was because my mom was bringing me in
to see the principal.

107
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,809
About the cigarettes.

108
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,335
Yeah. My mom blew up
over that shit, too.

109
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,541
So, uh, I got to go.

110
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,321
Later.

111
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,772
Where are you going?

112
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,994
- Creep-lo!
- Loser!

113
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm going to go swimming every day.

114
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,065
You can't swim by yourself.
You're not allowed.

115
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,418
Everyone's going to swim.

116
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,878
The cure for anything is salt water.

117
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,914
Greatest gift my father ever gave me
was the sea.

118
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,448
The love for it.

119
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,009
The feel.

120
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,278
What's he going to do while we're away?

121
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,255
Who's the artist I like, Samantha?
With the grand skies?

122
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,644
Maxfield Parrish.

123
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,429
Maxfield Parrish,
that's the one. Great towering clouds.

124
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,197
When I was a boy on the water,

125
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,240
skies just like that. Magical.

126
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,469
Red and orange sunsets.

127
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,469
Arcadian.

128
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,080
Best to leave that to Esperenza, Theo.
She's used to doing it.

129
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,282
And the same with your dishes.

130
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Oh.

131
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,087
That is a lovely ring.

132
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,326
Is it a family thing? Your...

133
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,563
Your mother's side?

134
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,670
Yes.

135
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,502
Lovely. Carnelian.

136
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,099
The intaglio.

137
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,176
And the engraving on the inside says...

138
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,909
"Blackwell."

139
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,352
You should keep it somewhere safe.

140
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,426
I thought these might help.

141
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,632
If you take one at night,
it'll keep you from feeling scared.

142
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,176
It's perfectly understandable.

143
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,978
We all feel afraid sometimes.

144
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,301
We 're just trying to
build up a general picture.

145
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,020
Little bits of the puzzle.

146
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,152
Now, how long would you say you were

147
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,697
in the museum
before the first explosion?

148
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,197
About an hour.

149
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,168
Look at the map.
Where were you when it happened?

150
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,467
Which room were you in?

151
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,531
The last one before the gift shop.

152
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,141
Thirty two.

153
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,975
But your mother wasn't with you?

154
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,761
No.

155
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,355
She wanted to go back
and see a painting again.

156
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,833
Which painting?

157
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,733
The Anatomy Lesson.

158
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,932
It's a Rembrandt.

159
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,401
Why didn't you go with her?

160
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,077
Theo?

161
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,854
I said I'd meet her in the gift shop.

162
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,395
What do you remember about the incident?

163
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,042
Move! Get out!

164
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,245
Like, did you smell
anything before it happened?

165
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,896
I don't remember.

166
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,198
Did you see anything unusual?

167
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,470
I don't remember.

168
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,441
Anything at all?

169
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,742
Where were you
when the blast happened? Here?

170
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,212
Or here?

171
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,749
I don't know.

172
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,217
I know all these rooms look alike,

173
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,484
but maybe if you could remember
where you were,

174
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,067
we can start
to piece this thing together.

175
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,424
I'm not sure I see the point
in putting him through all of this.

176
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,060
Theo hit his head.

177
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,899
He has some memory impairment.

178
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,165
Nobody seems to have thought to ask
if he was hurt or not.

179
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Is that true?

180
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,578
All right.

181
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,740
Aftenuards, when you came round...

182
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,476
did you see people?

183
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,683
Yes.

184
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,253
What were they doing?

185
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,186
They were dead.

186
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,346
You told Beeman
the cigarettes were mine.

187
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,182
I was just standing next to you!

188
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,550
Jesus.

189
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,329
Get up!

190
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,407
Right. Okay.

191
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,546
Are you absolutely sure
you wanna do that?

192
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,747
Do what?

193
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,324
Your rook is in danger,

194
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,361
but I would suggest
you take a look at your queen.

195
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,369
Sorry things are so fucked up.

196
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,540
She was awfully nice.

197
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,481
Excuse me, I, uh...

198
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,278
He told me to bring it here.

199
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,564
I'm Hobie.

200
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,004
Come in.

201
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,730
Is that him?

202
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,899
The man who gave you the ring?

203
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,007
Yes.

204
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,605
His name was Welty Blackwell.

205
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,603
He was my business partner.

206
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,440
He was the business, really.

207
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,676
Handled the clients and sales.

208
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,896
You...

209
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,922
You said he gave it to you?

210
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,524
You mean in the gallery? After?

211
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,532
I'm glad he wasn't alone.

212
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,236
He would've hated that.

213
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,714
You're the boy, aren't you?

214
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,116
Whose mother was killed there?

215
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,953
Have you eaten?

216
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,604
You like the family you're staying with?

217
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,675
The Barbours?

218
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,944
It was in the papers.

219
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,450
About her taking you in, I mean.

220
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,182
Orphan's plight type thing.

221
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,086
I've done some work for her family
in the past.

222
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,352
What's your favorite subject in school?

223
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,324
English, I guess.

224
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,424
You have a favorite author?

225
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,464
Tolkien.

226
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,369
Edgar Allan Poe.

227
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,271
My dad says he's second-rate, though.

228
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,476
He says he's the Vincent Price
of American letters.

229
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,504
I don't think that's fair, though.

230
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,811
No, I don't either.

231
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,281
And where is he in all this, then?

232
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,017
Your father?

233
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,857
Oh, I don't know.

234
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,392
He ditched us.

235
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,723
Good riddance.

236
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,028
He could be okay sometimes, I guess.

237
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,170
He used to be an actor.

238
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,899
And when we watched movies,

239
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,068
he used to tell me how they did
the special effects and all.

240
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,512
But he drank.

241
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,885
Like sometimes when he picked me up
from school and...

242
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,492
Anyway, he's gone now.

243
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,254
Well, you've pitched up
with an interesting family anyway.

244
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:46,206
Now all that remains
is a handful of paintings.

245
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,610
The Goldfinch is one of them.

246
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,349
It had to live
its whole life like that?

247
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,847
Trapped?

248
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,458
Is she here?

249
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,122
Pippa?

250
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,231
This is Theo.

251
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,034
He wants to say hello.

252
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,377
Not too long, pigeon.

253
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,939
You need to rest.

254
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,089
I know you.

255
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,089
Are we friends?

256
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,286
Sorry. I've forgotten things.

257
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,391
I didn't remember my room
when I came home.

258
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,008
What's your favorite piece of music?

259
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,610
Beethoven.

260
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,476
You look like somebody
who listens to Beethoven.

261
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,350
Is that what you wanna do?

262
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,791
Be a musician?

263
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,266
I'm not supposed to listen to music,
'cause of my head.

264
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,033
It's horrible.

265
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,270
What Beethoven do you like?
I've got some Glenn Gould.

266
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,869
It's my favorite.

267
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,280
It's medicine.

268
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,149
I think it's morphine.

269
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,026
You get tired during the day?

270
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,137
Yeah.

271
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,995
I didn't use to.

272
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,042
Me neither.

273
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,542
Now, I can't stay awake.

274
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,842
I'm sorry.

275
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,914
I know it's rude,

276
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,348
but would you mind
if I just close my eyes for a bit?

277
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,881
You can listen to some music,
if you like.

278
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:09,908
You like it?

279
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,656
John Singleton Copley,

280
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:24,486
a great Colonial portrait painter.

281
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,493
It was my grandmother's.

282
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,095
She loved it, too.

283
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,304
This option two or three?

284
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,308
Three.

285
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:40,411
Okay.

286
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,312
And now,
how about this is choice five

287
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,609
or choice six?

288
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,241
Six.

289
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,898
Why can't she listen to music?

290
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,238
She can, sometimes.

291
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,745
It just tends to upset her.

292
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,716
She thinks she has to practice,
prepare a piece for school.

293
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:33,756
They say that she could play
on some amateur level one day...

294
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,460
but so many changes.

295
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,393
Her aunt is taking her to Texas.

296
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,132
I thought she lived here.

297
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,703
Well, she did.

298
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:59,111
Welty was her uncle

299
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,880
and her legal guardian,
after her mother died.

300
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,789
But now,
Margaret is Pippa's nearest relative.

301
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,427
Blood, anyway.

302
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,822
And she thinks
she'd be better off with her.

303
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,994
What's she like?

304
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,970
She seemed nice, I guess.

305
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,770
She said she's got horses
and a swimming pool.

306
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,805
I don't ride.

307
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,239
Do you?

308
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,282
No.

309
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,111
My mom did.

310
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,518
She used to have horses
growing up in Kansas.

311
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,855
There was this one,
used to get so lonely...

312
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,258
he would come and put his head
through the window...

313
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,660
just to see what was going on.

314
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,467
Is your motherdead, too?

315
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,163
Yes.

316
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,542
Did yours get sick?

317
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,677
No.

318
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,641
Will you stay
with the family you're with?

319
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,715
No.

320
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:08,344
They're all going away for the summer.

321
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,118
Then what?

322
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,886
I don't know.

323
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,894
I wish you weren't going.

324
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,869
Do you rememberseeing me?

325
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,170
When?

326
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,178
Right before.

327
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,313
I remember you.

328
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,681
I was there.

329
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,552
I was there.

330
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,028
You should get
some rest, pigeon.

331
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,094
And I told Theo
I'd show him the workshop.

332
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,617
You like old things.

333
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,185
Must be interesting for you
at the Barbours', then.

334
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,720
The Chippendale? Queen Anne?

335
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,601
It's nicer here.
You can see how they're made.

336
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:37,698
At the Barbours', they all
kind of look like stuffed animals.

337
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,541
You can help me sort through
these cherrywood veneers.

338
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,949
Looking to match the case
for this clock here.

339
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,471
Theo, you remember Platt.

340
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,504
Who do I have to blow to get
a cup of coffee around this place?

341
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,414
Go back to your room.

342
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,178
- Ghance, just...
- No. Not this time.

343
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,684
Go back to your room.

344
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,788
Now!

345
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,293
Something happened at school.

346
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,493
Something bad.

347
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,601
Has he been expelled?

348
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,296
No one will talk about it.

349
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,500
Mother loves Platt the best.

350
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,099
Daddy loves Kitsey best.

351
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,645
Mother loves Platt.

352
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,284
She loves Toddy a lot, too.

353
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,361
I can't tell.

354
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,826
Well, one way is to check the wear.

355
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:52,075
If it's too even, like here,
then it's reproduction.

356
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,181
Antiq ues always wear asym metrically.

357
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:07,085
Anotherthing, here, this.

358
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:09,727
It's machine-cut.

359
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,363
You feel it?

360
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,065
Hmm.

361
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,192
But here...

362
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,304
hand-planed.

363
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,573
So this one is fake.

364
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:33,412
Well, no. It's only fake if
you try to pass it off as an original.

365
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:37,785
This is a reproduction,
and not a very good one.

366
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,653
There are things you can do
to help the reimaginlng.

367
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,628
Period wood, acid, gold size, lampblack.

368
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,564
You can rust old nails in salt water.

369
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,967
You'll get a feel for it.

370
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,575
The new one's flat. It's dead.

371
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,672
But this one...

372
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,648
That glow.

373
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:11,615
That's hundreds of years
of being touched, used.

374
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,920
That's life.

375
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,714
What do you know about Texas?

376
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,286
You can't walk anywhere
and they have the death penalty.

377
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,219
But it'll be better for her there.

378
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,792
The climate is good for convalescents.

379
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,623
She should go to the planetarium,

380
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,219
although it's inferior to the Hayden.

381
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,463
Do you wanna go get a burger?

382
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,700
I thought you were watching your weight,
so you'd fit into your prom dress.

383
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,535
Oh, oh, oh...

384
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:08,670
Oh.

385
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,840
Well, I've been making a corsage
for your dress,

386
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,009
and it goes
a little something like this!

387
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:20,882
Theo...

388
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,691
I have a proposal for you.

389
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,690
Would you like to come to Maine
with us this year?

390
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:27,661
Yes.

391
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,223
Please! That would be...

392
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,893
Yes, please.

393
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,699
Good. We'll see how you like sailing.

394
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,006
You think it's going to be fun,
but you'll hate it.

395
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,546
How come they decided to ask me?

396
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,774
Don't be a dunce.

397
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,747
They've grown quite fond of you.

398
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,846
I think they might make
a family announcement in Maine.

399
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,754
Announcement?

400
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,080
I think they might wanna keep ya.

401
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,184
Andy says we'll be sick.

402
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:00,698
He has to carry a baggie on board
just to throw up in.

403
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,092
I'm afraid I'm the same way.

404
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,103
You mightjust discover
you wanna be a sailor

405
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:11,608
or a marine biologist.

406
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,402
You never know
what's going to decide your future.

407
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,790
I got deck shoes, like you said.

408
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,555
And I got a sweater.

409
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,063
Theo...

410
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,899
I have a surprise for you.

411
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,639
Hey, buddy.

412
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:48,906
Long time no see.

413
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,615
Hi.

414
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,847
I'm Xandra. With an "X."

415
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,923
So we just got into LaGuardia
about two hours ago.

416
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,117
I'm out in Las Vegas now and, uh...

417
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,254
Well, things are pretty different
for me.

418
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:18,769
Son, we're straight off the plane.

419
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,505
And, well, we wanted to see you
straight away, of course...

420
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,843
but also need the key to the apartment.

421
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,109
Yeah, we couldn't get in there.
We tried already.

422
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,379
Yeah, I'm here
to start taking care of stuff.

423
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,477
You should be proud of your pops.

424
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,785
Fifty-one days sober.

425
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,983
Did it all on his own.

426
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:38,052
Detoxed on the sofa,
basket of Easter candy and Valium.

427
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,858
Because I couldn't take it.

428
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,404
My mom's the kind of lush
who would throw up in her own glass,

429
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,468
and then drink it anyway.

430
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,047
I guess I should have called, but...

431
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,631
Well, I figured it was easier
just to come and get you.

432
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,301
Get me?

433
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,844
You got a nice little place here.

434
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,647
No, it's more hers than mine.

435
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,592
What do you got there?

436
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,731
A picture.

437
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,995
No, I told ya.
Don't haul a lot ofjunk, all right?

438
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,093
You know,
the movers will bring most of it.

439
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,339
You know, your mother wasn't
so easy to get along with.

440
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,040
But there's two sides
to every marriage, you know?

441
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,874
And she sure could hold a grudge.

442
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,552
But God knows she didn't deserve...

443
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,530
"Desert End Road."

444
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,403
It's like you're moving
to some mining colony on Jupiter.

445
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,772
Iwonder if your school will be
one those places you read about,

446
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:02,040
with gangs, metal detectors.

447
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,618
Okay. We're off.

448
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,657
Have a good trip, all of you.

449
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,793
Goodbye, Theo.

450
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,295
You're an awfully good guest.

451
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,460
Hey, wake up, buddy.
Come on, you're holding up the line.

452
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,393
Jeez, he's as white as a sheet.

453
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,860
Why don't you, uh, give him
one of those? You know?

454
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,534
Here, this'll help.

455
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:47,876
Shoes.

456
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,417
What is that?

457
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,217
That's her dog.

458
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,051
Popper, you get back here.

459
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,613
He stayed by himself?

460
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:01,623
Come here!

461
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:02,954
He's got a water fountain.

462
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,790
Grab these other bags, will you?

463
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,228
Pop! Would you... Larry, get the dog.

464
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,299
Popper!

465
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,594
Popper!

466
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,399
Jesus, Xan,
there's shit all over the floor!

467
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,305
You don't think
I can see that, Larry?

468
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,342
Popper, come here.

469
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,139
Damn it, lstepped in it.

470
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,331
I thought he'd stopped?

471
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,708
Mmm?

472
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:31,073
Oh. That's just a beer.
He doesn't touch the hard stuff anymore.

473
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,647
Take the trash out, will you?

474
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,216
Where does it go?

475
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,035
There's a house down the street
with a dumpster outside.

476
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,356
Just stick it in there.

477
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,558
Won't they mind?

478
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,730
Who?

479
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,998
We're the only ones here.

480
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,671
I wear bespoke suits.

481
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,341
I swim twice a week.

482
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,139
I socialize with people I can't stand.

483
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:14,841
I'm relaxed...

484
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,313
personable.

485
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,183
I don't indulge in self-pity.

486
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,921
It is true what I read.

487
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,924
We 're so accustomed
to disguise ourselves to others...

488
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,634
that in the end...

489
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,865
we become disguised to ourselves.

490
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:42,879
Warmer.

491
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,950
Warmer.

492
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:50,487
Warmer.

493
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,826
Yes.

494
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,228
Really?

495
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,493
No, but it's so beautiful.

496
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,393
How would you know?

497
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,058
Most people wouldn't.

498
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,726
I've seen pieces he's worked on that

499
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,304
I could've sworn
were completely genuine.

500
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,000
This is genuine Connecticut Queen Anne.

501
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:15,546
But the pediment and the legs
were damaged,

502
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:21,175
so the finials and the legs
were salvaged from a different piece.

503
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,020
What? These?

504
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:27,857
Mmm-hmm.

505
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,329
You feel that?

506
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:33,763
Yeah.

507
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,100
Wow.

508
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,259
And...

509
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,071
here.

510
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,839
You feel that?

511
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,077
What are we looking at?

513
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,273
Come and see what Hobie made, Everett.

514
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:52,382
Oh, ldidn't make it.

515
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,577
I just patched the poor thing up.

516
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,082
Not worth much now, of course...

517
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,532
but maybe we can find a home for it.

518
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,252
What do you think, Pip?
Shall we take it?

519
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,350
It's bigger than our bedroom.

520
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,357
I'm gonna take these two to lunch
and then on to the airport.

521
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,864
What? Can't you come with us?

522
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:10,865
Oh.

523
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,802
No, no, I can't.
I have a client meeting, so...

524
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,464
You're such a businessman these days.

525
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:18,371
Well, one of us has to be.

526
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,068
All right, let's go.

527
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:23,709
Yes. Uh, well, it was so lovely
to see you again.

528
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,781
It was great to finally meet you, Theo.

529
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,819
If you're ever in London,
come and stay with us.

530
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,980
She was exaggerating about
the size of the flat, sort of.

531
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,794
I can recommend the poularde.

532
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,843
That's fine. Thank you.

533
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:54,978
Mmm-hmm.

534
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,179
- Thank you.
- Very good, sir.

535
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,646
This is a pleasant surprise, Mr. Reeve.

536
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,240
Lucius, please.

537
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,116
Are you looking
for another piece to buy?

538
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,951
I want to talk about the piece
you've already sold me.

539
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,257
The Affleck?

540
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,087
- It is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes.

541
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,028
Except that it isn't, is it?

542
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,529
Thomas Affleck, I mean.

543
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:17,795
The phoenix ornament is.
I'm fairly certain about that.

544
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,133
But the rest of the chest is not.

545
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:26,038
Antique, but unremarkable.

546
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,807
Mr. Reeve, I can assure you
that if there's been a mistake...

547
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,315
Oh, but there has been, Mr. Decker.

548
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:37,878
You sold a fake to someone
who can tell the difference.

549
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:39,456
To be honest...

550
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,515
I am still quite new at all this,

551
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:46,653
and I am certainly not an expert
at Philadelphia Chippendale.

552
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,499
Here's the problem.

553
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,327
I know exactly who put the little
Frankenstein's monster together

554
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,405
that you sold me.

555
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,404
Your partner.

556
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:57,984
My partner had nothing to do with this.

557
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,305
Oh, I think he did.

558
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,004
I've seen his handiwork before.

559
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,409
"Changelings."

560
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,043
That's what he calls 'em, isn't it?

561
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:09,718
A pair of finials from here,
a set of legs from there.

562
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:14,382
Just enough of a genuinely collectible
piece to fool the buyer, and voila'.

563
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:18,155
I'm happy to buy the piece
back from you, Mr. Reeve.

564
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,423
At a premium.

565
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,562
I don't see what else I...

566
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,599
- I know you.
- What?

567
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,431
I've been in this business
for a long time.

568
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:30,268
We all know poor Hobie was going under,
swimming in debt.

569
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,866
Then along you come, the wunderkind.

570
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,879
The knowledgeable,
charming young salesman.

571
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,279
Suddenly the business is thriving.

572
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,684
But I know you, Mr. Decker.

573
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,549
I know all about you.

574
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Theo?

575
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,132
It's Platt.

576
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:02,872
Platt Barbour.

577
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:06,900
Platt. Good Lord.

578
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,638
Long time. How are you?

579
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,145
How's Andy?

580
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,207
You know how Daddy had...

581
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,982
They used to call it
"problems with his nerves."

582
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,481
Bipolar.

583
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:22,786
I didn't know.

584
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,459
He was always very kind with me.

585
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:26,461
Yeah.

586
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:31,126
A few years back,
he came off his medication.

587
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,897
You know how he loved sailing.

588
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,409
He decided to go out
off the Northeast Harbor.

589
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,400
Iwent with him.

590
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:45,142
Andy came too, just in case
Daddy got storm giddy, you know?

591
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:48,865
Of course, Andy didn't wanna go.

592
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:52,154
He always hated the water.

593
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,591
Anyway, the wind blew up

594
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,150
and we were trying
to reef the mainsail...

595
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,021
and Daddy started just...

596
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,196
shouting all this poetic bullshit.

597
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,172
Next thing, he's overboard,
and we're trying to haul him back in.

598
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,341
And we get broadsided.

599
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,677
This big wavejust...

600
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,181
And they both went.

601
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,463
Andy hadn't tied hisjacket on properly.

602
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,629
He was always such a fucking klutz.

603
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,209
God, Platt.

604
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,408
Do something for me?

605
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,286
She's back here.

606
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,527
We're very informal now.

607
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,941
Mom? I've got a guest for you.

608
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:04,988
Mrs. Barbour?

609
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:12,762
Theo.

610
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,927
I can't believe it.

611
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,796
So handsome.

612
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,341
Isn't he, Platt? Hmm?

613
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,077
Yeah.

614
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,640
Now, you must tell me,
what have you been doing with your life?

615
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,352
Uh...

616
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,478
Dealing antiques.

617
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:42,957
Antiques. How marvelous, Theo.

618
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,995
American furniture, mostly.

619
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,289
You should come by.

620
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:49,763
You know how I love old things.

621
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,768
When you were a child, I used to
catch you studying my paintings.

622
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,168
You'd always go straight
to the very best ones.

623
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,638
The Peale, the Lane, the Copley.

624
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:03,113
I used to think, "Ah, a kindred spirit."

625
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,277
Mrs. Barbour...

626
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,814
I didn't know about Andy.

627
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:09,784
Mmm.

628
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,115
I can't believe it.

629
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,956
I am so sorry.

630
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,691
I don't need to tell you about loss.
Hmm?

631
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,634
You were always
such a good friend to him.

632
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,472
Thick as thieves, the pair of you.

633
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,836
Yourfunny little games.

634
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:34,811
So...

635
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,209
do you see any of your old school crowd?

636
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,910
No, not really.

637
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,045
I see a little bit of Tom Cable,
now and then.

638
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,178
Really?

639
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,703
Sees my sister...

640
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,491
on occasion.

641
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,085
Don't exaggerate, platypus.

642
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,756
Iran into him a couple of times.

643
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,228
So you really are here.

644
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:01,236
I didn't believe it when Platt rang
to say you were visiting.

645
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,458
It's great to see you, Theo.

646
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,864
I'm sorry, this is just so weird.

647
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,375
You must have been seven or eight
the last time I saw you.

648
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,606
A long time ago.

649
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,108
I'm so glad you came back to us.

650
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,381
Just like old times.

651
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,189
Hmm?

652
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,287
The lowboy goes
all the way back to Salem.

653
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,397
17605.

654
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:32,265
My grandmother's house, I remember,
when I was a child...

655
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,900
Oh, take my breath away.

656
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,405
You know, I'm amazed
you came back to us.

657
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,946
I always thought you'd hate us.

658
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:46,948
We were so horrible to you, Toddy and I.

659
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,312
You were only little.

660
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,578
I know.

661
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,613
And look at us now.

662
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,125
Almost exactly like people.

663
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:06,229
Well, if we're forgiven,
make sure you come back again.

664
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,678
Hmm.

665
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,819
Dear Pippa...

666
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,692
How are you?

667
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,358
I've been thinking about you.

668
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,670
I hope things are wonderful
for you in Texas.

669
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,207
I have to say...

670
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,401
I sort of hate it here.

671
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,015
Do you remember your mother?

672
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,089
Yes.

673
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,492
What do you remember?

674
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,922
She had dark hair...

675
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,759
and she was really pretty.

676
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,596
She laughed a lot.

677
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,208
And she liked galleries.

678
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:00,582
Is that why you were there?

679
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,020
Do you remember seeing me?

680
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:18,562
"However mean
your life is, meet it and live it."

681
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,135
It is not so bad as you are.

682
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:28,704
"Love your life. Poor as it is."

683
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,542
And what do we think about
Thoreau's anti-commerce stance?

684
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,584
I think it's stupid.

685
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,916
I mean, if everybodyjust dropped out
and moped around in the woods,

686
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,081
what kind of society would we have?

687
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,556
It's irresponsible.

688
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,422
Right.
If it was just people like him,

689
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,156
we wouldn't have stores,
or television, or roads.

690
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,131
Uh...

691
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,232
Twat.

692
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
Right.

693
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:55,266
But he might be arguing
the opposite of that.

694
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:58,433
Does anyone have a differing opinion?

695
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,617
Huh!

696
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:12,814
Harry Potter.

697
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,618
Fuck you.

698
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,658
Where's your snowboard?

699
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:28,204
Huh?

700
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:29,772
YourT-shirt.

701
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,331
There's not much boarding in the desert.

702
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,808
No. I don't know how to snowboard.

703
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,506
I just hate the sun.

704
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,857
Theo.

705
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:58,968
Boris.

706
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,305
Where are you from?

707
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:08,334
Russia, Australia, Poland...

708
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:14,009
New Zealand, Texas, Alaska, Canada.

709
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:15,718
Sweden.

710
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,514
Originally from Ukraine.

711
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,754
Jesus.

712
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,484
Yeah, we travel.

713
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,254
My fatherdigs mines.

714
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,090
People hate us everywhere we go

715
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:29,324
because the company promise
they won't fuck up the environment,

716
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,264
then they fuck up the environment.

717
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:32,765
Huh!

718
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:36,099
But I figure here who cares?

719
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,499
You want to get drink?

720
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,406
What?

721
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,001
Drink. I have beer at my house.

722
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,346
Uh...

723
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,614
Okay.

724
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,352
What are you doing?

725
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:52,455
Told you.

726
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,256
Hate the sun.

727
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:26,655
No.

728
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,892
Do you have any neighbors?

729
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,096
All the houses around mine are empty.

730
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,899
Same.

731
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,238
They built this shit way too far out.

732
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,774
Now desert is reclaiming.

733
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,313
Ha!

734
01:00:51,515 --> 01:00:53,107
Desert and the banks.

735
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,646
You want vodka?

736
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,678
No, thanks.

737
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,352
My dad drinks it all the time.

738
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,517
So much, he can't feel his feet.

739
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:05,618
Literally. It's got a name.

740
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,365
My...

741
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,824
My dad says he's stopped drinking.

742
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,362
Sure.

743
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,273
You want food?

744
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,607
I've got bread, sugar.

745
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,106
No, thanks.

746
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,551
Is there anyone here?

747
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,221
No.

748
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,292
My dad won't be back tonight.

749
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,458
It's just the two of you?

750
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,364
Yes. My mother is dead.

751
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,334
Mine, too.

752
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,472
Mine was alkie.

753
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,405
Got drunk and fell out of window.

754
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,072
Mine got killed in a bombing.

755
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,556
Yeah.

756
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,189
Life, eh?

757
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:02,936
What's this?

758
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:05,639
Uh, vitamins.

759
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:07,979
Xandra said she got them
from this bodybuilder guy.

760
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,219
Vitamins?

761
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,415
That's not "\f' for vitamin, Potter."

762
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,254
It's Vicodin. Can get you high.

763
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,433
You think she sells?

764
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:29,800
Her? No.

765
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,840
She manages a bar on the Strip.

766
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,271
Oh! Then she can't be selling drugs.

767
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,341
I thought you were from New York?

768
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,650
Oh, God, she's hot.

769
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,115
Would you mind?

770
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,152
If me and her...

771
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,485
Ugh.

772
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,084
You don't like her?

773
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:54,463
No.

774
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,825
I think my dad was seeing her
when my mom was still alive.

775
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,868
He used to say he was
going on all these work trips...

776
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,337
but I think he was coming here.

777
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:05,271
So?

778
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,832
That's on him.

779
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,604
Don't blame her.

780
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:12,141
Or the little dog here.
What's he called?

781
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:16,816
What are you...?

782
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:17,886
Hey.

783
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:23,726
Good boy.

784
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,124
That cost $20.

785
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,295
It would've cost $20.

786
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,985
Look at that. Cute fella.

787
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:59,419
You can put him down. Go ahead.

788
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,164
Stay.

789
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,233
What's your name, kid?

790
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,861
Theodore Decker.

791
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,871
Another New Yorker, right?

792
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:10,769
Yes, sir.

793
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:12,774
Pleased to meet you. I'm Naaman Silver.

794
01:05:12,876 --> 01:05:14,275
Is your dad home?

795
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,537
No, sir.

796
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,580
"Sir." Nice manners.

797
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,170
Do you know when he'll be back?

798
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,249
No, sir.

799
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,914
Would you like to come in and wait?

800
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,945
You're a good kid, Theo.

801
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,285
I won't, thank you,
because I don't really

802
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,586
like to bother a man when he's home.

803
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,693
Just tell him I called.
And you take care.

804
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,859
God bless.

805
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,416
Yes! There you go!

806
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:58,767
You see, that's what you get
when you exercise discipline.

807
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:00,983
You got to approach it like an investor.

808
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,422
That's me. Pure Scorpio.

809
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:05,553
You believe that stuff?

810
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:09,829
Half the sports books in Vegas
have an astrologer on speed dial.

811
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,594
You look for the edge where you can.

812
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:15,968
This year, 53% on what?
A thousand plays?

813
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:18,563
That's a good year.
That's a damn good year.

814
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,405
This fucking game, baby.

815
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:25,406
I wanna open up a savings account
for you, okay?

816
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,848
I put 10,000 aside, so...

817
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:29,179
You don't have to do that.

818
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:33,153
I know I don't have to do that.
I know that. I want to.

819
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:35,788
Just give me
your Social Security number,

820
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:36,689
when you've got a minute,

821
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:38,761
and I'll open it up for you.

822
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,127
It's just, you know,

823
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,262
I'm glad you're here, kiddo.

824
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,662
You and your mom...

825
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:51,463
You know, you two were always so close.

826
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:57,312
I'm glad you've given me
a second chance.

827
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,953
There you go! Are you seeing this?

828
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,115
You're bringing me luck already.
This is unbelievable!

829
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,659
We got two more games today.
We got to pace ourselves.

830
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:13,525
This is great. Oh, man.

831
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,140
We got to keep that dog
out of the house, too.

832
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,654
The dog is bad luck.

833
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,030
Help me with that, okay?

834
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,396
Is there any more ice cream?

835
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,871
Whoo!

836
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,346
We should trip together.

837
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,717
Drop acid.

838
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:46,386
That girl, the thin one in civics?

839
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,390
Kayley.

840
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,167
She says
her mother's boyfriend can get some.

841
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,931
Have you done it before?

842
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,338
Once.

843
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:03,542
It was fantastic.

844
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,343
What does it...

845
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,416
Shh!

846
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,777
My dad, he'll kill the dog. Hurry.

847
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,054
Popper. Come here.

848
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,062
Very exciting.

849
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:20,146
If you ever go to Ukraine,
people will treat you as big star.

850
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,256
Yeah?

851
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,191
You didn't tell me
yourfatherwas in movies, Potter.

852
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,262
I mean, it was only one or two,
you know.

853
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,491
It was mostly, you know, TV work.

854
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:33,592
Hey, listen, Theo,
I'm gonna take Xandra to the MGM Grand

855
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:35,866
for Thanksgiving dinner.

856
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:37,530
You wanna come?

857
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,971
We thoughtwe mightjust
do our own thing, Dad.

858
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,015
We'll probably go
to Boris' house for dinner.

859
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:51,064
But I guess I could come with you guys,
if that's what you'd rather?

860
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:54,282
The reservation's been made
already, so...

861
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,792
Well, I'll let you two work it out.

862
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,624
Boris, do you like cop movies?

863
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,891
- Sure.
- Yeah?

864
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:04,125
I made one with Mickey Rourke.
You wanna see it?

865
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,134
- For real, man?
- For real.

866
01:10:07,804 --> 01:10:10,204
This was delicious.

867
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,136
Thank you.

868
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,176
Mickey hated me, by the way.

869
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:15,842
I don't know
what the problem was,

870
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,056
'cause I thought he was pretty cool.

871
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,207
But, you know,
the guy was just threatened by me...

872
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,980
for whatever reason.

873
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,196
I mean, we even worked out together
a couple of times.

874
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:27,246
You want me
to change the reservation or not?

875
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,701
I never said I didn't want you to come.

876
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,215
I neversaid you did.

877
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:33,821
Got it.

878
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,889
What are you two really gonna do anyway?

879
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,593
We'll probably just watch TV here.

880
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,829
Do you want me to bring you
those cocktail sausages

881
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,429
and the hot wings that you like?

882
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,104
Great.

883
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:49,042
Cool. I'll hook you up.

884
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,681
But you stay outta my cigarettes.

885
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,847
"Every man, every woman..."

886
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,689
"carries one true home."

887
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,588
English!

888
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,857
In English, you fucker!

889
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:16,296
Oh! Fuck! Oh, my fucking mouth.

890
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,275
My wife, Dawn.
And our kids, Sebastian and Casey.

891
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,377
Ha!

892
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,072
Did you hear that?

893
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:25,741
What?

894
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:27,077
The man talking?

895
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:30,950
He just wished happy holiday
to his kids, Bastard and Casey.

896
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,077
Don't be stupid.

897
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:33,486
That's what he said.

898
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,817
That's hard, eh?

899
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:38,553
Casey's okay.
But calling your son Bastard on TV...

900
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,721
- That's not what he said.
- Then what did he say?

901
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,890
- How the fuck should I know?
- Then why argue?

902
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,832
Americans always call their kids
stupid fucking names

903
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:49,268
like Apple, and Blanket,
and Bear, and shit.

904
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:54,241
Families enjoying the first
skate of the season in New York City.

905
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,255
You and your mother go there?

906
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,747
No. It was for tourists.

907
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,782
What did you do?

908
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,480
Nothing. We just...

909
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,013
She made turkey.

910
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,824
We sang songs.

911
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,765
Can't we just swallow them?

912
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,701
It hits harder this way.

913
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,014
How will we know when it starts working?

914
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,820
My dad killed a man.

915
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:22,155
In mine, in New Guinea.

916
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,167
Bullshit.

917
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,904
No.

918
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,171
It's true.

919
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,041
He did it with a...

920
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,370
What do you call it?

921
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,249
Pipe wrench.

922
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,550
Hmm.

923
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:46,954
Tried to make it look like
loose rocks had fall on him.

924
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:50,883
We had to leave right after.

925
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,396
Now you.

926
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:00,934
A secret.

927
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,638
I dream about my mom.

928
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:17,215
I dream...
somebody tells me where she's living.

929
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:23,581
It's like
some old slum building across town.

930
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:26,154
And I run there...

931
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,828
and I run up the stairs...

932
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,092
but she's gone.

933
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,497
She's always gone.

934
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,575
It's not secret.

935
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,971
She won't see me
because it was my fault.

936
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:56,281
Because they'd said I'd been smoking.

937
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,955
And it was raining, and we were early...

938
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:05,199
and that's why we went into the museum.

939
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:11,471
It was my fault she died.

940
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:17,502
And now she won't see me.

941
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,490
Swim, Potter.

942
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,778
Where am I?

943
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:05,954
Where?

944
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,262
Pippa!

945
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,564
Where is she?

946
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:29,969
I haven't seen you for so long.

947
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:32,608
Emile.

948
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,112
You should stay still.

949
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:37,175
Not here. Not here. Don't leave it here.

950
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,848
Not here. Don't leave it here.

951
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,081
Take it.

952
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:43,585
Take it.

953
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,820
They mustn't see it.

954
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:47,695
They'll take it.

955
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,625
They took all the light bulbs.

956
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:55,994
They...

957
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,704
That? You mean that?

958
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,381
It's okay. Here.

959
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:10,485
Take it with you.

960
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:22,290
Promise! Promise you'll take it.

961
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,326
Uh-huh.

962
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,242
I have to find my mother.

963
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,251
Hobart and Blackwell.

964
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:52,258
Ring the green bell.

965
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:29,915
Clear on the side!

966
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,289
It's just me, Potter.

967
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:10,996
Potter.

968
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:17,235
Sleep. Sleep, Potter. Shh.

969
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,225
Theo, you got a minute?

970
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,698
Sure. What's up?

971
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,061
You know I said I'd had a good year?

972
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:52,163
Well, I'm looking
to make some big changes.

973
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,266
A buddy of mine
is opening up a restaurant.

974
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,673
Wow. That's great.

975
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,837
Yeah. It's a great opportunity.

976
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:03,044
But, you know, it's just, well,
restaurant taxes, liquor license taxes.

977
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,416
It's a big initial outlay.

978
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,848
Oh. Well, if you need the money
from the savings account, you can...

979
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,924
The...

980
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,925
Right. No, I, uh...

981
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:14,927
Right.

982
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,396
I appreciate that, pal. I do.

983
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,127
But what I need you to do is...

984
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:23,102
I need you to call this guy Bracegirdle,
your mom's attorney.

985
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,565
There you go.
I've written everything out.

986
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:29,133
You tell him that I'm sending you
to a private school,

987
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:32,475
and you need this amount
transferred to this account.

988
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,072
$65,000?

989
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:40,148
As long as the money's being used
for your benefit, it's legal, right?

990
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,382
And this restaurant,
it'll be for all of our benefits.

991
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,585
Thing is, if we angle this right?

992
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,721
You know, we could save, like, 30,000.

993
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,626
But why...

994
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:51,722
Theo, I don't have time
for this right now.

995
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,800
And if you need to sign documents,

996
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:58,736
you tell him
to fax to this number, okay?

997
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,832
But why do I have to do it?
I mean, it...

998
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:06,141
Hey. You're gonna do this, all right?
You've got to.

999
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:09,115
I'm in a real fucking tight spot here.
Do you understand that?

1000
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,981
You got it? Just a temporary thing.

1001
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:15,518
I mean, 'cause this opportunity... Hey.

1002
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:19,151
This opportunity could go away,
if I don't get on it right now.

1003
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,261
Stop!

1004
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,623
Stop with the crying.

1005
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,943
Just what's on the page.

1006
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:48,762
Bracegirdle and Wise.

1007
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,789
Can I speak to Mr. Bracegirdle, please?

1008
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,160
This is Theodore Decker.

1009
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,528
Please hold.

1010
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,135
Theodore, Im glad you phoned.

1011
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,967
I've had no way of getting in touch
with you directly.

1012
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,640
I wanna go to private school.

1013
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,733
Did my mother leave me some money?

1014
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,301
Not exactly.

1015
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:15,578
But you do have a 529
which can be used for your education.

1016
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:19,085
So, if! Asked you to send me $65,000?

1017
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:22,215
I'm afraid
the funds can only be released

1018
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,349
directly to the school of your choice.

1019
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,360
It was setup by your mother to ensure

1020
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,419
it could only be used
for your education.

1021
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:30,860
I don't know it! Should tell you this,

1022
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,231
but an unauthorized person
has twice tried

1023
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:35,394
to make a large withdrawal
on the account.

1024
01:24:35,504 --> 01:24:37,870
Someone with access
to your Social Security number,

1025
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,670
purporting to be your attorney
out there.

1026
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,869
Do you know anything about that?

1027
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:47,272
No, I don't.

1028
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,778
Thank you anyway.

1029
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,894
God damn it! No!

1030
01:24:59,962 --> 01:25:02,760
Fuck! God! Fuck!

1031
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:08,200
No! No! No!

1032
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,270
Fuck!

1033
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,379
He told me you had fortune.

1034
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,471
My dad?

1035
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:22,277
You think if I had a fortune
Iwouldn't have told you?

1036
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:23,384
I don't know.

1037
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,647
There are lots of things
you don't tell me.

1038
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:33,087
I know what will make you feel better.

1039
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,269
Believe me, Potter.

1040
01:25:45,774 --> 01:25:49,471
This is going to be
one of the great nights of your life.

1041
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,610
It's like a movie.

1042
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,976
It's all flat and black and white.

1043
01:26:26,148 --> 01:26:29,481
Would be nice
if we could've had color, though.

1044
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,478
Maybe if you paid more.

1045
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:39,824
Shit.

1046
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:41,726
No one was supposed to be here.

1047
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,191
Act normal.

1048
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,666
They've got sparks coming out
of their mouths.

1049
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:53,065
Normal. Normal.

1050
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:07,083
You're still in your work uniform.

1051
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:08,989
Theo...

1052
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:14,495
your dad's had a car accident.

1053
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,493
It was about two hours ago.

1054
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:24,503
His blood alcohol was .39.

1055
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:30,076
He was driving west into the desert...

1056
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:33,778
like he was leaving.

1057
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:38,678
Right.

1058
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:43,714
Right. So, when's he coming back?

1059
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:47,119
No, Theo.

1060
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:53,300
What I'm saying is is that he's dead.

1061
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,629
He's dead.

1062
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,104
He's dead, he's dead.

1063
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:26,901
What are you doing?

1064
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,263
I didn't think you could see me.

1065
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:34,433
You're too young to drink.

1066
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:36,809
Apologies.

1067
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:51,085
What's wrong with you?

1068
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,496
What is wrong with you?

1069
01:28:58,033 --> 01:29:02,527
You can't cry? Your father is dead.
Your own father.

1070
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,662
Oh, you think it's funny?

1071
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,604
Yeah, well, let me tell you something.

1072
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:11,304
You might not have had
a lot of time for your dad,

1073
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,438
but you are his kid...

1074
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:17,476
through and through.

1075
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:41,508
They've gone.

1076
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,341
And she's out cold.

1077
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,411
What are you doing?

1078
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:45,839
I'm looking for money.

1079
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,705
I'm leaving
before people start showing up.

1080
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:51,018
- Come with me.
- Where?

1081
01:29:51,086 --> 01:29:52,747
- New York.
- What?

1082
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,685
I can't stay here with her.

1083
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:56,087
Because of what she said?

1084
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:57,556
She's in mess, Potter.

1085
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,183
I feel sorry for her.

1086
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:07,668
Don't.

1087
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:11,069
We should plan this.
Crazy to go tonight.

1088
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,935
I can't stay here!

1089
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:15,373
She'll put me in a home.
You understand that?

1090
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:16,535
Look, I'm a minor.

1091
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:19,171
I've got no family, no friends out here.

1092
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,677
We have to go.

1093
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,750
Now.

1094
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:40,430
What about Popchik?

1095
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:49,453
We'll stop at yours, grab your things,
and then go to the bus station.

1096
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,139
I can't leave now. Give me more time.

1097
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:55,375
What? I don't have time.
They'll come for me.

1098
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,111
- Just one day.
- Why?

1099
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:58,276
Because I...

1100
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,717
Because what?

1101
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,386
There's something important
I have to tell you.

1102
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:06,822
Boris, what?

1103
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,759
What do you have to tell me?

1104
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:14,661
You shouldn't go. It's a mistake.

1105
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,600
I have to go.

1106
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:18,832
Now, are you coming or not?

1107
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:22,166
You go ahead.

1108
01:31:22,744 --> 01:31:24,109
I'll follow.

1109
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:25,771
One or two days.

1110
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:31,013
You have to come. Promise me.

1111
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:34,088
We'll go to Brighton Beach. That's where
all of the Russians hang out.

1112
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,282
- And we can go to school together.
- Potter.

1113
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:37,358
And...

1114
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:43,925
Good luck.

1115
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:46,657
Look after Popchik.

1116
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:28,061
I hope this will do.

1117
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,868
It's Welty's old room.

1118
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:45,282
Please don't make me go.

1119
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,418
You need to get out of those wet things
and get some rest.

1120
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:53,891
We'll talk when you're feeling better.

1121
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:02,969
And no one's gonna make you go.

1122
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,906
You can stay as long as you like.

1123
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:10,303
Both of you.

1124
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:09,469
I'm not going to drag you there again,

1125
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:10,731
but you have to decide.

1126
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:12,703
Chinois china or Birds of the Nile?

1127
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:15,806
Birds of the Nile.

1128
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:17,244
Oh, ow!

1129
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:20,647
Oh.

1130
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:25,516
Theo.

1131
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:27,885
It wasn't quite as romantic
as I hoped it would be.

1132
01:35:28,156 --> 01:35:29,714
They're beautiful.

1133
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:33,692
What?

1134
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:36,662
No, nothing. They're gorgeous.

1135
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:41,327
It's just, do you think they'll be
quite right for the actual day?

1136
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,269
No.

1137
01:35:44,372 --> 01:35:46,533
Emeralds, I adore them...

1138
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:49,207
but they're not really my stone.

1139
01:35:49,277 --> 01:35:50,835
Mother can't wear green either.

1140
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:52,937
Whatever you think.

1141
01:35:54,616 --> 01:35:55,616
Oh...

1142
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:58,685
Darling, I've hurt your feelings,
haven't I?

1143
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,189
Look, I will wear them.

1144
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,691
- You really don't...
- I want to.

1145
01:36:09,364 --> 01:36:11,389
Kitsey said no speeches today...

1146
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:13,434
so this is a toast.

1147
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,899
To my best friend and her husband-to-be.

1148
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,434
To Kitsey and Theo.

1149
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:23,543
Cheers.

1150
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,913
I hope you don't
already have this.

1151
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:29,211
No. You'll never ever believe this,

1152
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:32,549
but I saw this show in Boston
when I was in college.

1153
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,891
Is that that boy? Longstreet?

1154
01:36:41,763 --> 01:36:43,731
Forrest Longstreet.

1155
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,891
He was in Andy's class, wasn't he?

1156
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:46,797
That's right.

1157
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:50,268
He didn't invite Andy
to a birthday party, I remember.

1158
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,330
I don't think
Andy would've wanted to go.

1159
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:58,444
Perhaps not.

1160
01:37:01,516 --> 01:37:03,507
You knew him better than I did.

1161
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:09,312
I don't think I ever saw him for...
Forwhat he was.

1162
01:37:09,424 --> 01:37:13,827
I think I was always trying to
make him into someone else.

1163
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:19,925
After he'd gone...

1164
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:25,305
I thought
everything would be broken forever.

1165
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:30,136
And then you came back.

1166
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:38,209
And I thought
I'd never be quite so happy ever again.

1167
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:43,854
I hope you don't mind

1168
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:45,983
if I speak from the heart...

1169
01:37:48,496 --> 01:37:51,693
but I always did think of you
as one of my own.

1170
01:37:57,505 --> 01:38:00,497
I know this must have been
distressing for you.

1171
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:03,408
So I'd like to offer you
some compensation.

1172
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:05,741
Say, an additional 10,000?

1173
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,541
I know you were there.

1174
01:38:10,752 --> 01:38:12,413
Room 32.

1175
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,818
I know you were there,

1176
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:18,552
and I know what else was in that room.

1177
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,372
I don't know what you're talking about.

1178
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:26,561
The Metropolitan Museum,
the day of the bombing.

1179
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,164
I don't wanna talk about that.

1180
01:38:30,204 --> 01:38:31,831
My mother died in that explosion.

1181
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:35,865
I know she did.
Welton Blackwell died too, in room 32.

1182
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:38,336
You know, if your partner

1183
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:41,041
hadn't gone around telling half the town

1184
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,743
how you turned up at his door
with Welty's ring,

1185
01:38:43,851 --> 01:38:45,876
I might never have made the connection.

1186
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:48,452
What connection?

1187
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:52,788
The connection
between you and the painting.

1188
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:58,064
The painting you brought to Mr. Hobart,
who subsequently made you his ward.

1189
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:00,434
- I'm not his...
- 0rwhatever you are to him.

1190
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:03,265
The painting
you two have been farming out,

1191
01:39:03,371 --> 01:39:04,565
using it to raise money.

1192
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,607
This painting.

1193
01:39:08,576 --> 01:39:10,567
Fabritius' The Goldfinch.

1194
01:39:11,379 --> 01:39:16,112
Destroyed in a mindless terrorist attack
on a New York museum.

1195
01:39:17,218 --> 01:39:18,742
Oh, poor, brave little bird.

1196
01:39:20,822 --> 01:39:22,915
Lost forever.

1197
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:28,426
You've been irresponsible enough,

1198
01:39:28,496 --> 01:39:31,590
letting those street thugs
handle something so delicate.

1199
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,094
What I'm suggesting is...

1200
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:40,235
you sell it to me for, say...

1201
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,239
half a million dollars.

1202
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,846
Otherwise, I'm sure the police
would be quite interested...

1203
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:50,144
What the fuck
does this have to do with me?

1204
01:39:53,754 --> 01:39:54,812
All right.

1205
01:39:55,623 --> 01:40:00,322
The FBI received a tip
that a criminal gang in Miami

1206
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:04,194
was using the painting as collateral
in a drug deal.

1207
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:08,962
But that proves that it didn't burn
in the explosion, wouldn't you say?

1208
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:23,283
I would advise you
to think about my offer.

1209
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,649
I am quite prepared to go to the FBI.

1210
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:26,880
Be my guest.

1211
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:31,349
Whenever you'd like to talk about
the other matter, call me.

1212
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:46,204
Kitsey's not here, Theo.

1213
01:40:46,307 --> 01:40:48,207
I thought she'd be back
from work by now.

1214
01:40:48,309 --> 01:40:49,970
She's not answering her phone.

1215
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,807
I don't know when she'll be back.

1216
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,038
Okay.

1217
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,584
Can I wait for her here, please?

1218
01:40:58,653 --> 01:41:00,644
I think you bettercome back later.

1219
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,417
Are you serious?
I just want to wait in her room, Em.

1220
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:04,524
I don't...

1221
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,186
I live here, too.

1222
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,058
You can't just come barging in here.

1223
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:13,592
I'm sorry. It's a bad time.

1224
01:41:42,363 --> 01:41:43,557
It's all rig ht.

1225
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:45,291
It's gonna be fine.

1226
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,464
You all right?

1227
01:41:59,747 --> 01:42:00,975
Theo.

1228
01:42:03,384 --> 01:42:04,817
It's so late.

1229
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:08,418
You should've called me.

1230
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:10,753
Are you hungry?
I can make us something to eat,

1231
01:42:10,825 --> 01:42:12,122
if you like?

1232
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,627
Oh! Maybe a glass of wine?

1233
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,797
Em said you stopped by earlier.

1234
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,434
Oh. Darling, will you open this?

1235
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:25,767
Please don't.

1236
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:27,599
I'm sorry?

1237
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:30,473
I saw you.

1238
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:39,786
Oh.

1239
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:42,414
You don't mean Tom Gable, do you?

1240
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:45,523
He's an old friend.

1241
01:42:45,626 --> 01:42:48,595
Please, Kitsey. No more secrets.

1242
01:42:54,001 --> 01:42:56,299
I didn't think it would matter
until the wedding.

1243
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:02,867
Itried to break things off
a while back, but...

1244
01:43:02,977 --> 01:43:04,535
But you love him.

1245
01:43:08,783 --> 01:43:11,047
I don't expect you
to know what it feels like

1246
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:13,882
to be in love with the wrong person.

1247
01:43:18,826 --> 01:43:19,826
Theo...

1248
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,659
does it really matter
as much as all that?

1249
01:43:27,635 --> 01:43:29,500
You know it doesn't.

1250
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:31,565
Not really.

1251
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:35,338
I know about your things.

1252
01:43:36,811 --> 01:43:38,642
My things?

1253
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,808
Take all the drugs you want,
I don't care.

1254
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:45,382
This marriage makes sense.

1255
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:50,914
Mommy loves you so much.

1256
01:43:53,494 --> 01:43:54,927
It's a good match.

1257
01:43:56,197 --> 01:43:59,030
We like each other and we get on.

1258
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,330
Head not heart?

1259
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,004
If you like.

1260
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:18,609
$2, 000.

1261
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,545
Reilly and Britton, of course.

1262
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:24,352
First edition, first printing.

1263
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:27,617
As you can see, in beautiful condition.

1264
01:44:29,797 --> 01:44:30,797
I'll take it.

1265
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:33,025
For yourself?

1266
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,692
No. A gift.

1267
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:36,597
Lucky person.

1268
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:39,973
Oh.

1269
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:42,542
Look at this.

1270
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:47,108
Stored in some unheated shed
in Watervliet.

1271
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,815
It's amazing it survived at all,

1272
01:44:49,917 --> 01:44:51,117
but look at the grain, though.

1273
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:57,624
What?

1274
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,283
I didn't want to bother you.

1275
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:01,759
Bother me with what?

1276
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:07,325
This guy Reeve, Lucius Reeve...

1277
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:11,068
I sold him the chest-on-chest
with the Affleck ornament.

1278
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,139
And?

1279
01:45:13,808 --> 01:45:16,436
I sold it as an Affleck.

1280
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:21,009
I should have never, never.
But I didn't know what to do.

1281
01:45:21,115 --> 01:45:24,312
We had the IRS calling every other day,
and now he's got it in for us.

1282
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:25,749
Well, give him the money back.

1283
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,311
I've tried. I don't know what he wants.

1284
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:33,490
Dealers live by their reputation, Theo.
It's an honor system.

1285
01:45:37,865 --> 01:45:40,333
If word got out that...

1286
01:45:40,935 --> 01:45:42,926
I'll put it right, Hobie.

1287
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:45,782
I'll offer him more than what he paid
for the piece.

1288
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,671
I'm sure he just wants money.

1289
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:57,349
Hobie?

1290
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:19,005
Pippa?

1291
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,171
Hello, lovely.

1292
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:28,709
Are you gonna change the sign?

1293
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:30,482
No.

1294
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:32,314
I didn't ask him to.

1295
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:34,013
I know you didn't.

1296
01:46:35,522 --> 01:46:38,423
But Hobie's always saying
you've turned things around.

1297
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:40,727
Quite the salesman.

1298
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:44,253
And who'd have thought it?
Antique furniture?

1299
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:54,201
Do you miss it?

1300
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,175
New York?

1301
01:46:58,712 --> 01:47:00,907
Don't let me forget,
I've got a book for you.

1302
01:47:05,786 --> 01:47:07,583
I've got something for you, too.

1303
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,587
It's good timing.
I finished my book on the plane.

1304
01:47:14,028 --> 01:47:16,519
I've got you The Rings of Saturn.

1305
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:18,963
Everett said he thought you'd like it.

1306
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:29,409
- Is it good?
- Mmm-hmm.

1307
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:30,610
Great.

1308
01:47:31,145 --> 01:47:33,272
I'm really glad you're happy, Theo.

1309
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,611
I can't believe I haven't even met her
and you're getting married.

1310
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:37,717
Yeah.

1311
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,118
It was all pretty fast.

1312
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:44,052
Well, I guess when you know, you know.

1313
01:47:52,733 --> 01:47:55,099
Okay. I'm bushed.

1314
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:57,296
Time for bed.

1315
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:06,112
Night.

1316
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:36,370
I remember the feeling of,
"Who is this guy?"

1317
01:48:36,477 --> 01:48:40,470
That each voice is so clearly etched
in the eloquence,

1318
01:48:40,547 --> 01:48:42,826
with which he was able to play
the left and the right hands,

1319
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:46,684
so they sounded almost like
it was a duet played with yourself.

1320
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:53,986
Im sorry.

1321
01:48:55,996 --> 01:48:57,327
I thought you'd like it.

1322
01:48:58,966 --> 01:49:00,194
I loved it.

1323
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:05,027
It just reminded me of that world.

1324
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,661
It was really hard, you know.

1325
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:14,671
You just practice, practice, practice,
six hours a day.

1326
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:19,341
And then everything stopped that day.

1327
01:49:20,354 --> 01:49:22,914
Now I can't even go
to a concert.

1328
01:49:24,091 --> 01:49:25,319
And Welty...

1329
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:28,251
you know, he was only with me that day

1330
01:49:28,362 --> 01:49:31,024
because I was making him take me
to an audition.

1331
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:34,325
It was my fault, Thee.

1332
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,732
Come home.

1333
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:39,671
Home here?

1334
01:49:40,107 --> 01:49:41,107
Yes.

1335
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,176
What about Everett?

1336
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,609
When I was with Welty...

1337
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:51,578
when he gave me this ring...

1338
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:54,744
something happened between us.

1339
01:49:57,691 --> 01:49:59,750
Like the way he guided me to the shop.

1340
01:50:01,562 --> 01:50:04,463
The minute I was there, it felt right.

1341
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:07,460
And antiques?

1342
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,798
Why would I be interested?
Who would've known that?

1343
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:11,530
But I was.

1344
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,802
It's like he sent me
exactly where I needed to be.

1345
01:50:15,476 --> 01:50:18,309
And to who I needed to be with.

1346
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:23,743
Pippa.

1347
01:50:28,255 --> 01:50:30,280
- I...
- I know.

1348
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:31,789
I know.

1349
01:50:34,495 --> 01:50:36,053
Don't think I don't.

1350
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:43,827
Yes.

1351
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:46,734
I miss it.

1352
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:49,667
New York.

1353
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:53,075
But I'll tell you why I don't come back.

1354
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:56,306
Because at least in London...

1355
01:50:57,918 --> 01:51:00,648
I don't think about it...

1356
01:51:01,922 --> 01:51:03,947
every second of the day.

1357
01:51:07,928 --> 01:51:09,657
But I miss it.

1358
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:13,255
I miss Hobie.

1359
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:17,034
And I miss you.

1360
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:34,679
We are an awful lot alike, Theo.

1361
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:40,049
What we both went through...

1362
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,958
I don't think we can lean on each other.

1363
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:46,729
If one of us went down...

1364
01:51:49,236 --> 01:51:51,067
the other would go with them.

1365
01:51:55,342 --> 01:51:57,003
Theo, I'm sorry.

1366
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,811
No. No.

1367
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:03,182
I'm sorry.

1368
01:52:11,358 --> 01:52:12,518
It's okay.

1369
01:52:22,002 --> 01:52:23,002
Yo.

1370
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:26,597
Jerome? I need some.
Where do I go?

1371
01:52:26,707 --> 01:52:31,041
Hit up my girl Katrina.
Bar G-Slack off Avenue B.

1372
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:46,852
Does Katrina work here?

1373
01:52:47,628 --> 01:52:48,788
Katrina?

1374
01:52:50,197 --> 01:52:52,358
I'm a friend of Jerome's.

1375
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:56,562
He said she might be able to help me.

1376
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:58,738
What's her second name?

1377
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:04,441
Help you with what?

1378
01:53:07,314 --> 01:53:08,406
It doesn't matter.

1379
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:18,090
Hey.

1380
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:21,894
Potter!

1381
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:29,966
Boris?

1382
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,128
How did you know I'd be here?

1383
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:46,414
I didn't.

1384
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:47,783
You weren't looking for me?

1385
01:53:47,854 --> 01:53:48,684
What?

1386
01:53:48,789 --> 01:53:51,155
This is just accident?

1387
01:53:52,693 --> 01:53:53,693
Yes.

1388
01:53:56,129 --> 01:53:57,129
All right.

1389
01:53:59,433 --> 01:54:01,492
To accident, then. Mmm?

1390
01:54:15,782 --> 01:54:17,272
They serve food here?

1391
01:54:17,818 --> 01:54:19,115
Not usually.

1392
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:23,111
What do you do?

1393
01:54:23,457 --> 01:54:25,049
This, that.

1394
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:28,821
Many things, you know. Just getting by.

1395
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:32,128
You living in New York?

1396
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,827
No. I travel a lot. Sometimes here.

1397
01:54:35,669 --> 01:54:37,637
Sweden, Belgium, Germany.

1398
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:39,228
- Russia?
- Not so much.

1399
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:43,070
I thought maybe you went back
to Russia

1400
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:45,639
because you never came.

1401
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:48,806
Well, very fucked-up time.

1402
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:50,679
For a while, I worked for Mr. Silver.

1403
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:52,381
What?

1404
01:54:52,486 --> 01:54:53,963
I was living with Xandra at the time.

1405
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:54,817
What?

1406
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,015
My dad had moved. I had nowhere to go.

1407
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,421
We ended up getting along.

1408
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:00,189
Mr. Silver would come round.

1409
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,593
So for a while, I am his assistant.
Do this, do that.

1410
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:05,096
I can't believe you're here.

1411
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:08,057
Do you know what I did in college?

1412
01:55:08,168 --> 01:55:11,729
Conversational Russian, because of you.

1413
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:17,340
It used to make me think of you.

1414
01:55:23,683 --> 01:55:24,683
Potter...

1415
01:55:25,285 --> 01:55:27,685
I am so sorry for what I did to you.

1416
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,248
Forget it.

1417
01:55:32,225 --> 01:55:33,886
No, I can't.

1418
01:55:38,865 --> 01:55:40,230
Are you happy?

1419
01:55:42,135 --> 01:55:43,363
Not very.

1420
01:55:44,204 --> 01:55:45,296
A girl?

1421
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,904
Look, it's not that. It's...

1422
01:55:50,644 --> 01:55:52,544
I'm engaged to be married.

1423
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:57,076
I don't know why I'm telling you this...

1424
01:55:58,318 --> 01:56:01,446
but I saw her kissing anotherguy.

1425
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:05,124
Old friend of mine. Tom Cable.

1426
01:56:05,225 --> 01:56:07,420
The asshole with the cigarette,
when you were a kid?

1427
01:56:10,597 --> 01:56:12,087
And you love her.

1428
01:56:13,667 --> 01:56:15,567
But not too much, I think.

1429
01:56:16,503 --> 01:56:17,902
It's complicated.

1430
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:23,102
There is someone else?

1431
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:27,974
All right. Enough of this.

1432
01:56:28,081 --> 01:56:30,072
Let's go somewhere. Let's get a taxi.

1433
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:31,150
A taxi?

1434
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:36,849
You've got a fucking driver. You?

1435
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:38,788
I have a fucking driver!

1436
01:56:38,859 --> 01:56:41,623
Gyuri, say hello to Potter.

1437
01:56:41,695 --> 01:56:43,287
Hello, Potter.

1438
01:56:43,363 --> 01:56:44,363
Hello, Gyuri.

1439
01:56:45,432 --> 01:56:46,592
Watch the...

1440
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:48,293
Watch, you're spilling it!

1441
01:56:48,368 --> 01:56:49,368
Hold it still!

1442
01:56:54,441 --> 01:56:55,441
Come work for me.

1443
01:56:56,109 --> 01:56:59,545
Fate brings us together again.
And you are not happy.

1444
01:56:59,646 --> 01:57:01,113
I want to repay you

1445
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:04,480
because everything good
that has happened is because of you.

1446
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:07,385
That's great.
I got you started as a drug dealer.

1447
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:10,479
Not drug dealing. I have a good life.

1448
01:57:10,557 --> 01:57:11,557
We could...

1449
01:57:15,495 --> 01:57:18,555
I am so sorry, Potter.

1450
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,360
So sorry for what I did.

1451
01:57:21,468 --> 01:57:23,732
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.

1452
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:27,237
That I should treat you so badly.

1453
01:57:27,908 --> 01:57:31,366
And I have tried, I swearto you,
I have tried to get it back.

1454
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:34,156
I thought
you might have heard about Miami,

1455
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:39,208
and I wanted to tell you that nothing,
nothing could be traced back to you.

1456
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:45,724
No.

1457
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:49,393
You never opened it?

1458
01:57:49,496 --> 01:57:50,895
All these years?

1459
01:57:51,898 --> 01:57:53,763
How could you not fucking open it?

1460
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:55,232
Shut the fuck up. What are you...

1461
01:57:55,335 --> 01:57:57,200
You had stayed, I would have...

1462
01:57:58,338 --> 01:58:01,865
I would have given it back to you.
I promise.

1463
01:58:01,942 --> 01:58:03,876
Told you that I had switched it.

1464
01:58:03,944 --> 01:58:05,241
But you wouldn't wait.

1465
01:58:05,345 --> 01:58:07,404
You had to go straight away,
and I was scared

1466
01:58:07,514 --> 01:58:09,038
to tell you that I'm so ashamed.

1467
01:58:09,115 --> 01:58:10,241
Still so ashamed!

1468
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:12,875
Bullshit! Nobody knew about it.
No one has ever...

1469
01:58:12,953 --> 01:58:15,683
You are a blackout drunk, Potter.

1470
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:19,222
You showed me it.

1471
01:58:19,292 --> 01:58:22,284
At Thanksgiving. Totally wrecked.

1472
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,694
You unwrapped it and showed me.

1473
01:58:28,068 --> 01:58:30,536
And I wanted it. But not to sell.

1474
01:58:30,604 --> 01:58:33,573
Iswearto you.
You cannot sell something like that.

1475
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,937
I don't believe...

1476
01:58:36,376 --> 01:58:37,920
I don't believe one word you're saying.

1477
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:40,572
This is the back of the painting.

1478
01:58:41,081 --> 01:58:44,141
The verso prove that we have it.

1479
01:58:45,485 --> 01:58:48,977
The painting was used
as collateral on certain deals.

1480
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:53,248
Until Miami.

1481
01:58:53,927 --> 01:58:56,418
And I swear to you, Potter, I swear...

1482
01:58:56,496 --> 01:58:57,974
What are you... Wait, Potter!

1483
01:58:57,998 --> 01:58:59,226
Please, stop!

1484
01:59:46,713 --> 01:59:47,713
Move! Get out!

1485
02:00:39,032 --> 02:00:40,863
He came to see me today.

1486
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:43,896
Reeve.

1487
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:49,535
He had photocopies, bills of shipping.

1488
02:00:51,211 --> 02:00:52,235
Dozens.

1489
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:53,778
All right. Listen...

1490
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,370
I wanted to tell you.

1491
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:59,283
I was just trying to settle some debts.

1492
02:00:59,385 --> 02:01:00,863
I didn't know how to get out from under.

1493
02:01:00,887 --> 02:01:03,117
No, no, you don't have to tell me.

1494
02:01:03,523 --> 02:01:06,549
Business turning around
and it suited me...

1495
02:01:08,228 --> 02:01:09,126
to keep my head in the sand.

1496
02:01:09,229 --> 02:01:12,392
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.
This is all my fault.

1497
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:15,231
And I'll fix it.

1498
02:01:16,202 --> 02:01:18,136
That's not why he came.

1499
02:01:25,044 --> 02:01:26,739
Is it true?

1500
02:01:30,316 --> 02:01:33,979
Please tell me it isn't true.

1501
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:38,382
Hobie...

1502
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:41,427
I called him a liar and threw him out.

1503
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:42,984
Now, tell me.

1504
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:45,791
Is it true?

1505
02:01:47,634 --> 02:01:48,999
The painting?

1506
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:53,238
Yes.

1507
02:01:56,142 --> 02:01:58,770
Do you know
the history of that painting?

1508
02:01:59,946 --> 02:02:03,473
Do you know that it was
his last painting because he died?

1509
02:02:03,583 --> 02:02:08,020
Died in an explosion. A stupid accident.

1510
02:02:09,489 --> 02:02:13,255
And one of the only things
that survived...

1511
02:02:13,793 --> 02:02:15,317
like a miracle...

1512
02:02:16,129 --> 02:02:17,653
was that little bird.

1513
02:02:21,367 --> 02:02:25,701
Like nothing
that had been painted before.

1514
02:02:27,941 --> 02:02:30,705
And somehow, miracle after miracle,

1515
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:34,041
it survives through centuries.

1516
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:38,143
Until you.

1517
02:02:40,987 --> 02:02:42,887
Hobie, I never meant...

1518
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:47,326
I didn't know what it was at first.

1519
02:02:48,061 --> 02:02:50,552
And then, I don't even know
why I kept it.

1520
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:54,293
I was just trying to keep it safe.

1521
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:57,461
It wasn't yours to keep!

1522
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:06,874
My whole life,
everything I've tried to do...

1523
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:09,640
I don't know.

1524
02:03:10,717 --> 02:03:15,484
I don't know, maybe it's ignoble
to care too much about objects.

1525
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:18,150
But, Theo...

1526
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:24,060
that painting, pulled from the fire...

1527
02:03:25,999 --> 02:03:29,264
passed down, saved, preserved...

1528
02:03:29,836 --> 02:03:32,168
so it could be handed on.

1529
02:03:32,839 --> 02:03:34,534
And handed...

1530
02:03:37,911 --> 02:03:39,344
We die.

1531
02:03:40,713 --> 02:03:42,374
We all die.

1532
02:03:44,384 --> 02:03:49,378
But to destroy, to lose something...

1533
02:03:52,759 --> 02:03:54,920
that should have been immortal...

1534
02:04:18,051 --> 02:04:19,541
Is it lost?

1535
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:31,093
Hobie...

1536
02:04:32,765 --> 02:04:34,926
I never meant you any harm.

1537
02:04:36,002 --> 02:04:37,162
Never.

1538
02:04:59,926 --> 02:05:01,860
Cheers. Happy for you two.

1539
02:05:01,961 --> 02:05:03,105
Thank you for coming.

1540
02:05:03,129 --> 02:05:05,996
Come over and say hi to Anne.
I think she's over there by the corner.

1541
02:05:17,377 --> 02:05:18,810
Everything okay?

1542
02:05:22,882 --> 02:05:27,148
The best thing that ever happened to her
is when you came along.

1543
02:05:28,287 --> 02:05:30,152
Did your mother know, Platt?

1544
02:05:32,025 --> 02:05:35,358
She said from the beginning,
it was just an infatuation.

1545
02:05:37,163 --> 02:05:39,996
Women always love assholes, am I right?

1546
02:05:45,805 --> 02:05:47,033
We need more drinks.

1547
02:05:58,084 --> 02:05:59,084
Oh, hi.

1548
02:06:06,192 --> 02:06:07,853
Which one is she?

1549
02:06:08,561 --> 02:06:09,823
Is that her?

1550
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:13,060
Loveliest lady in the room.

1551
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,332
Go tell your lovely lady
that you have to leave.

1552
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:18,063
What are you doing here?

1553
02:06:18,571 --> 02:06:20,251
I have a ticket for you
but we must go now.

1554
02:06:22,175 --> 02:06:24,336
Why the fuck would I go to Amsterdam?

1555
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,275
'Cause you want it back.

1556
02:06:46,365 --> 02:06:48,094
- I'll find you later, okay?
- Yes.

1557
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:51,969
Oh, there you are.

1558
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:55,131
You must meet my godmother,
Anne de Larmessin.

1559
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:57,441
What are you doing?

1560
02:06:58,377 --> 02:06:59,377
Hmm?

1561
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,540
I'm going.

1562
02:07:03,049 --> 02:07:05,415
You can't. There's more photographs.

1563
02:07:05,485 --> 02:07:08,613
I'm going to be away for a few days.

1564
02:07:08,721 --> 02:07:10,245
Make up an excuse for me.

1565
02:07:11,991 --> 02:07:13,720
Are you coming back?

1566
02:07:16,662 --> 02:07:18,254
Take care, Kitsey.

1567
02:07:31,310 --> 02:07:33,175
Before and after.

1568
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,776
Everything is before and after.

1569
02:07:38,618 --> 02:07:40,916
In the middle is the painting.

1570
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:44,446
The one thing you did.

1571
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,855
You crossed the border
into another country.

1572
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,354
And now you can never go back.

1573
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,625
You cannot sell a painting
like that, Potter.

1574
02:07:56,702 --> 02:07:58,169
It's quickest way to get caught.

1575
02:07:59,305 --> 02:08:02,968
People with goods, they front you,
hold painting as collateral.

1576
02:08:03,042 --> 02:08:05,840
You sell the goods, you give them
their cut, painting is returned.

1577
02:08:06,379 --> 02:08:07,209
Who?

1578
02:08:07,313 --> 02:08:08,473
Who took the painting?

1579
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:10,539
A German guy I know.

1580
02:08:10,650 --> 02:08:13,380
Deals in stolen art.
Calls himself Sascha.

1581
02:08:13,486 --> 02:08:17,547
Was involved in setting up the operation
with those Miami assholes.

1582
02:08:17,657 --> 02:08:20,524
And then, he went missing.

1583
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:24,657
Now Sascha is feeling heat
from FBI raid.

1584
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:28,393
So he is willing to offload it for cash.

1585
02:08:37,076 --> 02:08:38,703
Glad to see you again, Potter.

1586
02:08:38,811 --> 02:08:41,041
- You know, that's not actually my name.
- So?

1587
02:08:41,147 --> 02:08:43,843
Sascha is here with the painting.

1588
02:08:43,916 --> 02:08:46,976
Victor got in touch,
said he had a buyer.

1589
02:08:47,053 --> 02:08:48,520
An American businessman.

1590
02:08:48,588 --> 02:08:51,318
And who's this American businessman?

1591
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,390
That would be you.

1592
02:08:57,363 --> 02:08:58,591
You want the painting back?

1593
02:08:59,365 --> 02:09:00,662
Yes?

1594
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:02,030
Yes.

1595
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:03,693
I am going to do this.

1596
02:09:05,504 --> 02:09:07,938
I'm going to make
everything right again.

1597
02:09:13,613 --> 02:09:15,604
40,000. My money.

1598
02:09:15,715 --> 02:09:17,182
This they get to keep.

1599
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:20,548
That way, they don't look so close
at bank draft.

1600
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:23,885
By the time they realize is no good,
we are long gone.

1601
02:09:23,956 --> 02:09:25,218
Now story is...

1602
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:28,522
you are based in New York,
very rich man.

1603
02:09:32,398 --> 02:09:33,422
Is just for show.

1604
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:54,632
There's someone in the back.

1605
02:11:07,126 --> 02:11:08,286
No one there.

1606
02:11:15,134 --> 02:11:16,863
Right, I'll see you later.

1607
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:37,253
A lot of trouble...

1608
02:11:39,325 --> 02:11:41,418
but worth it, yes?

1609
02:11:42,428 --> 02:11:43,428
Yes.

1610
02:11:43,496 --> 02:11:45,191
Merry Christmas.

1611
02:12:01,247 --> 02:12:03,340
Don't be a prick, Boris.

1612
02:12:12,057 --> 02:12:13,456
Do it over there.

1613
02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:16,918
Care! Pietersz...

1614
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:19,682
known as Fabritius...

1615
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:24,252
born in Holland in 1622.

1616
02:13:25,598 --> 02:13:27,623
He's only 32 years old,

1617
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:29,930
but he's already considered
one of the greatest painters

1618
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:32,334
in an age of great painters.

1619
02:13:34,173 --> 02:13:36,107
He's painting in his studio in Delft

1620
02:13:36,175 --> 02:13:40,942
when a nearby gunpowder store
accidentally explodes.

1621
02:13:43,182 --> 02:13:45,946
Neighbors pull a wooden panel
from the rubble...

1622
02:13:47,987 --> 02:13:52,390
and on the panel is painted a goldfinch.

1623
02:13:56,662 --> 02:14:01,395
For hundreds of years,
it is passed hand to hand.

1624
02:14:02,167 --> 02:14:03,691
It survives.

1625
02:14:06,171 --> 02:14:07,331
Until me.

1626
02:14:13,078 --> 02:14:17,139
To have kept it shut up in the dark
all these years.

1627
02:14:17,650 --> 02:14:19,641
A thing made of light.

1628
02:14:21,921 --> 02:14:23,855
That only lived in light.

1629
02:14:26,191 --> 02:14:28,022
I would've given it back.

1630
02:14:29,361 --> 02:14:30,521
I swear.

1631
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:36,929
But it was too late.

1632
02:14:39,071 --> 02:14:42,097
Things done that can never be undone.

1633
02:14:45,744 --> 02:14:47,575
Things that come together.

1634
02:14:50,683 --> 02:14:52,674
And things that fall apart.

1635
02:15:37,296 --> 02:15:38,296
Hey.

1636
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:12,497
Stop.

1637
02:16:13,098 --> 02:16:16,158
Hey. Hey. You need to walk.

1638
02:16:16,268 --> 02:16:17,268
Yes?

1639
02:16:17,703 --> 02:16:20,194
All right. Okay. Come on.

1640
02:16:20,305 --> 02:16:21,305
All right.

1641
02:16:21,373 --> 02:16:22,373
Okay.

1642
02:16:23,375 --> 02:16:24,467
Let's go.

1643
02:16:25,944 --> 02:16:28,105
There he is. That's it.

1644
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:33,776
Come on.

1645
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:35,342
The Chinese boy...

1646
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:38,216
maybe he runs back to Sascha.

1647
02:16:38,323 --> 02:16:42,487
Gyuri knew this place in Frankfurt
that Sascha used to use.

1648
02:16:42,561 --> 02:16:45,155
Place is like fortress.

1649
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:49,030
Cameras, locks, pass-codes and shit.
Need army to get in.

1650
02:16:49,368 --> 02:16:51,495
Or police.

1651
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:55,199
Eat. You should.

1652
02:16:57,176 --> 02:17:01,169
All right, so, problem is
police need probable cause.

1653
02:17:01,246 --> 02:17:07,082
Gyuri has cousin,
works in very expensive bar.

1654
02:17:07,186 --> 02:17:11,680
Now he goes to the police
and says he sees two Germans arguing,

1655
02:17:11,757 --> 02:17:14,590
and one of them leaves behind folder.

1656
02:17:14,693 --> 02:17:16,820
And inside the folder?

1657
02:17:17,262 --> 02:17:19,093
Photograph of Goldfinch,

1658
02:17:19,198 --> 02:17:24,033
newspaper articles, and FedEx envelope
with Sascha's address.

1659
02:17:24,103 --> 02:17:26,333
Next day, is like movie.

1660
02:17:26,405 --> 02:17:28,930
SWAT team
fucking breaking down the door.

1661
02:17:29,041 --> 02:17:31,373
I didn't see it happen. I wish I had.

1662
02:17:31,443 --> 02:17:34,344
To see the look on Sascha's face,
being dragged out.

1663
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,910
And yes.

1664
02:17:41,553 --> 02:17:43,043
It is there.

1665
02:17:45,023 --> 02:17:46,183
Your bird.

1666
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,188
They find it...

1667
02:17:49,795 --> 02:17:51,057
and it is safe.

1668
02:17:56,101 --> 02:17:57,363
You are welcome.

1669
02:17:58,237 --> 02:17:59,898
But there is more.

1670
02:17:59,972 --> 02:18:02,304
They find other paintings.

1671
02:18:02,407 --> 02:18:04,807
Stolen paintings. And also...

1672
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:06,377
a Rembrandt.

1673
02:18:06,445 --> 02:18:08,037
Now drink more coffee.

1674
02:18:13,585 --> 02:18:14,882
Listen to me.

1675
02:18:16,388 --> 02:18:17,912
Is important.

1676
02:18:19,558 --> 02:18:23,153
You talk about bad things you have done.

1677
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:25,827
And you blame yourself.

1678
02:18:27,332 --> 02:18:28,492
You wish...

1679
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:32,229
wish you were dead.

1680
02:18:36,275 --> 02:18:38,766
So we have done bad things.

1681
02:18:39,978 --> 02:18:43,505
But maybe sometimes
good can come from bad.

1682
02:18:45,984 --> 02:18:48,475
If you hadn't,

1683
02:18:48,587 --> 02:18:50,316
if! Hadn't...

1684
02:18:50,923 --> 02:18:53,949
maybe none of these paintings
would be found.

1685
02:18:54,359 --> 02:18:56,919
Maybe it's like...

1686
02:18:59,598 --> 02:19:03,329
huge fucking weather system
rolling over,

1687
02:19:03,435 --> 02:19:07,428
and we just get blown,
and maybe is fate or...

1688
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,307
Why give name?

1689
02:19:17,349 --> 02:19:18,349
Just...

1690
02:19:19,818 --> 02:19:20,978
life.

1691
02:19:23,522 --> 02:19:24,522
Eh?

1692
02:19:36,401 --> 02:19:39,370
Your bird is safely back in the world.

1693
02:19:46,311 --> 02:19:48,336
Happy Christmas, Potter.

1694
02:19:55,721 --> 02:19:57,313
Theo...

1695
02:19:58,824 --> 02:20:00,689
there's too much to see.

1696
02:20:02,094 --> 02:20:03,721
There's The Anatomy Lesson.

1697
02:20:03,829 --> 02:20:05,820
And we should see Frans Hals, too.

1698
02:20:07,266 --> 02:20:08,266
Oh.

1699
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:13,170
Look.

1700
02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:21,336
I like this one.

1701
02:20:23,348 --> 02:20:25,908
The Dutch invented the microscope.

1702
02:20:26,018 --> 02:20:29,283
They wanted it
all as detailed as possible.

1703
02:20:29,621 --> 02:20:32,522
Even the tiniest things mean something.

1704
02:20:33,258 --> 02:20:35,055
Like that wilted leaf there.

1705
02:20:35,127 --> 02:20:37,288
That's the painter sending you
a secret message...

1706
02:20:37,963 --> 02:20:41,091
telling you things don't last.

1707
02:21:10,996 --> 02:21:12,258
Sorry.

1708
02:21:12,831 --> 02:21:15,163
This is the one
I was talking about.

1709
02:21:21,006 --> 02:21:23,600
This is the painting I love most.
