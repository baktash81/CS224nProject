1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,311
Some things start out big...

2
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,148
and some things start out small.

3
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,484
Very small.

4
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,153
But sometimes the smallest thing...

5
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,281
can make the biggest changes of all.

6
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,246
Dad, get over here.

7
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:23,336
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go
when stuff's happening.

8
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,764
- Well, what is it?
- It was an egg.

9
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,850
Look!

10
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,770
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster
from across the sea.

11
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,689
Vicious, flesh-eating.

12
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,403
- Looks like a baby to me.
- Babies grow up.

13
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,614
You keep that thing,
one day we'll turn our backs--

14
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,118
It'll be picking us out of its teeth.

15
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,748
Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

16
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,251
- So, what do we do?
- Get rid of it!

17
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,217
What has gotten into you?

18
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,055
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

19
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,559
I'm sorry, little one.

20
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,479
Okay, get rid of it.

21
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,691
All right, I will.

22
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,499
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

23
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,861
Here.

24
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,950
It's okay.
We'll teach him to hate meat.

25
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,581
Watch his head.

26
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,918
I-l mean, watch it.
He could bite.

27
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,762
This monster's got no teeth.
What's he gonna do, gum us to death?

28
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:43,059
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

29
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,896
Does that look like a monster to you?

30
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,812
Let me out! Let me out!

31
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,485
Hair ball!

32
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,529
That was great! Get him!

33
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,908
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

34
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,243
I can't take it!
There are too many ofyou!

35
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,704
Come on! Pick on somebody
your own size. Stop!

36
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,667
Help! All right, get up, get up, get up!
Hold it! l-- No, stop it! Stop it!

37
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,171
Oh, no--

38
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,054
Aladar? You're not dead.

39
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,767
- No!
- All right, guys, break it up.

40
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,938
Remember the courtship? You're
gonna miss seeing all that smooching.

41
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,023
- Oh!
- Oh, Mom!

42
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,943
That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here!

43
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:22,367
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

44
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,871
Go fi nd Zini.
He's rehearsing pickup lines.

45
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,207
Let's hope he's found
some new material.

46
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,712
Hey, sweetie, ifyou'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

47
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,674
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

48
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,553
Girls, I'm known
as the professor of love...

49
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,055
and school's in session!

50
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,266
Yeah, I still got it.

51
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,435
I hope it's not contagious.

52
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,146
I'm a raging epidemic of romance.

53
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:55,650
Come on, hot stuff. Let's get going. You
don't wanna miss Yar's annual pep talk.

54
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,237
Oh, goody. I can't wait to hear
the mating advice ofan old monkey.

55
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,657
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I heard that in his day
that old monkey was quite a swinger.

56
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,576
- You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah.

57
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,747
- To hear him tell it,
he put the prime in primate.
- Really?

58
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,072
- Go on, now! Chest out, chin up!
- Whoo!

59
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,493
Make 'em look good, son.

60
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,205
Come on, Yar. With my charm
and your brains, no problem.

61
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,382
Hey, girls, look what
just pulled into town.

62
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,551
- Hey, ladies!
- Your buffet table of love.

63
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,638
- Right here, right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

64
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,183
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

65
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,268
- Whoa!
- Wow!

66
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,772
Zini!

67
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,222
You're missing all the action, pal.
Come on.

68
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,393
Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action! Whoo!

69
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,935
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

70
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,020
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid ofthem.

71
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,149
With the ladies, before you know it
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.

72
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:28,655
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

73
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,118
No, we have two.

74
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,378
Well, it's never really
been his best event.

75
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,631
- He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar.

76
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,093
Ifonly there was someone
on the island foryou.

77
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,887
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

78
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:57,934
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

79
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,226
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

80
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,709
- What are they?
- I don't know.

81
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,586
- What are they?
- I don't know.

82
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,456
- Dad?
- Something's wrong.

83
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,419
Aladar, where's Suri?

84
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,922
She's up in the tree.

85
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,669
Come on! Go, go! Come on!

86
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,879
- Mom!
- Suri!

87
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,590
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

88
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,177
- Mom!
- Suri, where are you?

89
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,101
Run, Aladar! Run! Run!

90
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,574
Yar, come on!

91
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,119
- Zini, jump!Jump!
- Zini, jump!

92
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,497
- Zini!
- Hold on!

93
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:26,893
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

94
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,897
Aladar! Over here!

95
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,825
Oh, Suri. Easy. Easy.

96
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,746
They're all gone.

97
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,165
Shh, shh.

98
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,293
I'm here.

99
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,588
Come on.
We can't stay here.

100
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,655
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

101
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,949
- Look!
- Whoa!

102
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,577
- Did you see that?
- What?

103
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,746
- I did.
- Me too!

104
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,707
- Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

105
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,918
- Leave it alone-- Hey!
- Shh, Dad!

106
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,088
- I-lt's scaring Suri here.
- No, it's not.

107
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,966
Everyonejust be quiet.

108
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:58,039
- Yar, grab on!
- I can't reach!

109
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,219
Aladar, they're stopping!

110
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,140
Huh?

111
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,687
Stay out of my way!

112
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,357
You heard Kron.
Move it!

113
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,377
Watch it!

114
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,060
Zini, get your head down!

115
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:33,134
Walkin' backwards, huh? Well, let me
know ifthat gets you there any faster.

116
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:39,599
Keep those little legs movin', Url,
oryou'll get left behind.

117
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,654
Look at all the Aladars!

118
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,241
I-lfyou're even thinking
ofjoining them--

119
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,245
Hang on! Hang on!

120
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,690
Kron.

121
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,151
There is a more protected spot
further down the--

122
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,946
We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

123
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:35,572
We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

124
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,336
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at
your nesting grounds now.

125
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,630
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at
your nesting grounds now.

126
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:58,094
All this pushing and shoving about,
just for a place to sleep.

127
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,638
I'm not used to
this kind of behaviour.

128
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:05,435
Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

129
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,812
Oh, I could not possibly.

130
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,690
Uh, uh, shoo, shoo.

131
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,692
Will you come on, Baylene?

132
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:16,404
You wanna get to the nesting grounds
alive? Show some backbone.

133
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,823
Hey there!

134
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,244
Oh, sorry about that. Uh, it'sjust
we overheard you talking, and, um--

135
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,959
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

136
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:34,381
He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

137
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:41,137
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.

138
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,847
Excuse me?

139
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:48,103
Um, he's my grandfather,
a couple times removed.

140
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,647
Try a couple ofspecies removed.

141
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,858
Uh, uh, uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.

142
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,361
We're all that's left.

143
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,155
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.

144
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,408
Baylene's the last of her kind.

145
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,619
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

146
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:08,373
I heard you say something
about nesting grounds.

147
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,502
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

148
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:15,046
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

149
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:19,009
Will we fi nd anybody
that looks like us there?

150
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:23,263
Oh, the last few days
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

151
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,807
Who knows what we'll fi nd.

152
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,185
The hard job now
isjust getting there.

153
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,980
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

154
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:37,110
- Kron, the herd's head honcho.
- We can hardly keep up.

155
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:41,364
A-An older woman like myself, it's--
well, it's positively indecent.

156
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,075
Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

157
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,661
Oh!

158
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,127
Hey! What's his problem?

159
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:58,131
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

160
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:01,134
Uh, excuse me.
Kron! You got a second?

161
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,513
- Get lost, kid.
- Relax, Bruton.

162
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,271
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

163
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:17,025
Why aren't you uphill with the--

164
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,611
uh, young bloods?

165
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,823
Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

166
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,743
I guess they-- they're having
a hard time keeping up.

167
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,496
So, you know, maybe
you could slow it down a bit.

168
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:35,669
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

169
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:40,006
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

170
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:43,218
Hey, they need help back here.

171
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,513
Watch yourself, boy.

172
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:51,142
Don't worry.
That's how my brother treats newcomers.

173
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,770
No matter how charming they are.

174
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,314
You sure know how to
catch a girl's eye there, stud.

175
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:01,236
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

176
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:05,240
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

177
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:09,786
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

178
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,997
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

179
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,167
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my--

180
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:19,587
No, Yar, she's right-- better to keep
our heads down with this bunch...

181
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,799
than get 'em bitten off by
those things.

182
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:27,804
Well, you just consideryourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

183
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,668
Hey, wake up. Enough with the beauty
sleep. You're ravishing already.

184
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,089
Hey! Hello! Anybody in there?

185
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,843
Zini, what are you doing?

186
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,929
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn oftime.

187
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,682
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

188
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:16,019
Something's up. The herd's gathering
without us. Let's check it out.

189
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:20,440
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

190
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,942
Come on, get up.
On your feet.

191
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,404
The charm never stops around here.

192
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,699
- You say something?
- Uh, no. No, sir.

193
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:37,582
Unless you got a death wish, you and
that little parasite better get moving!

194
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,337
Sheesh, is that guy ugly, or what?

195
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,342
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

196
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:54,724
-What are you talking about?
-You know what I'm talking about: Neera.

197
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:59,354
Scaly skin, yellow eyes, big ankles.

198
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,482
Yeah. I made
a real impression on her.

199
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,069
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

200
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:09,114
- "The love monkey"?
- Oh, baby!

201
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:21,501
That, children,
is what's known as a jerkosaurus.

202
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,048
And with that, the ice is broken.

203
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:40,437
We've got a lot offi rst-timers here.
Make sure they get it.

204
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,565
We stop for nothing and no one.

205
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,821
Ifthis is your fi rst crossing,
listen up.

206
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,575
There is no water
till we reach the other side.

207
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:57,954
And you'd better keep up,
'cause ifa predator catches you,
you're on your own. Move out!

208
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:09,215
Oh, my goodness.

209
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:09,883
Oh, my goodness.

210
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,801
It looks like a very long walk.

211
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:16,556
And hot. Ifyou smell somethin'
sizzlin', it could be me.

212
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,342
- We're moving too slow.
- I'll pick up the pace.

213
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:04,479
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

214
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:08,983
That's all I need:
a monkey on my back.

215
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:53,111
On your feet, Eema.
We can't let those things eat you.

216
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,613
They're out there waiting.

217
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,538
The lake!

218
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:49,542
- We made it?
- It'sjust over that-- that hill, baby.

219
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,670
Oh, thank goodness.

220
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,506
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

221
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,218
Well, it's time
to refresh my memory.

222
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:30,000
Ooh, I'm just gonna
walk right into that lake...

223
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,211
until the water's
up to my eyeballs...

224
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:36,464
and soak it all in.

225
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:50,645
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

226
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,984
What do you want us to do?

227
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,571
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

228
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:08,538
Enough!
You have to be strong now!

229
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:12,792
The nesting grounds are only
a few days away! Keep moving!

230
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,048
Kron, we've never gone this long
without water.

231
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:21,009
Ifwe keep going like this,
we'll lose halfthe herd.

232
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,429
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

233
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,274
What, they're moving already?
Oh, we'll never keep up.

234
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,984
There was water here.

235
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:39,986
Always water here before.

236
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:47,077
We always had water.
Always.

237
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,372
And-- And plenty of mud.

238
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:56,336
Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won't wait. We must carry on.

239
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,675
You gotta get up!

240
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:08,431
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

241
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,450
Baylene, don't move.

242
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,744
Uh, what is it? What's wrong?

243
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,374
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do.

244
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,876
Lift your foot, Baylene.

245
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,635
Now press down.

246
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:52,183
I always did like big girls!

247
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,603
- Water.
- Oh, my goodness!

248
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,279
- Water! Come on!
- They found water.

249
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,493
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

250
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,888
Kron, look.
All we had to do was dig and--

251
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:33,558
Good.
Now get out ofthe way.

252
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:48,782
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

253
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,463
Eema!

254
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,845
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

255
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,023
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

256
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:25,151
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

257
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:28,279
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

258
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,546
Let's get out of here.

259
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:12,824
Now, you come out on three.

260
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,701
Now, you come out on three.

261
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,127
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

262
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,588
Hey, hey, what's going on?

263
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:29,716
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

264
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,593
I think they're scared of me.

265
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,054
Well, who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

266
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,140
Come on over, guys.

267
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,811
Take it easy. Don't worry.
She'sjust a hair ball.

268
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:45,940
And proud of it. Come on.
He's gonna fi nd you some water.

269
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:03,249
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

270
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,131
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.
Knock it off.

271
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:12,425
Let's-- Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork.

272
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:16,805
Ready?
One, two, three.

273
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:19,891
Press!

274
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:24,813
Good job, Suri.

275
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,315
So, where are your parents,
anyway?

276
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,776
A lot of us are on our own now.

277
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:36,157
- You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

278
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:42,038
I'm Aladar, thejerkosaurus.

279
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:45,291
Oh. Sorry about that.

280
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:49,337
- Probably right.
- Dad, wake up.

281
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,381
Huh?

282
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:54,509
- Why did you help that old one?
- What else could we do?

283
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:57,178
Leave her behind?

284
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:01,224
Oh, you mean you actually--

285
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,601
Well, that happens all the time.

286
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:06,396
- You don't survive ifyou're not--
- Strong enough.

287
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,857
Well, yeah.

288
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,526
Is that you talking,
oryour brother?

289
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:19,034
Everything's so different.
I-- I don't know what to think any more.

290
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:22,704
Look, Neera,
we watch out for each other...

291
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,832
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

292
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:29,085
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not.

293
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,588
But it's all I know.

294
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,425
So, um-- Oh, water.

295
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,053
I'll, uh, get you some water.

296
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,056
- Can I try?
- Sure.Just press.

297
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,605
- Hmm.
- Oops!

298
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,024
- Sorry.
- No, you-- you fi rst.

299
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:54,778
One down and--

300
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:57,364
Well, one down.

301
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:22,806
Kron! Carnotaurs!

302
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,266
What?
They never come this far north.

303
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:28,395
The fi reball
must've driven them out.

304
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:37,153
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!

305
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:39,614
Move the herd out, double-time!

306
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,545
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

307
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:58,842
Kron! What's going on?

308
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,803
Carnotaurs. Ifwe don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

309
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,140
But the others in the back,
they'll never make it.

310
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:09,728
- They'll slow down the predators.
- You can't sacrifice them like this!

311
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:14,691
Hold it! That could be
you back there, oryou!

312
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:23,241
Ifyou ever interfere again,
I'll kill you.

313
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:29,706
Stay away from him!

314
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:36,755
Aladar, no! You just--
Just go. I'll be okay.

315
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,847
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

316
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,807
- Carno-what?
- Carnotaur.

317
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:50,852
A mouth full ofteeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

318
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:54,731
Come on, you guys, get on, get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

319
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,609
Go on.

320
00:46:57,734 --> 00:47:00,320
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

321
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:03,114
Aladar, slow down!

322
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,792
Oh, joy. Blisters.

323
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,253
I've got blisters on my blisters.

324
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,423
You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

325
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:03,258
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

326
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,176
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

327
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:07,053
Okay, what's the worst
thing it could be?

328
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:08,930
A carnotaur.

329
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,181
Okay, what's the second worst
thing it could be?

330
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,391
Two carnotaurs!

331
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:12,684
Two carnotaurs!

332
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:15,186
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
- That's it! I'm gone!

333
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:15,812
Everybody! We don't know for sure. It
could be the herd. Let's check it out.

334
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,940
Everybody! We don't know for sure. It
could be the herd. Let's check it out.

335
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:33,163
Oh, it's Bruton.

336
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:37,167
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

337
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:52,432
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs.

338
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:56,227
- Oh, we should keep moving.
- We can'tjust leave him here.

339
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,480
We can ifwe move fast enough.

340
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:03,193
Hey, uh, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

341
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:06,821
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.

342
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:10,158
- Now get away from me.
- Suit yourself.

343
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,934
Ifyou change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

344
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,821
It's dark, but at least it's dry.

345
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:52,200
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

346
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:54,619
Ouch! Sorry, Url.

347
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:57,455
Sturdy little thing, ain't he?

348
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:01,334
Ahem.
We appear to have a visitor.

349
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,406
You coming in, or what?

350
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:34,200
What is it with you?

351
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,328
At least I know enough
to get in out ofthe rain.

352
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:40,457
Now come on. On your feet.

353
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:05,732
Uh, you can lie down with us.
It's warmer.

354
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:16,493
May I remind you
that he's one ofthem?

355
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:19,954
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

356
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:31,800
Who booked this trip, anyway?

357
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,469
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

358
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:38,348
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

359
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,850
You tell him, Eema.

360
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:52,153
If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

361
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,366
Ifyou could sleep that deep, honey,
you'd be dead.

362
00:52:00,453 --> 00:52:03,623
This plant grew on our island.

363
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,335
It will make you feel better.

364
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:22,475
Why is he doing this,
pushing them on with false hope?

365
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,603
It's hope that's gotten us
this far.

366
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:29,774
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

367
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:34,571
- I've accepted mine.
- And what is your fate?

368
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:37,157
To die here.

369
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:41,953
- It's the way things are.
- Only ifyou give up, Bruton.

370
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:45,248
It's your choice, not your fate.

371
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:51,838
Well, the plant will help.

372
00:53:38,593 --> 00:53:40,470
Carnotaurs.

373
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:47,352
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

374
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:48,561
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

375
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,825
Go, go! Hurry!

376
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:48,204
Move it, Eema!

377
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:57,297
Aladar! Aladar! Oh, no!

378
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,557
I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

379
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,803
Bruton!

380
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:57,649
Bruton! No!

381
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:11,913
Bruton!

382
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,268
You did what you could.

383
00:57:35,955 --> 00:57:37,248
It's okay, little ones.

384
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:37,832
It's okay, little ones.

385
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:42,170
We're going to make it.

386
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:11,658
Okay, okay, let's do it again. Let's do
it again. Um, I spy with my little eye--

387
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:15,412
- A rock.
- You got it again! Ooh, you are good!

388
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:20,375
Well, I'll tell you what I spy--
a dead end.

389
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:30,885
- What do we do now?
- I guess wejust go back.

390
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:36,808
- Hold on a moment.
- Zini, what is it?

391
00:58:36,933 --> 00:58:40,645
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah!

392
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:56,202
- Get a load ofthat!
- Good show!

393
00:58:56,327 --> 00:58:59,622
Everybody stand back!
We're out of here!

394
00:59:06,546 --> 00:59:08,506
Run!

395
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:11,509
Aladar, look out!

396
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:20,935
No!

397
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,889
Aladar, we'll go back.

398
00:59:57,889 --> 00:59:58,473
Aladar, we'll go back.

399
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:01,601
Back to what? It's gone.

400
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:05,355
We're not meant to survive.

401
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:09,150
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

402
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,360
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

403
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,155
And how dare you waste that
good fortune by simply giving up?

404
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,990
Well, shame on you.
Shame on you, shame on you.

405
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,867
Well, shame on you.
Shame on you, shame on you.

406
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:20,412
The worst of it is...

407
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:22,288
you allowed an old fool like me to
believe I was needed...

408
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:25,417
you allowed an old fool like me to
believe I was needed...

409
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,252
that I still had a purpose.
And do you know what?

410
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:27,877
that I still had a purpose.
And do you know what?

411
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:31,631
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

412
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:35,301
And l, for one,
am not willing to die here.

413
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,937
Oh, dear.

414
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:49,042
The nesting grounds.
It's-- It's untouched.

415
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:16,152
- Our new home.
- And it comes with a pool!

416
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,454
Cannonball!

417
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:30,458
Ha. Amateur.

418
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,837
Look out below!

419
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:53,857
Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?

420
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:57,193
Not to mention Neera.

421
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:02,032
They'll get here soon enough.

422
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:09,080
- Oh, no.
- Eema?

423
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,961
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

424
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:18,631
That is the way
we used to get in here.

425
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:26,598
They'll never make it over that.

426
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:31,394
Aladar, wait, wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

427
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,272
Let him try.

428
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:39,319
I hope Kron's
in a listening mood.

429
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:59,130
Stay here.

430
01:04:04,427 --> 01:04:07,097
We'll fi nd a way around it.

431
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:10,725
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

432
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:12,787
We have to keep trying.

433
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:17,667
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

434
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:20,295
Now, let's go home!

435
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:33,683
- You'll make it, won't you, boys?
- No!

436
01:05:33,808 --> 01:05:38,229
Watch them. They're tough.
Ifthey can do it, so can you!

437
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,200
Kron!

438
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,953
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur's coming!

439
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:59,668
- Keep moving!
- Stop!

440
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:02,253
I've been to the valley.
There's a safer way.

441
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,677
- Go on, show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

442
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:12,931
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where? Straight to the carnotaurs?

443
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,685
Ifwe hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

444
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,229
There's a sheer drop
on the other side.

445
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,360
You're gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley,
and everybody can make it!

446
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,113
Now follow me!

447
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:31,825
Kron!

448
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:36,079
They're staying with me!

449
01:06:36,204 --> 01:06:39,332
All right, let's go.

450
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:35,138
Neera!

451
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:36,366
He's led that monster right to us!
This way!

452
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,744
No! Don't move!

453
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:43,915
Ifwe scatter, he'll pick us off.
Stand together.

454
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:33,274
No. No.

455
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,519
Kron.

456
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:50,620
Welcome home.

457
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,871
Welcome home.

458
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:29,534
Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

459
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:33,872
I'd say it's been a few years
since you hatched an egg.

460
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:37,375
You're right.
So let me practise on your head.

461
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,546
Look!
Somebody wants to meet you.

462
01:13:44,924 --> 01:13:51,681
Oh, aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see.

463
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:55,685
Hey, little guy.
He looksjust like me.

464
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,022
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

465
01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:03,443
Oh! Oh, happy day.

466
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:07,405
- Well done, little one.
- Come here, you little rascal.

467
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:10,533
Let me get a good look at you.

468
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:17,332
Yep, you're your father's son,
all right.

469
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:21,670
Hey, look what I found!
New neighbours!

470
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:25,465
Any ofyou ladies up for a game of,
uh, "monkey in the middle"?

471
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:28,843
Easy, now! Easy! Hey! Whoo!

472
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:23,356
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

473
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:27,902
One thing is certain--
our journey's not over.

474
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:31,865
We can only hope that
in some small way...

475
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:34,993
our time here will be remembered.
