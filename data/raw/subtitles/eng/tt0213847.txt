1
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,130
This afternoon at 5:00.

2
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,260
Il Duce will speak to the nation!

3
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,260
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,310
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,730
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,650
Mussolini will speak to

7
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,410
all Italians!

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,200
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

9
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,500
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
Il Duce will speak to the nation.

10
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,880
<i>I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.</i>

11
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,460
<i>And my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.</i>

12
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,720
<i>That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...</i>

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,760
<i>and I got my first bicycle.</i>

14
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,350
The frame is British, the gears are German,

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,350
the pedals are French,

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,440
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

17
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,860
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

18
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,610
Are you sure it's safe?

19
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,200
I have new bikes too.

20
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,830
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

21
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,250
Fighting men,

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,340
on land, on sea and in the air,

23
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,420
Black shirts of the revolution,

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,840
men and women of Italy...

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,180
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

26
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,880
The hour...

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,210
of decisions from which

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,590
there is no return.

29
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,430
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,510
Who knows?

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,520
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

32
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,640
The declaration of war...

33
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,570
has already been delivered to the ambassadors.

34
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,790
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,670
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

36
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,010
Hey, guys!

37
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,140
Lucky bastard.

38
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,270
- He got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

39
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,020
Custom-made, just like the racers.

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,980
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

41
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,200
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

42
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,030
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

43
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,280
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

44
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,460
- And you, "Don Sasa"?
- I don't want some kid poking into our business.

45
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,460
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

46
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,470
She's coming!

47
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,390
What's going on?

48
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,480
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

49
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,860
- Who is she?
- The deaf guy's daughter, our new Latin teacher.

50
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,450
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

51
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,600
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

52
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,690
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

53
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,360
What's her name?

54
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,480
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

55
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,370
The sun is bigger than the moon.

56
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,670
Or Sol maior est quam lunam.

57
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,920
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

58
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,630
Yes, but hurry.

59
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,590
I love honesty more than wealth.

60
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,470
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

61
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,680
- Mine's a bazooka!
- I got eight!

62
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,690
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

63
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,400
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

64
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,940
Torpedo!

65
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,200
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

66
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,370
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

67
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,580
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

68
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,750
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

69
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,750
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

70
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,340
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

71
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,340
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

72
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,260
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

73
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,730
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

74
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,520
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

75
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,820
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

76
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,860
and you still haven't measured yourself.

77
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,160
Measure it!

78
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,070
One, two,

79
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,410
three, four, five...

80
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,870
Only six!

81
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,750
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

82
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,710
Short pants: Short dick!

83
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,670
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

84
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,880
Bullshit!

85
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,510
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

86
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,720
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

87
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,610
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

88
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,920
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

89
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,050
What cigarettes do you want?

90
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,140
Macedonia Extra.

91
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,750
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

92
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,830
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

93
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,880
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

94
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,430
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

95
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,890
My father's still young.

96
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,260
And you're too young
for long pants.

97
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,560
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

98
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,060
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

99
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,730
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

100
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,820
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

101
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,280
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

102
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,280
- Leave him alone!
- I know what I'm doing.

103
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,410
And you let your friends beat you up.

104
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,000
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

105
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,630
But stealing trousers from your father...

106
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,010
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

107
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,510
But, Papa, you don't understand!

108
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,640
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

109
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,140
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

110
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,350
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

111
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,270
Enough!
He's still a child!

112
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,110
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

113
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,910
Let's make a deal.

114
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,290
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

115
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,340
then you'll get long pants.

116
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,710
Swear it.

117
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,120
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

118
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,250
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

119
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,340
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

120
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,470
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

121
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,180
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

122
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,310
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

123
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,980
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

124
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,980
Not me!

125
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,270
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

126
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,400
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

127
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,940
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

128
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,230
It's that pretty, romantic one...

129
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,030
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

130
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,280
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

131
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,790
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

132
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,960
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

133
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,810
<i>Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,</i>

134
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,270
<i>and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,</i>

135
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,190
<i>it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.</i>

136
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,410
<i>So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.</i>

137
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,580
<i>I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...</i>

138
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,370
<i>who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.</i>

139
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,830
<i>I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.</i>

140
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,880
<i>After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.</i>

141
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,790
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

142
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,840
So long!

143
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,630
Don't get lost!

144
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,390
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

145
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,890
Mind your own fucking business!

146
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,490
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

147
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,440
The show's over!
She's gone now!

148
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,450
I forgot the key.

149
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,680
So it's true what people say!

150
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,930
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

151
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,350
You've poisoned me with your lies.

152
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,610
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

153
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,150
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

154
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,360
But I've never done anything wrong.

155
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,490
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

156
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,870
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

157
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,210
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

158
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,870
Liar!

159
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,510
- Amoroso.
- Here!

160
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,670
- Cali.
- Here!

161
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,430
- Costanza.
- Here!

162
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,470
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

163
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,930
Can I put mine in her mouth?

164
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Can I put mine
between her legs?

165
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,810
Okay, but one at a time!

166
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,430
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

167
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,100
I'm sure no one wanted her.

168
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,030
They say she's a seamstress.

169
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,190
But she's so vulgar.

170
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,330
My son says she looks fake.

171
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,330
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

172
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,090
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

173
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,510
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

174
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,340
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

175
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,310
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

176
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,350
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

177
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,650
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

178
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,360
Our brave and invincible Fighting men
have delivered a powerful blow...

179
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,490
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

180
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,830
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

181
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,040
of our forces at the front,

182
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,760
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

183
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,730
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

184
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,440
Malena.

185
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,770
Right rank!
Eyes front!

186
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,030
Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

187
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,450
One, two! One, two!

188
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,200
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

189
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,290
Malena is available!

190
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,610
Comrades of Castelcuto,

191
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,240
we are gathered here today...

192
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,620
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

193
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,120
which has struck our town.

194
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,460
To express our deepest condolences...

195
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,420
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

196
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,420
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

197
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,800
and to his bride Maddalena,

198
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,510
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

199
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,020
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

200
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,400
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

201
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,530
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

202
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,900
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fighting men!

203
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,620
Of our fellow citizen in defense of his country was not a useless

204
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,500
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

205
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,960
A lucky girl will catch him!

206
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,510
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

207
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,770
For Victory!

208
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,810
Long live II Duce!

209
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,270
From now on I'll be at your side.

210
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,030
Forever. I promise.

211
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,410
Just give me time to grow up.

212
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,210
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

213
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,380
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

214
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,340
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

215
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,510
She knows her way
around the block!

216
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,350
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

217
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,600
One day he was distracted
as he walked by...

218
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,730
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

219
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,940
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

220
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,200
Guess she's too busy!

221
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,280
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

222
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,790
with subversive tendencies.

223
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,210
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

224
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,710
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

225
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,670
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

226
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,260
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

227
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,100
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

228
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,590
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

229
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,590
They're too intimate.

230
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,800
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

231
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,760
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

232
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:45,440
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

233
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,740
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

234
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,530
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

235
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,880
I am always at your service.

236
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,090
- Renewed condolences, Malena.
- Condolences.

237
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,770
What a piece of ass!

238
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,770
Son of a bitch!

239
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,070
You little runt!
Come back here!

240
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,090
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

241
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,330
Renato, It's late.

242
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,660
Renato, get up.

243
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,510
Monster!

244
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,760
You're a fetishist,

245
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,220
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

246
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,140
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

247
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,230
Shame on you!

248
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,650
You shameless girl Can I keep them?

249
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,030
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

250
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,870
Come here, you little pig!

251
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,200
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

252
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,750
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

253
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,420
- Answer me!
- Okay!

254
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,550
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

255
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,260
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

256
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,390
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

257
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,230
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

258
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,400
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

259
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,320
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

260
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,530
Still... What is this shit?

261
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,790
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

262
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,750
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

263
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,710
Everything they give us is terrible!

264
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,920
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

265
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,460
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

266
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,510
The thread isn't the problem!

267
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,850
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

268
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,810
What does that mean?

269
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,480
Do you get it now?

270
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,600
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

271
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,650
But he'll have no pockets.

272
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,320
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

273
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,700
Lights out!

274
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,370
...that the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor...

275
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,620
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

276
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,130
While upon womens work
you sat intent,

277
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,550
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

278
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,970
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

279
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,270
This child needs air.

280
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,480
- Air?
- Air.

281
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,010
Good morning, Professor.

282
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,190
This letter is for you.

283
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,740
It says "urgent. "

284
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
You're dishonored.
Your daughter Malena is sleeping
with the whole town.

285
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,440
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

286
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,230
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

287
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,650
So there's hope for us too!

288
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,320
Take it back!

289
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,990
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

290
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,450
Tonight was wonderful.

291
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,920
- For me too.
- I know it's been only ten months since.

292
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,880
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

293
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,340
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

294
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,050
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

295
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,730
Take care of yourself.

296
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,490
So see you tomorrow?

297
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,620
Yes.

298
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,370
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

299
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,750
What time?

300
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,630
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

301
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,010
How dare you
pester my fiancee!

302
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,310
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

303
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,470
You're a liar and a bastard!

304
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,980
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

305
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,230
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

306
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:14,490
- Coward, scoundrel!
- Get up.

307
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,660
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

308
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,910
I'll break you in two!

309
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,210
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

310
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,670
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

311
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,050
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

312
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,430
With a traitor!

313
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,100
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

314
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,220
It's the dentist.

315
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,900
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

316
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,310
And as for you,

317
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,860
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

318
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,750
We knew she had one lover, but two?

319
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,920
But where does
the dentist fit in?

320
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,380
He fits in between her legs!

321
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,470
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

322
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,470
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

323
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,850
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

324
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,350
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

325
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,770
What's the dentist
got to do with it, poor guy?

326
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,150
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

327
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,150
That Lt. Cadei seemed
like such a gentleman.

328
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,490
How could he get mixed up in this?

329
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,990
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

330
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,330
The lieutenant was asking for it!

331
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,540
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
- Will they go to court?

332
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:54,630
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

333
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:59,180
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

334
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,760
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

335
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,890
That's insulting an officer.

336
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,270
We'll all end up in court!

337
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,310
While we were
watching her caboose,

338
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,730
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

339
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,850
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

340
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,850
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

341
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,810
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

342
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,770
Can I help you?

343
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,570
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

344
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,490
Please have a seat.

345
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,830
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

346
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,870
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

347
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,380
Have her come in.

348
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,470
- Go in.
- Thank you.

349
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,470
Please sit down.

350
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,430
Charmed.

351
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:19,690
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

352
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,030
the widow Scordia called Malena.

353
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,450
She could get two years in prison.

354
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,870
Everything will be fine, trust me.

355
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,130
Sit down.

356
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,390
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

357
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,310
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

358
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,650
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

359
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,690
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

360
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,860
Yes.

361
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,860
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

362
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,410
Absolutely not.

363
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,080
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

364
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,920
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

365
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,040
on his way to your house?

366
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,250
I don't know.

367
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,550
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

368
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,440
Yes, once.

369
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,070
- Where?
- At my house.

370
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,960
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

371
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,590
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

372
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,760
What did you do?

373
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,340
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

374
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,270
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

375
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,690
I don't know.

376
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,940
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

377
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,280
He said good-bye and left.

378
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:34,620
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

379
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,580
who, five years ago...

380
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,670
had the honor of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth...

381
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,960
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

382
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:47,550
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

383
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,420
Your husband's crazy.

384
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,470
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

385
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,560
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

386
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,900
are no concern of the law.

387
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:10,570
All right.
Did you know that,

388
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,620
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

389
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,370
One down.

390
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,290
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

391
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,540
Clerk.

392
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,120
He declared to have encountered

393
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,670
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

394
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,130
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

395
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,680
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship. "

396
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,690
Son of a bitch.

397
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,860
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

398
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,530
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

399
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,240
certain feelings.

400
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,870
But unlike the married Cusimano,

401
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,000
who was, let's face it, guilty...

402
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,830
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

403
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,880
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

404
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,510
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

405
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,720
Cadei is...

406
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,930
and was...

407
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,430
a bachelor... a bachelor!

408
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
Clever, that lawyer.

409
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,650
He's a bachelor himself.

410
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:30,980
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

411
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,400
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

412
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,160
than that of being ill-fated,

413
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,080
alone and beautiful.

414
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,250
Here is her crime: Her beauty!

415
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,460
And from here, the envy,

416
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,540
the lies, the disgrace,

417
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,840
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

418
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,720
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

419
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,600
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

420
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,940
in faraway East Africa.

421
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,360
In the beating heart of our argument...

422
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,110
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

423
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,360
which asks just one question:

424
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,530
Can a young woman...

425
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:24,500
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

426
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,750
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

427
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,210
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

428
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,470
a new ending to her own love story?

429
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,260
Your Honor,

430
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,680
the citizens
of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"

431
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,360
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

432
00:57:55,530 --> 00:58:00,280
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

433
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,490
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

434
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,460
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

435
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,500
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

436
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,880
Let's get to us!

437
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,970
I know it's not much.

438
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:24,720
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

439
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,140
Don't you understand?

440
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,940
That's peanuts!

441
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,810
My fee is much more than that.

442
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,780
You'll never have enough money!

443
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,900
But how will I ever repay you?

444
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,910
It's very easy, my sweet.

445
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:47,330
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

446
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,250
I'm in love with you!

447
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,590
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

448
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,970
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

449
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,930
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

450
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,710
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

451
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,380
only once and never again.

452
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,670
But you didn't keep our agreement.

453
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,380
Now we're even.

454
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,310
<i>Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...</i>

455
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,230
<i>wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.</i>

456
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,110
<i>Now I understand why.</i>

457
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,320
<i>It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.</i>

458
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,030
<i>But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.</i>

459
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:12,740
<i>They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.</i>

460
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,910
<i>I know how badly
they treat you here,</i>

461
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,460
<i>how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...</i>

462
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,000
<i>and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.</i>

463
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:25,380
<i>But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...</i>

464
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,680
<i>so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?</i>

465
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,720
<i>They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.</i>

466
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,980
<i>How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against</i>

467
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,140
<i>the sweat of an old man...</i>

468
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:43,150
<i>who never does anything
without his mother's consent?</i>

469
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,260
Is it true you're getting married?

470
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,640
What are you writing?

471
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,770
Give me that!
Let me see!

472
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,890
Get out!

473
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,790
Stand up straight.

474
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,960
A little longer, Don Placido.

475
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:51,050
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

476
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,340
Will they be ready tomorrow?

477
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:56,180
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

478
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,600
...as Allied bombings continue.

479
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,610
Wait for me.

480
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,860
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

481
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,250
Moron! Idiot!

482
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,580
Idiot!

483
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,750
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

484
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,670
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

485
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:31,090
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

486
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,470
Never! Never!

487
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:37,760
Never!

488
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,000
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

489
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,540
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

490
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,000
Malena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

491
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:14,800
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

492
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:20,510
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

493
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,060
Yeah, his plan
is in his pants.

494
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:26,140
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

495
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,610
Good morning, Antonio.

496
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,530
I brought some sugar and flour.

497
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,900
- What about the bread?
- The best.

498
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,950
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

499
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,120
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

500
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:18,480
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

501
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,170
It's Professor Bonsignore.

502
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,470
Malena's father.

503
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,990
I'm here for you.

504
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,670
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

505
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,960
Condolences.

506
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,550
Step aside, kid.

507
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,300
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

508
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,350
Don't forget my offer.

509
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,390
- Who is it?
- It's me.

510
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,060
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

511
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,900
I brought you some more food.

512
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,400
Come in.

513
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,330
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

514
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,340
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

515
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,890
I can come every Thursday!

516
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,730
As long as you bring the food.

517
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,390
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

518
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,400
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

519
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,150
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

520
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:34,030
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

521
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,200
Look who's here.

522
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,390
She's a redhead now.

523
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:04,220
Look how she's put together.

524
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,680
I'd like to cut off that hair.

525
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:20,030
How disgusting!

526
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,520
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

527
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,270
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

528
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:21,860
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

529
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:24,740
But with the Germans?

530
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:28,370
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

531
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,660
The two whores run
from room to room...

532
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,540
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

533
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,500
Holy shit!

534
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,160
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

535
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,500
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

536
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,510
Rosa!

537
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,430
Come here!

538
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,640
That's enough!

539
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:35,930
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

540
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,310
No.

541
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:41,150
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

542
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:44,610
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

543
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,530
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

544
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,200
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

545
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,740
Cast the devil into the wild.

546
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,410
Shameful!

547
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,120
Disgraceful!

548
01:18:58,210 --> 01:19:03,210
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

549
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,090
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

550
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:09,380
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

551
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,810
Renato!

552
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,280
Renato, wait here for me.

553
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:38,580
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

554
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,120
- My father?
- He's coming.

555
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,920
Ladies!

556
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,840
Choose the one you like.

557
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,010
Ladies!

558
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,970
What do we have here?

559
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,050
Fresh young meat.

560
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:01,710
Lupetta, up to the room.

561
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,500
Treat him right.

562
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,100
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

563
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,140
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

564
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:23,810
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

565
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,690
Go ahead.

566
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:17,010
- Is it your first time?
- No.

567
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,760
I've imagined it many times.

568
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:45,930
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

569
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,900
Stay back.
This is between the women.

570
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,990
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

571
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,580
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

572
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:43,250
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

573
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:02,320
Now let's see
what men make of you!

574
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,990
The madame is served.

575
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:21,600
Get lost!

576
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,610
Disappear!

577
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,720
- I know that face.
- Who is it?

578
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,890
Nino Scordia,
Malena's husband.

579
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,310
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

580
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,490
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

581
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:48,620
Isn't that Malena's husband?

582
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,030
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

583
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:29,950
Do you know Malena Scordia?

584
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,910
Who's she?

585
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,540
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

586
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,460
We don't know anything.

587
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,250
When we came,
no one was living here.

588
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,920
No one?

589
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:59,070
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

590
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:03,070
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

591
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:06,820
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

592
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:10,410
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

593
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:14,910
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

594
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,580
Sir, he lost his arm...

595
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,000
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

596
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:21,880
Me "boy-bar. " Coffee.

597
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:25,930
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

598
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,090
Okay, okay.

599
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:31,140
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

600
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:33,480
Now no one will talk to me.

601
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,020
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

602
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,100
No one in town knows
where she is.

603
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,110
His wife was the woman

604
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,860
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

605
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:47,820
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

606
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:50,200
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

607
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:18,060
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

608
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:22,020
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

609
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:26,440
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

610
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,410
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

611
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:30,870
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

612
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:36,620
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

613
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,880
You're a family of heroes!

614
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,550
You're right.

615
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:50,180
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

616
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,640
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

617
01:35:54,810 --> 01:35:58,390
You may find your wife there!

618
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:02,870
Wait a minute. Come back!

619
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,720
<i>Dear Signor Scordia,</i>

620
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,720
<i>forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.</i>

621
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:20,060
<i>These last months have
taught me much about courage,
even if I have found little myself.</i>

622
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:23,190
<i>I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.</i>

623
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:27,650
<i>Around here, they only say
bad things about her.</i>

624
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:31,860
<i>But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.</i>

625
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:35,780
<i>You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.</i>

626
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,740
<i>It is true,
a lot of things happened,</i>

627
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:42,160
<i>but back then,
you had been dead along time.</i>

628
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:47,210
<i>The last time I saw her, she was
on a train for Messina.</i>

629
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,670
<i>I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,</i>

630
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,720
<i>but my name is Renato.</i>

631
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:35,930
Good morning, Judge.

632
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:39,390
All is well, thank God.

633
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:42,970
Eat up, my sweet pea.

634
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:58,660
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

635
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,370
Giorgio, look who's here!

636
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,890
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

637
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:07,520
It's nothing.

638
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:38,510
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

639
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:40,630
Quiet. She's here!

640
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:45,180
It took a lot of courage to come back.

641
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:47,640
Look who's here.

642
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,810
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

643
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,810
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

644
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:00,320
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

645
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,070
She's put on weight, too.

646
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,530
But she's still beautiful.

647
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,040
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

648
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,390
Good morning.

649
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,730
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

650
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:34,230
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

651
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,320
Nice things here!

652
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:43,070
- Like it, Signora Malena?
- Yes.

653
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:45,620
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

654
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,740
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

655
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:52,080
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

656
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:55,040
- Thank you.
- Good day.

657
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,640
It's okay. I'll get it.

658
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,730
Thank you.

659
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,030
Thank you for your help.

660
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:15,410
Good luck, Signora Malena.

661
01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:49,110
<i>I pedaled as fast as I could</i>

662
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,370
<i>as if I were escaping...</i>

663
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:54,540
<i>from longing,
from innocence, from her.</i>

664
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:57,120
<i>Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.</i>

665
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,290
<i>And as they've held me close...</i>

666
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:04,920
<i>and asked if I will
remember them,</i>

667
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:10,260
<i>I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you. "</i>

668
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:14,310
<i>But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...</i>

669
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:15,600
<i>Malena.</i>
