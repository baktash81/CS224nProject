1
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,331
Fast bike, huh?

2
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,699
Yeah, sometimes.

3
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,945
Want me to fill it up?

4
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,741
I'm not here for the gas.

5
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,514
You can keep an eye on it for me.

6
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:49,181
Leave it on the road, guys.

7
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,713
That stunt almost cost me my ride, boy.

8
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:57,218
- You were in my way. I was in a hurry.
- Well, now you'll be late.

9
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:01,219
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass
off my car.

10
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,866
What is it about driving cars
that makes you all such assholes?

11
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,733
Can you do something
about these dirty windows?

12
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,233
Five bucks.

13
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,065
Make it 10.

14
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:49,104
Thanks.

15
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,238
Buckle up.

16
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,392
Well. It didn't take long
for you to find trouble.

17
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:08,161
Step up. I'm running
a two-for-one special today.

18
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,293
Special, huh?

19
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,430
Can I get fries with that?
Because I'm hungry as hell.

20
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,471
- What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you, man.

21
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,237
- Wish I could say the same for you.
- Welcome home.

22
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:27,280
Thanks, man.
Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

23
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:33,445
Dude's gone six months in Thailand without
a word and now he's busting our chops.

24
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,023
Since when did you get so sensitive?

25
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,784
I got a rally to get to.

26
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,825
You must be in a hurry to die.

27
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,796
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be
as happy to see you as we are.

28
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:47,663
- You were on the run. Why you back now?
- I gotta make things right.

29
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,304
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

30
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:56,673
- And here I thought it was all about us.
- Look...

31
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:00,873
...this is my mess, not yours.
You don't have to make this run.

32
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:04,510
- We can't let you have all the fun.
- You're gonna need us.

33
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,387
Yes, I am.

34
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,356
Still know how to ride that thing?

35
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,995
We'll have to race
the twisties to find out.

36
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,925
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

37
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,935
I don't want to miss that look
on your face when I blow past you.

38
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,101
What the...?

39
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:48,708
- We got company.
- Out of my way, punk!

40
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,484
What's his problem?

41
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,393
I got him!

42
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,565
- Your ass is mine.
- Let's go, punk.

43
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,170
Come on, what you got?

44
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:12,136
- You like that?
- Bring that piece of shit on.

45
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:36,526
I'm burning, I'm burning.

46
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,769
- Relax!
- You should've let him burn!

47
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,304
He could've killed us!

48
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:49,774
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet.
Move out of the way.

49
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,778
Let's see if this guy fights
as bad as he rides.

50
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:55,612
- Walk away.
- You got loud pipes...

51
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,844
...but you ain't saying nothing!

52
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,885
You ain't gonna like how this ends.

53
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,203
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

54
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,587
What's up, J? Drop something?

55
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,057
Just taking care of some business, T.

56
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:46,999
Ford. I heard you was up in Indochina
eating sushi and shit.

57
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:52,833
- I thought sushi came from Japan.
- I know where sushi come from, nigga.

58
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,842
I ain't even talking to you.

59
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,675
You know I could smash you right now.

60
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,911
You and your little tricycle friends.

61
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,080
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

62
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,489
Consider it a welcome-home present.

63
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:18,098
Under one condition. Somebody gonna
give my brother a new bike.

64
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,202
- I want his bike.
- I ain't giving you shit.

65
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,002
There's only one way
you're getting one of these bikes.

66
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,711
I know you been gone a long time, Ford.

67
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,152
But not long enough to forget
who run things around here.

68
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:46,255
I hate to see you end up as Dojo's dinner.

69
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,820
Trey. One-time.

70
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:55,468
Probably not a good time
to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

71
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:59,039
Get that bike from you later.

72
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,647
Hey, officer, how's it going?

73
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:08,976
Beautiful day today.

74
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:55,526
- What are you waiting for?
- What you think?

75
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,632
Go show these boys how to ride.

76
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,792
- How about a ride?
- This thing might be too much for you.

77
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,871
- We'll never know till I'm on it.
- All right, you too.

78
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,031
It's not that I don't enjoy your company.

79
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,138
Just be gentle with him.

80
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:16,446
- Nice bike.
- Nice ass.

81
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:18,911
Got a name?

82
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,919
Yeah.

83
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,333
Ford. What's he doing here?

84
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,774
<i>Forecast for today:
Sun, sun and more sun.</i>

85
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,442
<i>Highs 94 to 103.
Don't forget your sunscreen, folks.</i>

86
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,084
<i>Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour,
with locally higher gusts.</i>

87
00:13:06,835 --> 00:13:08,803
Be with you in a second.

88
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,965
Looking for something in particular?

89
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,677
Yeah, you got one of them seats in a pink
Naugahyde? Maybe with a little gold fringe?

90
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,483
You never were funny, Ford.

91
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,620
Oh, come on, you used to think
I was funny.

92
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,653
Maybe you lost your sense of humor.

93
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,790
I think I have a pretty good sense of humor.

94
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,360
Like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop...

95
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,658
...waving warrants, telling me
my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

96
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,064
That was funny.
I laughed my ass off for weeks.

97
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:43,466
I wrote you letters.

98
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,836
- I made fires.
- I tried to call.

99
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,672
Yeah, but my phone was tapped
for six months. That was fun too.

100
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,439
- Can I explain?
- Let me guess.

101
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:58,382
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me,
you were trying to protect me...

102
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:01,580
...and it wasn't your fault.
- It was my fault.

103
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,520
- We're closed.
- The sign said...

104
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,526
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

105
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,164
You too, Ford.

106
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,138
You don't know how many times I've played
this out in my head in the last six months.

107
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,066
Must be frustrating.

108
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,338
You got balls even coming here.

109
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:32,419
The feds and the Hellions are after you
and Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

110
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:33,816
Yeah.

111
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:38,589
Well, that's because I did.

112
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,192
- Ford?
- Yeah?

113
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,864
- Go now, please, before l...
- Before what?

114
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:14,284
And to think we almost decided
to go to the beach this weekend.

115
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,921
Lucky for me, Luther hates to swim.

116
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,901
Henry.

117
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,209
I don't know why
you're buying a new seat, Ford.

118
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,005
Looks like you haven't
broken in your old one yet.

119
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,479
Looks like Ford prefers to ride bitch to me.

120
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,245
It looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself, Henry.

121
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,450
Share one with your friends long enough
and you're liable to catch something.

122
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,273
Heard you were in Indochina.

123
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,973
Some shit like that.

124
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,645
- Good food there?
- Thailand, actually...

125
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,381
...but the food was great.
Thanks for asking.

126
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,821
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

127
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,357
Tell me...

128
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,691
...you got a punch line for this:

129
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,960
Where are my goddamn bikes?

130
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,236
You really want them...

131
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:32,731
...or what's inside them?

132
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,643
Where are they?

133
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:44,317
- Why don't you just cut it out of him.
- No, he won't.

134
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,814
He's too smart for that.

135
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,051
Because he knows if he touches me
he'll never get his shit back.

136
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:54,092
Then again...

137
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,521
...l'm not that smart.

138
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:58,495
Shane.

139
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,442
You've got till sundown
to hand over my bikes.

140
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:43,434
- Your brother said we had a deal.
- Junior don't do the deals around here, I do.

141
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:49,676
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make deals,
he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

142
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:54,879
That's funny, because I was
thinking the same thing.

143
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,220
I didn't come here to watch you
pet your dog, primate.

144
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:04,092
<i>I didn't invite your Dukes of Hazzard ass.</i>

145
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:08,498
So you can raise up whenever you feel it.
The answer is no.

146
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,568
You're not slinging your dope on my streets.

147
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,968
Hand me that bottle.

148
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,942
Look...

149
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:22,981
...l'm not some dimebag street punk.

150
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,982
I'm a businessman.

151
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,791
And I'm telling you to make this right.

152
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,085
I wouldn't give a shit
if you was Don Corleone himself.

153
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,928
The answer is still no.

154
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:38,797
So get out of my face.

155
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,705
What the hell was you looking at?

156
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,642
I love you.

157
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:57,543
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you
would've been down with that shit.

158
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,516
You could've made a killing.

159
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:03,715
First you gonna act a fool
up there on the road, now this?

160
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,382
What's wrong with you?

161
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,155
You messing with
my goddamn good nature, boy.

162
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:12,960
Go get me a beer, man.
You messing up my buzz.

163
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,995
Get me a Diet Pepsi. Don't slam my door.

164
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,697
You better count to 10!

165
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:24,136
- I'm gonna whup his ass.
- Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

166
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:26,542
Dojo got more sense than that boy.

167
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,687
Henry, looks like
you're the one riding bitch.

168
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:59,270
Looks like your engine
could use a little work.

169
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:03,108
What part of "I don't love you
anymore, you're a bastard...

170
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,413
...and I never wanna see you again"
didn't you understand?

171
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:10,824
How about the part that stops you
from driving off right now?

172
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,312
Thirsty?

173
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,433
All right, one beer. But you're buying.

174
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:17,684
- What up, Junior? You all right?
- No, I'm definitely not all right, man. Move!

175
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:43,341
Watch out, white boy.

176
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:46,043
- Call it an accident?
- How about I kick your ass?

177
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,621
No, I prefer we still call it an accident.

178
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:52,652
- How about now?
- Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

179
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,729
- Junior! Junior!
- I'm gonna kill you!

180
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,956
Come on, chill!

181
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,089
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always
got to show your ass, man, huh?

182
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,728
Why you can't come here
and play your position?

183
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,557
Look at me, boy.

184
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:33,360
I love you. You're my brother,
but you better stop embarrassing me.

185
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,935
Stop acting so damn crazy.

186
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,096
And I got your back for life.

187
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,973
Well, if you got my back, then show me,
blood, on everything!

188
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:48,377
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't
got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

189
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,780
Watch out. Get out of my way, man.

190
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:55,184
Dawson's Creek almost beat
your brother's ass, blood.

191
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:58,326
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

192
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,894
- What're we gonna do about Ford?
- Junior just solved our problem.

193
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:05,499
- Why don't we just grab him right now?
- No, not now.

194
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:09,068
I got a better idea. Get the boys.

195
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:13,901
What is it with you, Ford?
Everywhere you go, everything turns to hell.

196
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,566
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

197
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,312
Go powder your nose, China.

198
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,594
Let's have some fun.

199
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:52,706
- That's him. Get him.
- There he is.

200
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:04,681
We'd like to thank the Hellions for
messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

201
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:07,084
He ain't going anywhere.

202
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,628
- Here he comes.
- There he goes. Get him!

203
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,925
See you, Junior.

204
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,818
Hey, what's up, man?

205
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,521
Hey. What's up?

206
00:24:43,698 --> 00:24:45,757
Hey, dude.

207
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,397
Damn!

208
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:59,077
You screwed me, Junior.

209
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:04,584
I assume you're apologizing
for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

210
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:11,147
I made promises based on your black ass.

211
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,299
And now I've got a problem.

212
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,370
- But you're gonna help me out of it.
- Yo, dog.

213
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:32,009
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey.
We could work this out, man.

214
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,671
I could make this happen, all right?

215
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:38,112
Time's up.

216
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,099
You know what to do, baby?

217
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,464
There's this one road that winds up
the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

218
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:04,006
It's got mountains on one side,
ocean on the other...

219
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,081
...so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it.

220
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,481
I tell you, the last six months, every time
I took that drive I thought about you.

221
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,751
Did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to Thailand?

222
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,229
You got to the bottom of this beer.
Explain away.

223
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,862
All right.

224
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:33,372
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't
like him, but he was a paying customer.

225
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,442
I fixed his chopper a couple times.

226
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:51,558
Six months ago, he turns up at your shop...

227
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:55,287
...with these two bikes.
He asked me if I'd mind looking after them.

228
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:57,055
I figure,
what the hell, right?

229
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,323
So I do.

230
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:04,734
Then I go to move them, they don't start.
So I check the tanks.

231
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,772
They're filled with kilos of crystal meth.

232
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,408
So first thing, I get them out of there.

233
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:14,947
So that's why that fed McPherson
raided my shop after you split.

234
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:19,119
And you dropped off
the face of the Earth.

235
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,417
I took off...

236
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,624
...so that you wouldn't get dragged into it.

237
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,357
I split.

238
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,529
Now I'm the only one involved with Henry.

239
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:37,398
So you left to protect me?

240
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,808
What'd you think, you were gonna just
come back and explain everything...

241
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:47,038
...and then we'd just ride off
into the sunset together?

242
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,689
More or less.

243
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:06,599
Well, which is it? More or less?

244
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:11,799
Well, I was actually thinking Mexico.

245
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,533
- You're killing me.
- Get your gear on.

246
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:42,363
- Not a good time.
- Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

247
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,095
- Damn, really?
- Yeah.

248
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:51,470
- Give me 10 minutes, all right?
- Come on.

249
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,245
Move.

250
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:59,110
Move, man! Move!

251
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,821
Damn!

252
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,259
Wait. That's my brother, man.

253
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:06,984
It's all right.

254
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,231
Oh, no. No, man.
I'm taking him with me.

255
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,300
You can't do that, son.

256
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,070
Now, we're gonna find out who done this.

257
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:24,676
If you have any ideas who would
want to kill your brother...

258
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,179
If I knew who did this,
you'd have two dead bodies right now.

259
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,648
We got a witness.
Says she saw the whole thing.

260
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:35,016
A white male, mid-20s,
rode a custom motorcycle.

261
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,784
- Wore black and orange leathers.
- Black and orange leathers?

262
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,861
Hey, you know somebody
who fits that description?

263
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,431
Not anymore.

264
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:49,164
Let's go!

265
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:07,514
FBI. Agent McPherson,
federal gang task force.

266
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:11,489
Sheriff Barnes.
You don't look like your typical fed.

267
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:16,323
What'd you expect? A cheap suit,
late-model Taurus, a $ 10 haircut?

268
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,059
How'd y'all get here so fast?

269
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,361
Get this many motorheads
in one place, all wearing colors...

270
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,062
...something's bound to happen.
Pays to be close.

271
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,537
Oh, this is Agent Henderson.

272
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,736
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's one of the best field operatives.

273
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,371
Excuse me, I have to take this.

274
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:40,311
Yeah. Hi, baby.
I'm at a crime scene right now.

275
00:30:40,488 --> 00:30:42,752
- It's a typical homicide.
- Typical homicide?

276
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,791
Maybe you can explain to me
what a typical homicide is.

277
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,191
All right, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I promise.

278
00:30:49,363 --> 00:30:51,058
- I've got an eyewitness.
- You do?

279
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,462
- Yeah.
- You've practically got this solved.

280
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,432
I love you too. Jesus Christ.

281
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,539
We've got the murder weapon
and she saw the whole thing.

282
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:02,175
Congratulations.

283
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:06,905
I don't care if we have to comb
every inch of California.

284
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:12,485
I want that boy Ford, and I want
his head in Dojo's bowl by midnight.

285
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:16,089
- Amen?
- Amen.

286
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,522
Come on, boy.

287
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,948
Motel policy for cash customers.

288
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,518
Jay.

289
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,846
- Got him.
- Son of a bitch.

290
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:51,583
- I tried to pop Ford six months ago.
- He's cute.

291
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,956
You can visit him in prison. Map.

292
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:59,124
That's why you broke, you eat too much.

293
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,369
- I got it.
- That's okay.

294
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,704
What were you planning on paying with,
your good looks or your smile?

295
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:16,648
I love a girl who can
take care of herself, man.

296
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,945
I would've come back too.

297
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,615
If you boys will excuse me.

298
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,621
It seems like I'm overdue
for some paint and bodywork myself.

299
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:33,090
So, what are you gonna do about Henry?
We got a plan, right?

300
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:38,535
Yeah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna tell
Henry where he can pick up his shit.

301
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,705
Of course...

302
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:47,373
...l'm also gonna call that punk
McPherson and tell him.

303
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,709
Arrange a get-together with the evidence.

304
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,444
That way everybody gets
what they deserve, right?

305
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,316
Henry gets his shit,
McPherson gets Henry...

306
00:32:55,489 --> 00:32:57,980
...and we all go to Mexico and get drunk.

307
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:04,197
<i>As I reported earlier, Wallace, a member
of an Inglewood motorcycle gang...</i>

308
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:08,358
<i>... the Reapers, was brutally murdered
last night with a motorcycle chain.</i>

309
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:12,028
<i>With the help of an eyewitness,
the FBI has come up with a suspect:</i>

310
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,004
<i>Cary Ford, a white male
in his late 20s.</i>

311
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,974
<i>Ford was last seen riding
a black custom motorcycle...</i>

312
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:20,409
<i>... wearing orange and black
racing leathers.</i>

313
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,141
<i>If you have any idea
as to his whereabouts...</i>

314
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:26,146
<i>... please contact the local authorities.</i>

315
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,416
<i>Cary Ford is now the prime suspect
in the murder of Junior Wallace.</i>

316
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:33,984
Call the sheriff, Hal.

317
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:36,686
Ford was just spotted at Lone Pine.

318
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:38,965
Let's drive a little.

319
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,406
Yeah.

320
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:54,104
<i>Heard on the scanner
they spotted the white boy.</i>

321
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,013
<i>- Dawson's Creek, the white boy.
- All right, get me a map.</i>

322
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:02,284
We gotta make up some time.

323
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,994
<i>- Yeah?
- Give me Ford.</i>

324
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,026
Ford. It's for you.

325
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,636
<i>- Ford.
- Change in plans.</i>

326
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,706
Seems your buddy Junior's dead.

327
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,170
<i>Feds think you did it.</i>

328
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,074
Reapers think you did it.
Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

329
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:01,908
<i>You tell me where my stuff is
and it all goes away.</i>

330
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:03,944
I don't take orders, Henry.

331
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:06,211
- Never have, never will.
- What's that?

332
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,117
Ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold?

333
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,021
You spent too much time in Chink Land,
Ford. What does that mean?

334
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,721
It means I don't wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan.

335
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,455
<i>And by the way, Henry...</i>

336
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:22,500
..."Chink Land" implies China.
I was in Thailand, it's a different country.

337
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,501
Hey, my phone!

338
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,001
Hold it right there.

339
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,476
Everybody down on the ground!

340
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:36,673
Quit shooting!

341
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,413
You got the wrong guy.

342
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,111
We'll let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here.

343
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:44,052
- Are you okay?
- I got it under control!

344
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,915
I didn't kill anybody.

345
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,092
Shit!

346
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,195
You Earl?

347
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:57,368
Loved your French toast.

348
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,771
- Down.
- Like I said...

349
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:05,002
...I love a girl who can take care of herself.
- Thanks.

350
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:08,376
You're on the news.
That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

351
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:12,417
- Henry set me up. He wants his drugs back.
- Why don't you give them back.

352
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:15,783
- It's the only insurance I got.
- You were with me last night.

353
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,856
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

354
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,754
Tell the cops.

355
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,919
Right now it ain't the cops
that I'm worried about.

356
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,359
Not good.

357
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:26,329
- Reapers!
- He's right, Shane.

358
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,094
You think we could finish
this conversation later?

359
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,969
All right. Once we're in the clear,
you call the cops. Agreed?

360
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,409
What should I do with this?

361
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:41,344
Forget what I said about liking women
who can take care of themselves.

362
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:46,614
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy.
You'll be safer here than running with us.

363
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,449
- See you back in L.A.
- What am I supposed to do?

364
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:51,591
Hang out with Earl?

365
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,134
Which way?

366
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,506
Which way did you say, old man?

367
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:20,119
- Which way?
- Shortcut!

368
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:27,289
Let's catch them,
kill them and bury them!

369
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:34,230
They're still on us!
Shit! There's more of them!

370
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,926
- What are we gonna do, Ford?
- Where we going?

371
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:39,367
I'm working on it!

372
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,798
Which way did they go?

373
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,705
Damn! Come on!

374
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:45,302
Now can we call the cops?

375
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,269
- No.
- Why not?

376
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:49,909
Because it's not just the cops,
it's McPherson.

377
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:51,910
McPherson?

378
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,842
The guy that tore up your shop.

379
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:56,081
He already thinks I'm a drug dealer.

380
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,016
Now he thinks I shot Junior.
And he has no reason to think otherwise...

381
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:03,554
...unless I can prove it.
- Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

382
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,885
This just keeps getting
better and better.

383
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,024
I got a spare in my toolkit.

384
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,190
He was strangled, by the way.

385
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,933
- Who?
- Junior. He was strangled with a bike chain.

386
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,704
Shit.

387
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,543
Henry used the chain off his own bike.

388
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,906
- How do you know that?
- How do you know?

389
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,176
Yeah, how did you know that?

390
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:33,715
Well, it's...

391
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,611
It's complicated.

392
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:40,626
- You turning left, or we going to Oregon?
- It's right.

393
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,091
It's right? What...?

394
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:45,460
Get the finger out of my face.
I know where I'm going.

395
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:50,833
Henry just screwed himself.

396
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,565
- See those scratches and nicks?
- Yeah.

397
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,141
Well, it picks them up
from the sprocket.

398
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,336
Now, no two bikes
got the same chain-wear pattern...

399
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:02,209
...because no two sprockets
are the same.

400
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,584
So we match the chain
used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

401
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,780
...and we got him.

402
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:12,515
Like a fingerprint.

403
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,355
Try not to move your lips
so much when you think.

404
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:19,527
Now we call the cops, right?

405
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,466
Now we call the cops.

406
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,870
- Real cute, guys.
- Get a room.

407
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,345
<i>- McPherson, it's F...
- Ford. Looks like you're trading up.</i>

408
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,184
Going from drug trafficking
to first-degree murder.

409
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,883
<i>- I was set up.
- In my business I hear that a lot.</i>

410
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:49,621
- Loud. Recorder's on.
- Who wants to set you up?

411
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:51,697
Henry James.

412
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,399
Leader of the Hellions.
Now, why would he wanna do that?

413
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:58,231
Those drugs you were looking for
belong to Henry.

414
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:02,239
I stashed them the night before you
raided the shop. He wants them back.

415
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:05,867
Tell me where the drugs are,
I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

416
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:10,346
- Maybe we can work something out.
- "Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

417
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:13,850
...then I'll take you to the drugs.
- Arrest him? On what grounds?

418
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:15,416
First-degree murder.

419
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:18,757
- What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry?
- Big "if."

420
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:20,484
Arrest him.

421
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,389
- Get his bike, I'll show you.
- Get his bike. Okay.

422
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,398
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest?
Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher...?

423
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,696
- Hold on, I'm making a list.
- You're not listening to me.

424
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,271
- Henry killed Junior.
- I don't know that.

425
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,431
Then you can't help me!

426
00:41:46,186 --> 00:41:48,017
Well, that didn't fly.

427
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:51,316
Screw it. Let's haul ass down
to Mexico and don't look back.

428
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,892
As much as I hate to say it,
I agree with him.

429
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:58,562
- We're going to L.A.
- Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

430
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:01,462
I have to get Henry's bike.
That will clear me.

431
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:05,366
They'll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast.

432
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,201
We're not exactly hard
to spot driving these.

433
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:12,607
- You wanna ditch the bikes?
- No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

434
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:17,281
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy, right?

435
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,750
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

436
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:25,689
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

437
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:43,232
Po-po got the highways
blocked from here to L.A.

438
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,900
L.A.?

439
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:48,445
Why would he go to the one place
he know I got on lockdown?

440
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:51,948
- Let's catch him on the interstate.
- No, he's smarter than that.

441
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,609
He trying to backdoor us.

442
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,678
He going through the Palms.

443
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,121
That's the way I'd go.
And that's the way we going.
