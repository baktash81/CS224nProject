- No, but-

for a dancing tortoise...

is up to the challenge.

Well-

I hate dirt, and I heard
from a friend who went camping...

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,448
that mountains are very dirty.

243
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,644
I heard that too.
You're not able to vacuum up there.

244
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:47,348
And if you could, under the dirt
there'd just be more dirt.

a little more logical.

you said last night...

- Okay, Dad.
- Because we'd win.

- That's enough!
- What?

943
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:43,813

- Isn't that why we're here?
