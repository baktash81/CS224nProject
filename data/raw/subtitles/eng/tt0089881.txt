1
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,832
The arrowwhich felled the boar

2
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,117
belonged to Lord lchimonji.

3
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,070
Drink to him!

4
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,037
The wily old beast

5
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,238
shot out right in front of me.

6
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,719
My horse reared.

7
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,633
Before I could aim, off I fell.

8
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,309
Father?.

9
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,673
Shall we roast the boar here?.

10
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,950
He was old.

11
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,395
His hide is tough, it stinks.

12
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,959
Indigestible.

13
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,948
Like me, old Hidetora...

14
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,349
Would you eat me?.

15
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,030
You'd stick in our throats.

16
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,792
That's why I joined the hunt,

17
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,758
to reinforce our friendship.

18
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,035
I, too!

19
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,829
I would cement the bonds between
the houses of lchimonji and Ayabe

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,313
by marrying my daughter
to your son Saburo.

21
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,435
Hold on!

22
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,355
That's my own intention.

23
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,754
Lord lchimonji,
the day is propitious.

24
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,956
Give us your answer.

25
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,669
Whom will you have for Saburo,

26
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,310
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?.

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,918
Not an easy choice.

28
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,113
Two daughters

29
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,118
for one son.

30
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,749
A pity Jiro, my second son,
already has a wife.

31
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,829
Kyoami!

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,879
Entertain us!

33
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,629
From the far mountain

34
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,632
From the near mountain

35
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,630
Who comes hippety-hopping

36
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,270
Showing off his handsome ears?.

37
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,589
A hare!.

38
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,633
Only one hare, Kyoami?.

39
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,995
Two, I think.

40
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,072
Hopping here

41
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,708
to be eaten by Father.

42
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,151
Saburo, that's rude!

43
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,149
Hold your tongue!

44
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,236
The Great Lord is tired.

45
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,519
Let us withdraw until he awakes.

46
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,392
This is unlike Father.

47
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,032
He only pretends to sleep.

48
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,838
After Saburo's insult,

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,309
how else could he save face?.

50
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,117
All he did was hunt.

51
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,713
In the old days

52
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,316
he'd rout an army
and not be winded.

53
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,069
It's impolite to our guests.

54
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,790
Kyoami, wake him!

55
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,235
Father worries me.

56
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,030
He's barely snoring today.

57
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,276
Father, what is it?.

58
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,350
Are you ill?.

59
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,555
Father...

60
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,108
A dream.

61
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,471
I had a dream.

62
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,151
I was in a strange land.

63
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,592
A vast wilderness.

64
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,759
I went on and on,
but met no one.

65
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,671
I called, I shouted,

66
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,672
but no one answered.

67
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,039
I was alone.

68
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,679
Alone in the wide world.

69
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,434
I felt a chill...

70
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,873
Such stupidity!

71
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,797
Taro's voice pulled me back.

72
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,871
I saw my beloved children.

73
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,832
Taro...

74
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,748
Jiro...

75
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,193
and Saburo.

76
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,350
Father,
I've never seen you like this.

77
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,748
It's not right.

78
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,079
Quiet, Saburo!

79
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,118
Be thankful
we have his affection.

80
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,039
I'm puzzled, too.

81
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,033
I can scarcely believe my ears.

82
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,030
Normally all he asks
is our obedience.

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,311
That's affection enough.

84
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,595
All right.

85
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,516
I've been considering an idea

86
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,560
and I've reached a decision.

87
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,154
I want to tell it to you.

88
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,589
Now is a good time to do it,

89
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,754
while Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe
are with us.

90
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,268
Bring them!

91
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,074
I, Hidetora lchimonji,

92
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,156
was born in that small castle
in the mountains.

93
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,759
At that time, this entire plain
seethed with constant battle.

94
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,797
Many lords vied for power.

95
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,077
At the age of seventeen,

96
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,273
I flew my banner
over that castle.

97
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,238
I waged war for 50 years

98
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,673
and at last the plain was mine.

99
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,558
I hoisted my colours
over the main castle.

100
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,112
I spent more years

101
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,871
fighting lance to lance
with these two gentlemen.

102
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,038
Now the moment has come

103
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,194
to stable the steeds of war
and give free rein to peace.

104
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,633
But old Hidetora

105
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,995
is seventy years old.

106
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,310
I hereby cede total authority

107
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,913
over all my dominions
to my eldest son T aro.

108
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,229
My Lord, this is so sudden!

109
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,635
Not at all.
I've thought long and hard.

110
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,157
There comes a time

111
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,313
to step aside

112
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,873
and pass on the reins
to younger hands.

113
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,038
I say to you: that time is now!

114
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,270
This is my will.

115
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,033
Taro is now head of the lchimonji,

116
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,952
Lord of these lands.

117
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,239
I will quit the castle keep

118
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,391
and move to the outer tower.

119
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,233
I will retain a 30-man escort

120
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,029
and the title and insignia
of Great Lord.

121
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,037
But the actual leadership
lies entirely with T aro.

122
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,552
I expect all of you to obey.

123
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,594
I'll obey.

124
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,393
But what about me and Saburo?.

125
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,074
What do you intend for us?.

126
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,756
I give you, Jiro and Saburo,

127
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,316
the second and third castles

128
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,516
with their attendant lands.

129
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,750
You will support Taro

130
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,115
in the first castle.

131
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,838
I shall be your guest,

132
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,918
visiting each castle in turn,

133
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,556
Iiving out my remaining years.

134
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,871
How hard... to be old!

135
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,513
I would speak.

136
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,751
I respect your wishes

137
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,036
and appreciate your trust

138
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,270
but I beg you to reconsider.

139
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,668
Why?.

140
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,158
Though I am your eldest,

141
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,788
I could never take your place.

142
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,678
It is too great a task.

143
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,394
I always pray to the God of War,

144
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,551
"Let his life last 1 00 years,

145
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,473
"even if it means
shaving a bit off mine."

146
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,156
What a pretty speech.

147
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,470
I cannot use such honeyed words.

148
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,679
I'd be embarrassed.

149
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,234
Don't be spiteful.

150
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,437
You mean that Taro

151
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,909
only flatters me?.

152
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,077
Pay no attention to Saburo.

153
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,638
I feel the same as Taro.

154
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,870
We'd like nothing better

155
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,838
than to stay behind your shield.

156
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,034
But it's our turn to shield you

157
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,590
from life's bitter arrows.

158
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,553
Well said, Jiro.

159
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,350
Bring me that quiver!

160
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,708
Break an arrow in two.

161
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,999
Can you do it?.

162
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,515
Bundle them...

163
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,236
and try again.

164
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,594
A single arrow is easily broken.

165
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,194
Not so three together.

166
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,473
Whenever Taro is in trouble

167
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,154
if you unite your forces

168
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,073
the house of lchimonji will be safe.

169
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,592
Even in a sheaf,
three arrows can be broken.

170
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,068
More of your pranks!

171
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,469
Stop being foolish.

172
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,955
It's you who are foolish.

173
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,553
Your plan is absurd.

174
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,878
You are either senile or mad.

175
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,916
Silence!

176
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,391
Do not insult your father.

177
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,190
What madness have I spoken?.

178
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,989
Wherein lies my senility?.

179
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,149
I'll tell you.

180
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,957
What kind of world do we live in?.

181
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,557
One barren of loyalty and feeling.

182
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,388
- I'm aware of that!
- So you should be!

183
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,359
You spilled merciless blood.

184
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,670
You showed no mercy, no pity.

185
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,516
We too are children of this age,
weaned on strife and chaos.

186
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,916
We are your sons,
yet you count on our fidelity?.

187
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,231
In my eyes, that makes you a fool.

188
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,839
A senile old fool!

189
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,069
So that's it!

190
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,357
You mean that one day

191
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,149
you'll forget I'm your father
and betray me?.

192
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,117
More folly!

193
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,157
Does a traitor betray himself?.

194
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,356
Then you mean your brothers?.

195
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,559
He's jealous of Taro's position.

196
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,513
Is that why you slander me?.

197
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,591
Brother or not, watch your step!

198
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,673
Your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted.

199
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,559
The unity of the three sons
is split.

200
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,915
The indignity!

201
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,156
You scorn your father's wishes?.

202
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,673
Parents and children
have no place in this world.

203
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,991
Very well!
I cut the bond between us.

204
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,031
You are a stranger to me.

205
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,792
Out of my sight!

206
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,109
You mustn't.

207
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,474
Quiet, Tango.

208
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,748
My mistake
was to love him too well.

209
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,911
I spoiled him.

210
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,118
It's my fault he's arrogant.

211
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,270
But it's too late for regrets.

212
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,719
When flesh is rotten,

213
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,954
even our own, cut it away!

214
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,195
Wait, My Lord!

215
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,993
Master Saburo is blunt,

216
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,237
perhaps even disrespectful.

217
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,274
But his words are honest
and come from the heart.

218
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,592
Consider well. You will find

219
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,876
he is not wrong.
- Silence!

220
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,750
I will speak!

221
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,349
Begone!

222
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,709
I will stay!

223
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,758
You disobey me?.

224
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,918
My duty is to speak my mind.

225
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,833
Brandish your sword.

226
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,037
- I won't move.
- How dare you!

227
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,158
Revoke this rash decision.

228
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,233
Your insolence matches his.
I will not have it!

229
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,955
I banish you both!

230
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,030
Father!

231
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,753
What misery!

232
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,068
What will you do now?.

233
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,516
I grieve for Father, not myself.

234
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,554
The horror ahead of him...

235
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,114
Tango, you're an idiot!

236
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,474
- Why?.
- For defending me.

237
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,239
Your place is with Father.

238
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,397
He needs you.

239
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,431
They're following us.

240
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,389
Wait!

241
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,990
Why do you run away,
son-in-law?.

242
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,754
- Son-in-law?.
- Hear me out.

243
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,949
You're in disgrace,
exiled from your lands.

244
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,114
Lord Ayabe and l
witnessed the whole incident.

245
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,238
You are an outcast,
little more than a beggar.

246
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,834
Forgive my rudeness.

247
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,596
What I'm trying to say...
I can't find the words.

248
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,991
The meaning is clear.
No lord chooses a beggar...

249
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,195
For his daughter.

250
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,554
Of course not.

251
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,110
No... Now hold on!

252
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,432
Lord Ayabe rejected the marriage.

253
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,154
But on my way home
I got to thinking

254
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,552
of your extraordinary conduct.

255
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,631
I like the way you spoke up.

256
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,712
You have character.

257
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,270
You'd make a fine son-in-law.

258
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,228
I retraced my steps

259
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,709
but you had gone.

260
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,514
Does my offer interest you?.

261
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,956
How can I know?.

262
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,352
Then come stay with me
while you think it over.

263
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,355
You too, T ango.

264
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,509
You are honest and loyal.

265
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,476
I can use you.
Will you come?.

266
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,239
Thank you for your generosity,

267
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,276
but I cannot accept.

268
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,990
Whatever disguise I must adopt,

269
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,800
I shan't abandon the Great Lord.

270
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,989
What's going on?.

271
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,277
Hidetora's concubines
are moving from the keep.

272
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,795
Please excuse the delay.

273
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,389
Scandalous!

274
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,909
I am now the mistress.

275
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,355
They must make way for me.

276
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,717
My women,

277
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,076
kneeling to Taro's wife?.

278
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,789
Intolerable!

279
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,359
Why do you say that?.

280
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,714
You gave him the castle keep.

281
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,233
It's only natural.

282
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,109
Gives away his house,
gives away his land

283
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,714
His bounty earns him
a new title

284
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,558
Lord of the rice fields

285
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,473
A scarecrow!.

286
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,948
You call me a fool?.

287
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,554
No, the fool is me,

288
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,555
for serving as butt
to your laughing-stock.

289
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,911
But you're another

290
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,515
for losing your keep!

291
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,669
How dare you!

292
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,949
Kaede...

293
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,628
the view is more pleasant

294
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,833
now that this is mine.

295
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,119
As I recall,

296
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,556
a banner used to hang there.

297
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,393
Yes, Father's banner.
Also his helmet and armour.

298
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,589
Where are they?.

299
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,149
I gave them to Father's men.

300
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,711
The armour doesn't matter

301
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,879
but the banner...

302
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,835
Lord,

303
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,672
it belongs with the head
of the house of lchimonji.

304
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,428
But Father is keeping
his title and insignia.

305
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,434
Without them, you are a shadow.

306
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,635
What do you mean?.

307
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,150
He made it clear.

308
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,273
I am now in command.

309
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,515
In that case,

310
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,874
behave as if you are.

311
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,392
You want the banner?.

312
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,919
Ridiculous!
You take back what you give.

313
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,315
It is Lord Taro's order!

314
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,636
See the Lord, a gourd in the wind

315
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,275
Swinging this way

316
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,955
Swaying that way

317
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,833
Swinging as the breeze blows

318
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,390
So high up

319
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,797
Dangling hollow from the tower...

320
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,589
Isn't it fun?.

321
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,150
Villain! I'll teach you!

322
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,912
See the Lord, a gourd in the wind

323
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,189
Swinging this way

324
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,314
Swaying that way

325
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,952
Swinging as the breeze blows

326
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,189
So high up

327
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,035
Dangling hollow from the tower...

328
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,432
What fun, what fun!

329
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,228
Who goes there?.

330
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,519
It's Ogura.

331
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,428
I have a message.

332
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,433
Lord T aro is holding
a family gathering

333
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,672
to celebrate the transfer of power.

334
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,990
He invites his honoured father.

335
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,352
You too, Lord lkoma.

336
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,875
Your "family gathering"
is only us?.

337
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,592
Please, Father-in-law,
won't you sit down?.

338
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,954
I am to sit below you?.

339
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,431
Who am l?.

340
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,799
The honourable father
of my husband.

341
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,554
Is that all?.

342
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,796
Is the Great Lord dead?.

343
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,075
Don't joke.

344
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,719
I'm not joking!

345
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,039
I retain my title and my status.

346
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,355
Have you forgotten?.

347
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,073
No, of course not.

348
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,999
You gave full authority to me.

349
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,718
Did you forget?.

350
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,829
What do you want?.

351
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,753
I gave you this castle.

352
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,718
I moved out, reduced my escort.

353
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,638
They may be few in number,

354
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,075
but they're boisterous enough.

355
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,914
What is that song?.

356
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,399
With such goings-on,
how can I make myself obeyed?.

357
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,677
They are warriors,
unschooled in manners.

358
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,678
They like comic songs.

359
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,393
Comic songs can go too far.

360
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,794
That song makes fun of me.

361
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,394
My guard was defending my honour,

362
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,715
yet you went ahead and killed him.

363
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,711
I cannot allow that.

364
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,318
This once I'll overlook it,

365
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,199
but I must have your promise

366
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,749
that it won't happen again.

367
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,911
You will sign this

368
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,956
and seal it with your blood.

369
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,555
A pledge?.

370
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,432
This is nonsense!

371
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,470
Read it.

372
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,435
"Pledge.

373
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,919
"Firstly,

374
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,595
"l cede to Taro Takatora
the domains of lchimonji.

375
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,670
"Secondly,

376
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,791
"l make him sole ruler
of the house of lchimonji.

377
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,316
"Thirdly,

378
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,388
"though I am Taro's father,

379
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,909
"l shall submit to his authority

380
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,911
"and act accordingly.

381
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,792
"l swear by all the deities,

382
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,315
"may they punish me if I disobey."

383
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,912
I'm to seal this silly thing

384
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,712
with my blood?.

385
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,676
Everything it contains

386
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,680
was proclaimed by you yourself

387
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,400
before witnesses.

388
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,553
What does it change
if you sign it?.

389
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,151
Are you a son?.

390
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,554
What do you mean?.

391
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,109
Is this a son's attitude?.

392
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,390
The hen pecks the cock

393
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,391
and makes him crow!

394
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,351
I will not stay here.

395
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,152
Fortunately, I have another son.

396
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,951
Thank you, you did well.

397
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,798
I was born
and raised in this castle.

398
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,350
It belonged to my father.

399
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,876
I left it to marry you.

400
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,390
My father and brothers relaxed
their vigilance after the marriage,

401
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,552
and Hidetora murdered them.

402
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,275
Now I am back in my family castle.

403
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,591
How I have longed for this day.

404
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,515
My mother took her own life
in this very room.

405
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,991
Father is on his way.

406
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,630
My brother sent him packing.

407
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,557
He says Father grows eccentric,

408
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,515
and it would be unwise
to let him stay here.

409
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,477
Father's counsellor, lkoma,
is privy to my brother's plans.

410
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,033
This severity is unlike Lord T aro.

411
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,079
And you, Lord,

412
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,435
why do you do nothing?.

413
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,669
He's right.

414
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,749
You should succeed the Great Lord.

415
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,317
Lord Taro is a weakling.

416
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,600
The stake is large.
Gamble for it.

417
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,199
Then you are all willing
to gamble with me?.

418
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,228
Absolutely.

419
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,153
Dogs turn on a master
who gives up the chase.

420
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,754
Sound the horn
or become the quarry.

421
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,272
How the dogs howl!

422
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,395
I must say, I find it unfair.

423
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,319
Born twelve months after Taro,

424
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,109
so all my life
I must grovel at his feet.

425
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,199
Crack these bonds!

426
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,158
Good for you, My Lord!

427
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,118
Don't lick your chops yet.

428
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,708
Listen...

429
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,238
Taro is easy pickings.

430
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,832
His wife, Lady Kaede,
is another story.

431
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,075
Quite true.

432
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,592
She'd be a perfect match for you.

433
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,319
Why not steal her?.

434
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,392
Don't be impertinent.

435
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,709
First of all, there's Father.

436
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,313
He still has thirty warriors.

437
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,600
Each one is worth a thousand.

438
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,837
He'll soon be here
and so will they.

439
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,796
Any ideas?.

440
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,315
Open the gates!

441
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,148
Hidetora is here!

442
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,396
The Great Lord is here!

443
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,910
I will seek out Sue first.

444
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,398
Tell Jiro I want to see him.

445
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,916
Sue!

446
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,753
Praise be
to the Eternal Western Paradise

447
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,632
Praise be
to the Eternal Buddha

448
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,475
In 36 trillion manifestations

449
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,950
Praise be to Amida Buddha...

450
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,592
I knew you'd be here.

451
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,034
Father-in-law!

452
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,032
Never m ind the ceremony.

453
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,111
It's been a long time.

454
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,993
Let me look at you.

455
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,994
Still the same sad face.

456
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,032
When I see you, it breaks my heart.

457
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,355
It's worse when you smile.

458
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,274
I burnt down your castle.
Your father and mother perished.

459
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,430
And you look at me like that.

460
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,710
Look upon me with hatred!

461
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,553
It would be easier to bear.

462
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,638
Go on, hate me!

463
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,072
I don't hate you.

464
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,678
All is decided
in our previous lives.

465
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,389
The Buddha embraces all things.

466
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,637
Buddha again!

467
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,039
He is gone from this evil world.

468
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,475
His guardians are in exile.

469
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,839
We can't rely on Buddha's mercy.

470
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,598
There you are, Jiro!

471
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,080
I've come to be your guest.

472
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,875
I'm disappointed in Taro.

473
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,438
I already know.
It's all in my brother's letter.

474
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,552
Taro wrote to you?.

475
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,036
He says your guards
were unruly and vulgar.

476
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,557
I am to receive you with courtesy,

477
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,917
but I cannot let your warriors

478
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,911
inside the castle walls.

479
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,195
What's this?.

480
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,470
I'm to come in alone,
leaving my men to rot outside?.

481
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,874
My brother is the head of the clan.

482
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,589
I have no choice but to obey him.

483
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,388
If you dislike his conditions,

484
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,279
then it might be best

485
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,479
to go back and apologise.

486
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,111
Apologise to Taro?.

487
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,796
Go back?.

488
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,395
Stop!

489
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,274
Lord Kurogane!
Lord Shirane!

490
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,117
What does this mean?.

491
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,915
Lord lkoma!

492
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,516
An order from Hidetora.

493
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,399
"We arrived suddenly.

494
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,236
"The castle is unprepared.

495
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,229
"Withdraw and wait outside."

496
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,233
Enough is enough!

497
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,873
I understand!

498
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,269
You too,

499
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,919
you're just like Taro.

500
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,869
You want to be rid of me.
I'm too much trouble.

501
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,148
That's not true.

502
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,991
If you were alone,
I'd welcome you gladly.

503
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,152
The Great Lord
goes nowhere alone.

504
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,031
You renounced your power.

505
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,598
You have no need of an escort.

506
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,914
Only the birds and the beasts

507
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,276
Iive in solitude.

508
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,677
I've heard enough excuses!

509
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,398
Open the gates!

510
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,359
You needn't worry.

511
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,273
It's not for my men to enter,

512
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,317
but for me to leave!

513
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,311
Open the gates!

514
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,074
Now close them!

515
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,155
I will not see you again.
Ever!

516
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,995
The villages are deserted.

517
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,709
Not a grain of rice anywhere.

518
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,668
The peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains.

519
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,869
My Lord!

520
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,235
We must go to the third castle.

521
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,316
It was your first victory.

522
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,030
- Go back...
- No, lkoma!

523
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,358
If I could do that,

524
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,193
would I roam the plain hungry?.

525
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,399
Use your head!

526
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,992
What kind of welcome would I get,

527
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,958
I, who banished
the lord of the castle?.

528
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,077
By order of Lord Taro Takatora,
head of the lchimonji clan,

529
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,794
I take possession
of this castle.

530
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,793
Open the gates!

531
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,998
Without our master, Saburo,
the castle is nothing to us.

532
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,276
We leave it to you.

533
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,513
We will follow him
and die for him.

534
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,593
We hear he is with Lord Fujimaki.

535
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,830
We go to join him!

536
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,558
It's Tango!

537
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,869
I have rice, bean curd, plums...

538
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,714
I followed you

539
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,555
and saw how you suffered.

540
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,517
Though banished,

541
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,752
I am still your loyal vassal.

542
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,959
Is it really Tango?.

543
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,029
Hold on!

544
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,074
Don't take charity from peasants.

545
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,558
A samurai will starve
rather than beg.

546
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,599
The peasants are presumptuous.

547
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,031
Burn their villages!

548
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,589
Wait, My Lord!

549
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,390
Don't blame the peasants.

550
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,436
Rather than disobey Taro's decree,
they fled.

551
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,711
What decree?.

552
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,236
That you are banished.

553
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,795
Anyone who helps you...

554
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,759
will die.

555
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,036
Now I understand.

556
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,471
You tried to warn me of this.

557
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,156
Your humble servant.

558
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,433
Laugh, Tango!

559
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,830
Wretched Hidetora...

560
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,229
Rejected by his children,

561
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,553
driven from his castles,

562
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,158
with no place to go.

563
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,517
You have a place to go, My Lord.

564
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,159
Master Saburo has found refuge
with Lord Fujimaki.

565
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,117
Go to him.

566
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,319
No, I can't.

567
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,752
How could l

568
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,395
ever face him?.

569
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,473
Listen to me!

570
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,590
All Saburo wants is your welfare.

571
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,874
If I'm disguised like this,
if I followed you so far,

572
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,998
it's all thanks to him.

573
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,152
He sent me to protect you.

574
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,837
Saburo's men gave up the castle.

575
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,514
They went to join Lord Fujimaki.

576
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,753
Now Fujimaki's plot is clear.

577
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,351
First he takes Saburo,

578
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,153
then Saburo's warriors,
then Your Lordship himself.

579
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,630
The lchimonji battle each other.

580
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,554
And he walks off with your land.

581
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,076
That's a lie!
He's not that kind of man.

582
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,152
We must go to the third castle.

583
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,798
But Taro's general has taken it.

584
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,554
Ogura?. He won't touch us.

585
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,709
What's that?.

586
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,069
What do I smell?.

587
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,712
A very fishy stink!

588
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,917
Ogura has only a few men.

589
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,756
We can beat them easily.

590
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,028
My horse!

591
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,393
That's it, hurry!

592
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,672
Hell is ever at hand,
which you cannot say of heaven...

593
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,434
Stay behind if you're afraid.

594
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,319
And yet,

595
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,318
all we did was tell the truth.

596
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,719
The enemy...

597
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,997
I know. Call lkoma and Ogura!

598
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,116
They tricked us!

599
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,960
We're surrounded, overwhelmed!

600
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,553
Truly...

601
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,431
we are in hell!

602
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,113
Lord Taro is slain!

603
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,276
- What?.
- So be it!

604
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,996
A stray shot from the tower.

605
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,397
The fortunes of war.
The fates are kinder to you.

606
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,755
And Father?.

607
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,751
He'll commit hara-kiri.

608
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,033
- We're lost!
- Prepare yourself!

609
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,518
Farewell, My Lord.

610
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,749
Go back!

611
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,429
Lord!

612
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,876
The die is cast, do not falter.

613
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,629
You chose this path, follow it.

614
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,318
It leads to absolute leadership.

615
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,755
You can no longer turn back.

616
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,439
Is he mad?.

617
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,033
And better off for it.

618
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,155
What do you mean?.

619
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,157
My Lord, come to your wits!

620
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,551
In a mad world
only the mad are sane.

621
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,311
What do you see?.

622
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,555
Forgive me.

623
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,276
Excellent! The failed mind
sees the heart's failings.

624
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,119
The wonder of it!

625
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,635
I see on this withered plain

626
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,031
All those I destroyed

627
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,558
A phantom army

628
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,235
One by one they come floating

629
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,593
Rising before me...

630
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,759
Who's there?.

631
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,756
T ravellers stranded by the storm.

632
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,872
Let us stay the night.

633
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,236
My house is too poor for visitors.

634
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,833
We ask nothing special.

635
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,953
I'm sorry, I must be alone.

636
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,157
Why?. Are you diseased?.

637
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,070
No.

638
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,673
Then let us come in.

639
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,113
I cannot.

640
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,920
The one who seeks shelter
is the Great Lord himself.

641
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,428
We're coming in.

642
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,717
Our lord was taken ill.

643
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,629
He is wet through.
Bring something to cover him.

644
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,959
I'm cold.

645
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,589
Tango...

646
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,438
He is himself again.

647
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,555
More's the pity.

648
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,237
He is better off mad.

649
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,675
Tango,

650
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,353
Iisten to me.

651
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,277
I, Hidetora,

652
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,232
was attacked by my own sons.

653
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,470
I was betrayed by my vassal.

654
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,715
That's not the worst.

655
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,310
Because of me, my loyal men
died a useless death.

656
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,391
As fate would have it

657
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,958
only I survived.

658
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,149
I, who should have died!

659
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,752
You there! Woman!

660
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,639
I am not a woman.

661
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,116
It's so dark... Bring a light.

662
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,112
I have no light.

663
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,595
I have no need of one.

664
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,158
Are your eyes so poor?.

665
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,357
Are you Lady Sue's brother?.

666
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,071
Young Lord Tsurumaru?.

667
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,396
Yes.

668
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,668
Tsurumaru!

669
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,276
It's been a long time...

670
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,677
Lord Hidetora.

671
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,239
You remember me?.

672
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,037
How could I forget you?.

673
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,998
I was only a boy,

674
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,920
but could I forget the man

675
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,310
who burned down our castle?.

676
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,119
Who in exchange for my life

677
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,919
gouged out my eyes?.

678
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,795
I try to be like my sister,

679
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,554
to pray to Buddha
and rid myself of hatred.

680
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,319
But not one day do I forget!

681
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,118
Not one night do I sleep in peace!

682
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,352
I regret I cannot welcome you

683
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,511
as befits the Great Lord.

684
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,832
Luckily, my sister gave me a flute.

685
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,675
I will play for you.

686
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,878
Lacking anything else, I give you
hospitality of the heart.

687
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,834
It is the only pleasure

688
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,393
Ieft to me.

689
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,114
Sister-in-law,

690
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,276
here is my brother's hair.

691
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,876
He died in battle.

692
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:15,160
Unfortunately, it falls on me
to bring this unhappy news.

693
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,518
Ogura.

694
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,275
Where is my husband's body?.

695
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,671
In this heat,

696
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,435
it was too unsightly
to be displayed.

697
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,754
We burned it where it lay.

698
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,753
We held funeral rites at a temple.

699
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,114
Ogura...

700
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,394
Where are his armour and helmet?.

701
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,033
You're mocking me.

702
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,560
I'm wearing them.

703
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,871
Surely you recognise them.

704
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,438
Of course.

705
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,670
But I didn't dream
you would wear them

706
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,151
so soon after his death.

707
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,399
You surprise me.

708
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,399
I had thought

709
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,473
my brother would be pleased

710
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,437
to see me in his armour.

711
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,190
It was stupid of me.

712
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,074
Forgive me.

713
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,714
Help me take it off.

714
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,629
Sister-in-law,

715
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,916
I am about to be naked.

716
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,756
Lords lkoma and Ogura,
you have worked well

717
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,797
to further our interests.

718
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,955
We appreciate it.

719
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,357
These gifts are a token of thanks.

720
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,990
They're also a parting gift.

721
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,036
Farewell.

722
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,636
Lord Jiro feels it unwise

723
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,349
to keep you in his service.

724
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,751
Men who betray one master
may betray another.

725
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,590
A reasonable point of view.

726
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,479
Naturally you are disappointed,

727
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,358
but bear no grudges.

728
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,110
Is that clear?.

729
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,872
Good.

730
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,876
The Lady Kaede is here.

731
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,309
Send her in.

732
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,671
My apologies for my harsh words.

733
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,637
I am ashamed.

734
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,758
The incident is forgotten.

735
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,392
They say your father has gone mad.

736
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,237
That should please you.

737
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,710
What do you mean by that?.

738
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,829
I spoke frankly,

739
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,152
without gilding my thoughts.

740
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,198
Forgive me if I offended.

741
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,316
You must hate my father

742
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,313
for what he did to your family.

743
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,149
Am I wrong?.

744
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,034
Now it's my turn to be frank.

745
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,594
You are just as pleased as I am.

746
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,079
Lord Jiro, you are now head
of the house of lchimonji.

747
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,353
This helmet is rightfully yours.

748
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,199
I am not blind!

749
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,109
You murdered your brother
and stole his title.

750
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,999
Prepare to die!

751
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,149
No!

752
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,275
Even now

753
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,515
you deny it?.

754
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,510
It wasn't I who killed my brother.

755
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,874
Then who did?.

756
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,915
Speak! Who was it?.

757
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,549
It was...

758
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,952
Kurogane.

759
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,109
Hypocrite!

760
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,312
You gave the order
but won't take the blame.

761
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,073
A fine leader!

762
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,392
You give in so easily.

763
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,436
Now I will tell you the truth.

764
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,199
Lord Jiro,

765
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:32,392
I don't care about Taro's death.

766
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,678
What concerns me

767
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,789
is my own future.

768
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,594
I won't be a widow,
with my hair cropped,

769
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,513
nor a nun, with my head shaved.

770
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,433
This castle was my father's.
I won't leave it.

771
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,635
Lord Jiro,

772
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,670
consider my request well.

773
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,391
For my part, I'll say nothing

774
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,716
of your abominable crimes.

775
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,995
I won't reproach you
or speak against you.

776
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,151
If I did,
the kingdom would split.

777
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,518
But always remember.

778
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,239
I can destroy you.

779
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,435
Is it a bargain, Lord Jiro?.

780
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,152
My Lord...

781
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,352
Yes, Sister-in-law?.

782
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,153
Sister-in-law?.

783
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,119
After what we've just done?.

784
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,433
By rights,

785
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,836
I really should be

786
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,159
your wife.

787
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,879
I have a wife: Sue.

788
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,589
I'll be merely your concubine?.

789
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,438
No! No!

790
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:00,312
You're mine!
No one else shall have you.

791
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,758
Don't cry, Kaede.

792
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,358
You won't be just a concubine.

793
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,155
As long as Lady Sue is there...

794
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,952
I'll attend to her.

795
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,148
But how?.

796
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,959
I'll repudiate her.

797
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,751
That's not what I want!

798
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,073
After our ecstasy,

799
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,592
I cannot bear it that another woman
has known your touch.

800
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,512
Such a woman cannot remain alive.

801
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,192
Well now, look where we are.

802
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,795
If fortune had run true,
Tsurumaru would live here.

803
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:32,196
You shelter in the very ruins
of the castle you burned.

804
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,560
Ignorance is bliss indeed.

805
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,159
Your helmet.

806
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,031
Your plumes.

807
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,515
Don't you look regal!

808
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,557
Help, here come demons!

809
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,433
Two of them.

810
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,994
Traitors! You must pay.

811
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,992
No, wait!

812
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,195
Let us explain!

813
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,759
Save your breath.

814
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,276
I know all about your treachery.

815
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,836
Die, traitor!

816
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,118
Jiro killed Taro.

817
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,837
Madness saved Hidetora.

818
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,279
If he recovers his wits,

819
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,479
he'll be killed too.

820
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,391
Jiro slew Taro, our lord is next.

821
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,233
We must take him to Master Saburo.

822
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,391
If only we could.

823
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,397
Mention Saburo and he runs away.

824
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,789
He doesn't dare face him.

825
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,791
On that point he's sane.

826
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,750
What about Master Saburo?.

827
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,471
Would you like to see him?.

828
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,032
The only way
is to bring Saburo here.

829
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,755
Maybe he can talk sense to him.

830
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,679
I'll be back as soon as I can.

831
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,157
Take good care of him.

832
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,512
Lady Kaede leads you by the nose.

833
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,840
If you wish to marry, fine.

834
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,632
But to kill Lady Sue for that?.

835
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:46,954
Sometimes killing is necessary.

836
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,399
But to kill on a whim?.

837
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,036
The order is unreasonable.
I must refuse.

838
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,879
Lord Kurogane,

839
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,595
at the second castle
there is a supply of salt.

840
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,279
Why?.

841
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,478
When you bring back her head,
salt it first.

842
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:40,156
Otherwise, in this heat,
we'll be unable to look at it.

843
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,554
Lady Sue is so beautiful,

844
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,790
it would be ungracious to her.

845
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,912
Since you will go personally,
there will be no mistake.

846
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,913
Do it as you see fit.

847
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,800
Why stay with this mad old man?.

848
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:29,516
If the rock you sit on
starts to roll, jump clear.

849
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:40,598
Or you'll go with it
and be squashed.

850
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,954
Only a fool stays aboard.

851
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,275
Where am l?.

852
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,593
What is this place?.

853
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,512
Paradise!

854
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,799
Think of it.

855
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,631
All my life,

856
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,471
I've been his nurse.

857
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,473
Good boy.

858
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,235
Sweet dreams.

859
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,274
I, Kurogane, am back!

860
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:24,950
Approach.

861
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,875
Thank you for being quick.

862
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,597
At your service, My Lady.

863
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:06,117
I have brought the object,

864
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,828
as per your instructions.

865
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,549
Be so kind as to examine it.

866
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:30,074
I'll be the first to look.

867
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,194
What is this?.

868
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,879
Your joking goes too far!

869
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,110
Is anything wrong?.

870
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,279
Imagine that!

871
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,789
Lady Sue was a fox in disguise.

872
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,036
Enough of your tricks!

873
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,350
This is a statue from a shrine.

874
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,195
Clever fox...
First becomes human

875
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,989
then turns himself to stone.

876
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,036
Are you making a fool of me?.

877
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,108
Certainly not.

878
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,829
There are many foxes hereabouts.

879
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:42,231
It's said they take human form.

880
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,910
Take care, My Lord.

881
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,949
They often impersonate women.

882
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:56,358
In Central Asia
a fox seduced King Pan Tsu,

883
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,988
and made him kill 1,000 men.

884
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:03,756
In China he married King Yu
and ravaged the land.

885
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,876
In Japan, as Princess Tamamo,

886
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:08,554
he caused great havoc at court.

887
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:13,236
He became a white fox
with nine tails.

888
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:18,393
Then they lost trace of him.

889
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,596
Some people say

890
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,439
he settled down here.

891
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,909
So beware, My Lord, beware.

892
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,355
This is how you keep our bargain!

893
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,308
You conspire with Kurogane
to humiliate me.

894
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,272
No, you're wrong.

895
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,509
Intolerable!

896
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,231
It's Kurogane's doing!

897
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,631
Always Kurogane!

898
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,350
Is he your only vassal?.

899
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,875
He's the villain who killed Taro.

900
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,793
He's the hero who saved Sue.

901
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,669
A two-headed monster.
This is your "right arm"?.

902
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,075
Until the day

903
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,511
I have Sue's head,

904
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,432
you shall not see me again.

905
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:43,069
- Sister, my flute!
- We've no time to get it.

906
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,878
I've had it since boyhood.

907
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,837
What shall we do?.

908
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,673
Kurogane said they'll pursue you.

909
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,035
I'll go back for the flute.

910
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:55,317
Your legs are old.
I'm the one to go.

911
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,233
We're near the ruins
of your castle.

912
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:01,790
Go there and pray for your dead.

913
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:05,191
You may never be back again.

914
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,235
Tsurumaru, let's hurry!

915
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,715
I see our castle.

916
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,475
That is, what's left of it.

917
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,153
Which way, sister?.

918
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,389
Over there.

919
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,275
Where?.

920
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,551
Earth and sky are topsy-turvy.

921
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:25,680
I was the fool and made him laugh.

922
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,118
Now the coin is flipped.

923
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,273
Don't be mute, say something!

924
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,035
You speak nonsense,
I'll speak truth.

925
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:42,350
We'll see what comes of it.

926
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,396
Begin, old man.

927
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,554
A serpent's egg
is white and pure.

928
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,157
A bird's is speckled and soiled.

929
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:08,270
This is a castle...

930
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,639
Here's a wall.

931
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,832
The bird left the speckled egg
for the white.

932
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:16,990
Strange...

933
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,316
The egg cracks,
out comes a snake.

934
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:24,509
Empty space above the wall.
Why?.

935
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,950
The bird is gobbled by the snake.

936
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:35,318
Where am l?.

937
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,072
Who am l?.

938
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,232
Stupid bird!

939
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,035
Saburo...

940
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,835
It hurts.

941
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,996
I'm aworm, don't crush me!

942
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,919
Who'd bother to crush a worm?.

943
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,674
Who are you?.

944
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,878
Is someone crying?.

945
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,358
Who's crying?.

946
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,790
Hell!

947
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,197
Man is born crying.

948
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:54,675
When he's cried enough, he dies.

949
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:26,194
Saburo has crossed the river.

950
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,918
He's now in Hachiman Field!

951
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:32,153
What can he do with so few men?.

952
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,313
Message from Lord Saburo.

953
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:39,836
Speak.

954
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,156
He is here to find his father.

955
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:46,198
That done, he will leave in peace.

956
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,551
Fujimaki is at the border.

957
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:06,675
I don't like it.

958
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,875
I didn't want reinforcements.

959
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,192
You should be glad.

960
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:13,839
Thanks to Fujimaki,

961
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,673
the enemy is pinned down here.

962
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:20,719
We can rescue your father
from Azusa Plain.

963
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:25,269
But it looks so aggressive.

964
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,796
One false move could mean war.

965
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,676
Maybe I was too hasty.

966
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:44,754
My worry spurred me on
but my son-in-law will grumble.

967
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:49,275
Sitting here, we pose no threat.

968
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,356
Prepare for battle!

969
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:10,200
My Lord, this is ill-advised.

970
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,999
Let Saburo have his father.

971
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,798
Avoid this war.

972
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,350
Once he has Father,

973
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,511
he'll accuse me of treason

974
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,558
and attack.

975
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:27,671
We can't give up Hidetora,
we don't know where he is.

976
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,673
There is much unrest in the land.

977
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,673
Fujimaki and Ayabe bide their time.

978
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,515
We need to retrench, not attack.

979
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:39,955
A message!

980
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,316
Lady Kaede awaits Lord Jiro,

981
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,475
to celebrate
his departure for battle.

982
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,198
A warlord

983
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,794
doesn't run to his woman.

984
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,473
Stay away!

985
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,996
When the enemy is assembled

986
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,435
we can go after His Lordship.

987
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:30,319
Be patient!
Rest the horses.

988
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,232
Dismount!

989
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,188
Weakling!

990
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,838
Kurogane has swayed you again.

991
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:45,793
No.
It's no time for war.

992
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:48,918
Wars are won by strong leaders.

993
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:52,072
Why fear Fujimaki and Ayabe?.

994
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:56,834
Your mistake

995
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:01,389
was to spare Hidetora, mad or not.

996
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,512
To kill him I have to find him.

997
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:12,078
Saburo knows where he is.

998
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:16,517
Otherwise he wouldn't have come.

999
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,073
Send him a message.
Say he can have his father.

1000
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:35,597
Watch his movements
and send out your assassins.

1001
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,111
I'm lost.

1002
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:55,710
Such is the human condition.

1003
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:00,834
This path...

1004
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:04,352
I remember...

1005
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,150
We came this way before.

1006
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,914
Men always travel the same road.

1007
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:13,035
If you're tired of it, jump!

1008
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,669
Up there.

1009
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,073
Who is it?.

1010
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:07,316
Sue!

1011
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,358
Sister, that voice...

1012
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,990
This ruin was once a castle.

1013
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:27,150
It belonged to Sue's father.
I destroyed it.

1014
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,758
Why am I here?.

1015
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,556
Why is Sue here?.

1016
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,919
And Tsurumaru too?.

1017
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,599
Is this a dream?.

1018
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,635
No, this is hell.

1019
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,195
Hell.

1020
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,358
The lowest level of hell.

1021
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:50,749
Mount!

1022
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:42,635
Message from Lord Jiro!

1023
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,795
Very good.

1024
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:17,912
He says he won't attack.

1025
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:21,356
We're to leave once we have Father.

1026
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:24,994
Let's go at once.

1027
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,113
We'd give away his wheareabouts.
Wait till dark.

1028
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:34,235
Ayabe is on the move.

1029
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:05,517
Vulture!
He smells blood.

1030
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,511
Stay calm, My Lord.

1031
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:23,079
Ayabe is watching.

1032
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,953
So is Fujimaki.

1033
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,355
They're waiting.

1034
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:37,398
Don't give them an excuse to attack.

1035
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:42,515
He wants Father but makes no move.

1036
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:45,470
What's his game?.

1037
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,797
She's taking so long.

1038
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,671
I'll go see what's keeping her.

1039
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:13,989
No, don't!

1040
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,796
Never mind the flute!

1041
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,674
You're acting like a child.

1042
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:22,877
I don't want to be alone again.

1043
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:26,111
You won't be alone.

1044
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,794
This image of the Buddha Amida

1045
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:38,599
will protect you in my place.

1046
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,469
Sister!

1047
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,270
I won't be gone long.

1048
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,635
Sister!

1049
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:12,359
I found Kyoami,
crying on Azusa Plain.

1050
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,915
Where's our master?.

1051
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:17,952
Forgive me.

1052
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,717
He's disappeared.

1053
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:25,996
You lost him

1054
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:27,599
on the plain?.

1055
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,748
Now we can't wait for dark.

1056
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:40,198
I'm going to Azusa Plain.

1057
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,920
Keep the enemy busy here.

1058
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,957
Ten men follow Lord Saburo!

1059
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:04,309
He's moving...

1060
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:07,796
He's heading for Azusa Plain.

1061
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:11,791
Gunnery captain!

1062
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:19,875
Take your men to Azusa Plain

1063
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,110
and lay an ambush.

1064
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,117
A reward for whoever kills Saburo.

1065
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:27,749
Are you mad?.

1066
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:30,913
Break your word and it's war.

1067
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:34,797
So be it.
It was inevitable.

1068
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,912
Saburo is not our only enemy.

1069
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:38,876
So what?.

1070
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:42,597
If they attack, we retaliate.

1071
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,678
We grab their land

1072
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,400
and enlarge our own.

1073
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:51,036
Fine words.
But words don't win wars.

1074
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:53,834
Where's the dog eager for prey?.

1075
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:55,793
Kaede's right.

1076
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:58,554
You're a mouse
posing as a mastiff.

1077
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:02,077
Kaede barks and you grovel.

1078
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,433
Silence!

1079
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:05,909
Stay behind!

1080
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:09,233
If you fear to fight, desert!

1081
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:14,509
If I deserted,

1082
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:15,914
where would I go?.

1083
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,477
Captain!
You have your orders. Go!

1084
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:37,711
Message for Lord Saburo.

1085
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:40,155
"Enemy gunners coming.

1086
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,673
"Take care."

1087
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:49,479
Infantry!

1088
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,429
Forward!

1089
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:07,394
Thinks he's smart.

1090
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,119
Get ready, men.

1091
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,797
We're moving

1092
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:24,192
into the woods.

1093
02:11:55,440 --> 02:11:56,395
Father!

1094
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:44,591
What a sky!

1095
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,390
Am I in the other world?.

1096
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:55,839
Is this paradise?.

1097
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,798
Why are you so cruel?.

1098
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:07,235
Why pull me from my grave?.

1099
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,315
Don't you know me?.

1100
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,720
- Father?.
- Yes.

1101
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:31,354
What do you mean by "father"?.

1102
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,995
Wait... I remember.

1103
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:42,920
I had three sons.

1104
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,677
Are you one of them?.

1105
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:55,310
Yes, I am Saburo.

1106
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,195
Saburo?.

1107
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:12,036
Saburo, it's you!

1108
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:23,116
I have no face to show you,

1109
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,558
no words to excuse myself.

1110
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,595
Give me poison to drink,

1111
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,638
I'll swallow it gladly.

1112
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,719
Don't talk like that.

1113
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:38,834
I don't hate you, Father.

1114
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,112
No sweet lies, I've had my fill.

1115
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:53,512
Does he look like a hypocrite?.

1116
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:57,358
True, soft words often deceive.

1117
02:14:58,360 --> 02:15:00,999
But, My Lord, look at him!

1118
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,398
Tears like this

1119
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,636
can only come from the heart.

1120
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,630
You'll live with us,

1121
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:20,030
and forget this bad dream.

1122
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:24,592
If only you can forget

1123
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:27,514
my cruelty to you.

1124
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:30,078
Forgive me.

1125
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:33,838
I am a stupid old fool.

1126
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:05,876
Attack!

1127
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:06,316
The enemy is in the woods.

1128
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:10,030
Our superior strength
is useless there.

1129
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:13,516
Then we'll burn them out.

1130
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,915
Charge!

1131
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,312
Attack!

1132
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,674
Pull back!

1133
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:12,351
We outnumber them.

1134
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:13,595
Crush them!

1135
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:06,110
Ayabe is marching
on the first castle.

1136
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:07,755
Impossible!

1137
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:10,590
He's on the ridge.

1138
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:20,834
Those troops are a decoy.

1139
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:31,274
Pull back!

1140
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,429
Forward!

1141
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:17,108
That's enough!

1142
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,796
Another cheer!

1143
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:50,120
I have so much to say.

1144
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:55,635
When we're alone and quiet,

1145
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,430
we will talk, father to son.

1146
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:05,154
That's all I want.

1147
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:07,912
Nothing else.

1148
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,798
He is dead.

1149
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:52,470
I know when one is dead.

1150
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:07,953
He is dead.

1151
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:12,473
You and I live,

1152
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,075
but Saburo...

1153
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,153
You can't die.

1154
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:33,718
I have tales to tell,

1155
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:38,031
forgiveness to ask.

1156
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,434
My son...

1157
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:43,473
is this justice?.

1158
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:48,195
Are you gone forever?.

1159
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,275
Keep away!

1160
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,272
It grows dark.

1161
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:06,677
Senile old fool.

1162
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:08,714
It's the end.

1163
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,956
Do not call back his spirit.

1164
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:44,397
He has suffered enough.

1165
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:51,709
Lord Saburo!

1166
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:02,869
Victory is ours!

1167
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:07,270
The enemy is retreating
with Ayabe in pursuit.

1168
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:09,990
We've won!

1169
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,679
Alas!

1170
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,756
It doesn't seem possible.

1171
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:22,475
He isn't here to share this.

1172
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:26,073
Hidetora is also gone.
Why?.

1173
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:31,672
Are there no gods?. No Buddha?.

1174
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:35,037
If you exist, hear me!

1175
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,755
You are mischievous and cruel!

1176
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:43,915
Are you so bored up there
you must crush us like ants?.

1177
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,959
Is it such fun to see men weep?.

1178
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,714
Enough! Do not blaspheme.

1179
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,150
It is the gods who weep.

1180
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:00,395
They see us killing each other,

1181
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:03,518
over and over since time began.

1182
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:06,509
They can't save us from ourselves.

1183
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:13,839
Don't cry.

1184
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:17,198
It's how the world is made.

1185
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:20,520
Men prefer sorrow over joy,

1186
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:23,194
suffering over peace.

1187
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:26,754
Look at them in the first castle.

1188
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:30,430
They revel in pain and bloodshed.

1189
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,636
They celebrate murder.

1190
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,830
We'll stay. You go to the tower.

1191
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:14,360
Stop! Close the gates!

1192
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:16,193
Where's Lord Jiro?.

1193
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:18,239
Whose head is that?.

1194
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,709
Saburo's or Hidetora's?.

1195
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,154
Neither.

1196
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,117
My Lord ordered me to...

1197
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:58,193
Wait, Kurogane.

1198
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:02,752
Is Lady Kaede the master here?.

1199
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:06,270
I serve you, but never her.

1200
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:15,314
Fox-devil!

1201
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:19,189
Your scheming has destroyed
the house of lchimonji!

1202
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,319
Such is the vanity of woman.

1203
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:24,471
Vanity, you say?.

1204
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:29,349
I wanted to avenge my family.

1205
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:31,875
I wanted this castle to burn.

1206
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:34,190
I have done all I set out to do.

1207
02:28:53,560 --> 02:28:55,755
My Lord, prepare to die.

1208
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:58,070
I, Kurogane, will follow you.

1209
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:28,192
