00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:24,291
Well, the PTA has an accepted
set of rules concerning the prom.

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,750
Young ladies must wear
non-revealing dresses.

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,083
Young men must wear suits or tuxes.

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,666
And if a student chooses to bring a date,
they must be of the opposite sex.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,916
Well, can't you just ban this student?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,125
Well, we've been advised
that there may be some legal repercussions

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,166
if we prevent this girl from attending,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,833
so although it breaks my heart,
we have no choice.

14
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,458
- There won't be a prom.
- [reporter 1] Mrs. Greene, a question.

[reporter 2] Hey, there's Emma!
Can we get a comment?

18

We're here for the opening night
of <i>Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,</i>

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,166
starring the incomparable Dee Dee Allen.

27
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,625
- Dee Dee! You're a Broadway star.
- Yes, I am. [chuckles]

You have your choice of roles.
What drew you to Eleanor?

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,250
Well, Eleanor Roosevelt
was a brave, powerful, charismatic woman

30
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,250
who no one had ever heard of.

31
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,958
Her story needs to be told.

32
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,416
People need to know
it is possible to change the world,

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,791
whether you're
a homely middle-aged First Lady

34
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,250
or a Broadway star! [chuckles]

35
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,458
Barry Glickman! You were brilliant as FDR.

36
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,666
From the moment
I first stepped into FDR's shoes…

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,916
And when I say "shoes," I mean wheelchair.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,083
…I had an epiphany.

39
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,708
I realized there is no difference

between the president of the United States
and a celebrity.

This is not a review you want

This is gonna close us.

173

We're wasting our lives.

174
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,250
Hmm, it's true.
At least we're all in the same boat.

175

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583

- That's from <i>The Tempest.</i>

177
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,541
Okay, one, shut up.
Two, I refuse to give up, okay?

178
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,458
We're… We're still celebrities.
We still have power.

180
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,166
Now, <i>The Times</i>
sort of castrated you as it were.

[Barry sighs]

182
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,416
Yep. They wrote you off
as aging narcissists.

183
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,375
I still don't understand
what's wrong with that.

184
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,625
There's a very simple way
that we can still love ourselves

185
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:50,500

decent human beings, okay?

186
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,166

- [Barry] Right?

188
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,875
- All we need is a cause.
- A cause célèbre.

189
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,375
Everybody think of some causes. Go.

190
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,416
- Um, poverty?
- Too big.

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,750
World hunger.

192
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,625
That is also a major thing.
No, we need something we can handle.

193
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,166
Some little injustice
we can drive to. Recycling.

194
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,541
- Let's see what's trending.
- [Barry] Recycling's good.

195
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,833
- Why are there so many award shows?
- Parking.

196
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,000
- [Barry] Or the TVs in the back of cabs.
- Oh! Oh, yeah, what about this girl?

197
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,750
Oh, my gosh. Check this out.

198
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,541
- [Barry] What girl?
- It's all over Twitter.

199
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,458
[Barry] Oh.

200
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
She's from Edgewater, Indiana.

201
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,291
She's a lesbian. She wanted to take
her girlfriend to the high school prom,

202
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,958
and the PTA went apeshit
and they canceled it.

203
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,000
They canceled prom?

204
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,125
- Are they allowed to do that?
- No.

Me? No, I have no idea
what just happened in there.

505
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,375
Strangers burst in hurling insults
at the parents, and you do nothing.

506
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,791
What kind of school
are you running here, Mr. Hawkins?

507
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,583
[sighs]

508
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,083
Excuse me, Miss Allen.
I'm Tom. Tom Hawkins.

509
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:08,333
I am the principal and I just, um…
What are you doing?

510
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,583
We have come to show this community

511
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:14,208
that gay people
and gay-positive icons, such as myself,

512
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,791
[inhales] are made of the same
flesh and blood as they are.

513
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,750
Uh-huh.

514
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:21,833
If they don't have gay people here,
why is my Scruff going crazy right now?

515
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,333
We're not monsters.

516
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,291
We're cultural disruptors. [chuckles]

517
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
I'm a fan.

518
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:35,083
- Really?
- Yeah. Yes, I am. [giggles]

519
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,000
[gasps]

520
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:41,583
[chuckles] What kind of a fan?
Big fan? Small fan? Scary stabby fan?

521
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:44,125
You could say that I'm a big fan. Yes.

522
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:48,916
Really? That's so surprising
because you're not my usual demographic.

523
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
- You mean Black?
- No, straight.

524
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:54,041
You are straight, right?

525
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,250
Yes. I am.
Straight people like Broadway too.

526
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:01,208
[chuckles] I've heard that.
Always thought it was a fairy tale.

527
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,500
- [chuckles] So to speak.
- [chuckles] So to speak. Well, it's true.

528
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,541
Um, I've been a fan since I saw you

529
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,541
in the show for which
you won your first Tony.

530
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,583
- No! You saw <i>Swallow the Moon?</i>
- I did.

531
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:16,958
The number at the top of the second act,
"The Lady's Improving"? Chills.

532
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,833
[chuckles] That song made me a star.

533
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,375
It made me a fan.

534
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,125
- Uh, Dee Dee, we gotta make haste.
- Okay.

535
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,958
Uh, Miss Allen, I just…
This is a very delicate situation.

536
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,958
I'm asking you and your friends
to back off for a few days.

537
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,291
- Back off?
- Yeah.

538
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,416
Backing off
is exactly what we're not going to do.

539
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I see what's happening here.
You're trying to disarm me with flattery.

540
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:43,666
It's not going to work, Tom.
Flattery makes me stronger.

541
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,625
Fuels my ego.

542
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,541
- [Alyssa] That was insane.
- I know.

543
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,958
- I'm really freaking out.
- Don't freak out.

544
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,916
We have a plan, remember?

545
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,416
We're gonna get dressed up and go to prom

546
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,250
and be together in public,
not hide anymore.

547
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,166
Are you sure about this?

548
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,250

Oh. Dickinson, four rooms.
I called yesterday.

598
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,625
Four rooms of varying size

599
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,500

of the company, right? [chuckles]

600

601

We don't have a suite.

602
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,166
- Now do you have a suite?
- Oh!

603
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:34,166
No, we don't have any suites.
All the rooms are the same.

604
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,416
- [Dee Dee sighs]
- [Angie] Oh!

605
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,958
Surely you know who I am.

606
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,291
At the very least,
I would like a room next to the spa.

607
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,166
Uh, there's no spa.

608
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,958
Angie, what is this place?
We're all gonna get stabbed and stuffed.

No, we don't have any cabins.

- How about now?
- [laughing] What is that?

614

It's a Drama Desk. You know what it is.

- [whispering] I vomited in the bus again.
- [Angie] Mmm.

00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,125
Can I see the hotel doctor, please?

617
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,958
Oh, my God, it's you.

618
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,541
I can't believe it. It's actually you.

619
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,875
You're the guy from <i>Talk to the Hand.</i>
It's on every night at 9:00 after...

620
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,541
- Can I have my room, please?
- Okay, let's get started. All right?

621
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,750
- Let's change some minds.
- [Angie] Uh…

622
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,958
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

- [Dee Dee gasps]

Make a wish, Dee Dee.

625
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,041
Death. I wish for death.

Okay, Sheldon's working on a venue.
Now, how's the song?

627
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:44,833
Uh, about that.
I was misled by my representation.

628
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:48,625
Mr. Sondheim is not a fan
of my Sweeney Todd.

629
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,208
- Quite the opposite, actually.
- [Barry] Oh, my God…

630
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,125
Jesus, Trent, you screwed us.

631
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:58,625
Don't worry.
I wrote something myself. Yeah.

632
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,958

633
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,958

634

You're welcome.

00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,166
- Oh, my God. [giggles]
- Yeah!

637
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,125
- This is awful.
- [giggles]

638
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,500
We can't perform this.
They'll boo us off the stage.

639
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:24,041
No, all we need is a simple message
that tugs at the heartstrings

640
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,333
and a little pageantry.

641
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:28,625

No, it's, uh…

677
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:47,000
- Trent, I could rip your face off.
- I'm sorry.

678
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,833
[Barry] You made me fail.
I am so sick of failing.

679
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,250
What do we do now?

680
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,375
We leave.

681
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,291
- First we kill Trent, then we leave.
- What about the girl?

682
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,583
- [Dee Dee sighs]
- [Principal Hawkins] Hello, everyone…

683
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:03,458
We have some news. Emma and I
wanted to be the ones to tell you,

684
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:07,750
thanks to pressure from the state's
attorney's office, prom is back on!

685
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,708
- [Barry] What?
- Prom is back on! [squeals]

686
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,666
- [all cheering]
- We did it!

687
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,625
Yay!

688
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:16,041
See? We're not narcissists.

689
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,416
Just to be clear, uh,
it's not because of you…

690
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,708
Well, maybe it was.

691
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:23,000
I mean, everybody started freaking out
when you got here.

692
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,791
The lawyer might've had legal power,
but you really scared people.

693
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,208
- [Angie] Aw!
- We scared people!

694
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,958
Important thing is, it's a victory.

695
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,916
Now you get to go to prom
like everybody else!

696
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,125
- [Angie] Yes!
- What are you gonna wear?

697
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:38,041
I was thinking like a vintage tux
and some high tops.

698
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,083
I don't know. Does it matter?

699
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,750
- Does it…
- [scoffs]

701
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,166
- Honey…
- Sweetheart, boo-boo.

702
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,625
I don't know you, okay?
And you don't know me,

703
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:56,083
but I am begging you,
let me dress you for the prom.

704
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,750
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

705
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,625
We're going to Saks.

706
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:02,166
- Uh, there's no Saks here.
- We have a Kmart!

707
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,958
- A what?
- A Kmart.

708
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,208
- [laughs]
- [Barry] Fine.

709
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,791
We'll check out
the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart,

710
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,916
do a little fashion show.

711
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,625
Okay! Oh, can we do it tomorrow?
We can meet at my place.

712
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,875
I have to go and find out
if I still have a date.

713
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,875
Sure. I'll go ahead, do a pre-shop.

714
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,458
Okay? Will you give me a ride
in your pickup truck?

715
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:26,166
Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian,
I drive a pickup?

716
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,708
- Well, do you? [chuckles]
- Shut up.

717
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,791
- [Sheldon] Anybody hungry?
- [Angie] I could drink.

718
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,916
- [Sheldon] What's around here?
- I saw a Big Boy by the highway.

719
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,208
- [Sheldon] Ooh, they have a gay bar here?
- [Angie] I love Big Boy.

720
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,625
Oh, gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed.

721
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,208
- Oh! Of course.
- [both chuckle]

722
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,166
- So, it's nice to see Emma smile again.
- Yes.

723
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,875
She's had a rough go of it.

724
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,416
I gathered that. Yeah.

725
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,166
- Even before the prom controversy.
- Oh?

726
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,375
When she came out, her parents,
well, they threw her out of the house.

727
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,916
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.

728
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:07,458
- It was, uh, pretty ugly.
- Oh…

729
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,000
Anyway, um…

730
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,458
Thank you for helping her…

731
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,166
- Or trying to.
- [both chuckle softly]

732
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,125
[Dee Dee] Yeah…

733
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,791
- Uh, Tom?
- Yes, yeah?

734
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:31,000
Is there a restaurant in town
that has plates and cutlery and…

735
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,833
Oh, uh, there's an Applebee's by the mall.

736

[gasps]

737
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,000
- Would you like to go?
- Yes.

738
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,666
Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.

739
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,666
- [giggles]
- All right.

740
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

Hello. I'm Dee Dee Allen.

- We haven't officially met.
- No.

- Hello. Dee Dee Allen.
- We're aware.

802
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:03,083
Ms. Allen, I'm sure that you are
very well-versed in the ways of the world

803
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:06,125
and Broadway in particular.
That's a community.

804
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But you don't know us.
You don't know this town and our values.

805
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,625
No, well, I'm just here
advocating on behalf of a young girl

806
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:20,333
whose voice perhaps is not heard
by some in the community.

807
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:26,458
Yes. Well, perhaps you should stick
to acting instead of activism.

836
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,791
It's just, I look at people like you,

837
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,333
and I just think how lucky you are
to be surrounded by your people.

838
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,291
My wh... My people? [chuckles]

839
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,250
I wasn't born on Broadway. You know?

840
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,625
I'm from Zelienople, Pennsylvania.

841
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,333
Yeah, I grew up dirt poor.

842
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:04,875
[clears throat]

843
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,333
This whole… [rolls tongue]

844
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,583
All this, I invented it.

845
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:15,291
Yeah. I'm just a small-town girl and…

846
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,000
- I had a big dream.
- Hmm.

847
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,041
Single, just putting it out there.

848
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,458
[both chuckle]

849
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,333
Well, I'm divorced.

850
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:33,208
Oh, I think I read about that.
Eddie Sharpe, the talk show host?

851
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,958
Yeah, right.

852
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:39,125
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing years.

853
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:46,375
I imagine it must be hard being
Dee Dee Allen, being a Broadway star.

854
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,041
You know, it is hard.

855
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,000
Sometimes I think I really…
I just want to quit.

856
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,666
No. No, please, you can't...
You can't do that.

857
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,208
[laughing] Why not?

858
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,958

- That's a nice picture.
- Oh, it's terrible.

901
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:57,000
Look at the backdrop.
Clouds? What, are we flying?

902
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:58,166
It's sweet.

903
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,000
Well…

904
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:04,250
You know, she needed proof
she was still part of the family,

905
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:07,750
and nothing says family
like a Sears family portrait.

906
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:11,458
- Is there booze in this?
- There sure is.

907
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:14,500
- [coughs] When you said lemonade…
- Well, it's Indiana lemonade.

908
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:18,541
Okay, it's official. I love you.
You're the cool grandmother I never had.

909
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:23,041
Hey, let me ask you something.
What happened with Emma?

910
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,250
[sighs]

911
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,833
You're not a mother,
so you can't know what it's like

912
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:30,375
to see your own daughter
give up her child.

913
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,791
I'm sorry.

914
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:36,000
When Emma came out,
oh, they could not handle it.

915
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,625
To bad parents and their broken progeny.

916
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,708
Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid.

917
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,625
[Barry] Mmm.

918
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,958
Oh, I wasn't talking about her.

919
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,875
What? You got kicked out too?

920
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,125
Well, I left before they could do that.

921
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,708
[Emma] So the only
nice dress I have is this.

922
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,666
Wow.

923
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:08,375
Okay, I mean, yeah, yep,
you could wear that to prom

924
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:09,583
or keep it lying around

925
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:12,083
in case there's a remake of
<i>Little House on the Prairie.</i>

926
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:14,875
Okay. That's it. I like him.

927
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:17,458
Emma, please let me
dress you for this prom.

928
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:22,500
I don't know. This is all so crazy.
What did you wear to your prom?

929
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,916
Well, I was going to wear a silver tux,

930
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:29,333
<i>aqua accessories, the whole look.</i>

931
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:32,500
<i>I waited outside, anxious to see my crush,</i>

932
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:35,333
<i>but when I saw him with his date, I froze.</i>

933
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,416
<i>I couldn't go in.</i>

934
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,291
<i>I didn't have your courage.</i>

935
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,666
This isn't about me.

936
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,041
This is about you.

937
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,625
And I promise you are going
to have the night of your life.

938
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,500
What is your date wearing?

939
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,750
I don't know.

940
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,583
I've never been to her house before.

941
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,916
Her mom doesn't know about us.

942
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,083
How long have you been together?

943
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,541
- A year and a half.
- Oh, honey.

944
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:07,250
But she's coming out tonight, big time.
That's the plan.

945
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,583
I'm really scared.

946
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,166
Would you get over here?

947
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:17,708
The point is you are brave.

948
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,875
You made all this happen.

949
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:23,041
When you walk into that gym tonight,
you know what people are gonna see?

950
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,875
They're going to see
the bravest person on the planet.

951
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,625
This is so hard.
Does every girl go through this?

952
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:31,625
Yes, all across town,

953
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:35,125
<i>girls are spraying on their tans
and whitening their teeth,</i>

954
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:38,791
<i>trying to look their best for the prom,
but they're wasting their time</i>

955
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:42,500
because they don't have the glow
that you have right now.

956
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:47,375
I trust you completely,
and that's kind of scary too.

957
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:50,041
Can we please go shop? Can we mall it?

958
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,708
- Is that okay?
- Yes, mall the hell out of it!

959
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,333
- Let's go.
- Okay!

960
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,708

But you're not alone. You're not.

1170
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,041
You got me. Hmm?

1171
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:29,666
And we are ride-or-die,
and you do have friends.

1172
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:31,708
Where are they?

1173
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,291
- [Dee Dee] This is it.
- [Trent] Yes.

1174
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,750
- No.
- Well, okay.

1175
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:44,916
[knocking on door]

1176
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,875
- [doorbell rings]
- [knocking at door]

1177
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,125
- Emma, can we come in?
- Yes.

1178
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,708
- We brought Häagen-Dazs.
- [Trent] That's fancy ice cream.

1179
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:55,666
I know what Häagen-Dazs is. Hand it over.

1180
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,500
Emma, I know you said
you didn't want us to help anymore,

1181
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:02,291
but we cannot let them get away with this.
We have got to fight back.

1182
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,583
Okay, I know everybody's really angry.

1183
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:09,083
But I think we have to admit
that we have made things worse.

1184
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:13,666
I think the best thing we can do
is disinfect our things and go back home.

1185
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,500
- No, we are not leaving.
- No!

1186
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:19,958
Dee Dee, we are gonna stay here,
and we're going to turn this thing around.

1187
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,250
- We gotta take back the press.
- [Trent] Yes, how?

1188
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:26,000
Emma, you've got to step up
and be the face of this thing.

1189
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,750
And that's going to get her a prom?

1190
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:31,541
This is not about a prom anymore.
This is about right and wrong.

1191
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,375
We need a national audience, prime time.

1192
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:37,500
You want a big audience fast?
We gotta use our ace in the hole.

1193
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:41,125
- One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need.
- No. No.

1194
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:42,416
- [Trent] Dee Dee!
- He's right.

1195
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,541
If I ask him for something,
he will want something in return,

1196
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,375
and what he will want
is the Hamptons house.

1197
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,958
He's been trying to get it for years.

1198
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:53,541
Okay. Okay, fine. Look, Sheldon,
you got to get that girl on TV.

1199
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,000
- Okay.
- Great.

1200
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,000
No, not great.

1201
01:05:57,083 --> 01:06:00,333
I'm sorry, but there is no way
I'm getting in front of a camera

1202
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:03,375
and telling my story
to millions of people. I can't do that.

1203
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:07,500
- See?
- Please. Please, just go.

1204
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:11,875
- Emma, if you do nothing... Okay.
- Barry. Go.

1205
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:17,166
- Okay, I get it. Okay. Okay.
- [Angie] Go. Go, go, go. Go, go.

1206
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,291
[whispering] I got this.
I know what I'm doing.

1207
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,041
Let me do my thing.

1208
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:26,958
There must be a way to rid this community,
and by extension, the nation,

1209
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:28,500
of this cancer of intolerance.

1210
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,875
What are you even doing here?
What happened to<i> Godspell?</i>

1211
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:34,333
Indianapolis was canceled,
as was the naval base at Guantánamo Bay.

1212
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,208
What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this.

1213
01:06:36,291 --> 01:06:39,541
Venture forth and seek out
the young people and rap,

1214
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,041
in a non-musical sense.

1215
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:50,416
[Angie] Mmm.

1216
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,750
Let's go get some more, huh?

1217
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,833
Two spoons this time.

1218
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:00,916
Come on.

1219
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,166
[Angie] Gotta stop. [chuckling]

1220
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:11,791
Before you lecture me or kick me to death
with those crazy antelope legs of yours,

1221
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:15,583
or whatever you're gonna do,
I know I should do something.

1222
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:18,500
I just can't.

1223
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,125
You gotta do this.

1224
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:22,083
You gotta do it for all of us people

1225
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:25,791
that are standing in the wings,
waiting to go on.

1226
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:29,500
- I'm too scared.
- Hmm.

1227
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,083
Let me tell you a story.

1228
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,750
It's 1975

1229
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:40,041
and the original company of<i> Chicago</i>
is in previews,

1230
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:43,041
and the worst flu in history
hits the cast.

1231
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:47,291
They're down to the third cover
for the role of Roxie Hart

1232
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,291
and she's scared, just like you are.

1233
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:56,666
And Fosse, who is a real ballbuster,
is putting her through her paces

1234
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,458
and she's petrified.

1235
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,166
Worst of all, she's doing the routine
like she's a robot.

1236
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:07,625
So the Foss, he says,
"Hey, kid. Snap out of it."

1237
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,583
[jazz music playing]

1238
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:11,875
"You got the steps."

1239
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,250
"You've got the notes."

1240
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:18,833
"Where's the zazz, baby?"

1241
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:23,666
And even though
she'd never heard that word before,

1242
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,041
she knew immediately what it meant.

1243
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:29,375
And she went out there
and she found that spotlight,

1244
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:32,250
and she crushed that performance so hard,

1245
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:39,125
she had that whole audience standing
on their feet screaming bloody murder!

1246
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:40,041
[sighs]

1247
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:42,250
And that girl was you!

1248
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:44,125
What?

1249
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,375
How old do you think I am?

1250
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:50,666
It was 1975! No.

1251
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:56,541
The point is
every Fosse girl knows that story.

1252
01:08:56,625 --> 01:09:00,625

The thought of getting up

This is awkward.

1276
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,666
You don't understand the concept of zazz.

1277
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:37,583
The zazz is not the moves.
The zazz comes from within.

1278
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:41,708
Do the moves and give it some zazz.

1279
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,500
Close your eyes.

1280
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,625
Think about Mrs. Greene.

1281
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,541
Think about that fake prom.

1282
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:53,708
Now think of finally
doing something about it.

1283
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,833

01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:20,458
Oh, it's rom-com Friday.
Rom-com Friday is sacred.

1306
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:21,791
We should be helping Emma.

1307
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:25,458
- We gotta get her on TV.
- Sheldon is on it. Come on.

1308
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,458
- How does this work, anyway?
- [Barry] It's infrared.

1309
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,333
- It reduces inflammation.
- [Dee Dee] Oh, good.

1310
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,791
But you can't keep it on too long.
It'll blow your face off.

01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,541
Saw this movie with Eddie.

1316
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,541
- It was our first date.
- [Barry] Was it really?

1317
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,083
- Yeah.
- [Barry] Mmm.

1318
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:01,416
Then he… took me out for dinner after.

1319
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:04,875
Well, I took him out. [chuckles]

1320
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,250
He didn't have any money.

1321
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:11,416
He was just starting out in comedy,
and he didn't have the big show like now.

1322
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,291
Fifteen years, he didn't have any money.

1323
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,750
And I picked up the tab. I paid.

1324
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,625
- [Barry] That was a bad move.
- [Dee Dee] No kidding. I'm still paying.

1325

[Dee Dee sighs]

1326
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,125
Can I make an observation?

1327
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:36,333
[sighs] Is it a pleasant observation
or is it an irritating one?

1328
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:37,625
You're not over him.

1329
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,500
No, don't say that. I am not…

1330
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,750
Trust me. I am…

01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,041
[chuckling] I am way over him.

1332
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:47,875
I'm just mad at myself, you know, I am so…

1333
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,666
Why it took me so long to…

1334
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:53,166
Figure it out.

1335
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:58,000
You know? I believed him.
I believed him every single time.

1336
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,083
"I promise you, it's nothing."

1337
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,916
"It's meaningless.
She's nothing to me. It's over."

1338
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:08,541
I finally got the message, you know.
He didn't love me. [chuckles]

1339
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:11,750
He didn't…

1340
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:14,791
[chuckling] He didn't even like me.

1341
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:18,041
But he liked the money.

1342
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,625
Oh, yeah, so I got out.

1343
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,375
I got out…

1344
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,416
And I gave him half my money.

1345
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,916
And now here we are, singing to trucks.

1346
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
<i>- And he's got a hit TV show.</i>
- [audience cheering]

1347
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,708
<i>And I still owe him
half my unemployment check.</i>

1348
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:38,791
[announcer on TV] <i>It's Eddie Sharpe!</i>

1349
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:40,125
[Eddie] <i>Whoa, hey!</i>

1350
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,291
<i>Welcome, everybody!
What's today's words of wisdom?</i>

1351
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,875
[Eddie and audience] <i>Never sign a prenup!</i>

1352
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:47,666
[all laughing through TV]

1353
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:53,291
And you know what the worst part is?

1354
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,000
I shut down.

1355
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:03,250
He took my little,
delicate blueberry heart,

1356
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,916
and he just… squished it.

1357
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,500
[Dee Dee sniffles]

1358
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,375
- What?
- Here's what you're gonna do, okay?

1359
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:18,041
You're gonna wear something
heart-stopping, like that yellow cape

1360
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,750
and those cute little boots.

1361
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:21,583
And you are gonna march down

1362
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:25,583
to that principal's office
like a bad, bad girl.

1363
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,333
[chuckling] Tom?

1364
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,791
- Tom is a fan. Friend.
- [Barry] Hmm?

1365
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,041
Well…

1366
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,375
He likes you.

1367
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,250
As a fan. Friend.

1368
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:40,083
I don't know.
Not even that much anymore.

1369
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,583
Okay, let's cut the crap.
I would kill, <i>kill,</i>

1370
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,416
to have a guy look at me
the way that he looks at you.

1371
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Stop it.

1372
01:15:48,416 --> 01:15:52,666
You're just…
You're poking my heart with your finger.

1373
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:56,416
Your still-beating,
delicate little blueberry heart?

1374
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,916
Do you think he really, really likes me?

1375
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,083
Oh, my God, yes!

1376
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:09,416
Barry! [kisses]

1377
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,125
[laughing]

1378
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,166
- I love you! I love you!
- I love you! I love you!

1379
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,541
You're just such a great… everything.

1380
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,333
[laughing]

1381
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,083
[Dee Dee] Okay, no, no, no. Okay.

1382
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,083
This, the master stroke, your idea.

1383
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:26,625
- And the boots?
- And the little cute boots.

1384
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:27,666
[chuckling]

1385
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:29,833
This is it.

1386
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:32,708
Oh!

1387
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,458
That is good.

1388
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,875
Mmm, now…

1389
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:43,666
You.

1390
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,791
I've been thinking about you
since we got here.

1391
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,791
Oh, God. I knew this was gonna
somehow turn around to me.

1392
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:57,250
And I think it's time somebody poked
that gay little heart of yours.

1393
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,250
Are we doing this? Fine. Uh…

1394
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:02,666
Do I only go for 10s
when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and...

1395
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:06,083
Your parents. You're from Ohio, right?

1396
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:07,416
So?

1397
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,666
We're in Indiana.

1398
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,500
- Ohio, Indiana, they're close.
- I can see where you're driving this.

1399
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,958
You have two living parents

1400
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:19,291
that you'll never be nearer to
than you are right now.

1401
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,166
- I think you should call them.
- No.

1402
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,416
They threw me away.

1403
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,750
Well, did they really?

1404
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,250
I told them that I was gay,

1405
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:32,166
and they said that they would take me
to therapy to change myself completely.

1406
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:37,875
Let your parents see who you are
before it's too late.

1407
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,708
If you don't…

1408
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,750
You'll regret it.

1409
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:48,250
I'm not the one who should have regrets.

1410
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,875
[voice breaking] I was the kid.

1411
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:54,208
I was the kid!

1412
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:57,958
[crying] I was 16.

1413
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,458
Sixteen years old. I was terrified.

1414
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,000
Terrified!

1415
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:11,166
And I needed one thing from them
and they couldn't give it to me.

1416
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,125
So don't you…

1417
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:14,791
[sobbing]

1418
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,875
[school bell ringing]

Well, they each had a bite.

1425
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,791
- Ooh, what'd you do?
- [Principal Hawkins] Yeah, a big bite.

1426
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,875
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.

[Dee Dee chuckles softly]

1428
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:56,083
Am I interrupting something?

1429
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:58,041
{\an8}I was just doing some research,

1430
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:01,333
{\an8}trying to figure out
if urinal cakes are poisonous.

1431
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,125
- Uh, how can I help you?
- [chuckles softly]

1432
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:09,750
Well, I've just been wandering
around town all day.

1433
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,250
[chuckles]

1434
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:15,125
I've seen the… sight. [chuckles softly]

1435
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:16,708
And, um…

1436
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:23,125
Bottom line is I just thought
you might want to take me to dinner

1437
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:26,041
and worship me again. [chuckles]

1438
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,750
No, I would not like to do that.

1439
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,291
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

1440
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:33,625
Okay, what's going on here?
Why is everybody always so mad at me?

1441
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:37,583
Well, speaking for myself,
it's because you're an opportunist.

1442
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,583
You came here for publicity.
You're a terrible person.

1443
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:43,041
No, no. Nobody gets to
talk to me that way. Nobody!

1444
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You know, meeting you in person
has been colossally disappointing.

[scoffs]

1446
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,083
I wanted you to be Dolores.

[Principal Hawkins] <i>She was joyful.</i>
<i>She was full of courage and hope.</i>

1451
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:01,625
- Okay, but she was fictional.
- But you made her real.

1452
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,833
When you sang
"The Lady's Improving" to Troy Gibson,

1453
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:09,125
you were admitting you weren't perfect
and you knew you could be better,

1454
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,875
and that's why
he didn't fire you from the circus act.

1455
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:15,791
Such humility and dignity.

1456
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,916
- That's who I thought you were.
- Well, I'm not.

1457
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,541
I'm not Dolores.

1458
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:28,041
I'm just a really, really,
really good actress. And you…

1459
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:30,916
You're just some hick town

between fantasy and reality.

1503
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:31,125
I'm not a total lost cause.
That was a totally selfless act.

1504
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:34,166
I mean, people would pay
premium prices for that performance.

1505
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,750

1506
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:40,958
Dee Dee, not charging for an apology

What the hell?

1508
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:47,125
If you want people to like you
instead of hate you, you have to be good.

1509
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:51,291
A good person. You have to put
other people's interests before your own.

1510
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:55,375
[scoffs] You don't understand.
I am a celebrity.

1511
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:58,958
It is all about me.
It has been for decades. [chuckling]

1512
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:03,833
That's the point of celebrity.
So I have to be reprogrammed.

1513
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,583
I have to unlearn things
like shoving and taking.

1514

- Yes.

1515
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:11,000
I need help with that. I need a…

Hi.

1523
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,333
Thanks for meeting me.
I was afraid you wouldn't come...

1524
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:56,250
What do you want?

1525
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:59,291
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- Were you in on it?

1526
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,708
Emma! You know me.

1527
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:02,750
Do I?

1528
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:05,250
What is this?

1529
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:07,500
What are we?

1530
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,583
- No, you know what we are.
- No, I don't.

1531
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,625
Do you know what it was like

1532
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:15,541
standing there in that stupid dress
alone in the gym,

1533
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:19,625
knowing that people got together
and planned the best way to hurt me?

1534
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:22,458
- That must've been awful.
- It was.

1535
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,000
But the worst part…

1536
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:32,208
The worst part was that you didn't come
even though you knew what happened.

1537
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:36,750
You didn't come and try and hold my hand
or take me out of there.

1538
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:38,416
- I couldn't, okay?
- Why?

1539
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,791
You know what my mother is like.

1540
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,458

Hey, look.
It's that guy from <i>Talk to the Hand.</i>

1576
01:28:29,958 --> 01:28:35,208
Hey, guys. I was just taking a walk,
enjoying the sweet scent of Americana.

1577
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:36,458
We're not interested.

1578
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:40,208
I feel like
there's an ideological divide between us,

1579
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:44,208
but if we got to know each other,
we could bridge it, right?

1580
01:28:44,291 --> 01:28:45,958
So I'll start.

1581
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,458
I'm Trent. I'm an actor.

- [Kaylee] Me?
- Yes. Why do you hate gay people?

- Yeah. Yeah, we all are.

- [girl] We go to church.
- Yeah, we're Christian.

1589

Well, I'm sure there are a lot of rules
in the Bible that you break every day.

Well, that's different.

Is it?

1592
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:24,583
You can't cherry-pick the Bible,
choosing which parts you want to believe.

1593
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:26,250
[Kaylee] We don't do that.

<i>♪ Of mine ♪</i>

1824
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,708
This is too much.
It's too much for my heart.

1825
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:51,208
That's why I wanted you guys to see it.
I've never been more proud.

1826
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,791
- So when is the prom?
- There's no money left.

1827
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:56,750
- What? What do you mean?
- We already had a prom, remember?

1828
01:43:56,833 --> 01:43:57,666
[Angie groans]

1829
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,375
[Principal Hawkins]
There could be a miracle. It's early.

1830
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:01,500
[Barry sighs]

1831
01:44:02,625 --> 01:44:05,125
Okay, people,
it's Mickey and Judy time. Okay?

1832
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:07,375
This is the part
where we roll up our sleeves

1833
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,708
and we put on a prom
with our own bare hands.

1834
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:13,791
- We are giving Emma the prom she deserves.
- Okay, wait a minute.

1835
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:17,041
How much are we talking about?
What does a prom cost?

1836
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:18,000
[sputters]

1837
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:20,000
I mean,
it's not a school-sanctioned event,

1838
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:21,958
so we have to pay
a rental fee on the gym.

1839
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:22,916
DJ.

1840
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,541
- Lighting.
- Sound system.

1841
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:27,083
[Principal Hawkins]
It's still thousands of dollars.

1842
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,166
Right. Um…

1843
01:44:32,166 --> 01:44:34,125
Okay, here.

1844
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:38,000
Charge that until it declines,
which will be soon.

1845
01:44:38,083 --> 01:44:41,500
I had to declare bankruptcy
after my self-produced <i>Notes on a Scandal.</i>

1846
01:44:42,208 --> 01:44:43,750
[Angie] Yes. Well…

1847
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:47,750
I don't have a credit card anymore
because I…

1848
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,166
Well, I just… [exhales]

1849
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:54,333
But, anyway, you can have what I have
in my Venmo and there's my cash.

1850
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:55,458
It's all yours.

1851
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:57,583
- Thanks, Angie. [chuckles]
- Sure.

1852
01:44:57,666 --> 01:45:00,958
Okay. This is my card
from the Actors Federal Credit Union.

1853
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:03,458
Just cross your fingers and swipe.

1854
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:08,416
All right. Well, we're making
some progress here. This is a nice start.

1855
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,458
Um…

1856
01:45:09,541 --> 01:45:12,000
{\an8}- We still have a long way to go.
- [Angie] Mmm-hmm.

1857
01:45:15,125 --> 01:45:16,291
[Angie clears throat]

1858
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:19,416
- Dee Dee. Dee Dee?
- What?

1859
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,291
Oh, come on. I know you've got
an American Express black card in there.

1860
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:24,875
There's no limit on that baby.

1861
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:30,000
Please, please, no.
I already gave a house.

1862
01:45:30,083 --> 01:45:32,833
Exactly, so this is nothing. Come on.

1863
01:45:34,791 --> 01:45:36,166
[seductively] Eleanor.

1864
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:39,083
Franklin.

1865
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,333
[sighs]

1866
01:45:42,666 --> 01:45:49,625
[dramatically] Why does being good
cost so much… money?

1867
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:51,000
[all chuckling]

1868
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:53,000
- Well done, Dee Dee.
- [chuckles]

1869
01:45:53,083 --> 01:45:54,916
- [Trent] Yes!
- We're fully financed.

1870
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,875
- [Trent] Yeah!
- Okay, well, let's give this girl a prom!

1871
01:45:57,958 --> 01:45:59,875
- Yes!
- [Barry] Okay, let's do it!

1872
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:03,083
[Trent] The students will want to see us
perform some sort of number.

1873
01:46:03,166 --> 01:46:06,541
So, look, I…
I've been thinking hard about this.

1874
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:07,458
[Barry] Mmm.

1875
01:46:07,541 --> 01:46:10,250
That thing
that you and I were talking about.

1876
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:13,750
- I called your mother.
- What?

1877
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,875
Yeah, I found her number in your phone.

1878
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:19,750
How did you know my passcode?

1879
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:23,500
Well, I guessed. 9481. Beyoncé's birthday.

1880
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:26,041
[chuckling] Got it on the first try.

1881
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:30,041
- Well, why would you do that?
- Because, Barry…

1882
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:35,625
- I know you couldn't do it on your own.
- What did she say?

1883
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:38,625
Well, I think
maybe you should let her tell you that.

1884
01:46:39,583 --> 01:46:40,583
[Vera] Hi, Barry.

1885
01:46:42,291 --> 01:46:46,208
Okay. I'm gonna give you some space,
and I'll be in the faculty lounge, okay?

1886
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:53,583
No. No, you…
You don't get to do this. Okay?

1887
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:57,875
You don't get to show up
out of nowhere. Okay? No. Uh-uh.

1888
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:59,500
I came all this way, Barry.

1889
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:02,083
Well, you can just turn around
and go right back, okay?

1890
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:03,791
You called me, didn't you?

1891
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,666
That was you who called
and hung up, wasn't it?

1892
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:11,958
[sighs]

1893
01:47:12,708 --> 01:47:17,541
I handled this all wrong, honey.
And I'm so sorry.

1894
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:19,666
Okay. You just… stay…

1895
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:26,500
When you told us what you were,
who you were,

1896
01:47:27,916 --> 01:47:31,000
your father and I, we were scared.

1897
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:32,583
We hardly knew what gay meant.

1898
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:35,666
We both thought
that somehow we had failed you,

1899
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,458
like maybe it was our fault.

1900
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:41,166
- So it's okay now?
- [sighs]

1901
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,041
What I needed was a mother
who didn't know if it was okay

1902
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:45,666
but loved me anyway.

1903
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:49,958
You think you were scared?
How do you think I felt?

1904
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:53,083
[sobbing] I know, Barry.
I failed you and I know.

1905
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:57,083
That's gonna be on my heart
till the day I die.

1906
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:02,958
[voice breaking] But all I can say is
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

1907
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,666
What about Dad? Is he here?

1908
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:11,833
Uh, no. He's just not…

1909
01:48:13,375 --> 01:48:14,541
He's not there yet.

1910
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:16,541
I'm sorry to say.

1911
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:18,458
Oh, Barry.

1912
01:48:20,416 --> 01:48:25,250
Please forgive me.
I've missed you so much.

1913
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,250
[crying] I missed you too.

1914
01:48:32,541 --> 01:48:33,583
I did.

1915
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:37,125
I missed you too. I missed you.

1916
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:39,125
[both sobbing]

1917
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:46,125
<i>♪ Then you came along
And right or wrong… ♪</i>

1918
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:50,166
- Aren't you tired of watching that?
- Eight million people have seen it.

1919
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:52,583
I just don't understand it.

1920
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:54,416
Well, I think it's brave.

1921
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:56,041
[sighs]

1922
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:58,833
The kids are saying
there's gonna be another prom.

1923
01:48:58,916 --> 01:49:01,000
- [scoffs]
- Someone's offered to pay for it.

1924
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:03,750
Who?

1925
01:49:04,958 --> 01:49:07,208
This is so generous of you guys.

1926
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,958
We had to do something
after you broke the Internet.

1927
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:13,000
It was crazy.
The numbers just kept going up,

1928
01:49:13,083 --> 01:49:16,333
and then the <i>Indiana Star</i> called,
and then the <i>Washington Post...</i>

1929
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,833
Hello, everyone.

1930
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:20,041
Can't have a prom without flowers.

1931
01:49:20,125 --> 01:49:22,083
So I will put these out on the table,

1932
01:49:22,166 --> 01:49:24,166
even though I'd rather just
give them all to you.

1933
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:26,458
- [Angie] Oh, my God!
- [Barry] Is this for real?

1934
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:31,750
Can I just say you guys are
the best middle-aged people I've ever met.

1935
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,333
[exhales]

1936
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:35,166
That is…

1937
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,916
Oh, honey…

1938
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:41,250
We need to talk to you
about something, okay? And I think it's…

1939
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:44,541
It's important that you understand

1940
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:47,916
the real reason
why we came here to visit you.

1941
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,250
- It wasn't for the Hoosier pie?
- [chuckles]

1942
01:49:50,333 --> 01:49:52,208
Well, I mean, um…

1943
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,541
- We were in a show.
- A wonderful show.

1944
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:58,875
Well, I mean…

1945
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:02,541
[hesitating]
And we got blasted by the critics.

1946
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:05,916
They called us narcissists, and it hurt.

1947
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,916
And it hurt
because I guess they were right.

1948
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:14,250
So we looked around for a cause
that might give us some credibility.

1949
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:16,625
[chuckling] Maybe get us some good press.

1950
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:19,458
Like building
a house for Habitat for Humanity.

1951
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:22,208
Then we realized that
we're not capable of building anything.

1952
01:50:22,291 --> 01:50:23,958
And then I found you on Twitter.

1953
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:27,666
I mean, it was just dumb luck,
but meant to be.

1954
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:32,583
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but…

1955
01:50:33,333 --> 01:50:35,541
You're going to build something.

1956
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,375
- You're going to build a prom.
- [all chuckling]

1957
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:40,416
Stop it! Stop this, please!

1958
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:43,041
Who gave you people
permission to be in here?

1959
01:50:43,125 --> 01:50:46,208
- I did.
- You should have consulted with the PTA.

1960
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:49,958
Well, this is not a school event, so
I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval.

1961
01:50:50,541 --> 01:50:54,375
I'm going to be
as clear as I possibly can.

1962
01:50:55,416 --> 01:50:58,208
Your beliefs are not our beliefs.

1963
01:50:58,291 --> 01:51:00,166
Hey, Emma. Can we talk to you?

1964
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:09,083
I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.

1965
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:13,416
You deserve to go to prom
just like any other kid.

1966
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:17,500
What? I thought you hated me.
I thought you all hated me.

1967
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:18,916
Oh, they hated you.

1968
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,208
They hated you with a burning passion
stoked by centuries of intolerance

1969
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:25,291
and the lack of a drama program.

1970
01:51:25,375 --> 01:51:26,791
I'm sorry, too, Emma.

1971
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,583
You know, you explain things really well.
You should be, like, a teacher.

1972
01:51:32,666 --> 01:51:35,666
- Oh, you should be our drama teacher!
- [girl] Yes, please!

1973
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,416
You should do it. Do it.

1974
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,666
- You're hired!
- I'm a teacher!

1975
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:42,583
- As a temp.
- Absolutely.

1976
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:45,125
No, no, no! This is...
This is what I was afraid of.

1977
01:51:45,208 --> 01:51:46,875
- Mom!
- Let me finish!

1978
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:50,416
No, you have got to stop talking
and just listen, okay?

1979
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,166
People don't turn gay.

1980
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,291
They are who they are.

1981
01:51:56,375 --> 01:51:58,541
No. You don't know what you're saying.

1982
01:51:58,625 --> 01:51:59,625
I do.

1983
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:01,333
I do.

1984
01:52:03,541 --> 01:52:07,583
Look, I know how you were raised,
