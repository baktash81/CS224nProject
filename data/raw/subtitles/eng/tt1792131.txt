1
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:48,056
Move 'em out, boys!

2
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,119
[indistinct chatter]

3
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,859
- [man 1] Let's go!
- [dog barking]

4
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,659
[man 2] Move it out!

5
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,352
[owl hooting]

6
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:31,037
Tonight... is the night.

7
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,298
[hooting]

8
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:36,969
All Hallow's Eve.
The moon is full.

9
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:40,775
I'll show all those fools
just how powerful

10
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:43,715
Warwick the Warlock really is!

11
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,116
[hooting] Master, you are the evilest.

12
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,350
Yes, I am.

13
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,287
Excuse me, Mr. Hoot, sir?

14
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,458
When do we get to meet
the Howlloween Hound?

15
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,661
I think Master's almost ready.

16
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,672
- [barking]
- The manor!

17
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,575
That no-good Warwick.
He must have the puppies.

18
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,012
- [barking]
- Give me those bolt cutters.

19
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,017
[barking]

20
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,324
Drat.

21
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,127
We must hurry. [hiccups]

22
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:18,904
Howlloween Hound
on All Hallow's Eve...

23
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,243
...with the moon full and bright,

24
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,806
open a portal beyond light.

25
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:30,083
Call three times to summon
a hound of great might.

26
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:35,083
The souls of five puppies
you shall have on this night.

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,494
Howlloween Hound.

28
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,491
Howlloween Hound!

29
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:50,968
To our side, Howlloween Hound!

30
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:57,281
Who dares summon me?

31
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,784
I do, Hound.

32
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,286
Warwick the Great.

33
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,184
I have the five puppy souls
of the same blood.

34
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:11,196
I believe they are
what you need to open the portal.

35
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,131
And why should I open
the portal for you?

36
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,795
Because together we shall unleash

37
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:20,795
all the creatures
of the underworld on Fernfield.

38
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:25,971
And then you and I
shall rule the land, Hound.

39
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,808
I like the sound of that.

40
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:32,511
But we only have this Halloween night,
while the moon is full.

41
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,821
The Howlloween Hound will see you now.

42
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,452
Let me go first.

43
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,422
- [man 1] Come on, boys.
- [man 2] Here we go now.

44
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,630
- Be careful, guys.
- OK, watch your backs, boys.

45
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,370
Pip! We have to find him, Dad!
He's my best friend!

46
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,507
We will, Joseph.

47
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:01,775
Grab that tree trunk.

48
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,249
We have to break down the door.

49
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:07,843
Pip!

50
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:13,185
I've changed my mind. I don't wanna
go with the Howlloween Hound.

51
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:16,058
Master, the puppy
doesn't want to go now.

52
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:19,189
All I wanted was a wise owl.

53
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,723
And I seem to have got a moronic parrot.

54
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,928
- You're next.
- [biting]

55
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,665
[yelling]

56
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,197
You can't escape!

57
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,152
He's catching up to me!

58
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:48,256
Might as well accept your fate!

59
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,526
[evil laughter] Got you!

60
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,904
[dog whining]

61
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,564
- Pip!
- [barking]

62
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,972
Stay back!

63
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,031
Stop, Warwick!

64
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:08,109
Stay back or I will
turn you all into toads!

65
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:10,048
Stay back!

66
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,913
- [growling]
- [croaking]

67
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,891
Soon you will all be my slaves!

68
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,934
Son!

69
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,437
- Deputy Tracker...
- [growls]

70
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,870
...after him!

71
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,605
Quickly, Hound. Dawn is here!

72
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,271
Take the last puppy.

73
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,541
I'm fading.

74
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,276
Complete the spell!

75
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,113
[howling]

76
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,785
Pip!

77
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:57,154
There's nothing I despise more
than petulant young children!

78
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,663
- Let me go!
- [screams]

79
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:00,029
No! Pip!

80
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,567
- [barking]
- [yelling]

81
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:07,370
[groaning] The sun! My eyes!

82
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,108
[grunting]

83
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,613
Hound! Open the portal!

84
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:19,709
I need all five puppy souls.
It's too late, Warwick.

85
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,285
It's over, Warwick.

86
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,657
You're under arrest.
Enough of your black magic.

87
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:28,956
You're through.

88
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:30,155
Never.

89
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,664
I'll take this town
under my control one day.

90
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,965
Mark my words. I'll be back!

91
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,993
[yelling]

92
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,801
What in tarnation just happened?

93
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,341
[sobbing] Dad,
look what they did to Pip.

94
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,484
This is a statue, son.

95
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,885
No, it's Pip.
We have to turn Pip back.

96
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,197
Joseph, I'm right here.

97
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,426
[gasping]

98
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:14,333
We have to get out
of this place now.

99
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,299
[Joseph] No.

100
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,068
Come on, son. Let's go.

101
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,199
Wait. Why are you afraid?
It's just me, Pip.

102
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,760
[indistinct chatter]

103
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,805
What happened, Sheriff?

104
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,739
I don't know.

105
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,437
But hopefully it won't happen again.

106
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,683
Oh, no! I'm trapped in here.

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,354
This home is officially condemned.

108
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,356
- [man 1] Good idea!
- [man 2] About time!

109
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,694
Let's board it up, boys!

110
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,563
I don't want anyone going in.

111
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:17,163
[crowd murmuring]

112
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,267
[hooting]

113
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,984
<i>[woman] It was 75 years ago</i>
</i>that the Manor was boarded up.</i>

114
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:41,052
No one is exactly sure
what happened that night

115
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,824
or whether the legend
is even true at all.

116
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:48,761
But it's an interesting part
of Fernfield folklore, regardless.

117
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,268
I can't wait for tonight.

118
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,795
Halloween is my favorite
event of the year, paws down.

119
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:56,968
You do a trick and
you're guaranteed to get a treat.

120
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,477
It's trick or treat, Budderball.

121
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,808
Even better!

122
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,315
For me, it's all about the costume.

123
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,111
I can't wait to dress up.

124
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,313
Kids go in there every Halloween...

125
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:12,414
...and they say the Howlloween Hound's
name three times in the mirror.

126
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,481
They're never seen again.

127
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:14,993
Where did you hear that?

128
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,791
Come on. He's just trying to scare us.

129
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,994
No. No, it's true.
And he gets their pets too.

130
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,559
Once you hear the Hound's howl...
it's too late.

131
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,198
Either way, this place
gives me the creeps.

132
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,240
[howling]

133
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,381
- [both laughing]
- [all] Oh, my gosh.

134
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,345
OK, Rodney and Skip,
no more tricks.

135
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,819
- Good one.
- Come along, children.

136
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,186
Onto the bus!

137
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,818
We have one more stop
on our spooky Fernfield tour.

138
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,054
[giggling]

139
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,229
Come on, get the lead out.

140
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,788
Come on, let's go.
Let's get on the bus.

141
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,366
[Rodney] You should have seen
the look on their faces.

142
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,732
Where's B-Dawg hiding?

143
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,741
I wasn't hiding, yo.

144
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,947
I was just getting ready
to pounce on that Hound.

145
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,818
Yeah, right, dude.

146
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,553
You were hiding like a scaredy-cat,
'cause you thought there was a ghost.

147
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,495
Pshaw, dawg.
B-Dawg is afraid of nothing,

148
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,498
especially no ghost!

149
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,228
Then why are you afraid to go
trick-or-treating tonight?

150
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,065
[all laughing]

151
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,729
Nice one, dude!

152
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,932
Fine. I'll prove it.

153
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,169
I'll go in there right now,
call out that Howlloween Hound,

154
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,372
and kick his tail, yo.

155
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,949
B-Dawg, wait.
Where are you going?

156
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,192
Whoa! This place is really creepy.

157
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:06,564
A pup? What is he doing in here?

158
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:10,269
Come on, guys. We can't leave
B-Dawg in there by himself.

159
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,823
[nervously laughing]
See? It's not too scary.

160
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,118
[chandelier clinking]

161
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,960
Did you guys just see that?

162
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,261
See what?

163
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:37,132
A strange glow, like a ghost.

164
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,797
Uh, nice one, dawg.

165
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,136
Maybe we just oughta leave.

166
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:47,475
Ha! Look who's the 'fraidy cat now,
big tough Budderball.

167
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,980
We must respect
the spirits of the night.

168
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,610
Ghosts are lost souls
that can't find their way to heaven.

169
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,587
B-Dawg the Brave, here I go.

170
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,992
[Rosebud] B-Dawg!

171
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,056
Let's reel him in
before we get in trouble.

172
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,876
This is the great
Deputy Tracker's grave...

173
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,411
[kids murmuring]

174
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,879
...one of the best canine officers
our town ever saw.

175
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,210
[boy 1] What? Where?

176
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,150
[woman] He had a nose for crime.

177
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,644
If there was evidence,
he had the best sniffer in town.

178
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,521
- He could just smell it.
- [screams]

179
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,614
[boy 2] What?

180
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,496
- Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson!
- Whoa.

181
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,300
That's the caretaker.

182
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,633
He's been running this place
as long as I can remember.

183
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,537
Yo, dawgs, did you see
that creepy old guy?

184
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,665
Yeah, that dude's, like, spook central.

185
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:52,405
OK, let's continue on, children.

186
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,186
[gulping]

187
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,224
Here we go, B-Dawg.

188
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,136
Just say it three times,
and it will all be over.

189
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,272
[stuttering] Howlloween Hound.

190
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,115
Howlloween Hound.

191
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,555
OK, nothing happened. Let's go!

192
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,753
Stop, please! Don't say it!

193
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:47,060
It's a ghost!

194
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,033
Let's get out of here, dudes!

195
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,558
Come on, B-Dawg. Run!

196
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,567
Don't say it again!
You'll release them!

197
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,905
[screaming]

198
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:05,607
You're... you're the Howlloween Hound!

199
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,448
Oh, no! You said it three times!

200
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:12,048
[screaming] Run for your life!

201
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,823
Wait!

202
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,437
Wait! I'm not the Howlloween Hound!

203
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,134
[screaming] The ghost is on my tail!

204
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,165
[hooting]

205
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,888
Yo, that was a ghost, dawgs!

206
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,828
A real off-the-chain ghoul!

207
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,662
Dudes, was that the Howlloween Hound?

208
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:59,363
I said Howlloween Hound
three times into the mirror, dawgs.

209
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,430
I released the Howlloween Hound!

210
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,100
Could it really be true?

211
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,111
They've released Master
after all these years?

212
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,343
B-Dawg is correct, although
he was smaller than I'd imagined.

213
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,146
Whatever it was, we are outta there.

214
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,313
And I, for one, am never going back.

215
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,186
Come on. Let's catch up to our kids.

216
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,588
[haunted house sounds]

217
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,862
Now, I know you're all excited
about trick-or-treating tonight,

218
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,838
but let's not forget that your Fernfield
history projects are due Monday.

219
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:34,896
Monday?

220
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,034
What a bonehead.

221
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,941
Yes, Billy. Is that a problem?

222
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,378
It's been assigned
for the last two weeks.

223
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:46,350
Oh! Oh, that project!

224
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,182
Yeah, I totally finished mine.

225
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,052
Great, Billy.
What subject did you choose?

226
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,626
I, uh...

227
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,958
The Curse of the Howlloween Hound.

228
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,928
Perhaps your project might
finally answer

229
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,161
whether the legend is true or not.

230
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,227
Oh, oh, definitely!

231
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,863
OK, class dismissed.

232
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,966
[high-pitched giggling]
Happy Halloween!

233
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,400
- Bye.
- Wow.

234
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,536
What am I gonna do?

235
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,413
If I don't pass this project,
I'm gonna be history!

236
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,883
What do you mean, Billy?

237
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,580
Sounds like you've got
a great spooky topic.

238
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,248
I just picked the first thing
that came into my head.

239
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:27,191
I totally forgot about
this history project.

240
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,249
Uh-oh.

241
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,853
I don't even know if I'll be able to go
trick-or-treating tonight.

242
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,761
Now, that's a disaster.

243
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,765
You know, if the police were involved,

244
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,199
then I bet Sheriff Dan knows
a thing or two about it.

245
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,602
- [all] Yeah.
- All right.

246
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,299
- Yeah, good idea.
- All right, let's go check it out.

247
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,396
- All right.
- Yeah, let's go.

248
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:48,471
The Howlloween Hound, yeah.
I've heard that spooky story

249
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,606
around the campfire once or twice.

250
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,446
Careful, kids,
there's a stair here that...

251
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,486
- [kids yelling]
- Yep, that's the one.

252
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,853
OK. Sheriff Jim kept all the evidence

253
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,550
from every case
he was ever on down here.

254
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,425
We're bound to find something
in these cold case files.

255
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,794
How are we gonna find
anything down here?

256
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:09,561
Don't worry, kids. I got this
entire room perfectly organized.

257
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,126
- [grunting]
- [clattering]

258
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,572
- That's been moved.
- [Billy] Uh-huh.

259
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,371
OK, we're looking for 1937.

260
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,812
- 1978.
- [Sheriff Dan] 1983.

261
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,941
1976. This could prove difficult.

262
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,720
Hey, I think this is it, Sheriff Dan!

263
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,017
- What?
- Yeah, check it out!

264
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,319
- Holy Dinah!
- Sweet!

265
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,122
That's good detective work, Billy.

266
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

267
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,990
Halloween, 1937.

268
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,396
- Whoa!
- Oh!

269
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,933
[Billy] No! No, wait, wait!

270
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,161
[Pete] Oh, dude.

271
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,693
- [groans]
- Uh... Wow.

272
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,865
OK... yep.

273
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,803
Thanks, Sheriff Dan.

274
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,302
Sweet.

275
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,872
- Whoa, that's cool.
- Whoa!

276
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:57,881
- What is that?
- Wow!

277
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,110
- Whoa.
- Sick.

278
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,651
That's quite the magic wand.

279
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:03,177
Hey, that'd be great
for my presentation.

280
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,085
Huh.

281
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,350
Do you think I could borrow it?

282
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,517
- [Bartleby] Yeah.
- [Pete] That's a good idea.

283
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,026
Well, it is a part
of this cold case file.

284
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,292
But it's been over 70 years, so, uh...

285
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,689
- Ah, what the heck.
- Cool.

286
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,202
But remember, that's police evidence,
so I'm gonna need that back, Billy.

287
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,862
Oh, I promise I'll bring it back.

288
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,998
OK. Wouldn't want
you casting any spells.

289
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,342
Well, let's go back upstairs.
I have a soufflé in the oven.

290
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,709
[Bartleby] Soufflé?

291
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,509
[Pete] Dude.

292
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,574
[snoring]

293
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,679
Hey there, Deputy dude.

294
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,716
Huh? What's going on?

295
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,319
Ooh! Top of the morning to you, Buddies.

296
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,423
Actually, it's afternoon, Deputy.

297
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,997
We were wondering where you pups went.

298
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,905
Hey, guys, it's four o'clock!

299
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,909
If we don't get ready
for trick-or-treating,

300
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,343
we're not gonna maximize
our candy potential!

301
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,575
Yeah. Thanks for all the help,
Sheriff Dan.

302
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,412
Well, good luck
with your project, Billy.

303
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,817
You let Sheriff Dan know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

304
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,751
And you kids, remind your parents

305
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,552
to come to the Fernfield
Spooky Brew Ha-Ha tonight,

306
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,081
or I'll have to arrest them!

307
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,718
[all laughing]

308
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,025
- [all] Thanks, Sheriff. Bye!
- [Sheriff Dan] See you!

309
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,722
[recorded laughter]

310
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,359
Come on, B-Dawg.

311
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,465
Let's go, boy.

312
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,509
[door closing]

313
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,244
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh, hello, dear.

314
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,475
I gotta get ready for trick-or-treating.

315
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,143
- Did you pick up the costume?
- Oh, I sure did.

316
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,845
- It's just over there on the table.
- Cool.

317
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,912
And I bought a matching one
for B-Dawg as well!

318
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,424
Oh, sweet.

319
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,089
[bell dinging]

320
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,100
Mom?

321
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,661
Oh, isn't that adorable?

322
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,605
You are just gonna be the cutest
little hip-hopper out there.

323
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,335
[stammering] Mom, I said hip-hop rapper,

324
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,643
not hip-hop rabbit!

325
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,878
I mean, are you trying
to completely ruin our street cred?

326
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,819
- [barking]
- I'm sorry. We cannot wear these.

327
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:20,347
Billy, you two will look
adorable as bunnies.

328
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,218
[groans]

329
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,998
Huh.

330
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,434
[stammering]

331
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,337
- Check it out, B-Dawg.
- [whimpering]

332
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,347
I present to you, Warwick the Warlock,

333
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,906
- at your service.
- [whining]

334
00:21:47,174 --> 00:21:50,451
I'm sorry, B-Dawg,
but it's really not that bad.

335
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,650
[whining]

336
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,159
Hey, check this out, buddy.

337
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:01,064
This must have been
what the warlock looked like.

338
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,692
And see the photo?

339
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:07,261
That must be the boy from the story,
and his little pup, Pip. See?

340
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,404
2332 Pine Lane.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,508
I wonder if he still lives there.

342
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,049
Yeah, I know, it was,
like, 75 years ago.

343
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:22,052
He'd be older than Grandpa by now.
Man, that's old.

344
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,752
If I could just talk to him,
this would be the easiest project ever.

345
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,720
- [owl hooting]
- It's kind of creepy.

346
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,040
Hurry!

347
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:44,906
Almost... got it.

348
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,402
- There!
- [cat growling]

349
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,572
[yelling]

350
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,314
- Dude, chill. It's just a dumb cat.
- [yowling]

351
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,250
I bet there's tons
of weird stuff we can use

352
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,312
to scare those dudes from class with.

353
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,755
Oh, man. It's getting dark.
We better hurry.

354
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,761
[grunting]

355
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:14,132
Whoa.

356
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,730
[Skip] Almost.

357
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,766
What? I got more visitors?

358
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,880
[Skip] Check it out.

359
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,542
[Rodney] Whoa.

360
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,268
[kids laughing]

361
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,168
All right.

362
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:52,235
With the Howlloween Hound,
I will control the world.

363
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,144
- [chuckling]
- [exaggerated laughter]

364
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,976
Hey, that is really good.

365
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,880
- Thanks, dawg.
- Whoa.

366
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,285
Why is that thing, like, glowing?

367
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,982
- [Sam] Oh, yeah. Intriguing.
- Huh.

368
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,954
I don't know.

369
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,984
Maybe it has batteries or something.

370
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,925
Argh, nice costume, matey!

371
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,296
Does the "B" stand for bunny?

372
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,595
[all laughing]

373
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,664
This ain't no ordinary rabbit costume,
dawgs.

374
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,333
It's a killer rabbit.

375
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,469
And those things are da bomb!

376
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:29,844
- Now let's go score some sugar.
- Oh, yeah.

377
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:32,850
There are healthy
alternatives to sugar, too.

378
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,681
My family is handing out

379
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:39,418
homemade almond raisin granola.
How cool is that?

380
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,016
OK, no offense,
but I vote we skip Sam's house!

381
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,618
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

382
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,323
- Me three.
- Ah, man.

383
00:24:45,352 --> 00:24:47,059
- [Alice] Sorry.
- Sorry, buddy. Come on!

384
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,724
[Alice] Whoa, check out the full moon!

385
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,396
[owl hooting]

386
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,634
Awesome!

387
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,589
[creaking]

388
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,524
Whoa.

389
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,004
"Rodentus...

390
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,408
...trans...

391
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,577
...something."

392
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,486
- Rodney!
- What?

393
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,599
- [rumbling]
- [groaning]

394
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,040
[clinking]

395
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,110
We are... free!

396
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,447
Oh, no!

397
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:15,851
[evil laughter]

398
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,525
Oh, it was horrendous in there!

399
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,187
- [groaning]
- [whimpering]

400
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,094
Are you the ones that released us?

401
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,462
- Speak up!
- [both gasping]

402
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,490
Wait a minute.

403
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,535
Where's my staff? My book?

404
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,870
You've stolen them, haven't you?

405
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,810
Give me that.

406
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:44,141
<i>Ratius rodentius!</i>

407
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,946
- [sizzling]
- [Warwick laughing]

408
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,975
[Skip squeaking] Oh, no!
What happened to us?

409
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,320
[Rodney] Let's get out of here!

410
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:56,156
Now... they won't be able
to warn the rest of the town.

411
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,321
We must finish the spell.

412
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,490
I can smell the blood
of the five puppies we need.

413
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,000
They have been in this room.

414
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,899
Oh, no!

415
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,530
[squeaking]

416
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,308
Hey, watch where you're going!
That's my tail!

417
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,677
Will you zip it? We have to find help!

418
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,305
[yowling]

419
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:22,686
You'll make a great Halloween treat.

420
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,153
[loud yowl]

421
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:26,248
Come on! We were just kidding before!

422
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,053
We love cats, really!

423
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,163
[frantic squeaking]

424
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,196
[yowling]

425
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:43,939
[growling]

426
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,414
[creaking]

427
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,830
[hooting]

428
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,894
[sighs] Oh.

429
00:28:13,927 --> 00:28:16,874
The Manor has seen better days.

430
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:20,503
[hooting] Master, it's true.
You're back!

431
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,177
[Warwick] Yes, Hoot,
you moronic birdbrain.

432
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,184
Go and find my staff.

433
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,186
Nothing can happen without it.

434
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,586
It'll be illuminated by the moonlight.

435
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,850
Yes, Master.

436
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,554
[hooting]

437
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:40,659
Hoot will find the glowing staff

438
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,132
and I will find my spell book.

439
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:47,670
If they can leave, then maybe I can too.

440
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,873
I'm free! Yes!

441
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:55,107
OK, I better go warn those puppies.

442
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,444
- Thanks!
- Thank you!

443
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,545
Thank you!

444
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,353
- Come on!
- Guys, let's go to this house.

445
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,756
I hope they have strawberry fizz bombs
at the next house.

446
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,351
- Let's go check out this one!
- Come on, let's go!

447
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:14,024
- They're amazing!
- Let's go.

448
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,224
Come on!

449
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:24,264
Yo, let's get this trick-or-treatin'
show on the road.

450
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:28,109
I don't want any more run-ins
with that Howlloween Hound dog

451
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,774
or any other creepy ghost,
for that matter.

452
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:34,182
Dude, they're just kids
in Halloween costumes.

453
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,246
Either way, dawg, I'm keeping
my eye on everything tonight.

454
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,123
- [Warwick groaning]
- [girl] Wait up, Sam!

455
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,927
Ah! Get away!

456
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,129
Look at that old guy.

457
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,136
- Get away!
- Excuse me.

458
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,797
- Real scary.
- [mumbles]

459
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,135
[kids screaming]

460
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,005
This is horrible.

461
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,604
Evil creatures are roaming the streets.

462
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:03,076
Oh.

463
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,845
- Hurry!
- Yeah, come on.

464
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,511
The best candy's at the next house!

465
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:09,814
[kids] Trick or treat!

466
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,152
That pink goblin is hideous!

467
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,853
You've misled me, Warwick.
This town has already been taken over.

468
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,361
Quickly, Hound.
We still have some time.

469
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,365
Go and find your puppy souls.

470
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:28,730
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's go cash out.

471
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,741
[doorbell cackling]

472
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,513
- Dude!
- Whoa.

473
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:45,079
Who dare knocks on my door?

474
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,182
- Dude, sweet costume!
- Yeah!

475
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,559
Dude, it's Frankendude to you.

476
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,563
- Oh, hello, children!
- Mrs. Carroll!

477
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,032
- Hi, Mrs. Carroll.
- It's Mrs. Frankendude.

478
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,730
- Welcome to our spooky house.
- Yeah.

479
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,365
- So, what do you think?
- It's totally awesome.

480
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:04,068
- Oh, it's so cool.
- Trick or treat?

481
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:07,408
Rad. Yeah, let Frankendude
help you out there, all right?

482
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,936
Except one per customer or
Frankendude will get upset

483
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,072
and then have to storm the village.

484
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,414
- [all laughing]
- That will be uncool.

485
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,918
[all] Good night. Thanks!

486
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,749
- Later.
- Shaka brah!

487
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:18,050
Hang ten on it.

488
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,420
[Sam] Let's check that place out!

489
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,755
- See ya in the tube.
- [laughing]

490
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:23,226
[Billy] Let's go check out
the next house, guys.

491
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,057
[Pete] Let's hurry up!

492
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,689
- [laughing]
- [puppy whining]

493
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,632
- Oh, he's so cute.
- It's time for us to get some treats.

494
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:31,168
Watch and learn.

495
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,430
[Mr. Carroll] Look,
he's coming up on the porch.

496
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,766
[Carrolls exclaiming]

497
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,636
- [whining]
- The dude begs.

498
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:39,174
- Oh, bark.
- He chases his tail...

499
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:42,441
Cute! He's going in a circle!

500
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,913
...then rolls over.

501
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:46,849
And for the finale,
Budderball's signature trick:

502
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,613
Plays starving!

503
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,778
- Oh!
- Oh.

504
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,288
- [whining]
- Go get some treats.

505
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:56,385
If Budderball's an expert at anything,
it's begging for treats.

507
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,418
- Oh, yes.
- He earned it.

508
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,124
He did earn it.
There you go.

509
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,829
- Yeah!
- Really, really good!

510
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,533
- I'm so excited, you guys!
- That was awesome!

511
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:23,414
Hey, there's another ghost!
Maybe he can help me.

512
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,220
Excuse me. My name is Pip.

513
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:32,889
I was wondering if you've seen
five Golden Retriever puppies?

514
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:38,427
[laughing] That tickles.

515
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,495
[screaming] Ghost!

516
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:45,134
Help, Mom!
I just saw a real ghost!

517
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,644
[mother] Time to go home.
You've had enough sugar for one night.

518
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:52,810
Uh-oh. I guess ghosts are scary.
I better disguise myself.

519
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:03,861
[muffled laughter]

520
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:11,695
[Billy] That was such a jackpot.

521
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,363
[Alice] I got all my favorite candy.

522
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,673
[Billy] Come on, Sam!

523
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:18,198
[Sam] Geez, guys, wait up, I'm coming.

524
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,337
[hooting] There's the Master's staff.

525
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,075
[Sam] Two words: Godzilla feet!

526
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:27,276
- Trick or treat!
- Oh, what have we here?

527
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,944
- All right, here's for you.
- Thank you!

528
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,853
There you are.
Thank goodness I found you guys!

529
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:42,389
Yo, if you're lookin' for a pawtograph,

530
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,230
I ain't in da mood.

531
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,737
I'm here to warn you about
the Howlloween Hound.

532
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,499
How did you know about that?

533
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:55,975
[yells] It's the Howlloween Hound!

534
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,039
I told you dawgs he'd come after us!

535
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,051
- No, I'm not.
- Run, dawgs!

536
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,177
[all yelling]

537
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,324
[all breathing heavily]

538
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,605
Yo, this ghost dawg
just doesn't give up!

539
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,107
What do we do?

540
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,608
I know a place.

541
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,907
If there's anyone who can help us
with a paranormal problem,

542
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:30,915
it's Zelda. Follow me.

543
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,680
Please, wait.
I'm just trying to warn you guys.

544
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:44,456
[puppies barking]

545
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,121
[panting]

546
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,892
That must be them.

547
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:56,334
It looks like someone else
is after those puppies, too.

548
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,268
[breathing heavily]

549
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:06,977
Remind me to never
come trick-or-treating

550
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:11,250
here at 2332 Pine Lane again!

551
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:14,486
Talk about no Halloween spirit!

552
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,322
2332 Pine Lane?

553
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,662
Hey! Guys, the boy
from the story lived here.

554
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,726
This was Joseph's house.

555
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,271
Go knock on the door, Billy.
Maybe he still lives there.

556
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:31,832
Alice, come on, he'd be, like,
a thousand years old or something.

557
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:35,310
Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

558
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,075
[sighing]

559
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,314
[gate opening]

560
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,952
[owl hooting]

561
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:05,372
I guess nobody's home.

562
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:07,639
See, I told you guys.

563
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,648
It's just a creepy old house
with nobody in it.

564
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:14,783
[all gasping]

565
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,217
What?

566
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,982
Behind you, look.

567
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,581
Oh, ha ha. Good one, Sam,

568
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,387
but I'm not gonna fall for...

569
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:23,553
[Pete] Uh...

570
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,459
For reals?

571
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,191
[Sam] Yeah.

572
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,729
Oh! Um...

573
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,437
Uh, hello, sir. I...

574
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:42,377
I was just wondering
if this boy still lives here.

575
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:47,077
No, this boy hasn't lived here
in quite some time.

576
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:48,483
What do you want?

577
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,921
Well, you see,
I'm doing this school project

578
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,151
on The Curse of the Howlloween Hound,

579
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,717
you know, an old Fernfield legend,

580
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,756
and I was just hoping
to ask him some questions.

581
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,927
I'm sure if that boy
wanted to talk about it

582
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,937
he would have a long time ago.
Now go away!

583
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,906
Oh, OK. I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,169
Hey, boy!

585
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,076
Where'd you get that staff?

586
00:37:16,102 --> 00:37:18,708
Hand it over!
That's very dangerous!

587
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,513
[all] Run! Go!

588
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,779
Come on! Go!

589
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,083
[Billy] He's behind us!

590
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,986
[Sam] So creepy!

591
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,082
[exhales]

592
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:38,658
I must find out who's responsible
for this infestation.

593
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:43,400
No one beats Warwick the Warlock
at his own game.

594
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,643
What is this?

595
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:51,079
Perhaps the evil sorcerer lives there?

596
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,878
[exhales]

597
00:37:58,177 --> 00:38:02,125
All the ghouls and goblins
are flocking to his door.

598
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,149
[laughing]

599
00:38:03,182 --> 00:38:05,162
[electronic laughing]

600
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,994
[kids] Trick or treat!

601
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,093
- [cackling]
- [screams]

602
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,130
- Who dares...
- [screams]

603
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,340
Dude, a little bit, uh,
old for trick-or-treating?

604
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,901
No!

605
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,709
Now give me what's rightfully mine!

606
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,581
OK, I think that would entail
a trick on your part.

607
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,586
[hooting]

608
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,182
[gasps] Wow.

609
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,251
Master, I have good news.

610
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,456
OK, that's... Wow, ventriloquism.
That's impressive.

611
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,057
Yeah, bro, you just
got yourself a treat. Nice.

612
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:52,805
So, this is what
food tastes like these days.

613
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:57,079
Later.

614
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:03,019
Now, Hoot, tell me the good news.

615
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,544
Have you found my staff?

616
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,887
Yes, a young warlock has it.

617
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,051
[sighs]

618
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,890
I leave for 75 measly years,

619
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:14,693
and they find someone new to replace me.

620
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,631
- [kids] Trick or treat!
- Where's the respect?

621
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:18,168
[electronic laughing]

622
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,828
[sighs]

623
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:23,873
[breathing heavily]

624
00:39:29,602 --> 00:39:31,309
[panting]

625
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,077
I think we lost him.

626
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,209
Why is that ghost dude after us?

627
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:37,721
Maybe he wants to drink our blood!

628
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:39,086
That's vampires.

629
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,591
Maybe he wants to eat our brains.

630
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:44,322
That's zombies, dude.

631
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:47,762
Maybe he wants to devour
everything he sees.

632
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,528
- That's Budderball.
- Hmm?

633
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,935
It's probably because B-Dawg
released him from the mirror.

634
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,599
Oh, sure, dawg, blame me!

635
00:39:56,629 --> 00:40:01,442
It's you guys teasing me and calling me
scaredy-cat that made me do it.

636
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,539
It's true. We have to take personal
responsibility for our own actions.

637
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:11,685
- [boy] Wait up!
- [all] Trick or treat!

638
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,123
He's got all kinds of terrifying
creatures following him.

639
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,353
- Thanks!
- Let's check out that place.

640
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,793
How will we get to him?

641
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,797
Those are just his friends, Master.

642
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:25,233
Friends? With creatures
of the underworld?

643
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,897
- No, they're...
- Silence!

644
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,032
- I need to focus.
- [kids] Trick or treat!

645
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,807
- Come on, guys! Let's go!
- Let's go over here!

646
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,709
- You there!
- Huh?

647
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:38,977
- Young warlock.
- Um, he's...

648
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,381
[chuckles]

649
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,680
Do you know who I am?

650
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:48,315
Uh... I'm not sure?

651
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:51,624
I am Warwick the Warlock,

652
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,358
the evilest warlock known to man!

653
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,455
[hiccups]

654
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,296
[all laughing]

655
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,169
- [yelling]
- [Sam] Oh!

656
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:05,975
I will make all of you ghouls my slaves!

657
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,410
[Billy] Uh... [chuckles]

658
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,741
Now...

659
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,747
...give me that staff!

660
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,514
Here, take it, Mister.

661
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,646
- Whoa!
- [yelling]

662
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:22,657
- What was that?
- Whoa!

663
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:23,955
That was awesome.

664
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,491
How did you do that?

665
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,863
Dawg, I have no idea!

666
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:33,062
But I'm pretty sure that guy
was who he says he is.

667
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,002
- What do you mean?
- Check this out!

668
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,205
That dude really is the Warlock!

669
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,004
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

670
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:42,535
- [coughs]
- [Sam] Uh, guys...

671
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,343
I believe that now would be
an opportune time to run.

672
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,112
- Go!
- Run!

673
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:50,045
Are you OK, Master?

674
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:55,787
I clearly underestimated that warlock.

675
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,384
[coughs]

676
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,986
[Billy] Guys, come on!

677
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,122
Come on!

678
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:04,900
Whoa.

679
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,403
[all panting]

680
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:09,133
What was with that guy?

681
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:14,007
Yo, I have no idea,
but he wanted this thing pretty badly.

682
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,877
We better find Sheriff Dan, like, now!

683
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,347
- [Billy] Let's go.
- [Bartleby] Let's go.

684
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,950
[grunts]

685
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,053
[cackling]

686
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:35,056
Yeah, again, great bit before,

687
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:37,761
but, uh, it's kinda one piece
of candy per trick.

688
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:42,239
Look, I need your help, monster.

689
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:44,935
You're big and you're scary,

690
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:47,705
the perfect henchman for this job.

691
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,940
<i>Slavius mineus!</i>

692
00:42:50,002 --> 00:42:52,141
- [laughing]
- What the...

693
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:03,084
[exhales] Now, you will do
exactly as I tell you.

694
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:05,095
Dude.

695
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,262
Dude.

696
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:13,293
I want you to find a young warlock

697
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,671
whose staff has a shiny blue crystal.

698
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,937
I want you to seize it.

699
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,477
Yes, Master.

700
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:25,846
And then eliminate him.

701
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:29,113
Yes, Master.

702
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:33,988
Dude. Dude.

703
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:36,526
[groaning]

704
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:40,157
[grunting]

705
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,989
[groaning]

706
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:45,558
Dude.

707
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,141
I probably should have used
someone smarter for this job.

708
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,376
[groaning]

709
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,252
Idiot!

710
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,045
[hooting]

711
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:15,690
I believe this is the place.

712
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:31,542
Hello? Is anyone home?

713
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,676
I don't think anybody's here.

714
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,053
Yo, check out this crystal ball, dawgs.

715
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:45,686
It's like a giant gumball.

716
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,628
Welcome.

717
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,498
Yo, dawgs, the gumball is talking to us!

718
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,961
- I am Zelda.
- [shouting]

719
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:58,099
I am all-knowing and all-seeing.

720
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:02,578
I specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

721
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:05,047
I also do doggy weddings
and doggy bar mitzvahs.

722
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,415
Now, I sense you puppies are in danger.

723
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:10,851
Only if we end up at your groomer.

724
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,584
B-Dawg! I apologize for my brother.

725
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:17,423
We need your help because
this ghost has been chasing us.

726
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,086
Well, this is Halloween,

727
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,392
the only night spirits are free to roam.

728
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,094
We must make contact
with this ghost of yours.

729
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,261
[gasps] Oh, I have a Ouija board.

730
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:29,204
It can be used
to contact the other side.

731
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,442
- Hello?
- [all gasping]

732
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,215
I don't think you're gonna
need your Luigi board.

733
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:46,621
There's the ghost!

734
00:45:46,645 --> 00:45:50,354
Oh, a ghost! [groaning]

735
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:55,425
That dudette is down for the count.

736
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:57,297
Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.

737
00:45:57,322 --> 00:46:01,429
That's what ghosts always say
before they eat you.

738
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,963
Ghosts don't eat.
There's no way for us to.

739
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:06,636
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

740
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:09,043
I'm a friendly ghost, I promise.

741
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,909
Oh, my, what a horrible dream.

742
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,440
- I know I look a bit strange.
- Oh!

743
00:46:14,473 --> 00:46:16,817
But I was once a pup just like you.

744
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,115
My name is Pip.

745
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,816
You're the pup from the story.

746
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,586
Yes. I've been like this
ever since that night.

747
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,958
The Hound stole my brothers'
and sisters' souls.

748
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,190
The spell must have been
interrupted that night.

749
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,493
Your soul was left in limbo.

750
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,591
[sniffing]

751
00:46:35,027 --> 00:46:37,837
[soft growling]

752
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,001
I'm sorry I scared you guys
at the Manor.

753
00:46:40,032 --> 00:46:42,512
I was trying to stop you
from releasing the Hound.

754
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,843
Yeah, and we're sorry, too, Pip.

755
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:46,849
I'm Rosebud, and these are my brothers,

756
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:49,852
B-Dawg, Mudbud, Buddha and Budderball.

757
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,751
The Hound and Warwick are free.

758
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,154
They're still trying
to finish their spell,

759
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,955
but they need five puppies
of the same blood to do it.

760
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,359
They're after you guys.

761
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:01,626
We must stop them
from completing the spell.

762
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,758
And Pip, now that you
have left the Manor,

763
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,632
if you do not return
to your body before sunrise,

764
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,433
you will be lost forever.

765
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,870
[gasping]

766
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,499
We must find the body
you once inhabited.

767
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:16,638
We shall ask the spirits
through my crystal ball.

768
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,652
[deep growling]

769
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:26,554
[exaggerated voice]
Oh, beautiful and wise one,

770
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,751
we ask for your help
on this night of Halloween.

771
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:32,227
Please show us this young pup's body.

772
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:35,128
Does it still exist
on the earthly plane?

773
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,661
That's me! I turned to stone
the night it all happened.

774
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:43,002
Ah, snap! The cemetery?

775
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:47,408
I mean, is it really necessary
to go there, dawgs?

776
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:52,241
[all gasping]

777
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:54,574
Hello, puppies.

778
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,415
Oh, no! It's the Howlloween Hound!

779
00:47:57,442 --> 00:48:00,889
Come out, come out,
and I'll have your souls for dinner.

780
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,914
Oh, no. I'm stuck!

781
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,426
The back door, quickly!

782
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,767
Come on! [grunting]

783
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:17,904
[loud groaning]

784
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:19,602
- [kids] Mr. Carroll?
- [Billy] Oh, Mr. Carroll!

785
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,702
- Maybe you can help us.
- Give me staff!

786
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:24,941
That's not normal, even for Mr. Carroll.

787
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,279
- [Pete] That dude's eyes are creepy!
- [all exclaiming]

788
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:29,285
We better get to that party!
Sheriff Dan's there!

789
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:30,979
- [Billy] Yeah, come on!
- [Pete] Come on!

790
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,623
Dude.

791
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:43,624
[singing "Monster Mash"]

792
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:12,995
Billy! Billy, come on!
Dance with your mom. Whoo!

793
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:15,164
Whoo!

794
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:19,033
Mom, I really don't have time right now.
See, there's a monster chasing us.

795
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,229
Of course there is, dear.
It's Halloween!

796
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:23,569
- [Mr. Carroll] Give me staff!
- [Billy] There he is.

797
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,335
Run! Run!

798
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,172
Oh, sweetheart, where are you going?

799
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,678
[grunting]

800
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,009
[noisemaker tooting]

801
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,116
[grunting]

802
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,794
[burping] Dude.

803
00:49:52,524 --> 00:49:54,595
[fireworks whistling]

804
00:49:56,361 --> 00:50:00,366
This must be that young Warlock's lair!

805
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:03,538
It's swarming with all those creatures.

806
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:07,812
This warlock is more powerful
than I thought.

807
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,953
[all chattering]

808
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:13,516
[high-pitched scream]

809
00:50:13,545 --> 00:50:14,888
Hand over the candy.

810
00:50:14,913 --> 00:50:16,517
Stay back, demon!

811
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,550
You'll not trick-or-treat me!

812
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,062
- [grunting]
- [popping]

813
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:26,302
Wait a minute.
You're no demon!

814
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:27,632
And you...

815
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:33,370
...you're no goblin!

816
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:35,976
You!

817
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,909
- [snapping]
- [shouting]

818
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:40,712
What kind of trickery is this?

819
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,413
These are just kids in disguises!

820
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,954
Out of my way!

821
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,923
- Let's get outta here!
- Let's get outta here!

822
00:50:47,946 --> 00:50:50,449
[singing "Monster Mash"]

823
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,668
[muffled music]

824
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,433
[Mudbud] Dudes! Sniffer!

825
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,941
He'll know what to do
about that nasty Hound!

826
00:51:05,964 --> 00:51:07,875
[snoring]

827
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,776
Deputy Sniffer!

828
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:11,780
Wake up! Wake up!
We need your help!

829
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:15,010
[stammering] Trick-or-treat,
smell my paws.

830
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,416
Yo, dawg!

831
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,115
It's a straight up 9-1-1!

832
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,623
[stammering] Buddies,
you startled me there.

833
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,148
What's the problem?

834
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:26,559
Did someone steal
Budderball's candy bag?

835
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:29,088
No. This is more serious
than trick-or-treating.

836
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,464
Well, hi there, Zelda.

837
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:35,130
Deputy Dawg, we got a serious problem.

838
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:37,434
The Howlloween Hound
has been released!

839
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:41,137
I sense we have a few hours
before the entire town is doomed,

840
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,702
and soon after that, the whole world!

841
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,305
You're quite the trickster, Zelda.

842
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,648
[chuckling] My great grandpappy Tracker

843
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:51,984
used to tell me that old wives' tale
when I was just a pup.

844
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,785
Scared the bejesus outta me.

845
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:57,589
Deputy Sniffer,
I can assure you the legend is true.

846
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:02,728
Wow, great ghost costume.

847
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,666
It's not a costume, Deputy Sniffer.
He's a ghost.

848
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,466
See, I can float through walls.

849
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:10,268
[Sniffer] Oh! Look at...

850
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,637
[stammers]

851
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,304
Whoa! Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

852
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:20,611
My name is Pip.

853
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,483
I knew your great grandpappy,
Deputy Tracker.

854
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,181
We could really use your help.

855
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:28,087
[sniffing]

856
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,355
Uh, would this hound
happen to be large and brown

857
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:33,693
and, uh, with green eyes?

858
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:36,491
Oh, no! He's found us!

859
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:39,730
The long paw of the law
will handle this intruder.

860
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,829
- You guys go.
- Hurry, we must get to the cemetery.

861
00:52:45,697 --> 00:52:47,040
[weak howling]

862
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:49,204
Stop in the name of the law!

863
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:52,705
Time to meet your fate.

864
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:55,775
- You're under arrest!
- [howling]

865
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,377
What in tarnation do you...

866
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,559
[singing "Monster Mash"]

867
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,796
[giggling]

868
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,206
Oh, there you are, Frank!

869
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:28,740
You didn't tell me you
left early for the party!

870
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,912
- Uh...
- Come on!

871
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:34,115
The costume contest is starting
and you're a shoo-in!

872
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,816
- Come on!
- [grunting]

873
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:45,728
Oh, I love your costume!
You're a wizard, right?

874
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:49,603
I am a warlock, Madam,
and I'm not wearing a costume!

875
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:52,267
Now unhand me, you crazy kitty cat!

876
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,274
[shouting]

877
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:01,242
- [applause]
- [Dan] OK, all right.

878
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,616
OK, all right.

879
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:05,780
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a round of applause

880
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,952
for the finalists
for most original costume.

881
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,585
[crowd chattering]

882
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:15,723
OK, you've got your numbers.

883
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,328
[panting]

884
00:54:22,794 --> 00:54:24,967
[Dan] All right, make a nice,
clean line, please.

885
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:27,475
Sheriff! Sheriff.
I've really gotta talk to you.

886
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:28,637
It's really, really important.

887
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,804
In a jiffy, Billy.

888
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,404
I just have to announce the winner,
all right?

889
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,414
But, Sheriff!

890
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:33,643
Ladies and gentlemen,

891
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:36,345
the first place winner is...

892
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,546
- ...drum roll, please.
- [drum roll]

893
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:42,317
The winner is...

894
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,951
...Frank Carroll! Frankendude!

895
00:54:44,983 --> 00:54:46,291
[shouting]

896
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:50,493
- Move!
- Honey, that's great!

897
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:52,365
Useless monster!

898
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,232
Must I do everything myself?

899
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,899
Staff! [grunting]

900
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,844
Say "cheese"!

901
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,777
[pained grunting]

902
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:07,474
- [shouting]
- [crowd gasping]

903
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,109
[shouting]

904
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:12,187
Heavens to Betsy!

905
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,190
Somebody had a bit too much
spooky punch!

906
00:55:14,212 --> 00:55:15,589
[crowd laughing]

907
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:17,149
Oh, honey, are you OK?

908
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:19,321
You know that story about the warlock?

909
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,263
Hypothetically speaking,
could Warwick return to Fernfield

910
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,823
even if it was, like, 75 years ago?

911
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:26,597
Billy, it's Halloween!

912
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,867
All the scariest monsters
return this time of year.

913
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,874
Give the staff to me, boy!

914
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:34,376
It belongs to me, Warwick,

915
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,174
the greatest warlock of all time!

916
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:38,875
I've gotta return that to Sheriff Dan!

917
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,349
What have you done with my book?

918
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:45,377
Now, sir!
That, my friend, is a party foul!

919
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,821
Unhand that boy!
Enough monkey business!

920
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:49,052
[grunting]

921
00:55:50,248 --> 00:55:52,194
Monkey business, eh?

922
00:55:52,217 --> 00:55:53,821
- [all] Let's go!
- [Sam] Come on!

923
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,262
<i>Transformius monchius!</i>

924
00:55:57,322 --> 00:55:59,302
[crowd gasping, applauding]

925
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:01,361
What in tarnation? [chittering]

926
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:03,599
- [gasping]
- You're under arrest

927
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,232
for insulting an officer of the law!

928
00:56:06,264 --> 00:56:07,607
[chittering]

929
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:10,245
[all laughing]

930
00:56:10,268 --> 00:56:12,874
[shouting]

931
00:56:12,904 --> 00:56:15,578
No one makes a monkey
out of Sheriff Dan!

932
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,981
- [chittering]
- [applause]

933
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:25,323
Great trick! Just fabulous!

934
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:28,227
Thank you! It's good to be loved!

935
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,263
- [hiccuping]
- [crowd laughing]

936
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:35,769
But it's better to be feared!

937
00:56:35,827 --> 00:56:37,534
[evil laughter]

938
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:40,432
[Mrs. Carroll] Wow!

939
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:42,239
That was amazing.

940
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,940
[Janice] That was!

941
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,244
Baby, come over here!
Come on, dance!

942
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,811
# <i>Ghosts and goblins</i>
<i>and green little things</i>

943
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:52,912
# <i>They're comin' up, comin' up</i>
<i>My, oh my, it's a scream</i> #

944
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:57,290
Dude, did you get the staff
to Sheriff Dan?

945
00:56:57,315 --> 00:56:59,591
- Sort of.
- Uh, what do you mean?

946
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:01,096
- Uh...
- [door opening]

947
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,463
- [chittering]
- Hey, that monkey

948
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,467
is dressed like Sheriff Dan.

949
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:08,129
- That is Sheriff Dan!
- What?

950
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:10,331
Run kids! He's coming!

951
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,010
[Pete] But, dude, where's Warwick?

952
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:17,478
There you are!

953
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:18,912
Does that answer your question?

954
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:20,041
Uh-huh.

955
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,779
Now, where is that book?

956
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:24,650
[gasping]

957
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:28,249
Or do you all want to be
turned into monkeys, too?

958
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,657
No, really, Mister,
we don't know where the book is!

959
00:57:30,682 --> 00:57:33,595
Wrong answer, boy.

960
00:57:34,352 --> 00:57:36,263
<i>Monchius appe...</i>

961
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,789
[screaming]

962
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,269
- Hurry!
- Uh...

963
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,329
Come with me!

964
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:46,536
Before it's too late! Come on!

965
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:49,139
Come on.

966
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,510
[groaning]

967
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:02,423
[engine starting]

968
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,290
They won't get far.

969
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,968
[all panting]

970
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,316
What's the plan now, dudette?

971
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,181
Everyone, look around for Pip's body.

972
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:30,515
We don't have much time.

973
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:48,234
Whoa! That's me.

974
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,329
"Pip. Rest in peace.

975
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,363
Most loyal friend of Joseph.

976
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:54,399
The best pup a boy could ever have."

977
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:56,036
What do we do now, Zelda?

978
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:58,411
OK, well, uh, I have to confess.

979
00:58:58,436 --> 00:58:59,779
[nervous laughter]

980
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:03,717
I've never really returned
a spirit to a body, per se.

981
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:05,277
But I'll give it a whirl.

982
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:09,550
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

983
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,823
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

984
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:18,160
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

985
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,897
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

986
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:24,429
It's working!

987
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,111
Help us, spirits, and take this soul.

988
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:32,842
Place it back into the body
the Hound once stole!

989
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,745
Whoa, guys, my legs!

990
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,282
I can wiggle my nose!

991
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:47,625
Wow, guys, I can chase my tail!

992
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,460
I'm back! Whoo!

993
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:51,626
How can I ever thank you guys?

994
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:53,396
Watch me run!
Look at me go!

995
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,870
Whoo! Awesome!

996
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,309
Come on, kids.

997
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,478
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

998
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,955
Quickly, everyone inside!

999
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,817
There they are!

1000
01:00:18,116 --> 01:00:19,652
[evil laughter]

1001
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:37,211
I want that book!

1002
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:39,344
[shouting]

1003
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,151
You'll be safe here.

1004
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:50,057
Evil like Warwick cannot
enter the house of God.

1005
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,025
Well, how come you have a key?

1006
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,824
I'm the organist here every Sunday.

1007
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:55,825
Don't worry, kids.

1008
01:00:56,787 --> 01:01:00,997
We beat Warwick once,
we can do it again.

1009
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:07,201
This is you, isn't it?

1010
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,213
You're the boy from the legend.

1011
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:16,246
That was sure a long time ago.

1012
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:21,585
Well, um, I'm Billy, and this is Alice,

1013
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:25,253
and that's Pete and Bartleby,

1014
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,919
and that's Sam.

1015
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,767
Joseph. Joseph Johnson.

1016
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,596
[sniffing]

1017
01:01:37,595 --> 01:01:38,505
[growling]

1018
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,074
[all gasping]

1019
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,551
This time, there's nowhere to run.

1020
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:52,316
[hooting]

1021
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:00,388
Mr. Hound, I am Zelda.

1022
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:02,261
I am all-knowing and all-seeing.

1023
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:06,428
I specialize in the mystic
and otherworldly.

1024
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,403
I believe I can help you
come from the dark

1025
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:11,771
back into the light.

1026
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:16,437
I actually like the darkness.
Now get out of my way.

1027
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,207
[shouting]

1028
01:02:20,972 --> 01:02:21,950
Oh, no!

1029
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:23,884
- Hoot.
- [grunting]

1030
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:26,684
Go tell that idiot Warwick
I've captured the puppies.

1031
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,450
Now, I have a different plan
for you pups.

1032
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:34,018
We're doomed!

1033
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:40,569
For 75 years I held onto this book...

1034
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,804
...dreading a full moon
on Halloween night.

1035
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:49,577
It's the only night Warwick could return
to finish the spell.

1036
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,311
They have my book!

1037
01:02:56,474 --> 01:02:58,715
How do I get my hands on it?

1038
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:05,151
[Billy] Whoa, what's up with this book?

1039
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:07,025
The writing's all trippy.

1040
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,621
It's Latin. I learned the language

1041
01:03:09,654 --> 01:03:11,930
and studied the book
from cover to cover,

1042
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:16,063
trying to decipher its meaning,
so I could stop Warwick.

1043
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:18,403
So, what's the book say, Mr. Johnson?

1044
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:23,468
Warwick will need three items
to complete the spell tonight

1045
01:03:23,501 --> 01:03:27,506
for the evil spirits
of the netherworld to remain here.

1046
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,482
The nether-what now?

1047
01:03:29,507 --> 01:03:33,216
That's another name
for a place where ghosts live,

1048
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:35,086
usually bad ones.

1049
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:38,184
Halloween is the one night

1050
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:42,527
these spirits can roam free
in our world.

1051
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:46,033
Only the Howlloween Hound
can call them out.

1052
01:03:46,724 --> 01:03:48,965
Warwick will use those spirits

1053
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:52,566
to control the townsfolk of Fernfield.

1054
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:55,770
But you said he needs three things,
right?

1055
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,369
That's right.

1056
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:01,115
His staff, the spell book...

1057
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,385
...and one other thing.

1058
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:07,420
Well, what is it?

1059
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:14,894
The souls of five young puppies
who share the same blood.

1060
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,730
Like brothers and sisters?

1061
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,267
[all] The Buddies!

1062
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,768
- Master!
- [shrieking]

1063
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,867
Don't sneak up on me like that!

1064
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:30,139
Hound has captured the five puppies.

1065
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:31,202
Perfect!

1066
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:34,273
Those puppies will come in handy

1067
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:36,375
in more ways than one.

1068
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:38,011
[evil laughter, hiccuping]

1069
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:50,096
[hooting]

1070
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,365
[shouting]

1071
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:00,908
Good work, Hound.

1072
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,104
Now all I need is my book.

1073
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:06,115
You take these puppies
back to the Manor

1074
01:05:06,137 --> 01:05:08,413
and I will meet you there.

1075
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:10,316
[laughter, hiccuping]

1076
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:26,761
Open wide like the jaws of a dragon!

1077
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:31,864
You in there!

1078
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:35,437
I have something you want.

1079
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:38,970
Yo, dawgs, it's that creepy old warlock!

1080
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:41,312
If you want to see your puppies again,

1081
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:44,114
you better bring that book to my Manor!

1082
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:45,415
[laughing]

1083
01:05:51,182 --> 01:05:54,288
Oh, no, they've got the Buddies!

1084
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,628
Yeah, but what if they're
just trying to trick us?

1085
01:05:56,654 --> 01:06:00,295
You really want to take that chance,
dude? I wouldn't.

1086
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:18,544
I told those wretched children
to bring me my spell book.

1087
01:06:20,511 --> 01:06:22,184
What if they don't come with the book?

1088
01:06:22,213 --> 01:06:25,854
Quiet, you moronic birdbrain.

1089
01:06:25,883 --> 01:06:28,022
They will want to save

1090
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:32,261
their precious puppies, won't they?

1091
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:34,803
[evil laughter, hiccuping]

1092
01:06:40,164 --> 01:06:44,271
Mr. Johnson, what happens
if we can't stop them?

1093
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:48,909
Then the spirits will be
under Warwick's control forever.

1094
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,010
They'll take over Fernfield first,

1095
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,248
and who knows what they'll do next?

1096
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,018
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

1097
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:00,159
We have to put an end to this tonight,
for all time.

1098
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:04,294
[muffled music]

1099
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:07,568
[squeaking]

1100
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:15,235
What are you dudes up to?

1101
01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:17,075
We're gonna get that dirty rat.

1102
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:19,171
Hey, I resent that comment.

1103
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:22,412
Come on, or you'll be a dirty rat
for the rest of your life.

1104
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:24,885
Ready to exact some revenge!

1105
01:07:27,912 --> 01:07:32,418
Soon, they will be here
with my spell book,

1106
01:07:33,484 --> 01:07:36,055
and you can devour those...

1107
01:07:37,054 --> 01:07:40,058
...delicious puppy souls.

1108
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,264
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1109
01:07:43,294 --> 01:07:44,432
Oh, what is it?

1110
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,532
Something is biting me! Ow!

1111
01:07:46,564 --> 01:07:50,137
Quickly, Hound,
Hoot do something! Ow!

1112
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:53,942
[shouting]

1113
01:07:53,971 --> 01:07:57,578
Yo, now that dawg
has some serious moves.

1114
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:05,954
Vermin!

1115
01:08:05,983 --> 01:08:07,553
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1116
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:09,292
Change us back, you jerk!

1117
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,628
Run for it, dude!

1118
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,298
Back off, you vermin!

1119
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,468
[squeaking]

1120
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:19,838
Hound! Get them!

1121
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,611
I'll get that book
from those stupid kids!

1122
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:29,117
Our kids are here?
Oh, no!

1123
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,051
You guard the puppies.

1124
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,315
Yes, Master.

1125
01:08:33,344 --> 01:08:38,726
Fail me, and I'll turn you
into a feather duster.

1126
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:56,309
Psst, Buddies.

1127
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,334
Pip!

1128
01:08:57,368 --> 01:08:58,870
We have to get you out of here.

1129
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,314
[hooting] What do you
think you're doing?

1130
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,079
I'm saving my friends.

1131
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,814
I can't let them escape.
Master would be furious.

1132
01:09:05,843 --> 01:09:08,983
Hoot, why are you so loyal to Warwick?

1133
01:09:09,013 --> 01:09:10,617
Seriously, dude!

1134
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:13,686
It's totally obvious he plans
to get rid of you.

1135
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:17,324
Master sometimes gets angry,
but he would never get rid of me.

1136
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:18,628
He needs me!

1137
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:20,727
Yo, are you hallucinatrippin'?

1138
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:23,897
He's got that Howlloween Hound
to do his dirty work now.

1139
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:27,670
Man, he calls you names
like moronic birdbrain.

1140
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:30,042
That does sound like something he'd say.

1141
01:09:30,067 --> 01:09:33,514
You have a conscience,
but yet you have spent your whole life

1142
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:36,381
being bossed around by someone
who doesn't respect you.

1143
01:09:36,407 --> 01:09:38,512
What do you know?

1144
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,544
I know you never meant to hurt us, Hoot.

1145
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:44,388
And even though you've been
under Warwick's control for a long time,

1146
01:09:44,415 --> 01:09:47,555
you still have a chance
at a happy life in this beautiful world.

1147
01:09:47,618 --> 01:09:50,861
But if Warwick wins,
we'll all be doomed.

1148
01:09:50,888 --> 01:09:53,368
Haven't the last 75 years without evil

1149
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,064
been a lot nicer than your time
under Warwick's wing?

1150
01:09:56,093 --> 01:09:59,666
It was kind of nice not having to look
over my shoulder all the time.

1151
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:11,216
You won't regret it, Hoot.
I promise.

1152
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:14,085
[Skip squeaking]
Run! He's on our tails!

1153
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:21,260
Rats! Another ridiculous chase.

1154
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:27,231
We've got to go, Buddies,
before they return.

1155
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,171
Puppies, how did you get out?

1156
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:33,606
I let them go.

1157
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,268
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1158
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,073
I've had enough of the dark side.

1159
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:39,604
I won't be responsible for anymore evil.

1160
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:42,747
[hooting]

1161
01:10:42,773 --> 01:10:43,945
Run, puppies, run!

1162
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:48,923
[B-Dawg] Let's go!

1163
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:51,517
- [hooting]
- [barking]

1164
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:54,188
[howling]

1165
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:13,739
Dudes, we're trapped!

1166
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:18,819
Finally, your puppy souls will be mine.

1167
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,618
Let them go, Hound.
All you need is me.

1168
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:22,646
What is this?

1169
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:26,985
It's me, Pip.

1170
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,326
You stole
all my brothers' and sisters' souls.

1171
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,559
Now all you need is me
to complete the spell.

1172
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:34,432
Then you'll have five souls
of the same blood.

1173
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:38,804
Why, Pip, I do remember you.
Your siblings were delicious.

1174
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:41,435
Take me and let the Buddies go.

1175
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:42,842
You don't need them.

1176
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:45,005
Goodbye, Buddies.

1177
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:46,672
No, dude! Don't!

1178
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:48,910
- Stop! No!
- Don't do it!

1179
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,315
Pip!

1180
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,115
[howling]

1181
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:56,516
This way, puppies.

1182
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,907
I can now open the portal.

1183
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:17,571
I'm not waiting for that idiot Warwick
any longer.

1184
01:12:33,217 --> 01:12:34,855
[gate creaking]

1185
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,600
Open the portal!

1186
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:48,302
Release the spirits of the netherworld!

1187
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,409
[deep evil laughter]

1188
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:54,574
[maniacal laughter]

1189
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:09,921
[Joseph] Oh, no!

1190
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:11,330
They've opened the portal!

1191
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:21,571
Have faith, young ones.
We can still stop it.

1192
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:24,204
- Yeah.
- [engine starting]

1193
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:30,750
[boy laughing]

1194
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:33,880
- Did you guys see that?
- [maniacal laughter]

1195
01:13:50,294 --> 01:13:52,296
- Let's get out of here!
- Run!

1196
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:58,135
[maniacal laughter]

1197
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:04,247
# <i>One dark, scary night</i>
<i>some wolves...</i> #

1198
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:08,051
Sheriff Dan really
went all out this year.

1199
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,149
- The special effects are amazing!
- Oh, yeah.

1200
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:14,495
[babbling]

1201
01:14:16,887 --> 01:14:18,730
[groaning]

1202
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,735
Dude.

1203
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,264
[all groaning]

1204
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:01,204
Perfect.

1205
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:06,440
- Bring it right to me.
- [car doors close]

1206
01:15:08,472 --> 01:15:12,010
Yo, this place is
a lot creepier at night.

1207
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:15,121
Stay close to me, kids.

1208
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,124
Warwick!

1209
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,569
We're here. We have your book.

1210
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:35,667
Ah, just in time.

1211
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:38,011
Hand it over!

1212
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:39,480
Where are the Buddies?

1213
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:43,382
Oh, they're around here somewhere.

1214
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:45,819
[chuckles sinisterly]

1215
01:15:45,876 --> 01:15:50,416
Now, I'll be taking that book.

1216
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:52,927
No book until you hand over the puppies.

1217
01:15:52,983 --> 01:15:55,554
Oh, really?

1218
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,832
[grunting]

1219
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,461
- [Pete] Mr. Johnson!
- [Warwick laughing]

1220
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:09,102
[laughing]

1221
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:11,578
[Alice] Oh, Mr. Johnson, are you OK?

1222
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,581
- [groans]
- Are you OK?

1223
01:16:13,603 --> 01:16:15,640
My book! [laughs]

1224
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,051
Go after him, kids.
It's up to you now.

1225
01:16:20,911 --> 01:16:21,946
[groans]

1226
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:24,958
[Billy] Let's go.

1227
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:34,431
- [all groaning]
- Dude. Dude.

1228
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:37,599
Now I shall complete the spell,

1229
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:41,008
and all the creatures
of the netherworld...

1230
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,608
...will be here forever.

1231
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:49,310
And I will rule the land.

1232
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:51,511
[laughing]

1233
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:57,124
[yelling]

1234
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,489
[choir singing]

1235
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:03,559
"Our Father who art..."

1236
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,897
Wait a minute.
This is not my spell book!

1237
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:08,095
It's the Bible!

1238
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,337
You!

1239
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:17,241
Hand me my staff... boy!

1240
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,837
No! <i>Protectus!</i>

1241
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,543
[yelling]

1242
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,142
Whoa!

1243
01:17:28,345 --> 01:17:30,325
Oh, sweet mama!

1244
01:17:30,347 --> 01:17:33,191
Where there's a kitchen,
there's gotta be food.

1245
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:36,857
Quick, we need to hide before
the Howlloween Hound finds us.

1246
01:17:47,898 --> 01:17:51,368
Mmm, perfect. Pickled eggs!

1247
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:54,278
A fellow can't fight evil
on an empty stomach.

1248
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,851
[slurping]

1249
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:03,346
Ew, Budderball, those are eyeballs.

1250
01:18:04,014 --> 01:18:05,516
They're a bit rubbery.

1251
01:18:13,924 --> 01:18:15,733
Uh, dude!

1252
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:19,569
No, seriously, Mudbud,
they're not that bad. You want one?

1253
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:22,873
Now, Budderball, please don't panic,

1254
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:25,573
but the Howlloween Hound
is right behind you!

1255
01:18:25,602 --> 01:18:28,173
And I shouldn't panic?

1256
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,908
Hello, puppies.

1257
01:18:30,941 --> 01:18:34,718
Just thought I would visit
the kitchen for a late night snack.

1258
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:39,659
All right, dawg, you win,
but take Budderball first.

1259
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:42,060
Uh, he's got the most meat on his bones.

1260
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:43,086
B-Dawg!

1261
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:46,862
Actually, I'm not that tasty. Really.

1262
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,063
Silence! I don't care who's first.

1263
01:18:49,092 --> 01:18:51,231
You'll all end up in the same spot.

1264
01:18:51,261 --> 01:18:53,867
Trust me, dawgs. I've got a plan.

1265
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:55,604
B-Dawg has a plan?

1266
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:57,441
I can have a plan.

1267
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,344
Yo, Budderball, when I tell you,

1268
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:01,780
let one rip.

1269
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:02,873
[howling]

1270
01:19:02,906 --> 01:19:03,907
Do it, dawg!

1271
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,010
[groans]

1272
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:06,952
[farting]

1273
01:19:06,977 --> 01:19:09,423
[coughing]

1274
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:12,452
No! This can't be happening!

1275
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,597
[laughing] Our secret weapon!

1276
01:19:18,622 --> 01:19:20,568
That was wicked, dude!

1277
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,797
That takes years of practice.

1278
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:24,304
Good thinking, B-Dawg.

1279
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:28,002
I knew Budderball's potion
could neutralize anything,

1280
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:29,975
including the Howlloween Hound.

1281
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,604
The kids! Come on!

1282
01:19:31,635 --> 01:19:33,273
[grunting]

1283
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,583
Quickly, Billy!

1284
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:43,955
The sun is rising!

1285
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,789
Say the spell!

1286
01:19:45,815 --> 01:19:48,625
- Come on, Billy!
- [Pete] Say it, dude!

1287
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:52,159
[groaning]

1288
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:56,695

<i>Dnuoh Neewollowoh!</i>

1298
01:20:20,717 --> 01:20:23,027
You're finished, Warwick!

1299
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:24,862
[all gasping]

1300
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:29,167
[yelling]

1301
01:20:32,362 --> 01:20:35,866
I will take you with me!

1302
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:38,037
[both yelling]

1303
01:20:38,068 --> 01:20:40,378
[Sam] Mr. Johnson! No!

1304
01:20:40,804 --> 01:20:43,307
[Warwick] Ah! Ah!

1305
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:49,115
It's you, that petulant child!

1306
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,186
You're back!

1307
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:54,787
The name is Joseph.
Joseph Johnson!

1308
01:20:54,851 --> 01:20:56,990
[shouting] No!

1309
01:21:09,499 --> 01:21:10,671
Whoa!

1310
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:15,349
Uh, what if he comes back?

1311
01:21:15,839 --> 01:21:19,150
I don't think that will
happen again, Alice.

1312
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,364
[yelling]

1313
01:21:39,763 --> 01:21:41,265

[kids panting]

1317
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,051
Huh?

1318
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:02,723

1323
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:35,794
Pip!

- [gasping]
- [yelping]

1325
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:43,098
Oh, Pip. Pip.

1326
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:44,771
[kissing]

1327
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,239
But where are the Buddies?

1328
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:47,969
- [barking]
- [laughing] Whoa!

1329
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:49,499
[Alice] Rosebud!

1330
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:50,636
- B-Dawg! Come here.
- Hey, Buddha.

1331
01:22:50,667 --> 01:22:53,170
[Bartleby] Budderball. Budderball.

[laughing]

1333
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:03,148
Come on, everyone!
Let's get out of this evil place!

1334
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,216
- [Pete] Yeah.
- [Sam] Come on, buddy, let's go!

1335
01:23:05,281 --> 01:23:07,056
Come on, let's go!

1336
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,023

[police siren chirping]

1338
01:23:18,328 --> 01:23:21,366
[Dan] I'm here. Clear the way.
I'm here. It's OK.

1339
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,604
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1340
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:28,213
[giggling, laughing]

1341
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:33,483
I haven't had an episode like this since
that Kiss concert in the '80s. Wow!

1342
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:43,054
Maybe now I can be a wise owl.

1343
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:45,030
It's a new day at last.

1344
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:48,631
[Rodney] Hey, can we get
some help over here?

1345
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:52,398
- Oh.
- [Skip] Yeah, it's cold!

1346
01:23:52,462 --> 01:23:54,032
Can someone find our clothes?

1347
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:55,508
[all laughing]

1348
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:04,309
Thanks again for all the help,
Mr. John...

1349
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:05,876
I mean, Joseph.

1350
01:24:05,909 --> 01:24:08,856
It was a pleasure... dawg.

1351
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:11,324
[all laughing]

1352
01:24:11,381 --> 01:24:13,520
So, what are you gonna do now?

1353
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:17,930
Well, I tracked down Pip's
brothers' and sisters' owners.

1354
01:24:17,954 --> 01:24:21,800
They live all across America now,
so we're going to visit.

1355
01:24:22,492 --> 01:24:26,099
Figure it's about time
that Pip and I do some living.

1356
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:27,334
See the country.

1357
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:31,942
It's so great to have
a new leash on life.

1358
01:24:31,968 --> 01:24:33,447
I'll miss you, Buddies.

1359
01:24:33,503 --> 01:24:36,074
Yo, dawg, we'll catch you
on the flip side.

1360
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,348
I think what my brother's saying is,
we'll never forget you.

1361
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:41,218
Hang loose, dude.

1362
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:43,747
Now that you can eat again,
do me a favor.

1363
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,784
You need to check out the chili cheese
dogs at every town you visit

1364
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:48,590
and tell us which one's the best.

1365
01:24:48,618 --> 01:24:50,256
Have a great time, Pip.

1366
01:24:50,286 --> 01:24:51,560
Goodbye, Buddies.

1367
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:57,171
[whining]

1368
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,770
I haven't felt this spry in years.

[chuckling]

1370
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,769
We better hit the road. Bye, kids.

1371
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:07,907
[all] Bye, Mr. Johnson!
