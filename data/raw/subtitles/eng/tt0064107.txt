AREN'T THE CLOUDS
BEAUTIFUL?

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,530
I COULD JUST
LIE HERE ALL DAY

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
AND WATCH THEM
DRIFT BY.

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,460
IF YOU USE
YOUR IMAGINATION

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,860
YOU COULD SEE
LOTS OF THINGS

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,500
IN THE CLOUD
FORMATIONS.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,900
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SEE LINUS?

9
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,300
WELL THOSE CLOUDS
UP THERE LOOK TO ME

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,460
LIKE THE MAP OF
THE BRITISH HONDURAS
ON THE CARIBBEAN.

11
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,430
THAT CLOUD UP THERE

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,800
LOOKS A LITTLE
LIKE THE PROFILE
OF THOMAS EAKINS

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,700
THE FAMOUS PAINTER
AND SCULPTOR.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,730
AND THAT GROUP OF CLOUDS
OVER THERE

IT'S TAKING YOU
TOO LONG

101
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,600
TO GET DRESSED
AFTER EVERY PITCH.

102

DO YOU THINK
THAT INCIDENT
AT HARPER'S FERRY

117

WAS CONSISTENT
WITH MORALITY?

DO YOU CALL THAT
MORALITY?
DEFINE MORALITY.

120

IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY.

121
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,900
HAVE YOU LISTENED
TO THE RADIO LATELY?

122
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,730

ANY BALL GAMES

124

SOME INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS.

GOT HIT
BY A LINE DRIVE.

128
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,130
DOES ANYONE HERE
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FIRST AID?

129
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,460
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT SERIOUS

130
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,360
SECOND OR THIRD AID
WILL DO.

131
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,530
HERE RUN OVER TO
THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN

132
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,960
AND SOAK
THIS HANDKERCHIEF
IN COLD WATER.

133
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,760

ARE INSULTS.

I USED TO BE
ABLE TO DODGE
THOSE LINE DRIVES.

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,230
AND THIS WAS GOING
TO BE OUR BIG YEAR.

169
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,500
THE YEAR
WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE

170
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,500
WE MIGHT EVEN SCORE
OUR FIRST RUN.

171
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,330
I THINK
IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN
TO WIN ONCE IN A WHILE.

172
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,360
WINNING ISN'T
EVERYTHING.

173
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,030
BUT LOSING
ISN'T ANYTHING.

174
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,800
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
CHARLIE BROWN.

175
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,660
WE LEARN MORE FROM LOSING
THAN WE DO FROM WINNING.

176
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,460
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
THE SMARTEST PERSON
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

177
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,230
I THINK YOU JUST
TALK YOURSELF

178
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
INTO BEING A LOSER
CHARLIE BROWN.

179
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,330
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE
IN THIS BUSINESS

180
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,760
OF SOME PEOPLE
BEING BORN LOSERS.

181
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,060
IF YOU KEEP ON
DOING DIFFERENT THINGS

182
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,360
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN

183
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,260
JUST AS MUCH
AS ANYONE ELSE.

184
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,030
JUST KEEP TRYING
CHARLIE BROWN.

185
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,260
DON'T GIVE UP.

186
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,300
YOU'LL WIN YOUR SHARE
OF BALL GAMES.

187
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,330
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

188
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,230
FOR SOMEONE TO LOSE
EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.

189
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,530
ONE OF THESE DAYS
YOU'LL WIN.

TURNS TO FAILURE.

I'VE NEVER SUCCEEDED

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,330
I RECOGNIZE YOUR FRAILTIES
YOUR WEAKNESSES.

212
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,760
YOU NEED ME
TO POINT OUT YOUR FAULTS

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,660
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

222
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,760
I'VE PUT ALL OF
YOUR FAULTS ON SLIDES.

TO OBSERVE THE WORLD
IN UPRIGHT POSITION.

228
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,030

LACK OF COORDINATION
CHARLIE BROWN.

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,560

AND HERE WE SEE
YOUR LACK OF STYLE.

230
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,300
NOW ON TO
YOUR PHYSICAL FAULTS.

231
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,230
THESE SLIDES WILL SHOW
YOUR TENDENCY
TOWARDS FATNESS.

232
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,800
LOOK AT THAT STOMACH.

233
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,100

AND YOUR LEGS.

IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN
EVEN YOUR TOES ARE FAT.

TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

I CAN'T STAND IT
ANY LONGER!

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,160
I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH!
I CAN'T STAND IT!
I CAN'T STAND IT!

245
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,730
ONE MOMENT THERE
CHARLIE BROWN.

246
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,060
RELAX HERE A WHILE
CHARLIE BROWN.

247
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,230
WE'LL SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM TOGETHER.

248
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,130
THE WAY I SEE IT
YOUR PROBLEM IS
ONE OF EMOTIONS.

249
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,400
WHEN YOU HAVE
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS

250
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,200
IT IS USUALLY BECAUSE
YOU HAVE NO OUTLETS.

251
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
YOU NEED
EMOTIONAL OUTLETS.

252
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,400
I NEED
EMOTIONAL OUTLETS.

253
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,230
WHAT KIND OF
EMOTIONAL OUTLETS
WOULD YOU SUGGEST?

254
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,460
THIS FOOTBALL
IS A PERFECT ANSWER.

255
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,760
THERE IS NO BETTER
EMOTIONAL OUTLET
THAN KICKING A FOOTBALL.

256
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,460
TO SUM IT ALL UP
IN ONE PHRASE
CHARLIE BROWN

257
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,760
YOU COULD KICK AWAY
YOUR FAULTS.

258
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,600
BOY YOU MUST THINK
I AM STUPID.

259
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,000
YOU JUST WANNA
HOLD THAT FOOTBALL

260
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,160
AND HAVE ME COME RUNNING AT
TO KICK AT IT

261
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,030
SO YOU CAN PULL IT AWAY
AND SEE ME FALL FLAT
ON MY BACK!

262
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,360
THE CURE IS UP TO YOU
CHARLIE BROWN.

263
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,130
DO YOU WANNA KICK THE HABIT
OR DON'T YOU.

264
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,000
PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER HAVE
ANOTHER VIEWING SESSION

265
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,500
OF ALL YOUR FAULTS
ON THOSE SLIDES.

266
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,360
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,530
I'LL TRY IT!
I'LL TRY IT!

268
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,930
NO MORE SLIDES!

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,960
YOU WON'T
BE DISAPPOINTED
CHARLIE BROWN.

00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,830
THIS TIME I HAVE
A LITTLE EXTRA SURPRISE
AS A BONUS.

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,260

WHY DO I LET HER
DO THIS TO ME?

WHY? WHY?

273
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,330
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,530
AFTER ALL
IF YOU CAN'T TRUST
YOUR OWN PSYCHIATRIST

275
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,960
WHO CAN YOU TRUST?

276
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,100
THIS TIME
I'M REALLY GONNA KICK IT.

277
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,930
I'M GONNA KICK THE HABIT.

278
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,060

ARE GOING TO BANKRUPT ME.

I CAN'T WASTE A GOOD LUNCH.

316
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,900
DO YOU HAVE TO DRAG
THAT STUPID BLANKET
TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY?

317
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,730
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF PEOPLE CAME UP
TO YOU AND SAID:

318
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,960
"YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
DRAGS A BLANKET WITH HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES"?

319
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,260
THIS BLANKET
IS A NECESSITY.

320
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,000
IT KEEPS ME
FROM CRACKING UP.

321
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,530
IT COULD BE REGARDED
AS A SPIRITUAL TOURNIQUET.

322
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,560
WITHOUT THIS BLANKET
I'D BE NOTHING.

YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING

328
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,360
SHOCK TREATMENTS
OR SOMETHING.

329
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,600
WHAT'S MORE SHOCKING
THAN SEEING YOUR FAULTS

330
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,560

ONTO A SCREEN?

331
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,960
LIFE IS DIFFICULT
ISN'T IT
CHARLIE BROWN?

332
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,400
YES IT IS.

333
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,660
BUT I'VE DEVELOPED
A NEW PHILOSOPHY.

334
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,030
I ONLY DREAD ONE DAY
AT A TIME.

335
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,200
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

336
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,160
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE
CARRYING ON LIKE THIS

368
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,800
{\i1}TO GAIN CONFIDENCE

369
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,700
{\i1}I THINK I'LL RAISE MY HAND

370
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,530
{\i1}IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME.{\i0}

371
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,000
{\i1}I THINK
I'LL JUST RAISE MY HAND
AND VOLUNTEER.{\i0}

372
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,600
MY HAND WON'T GO UP.

373
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,360
MY HAND IS SMARTER

375
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,100

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,700
AM I TALKING TO MYSELF?

378
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,260
YES MA'AM.
I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF
ABOUT THE SPELLING BEE.

379
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,460
YES MA'AM
I'D LIKE TO BE

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,730
[whispering]
PSST YOU'RE CRAZY
DON'T DO IT.

381
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,330
YOU'LL JUST MAKE
A FOOL OUT OF YOURSELF.

382
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
I WILL NOT!

383
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,600
[teacher chattering]

384
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,160
EXCUSE ME MA'AM.
I WAS ANSWERING
ONE OF MY MANY DETRACTORS.

385
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,760
{\i1}(Charlie)
WELL HERE I AM{\i0}

386
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,430
{\i1}IN THE FIRST ROUND
OF THE SPELLING BEE.{\i0}

387
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,060
{\i1}NOBODY THINKS I CAN WIN
THE CLASS SPELLING BEE{\i0}

388
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,560
{\i1}BUT I'M GONNA SHOW 'EM.{\i0}

389
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,630
{\i1}I NOT ONLY KNOW
A LOT OF HARD WORDS{\i0}

390
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,030
{\i1}BUT I KNOW
EVERY SPELLING RULE
IN THE BOOK.{\i0}

391
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,860
{\i1}THE ONLY ONE
I HAVE TROUBLE
REMEMBERING IS:{\i0}

392
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,700
{\i1}"I" BEFORE "E"
EXCEPT AFTER "D."{\i0}

393
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,800
{\i1}OR IS IT "E" BEFORE "I"
EXCEPT AFTER "G"?{\i0}

394
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,260
{\i1}I'VE GOT TO STAY CALM
AND NOT GET RATTLED.{\i0}

395
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,360
{\i1}THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE
TO PROVE TO EVERYONE{\i0}

396
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,200
{\i1}THAT I CAN DO SOMETHING.{\i0}

397
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,100
{\i1}I DON'T CARE
IF I DON'T ACTUALLY WIN.{\i0}

398
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,500
{\i1}ALL I WANT TO DO IS
GET PAST
THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS{\i0}

399
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,200
{\i1}AND MAKE A DECENT SHOWING.{\i0}

{\i1}LET'S SEE NOW
HOW DOES THAT
SPELLING RULE GO?{\i0}

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,730
{\i1}I GUESS I REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.{\i0}

403
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,900
{\i1}ALL THE WORDS
IN THE FIRST ROUND
OF A SPELLING BEE{\i0}

404
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,700
{\i1}ARE USUALLY QUITE EASY.{\i0}

405
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,930
{\i1}IN A WAY
I'D ALMOST LIKE TO START OFF
WITH A HARD ONE.{\i0}

406

444
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,430

445
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,600

YOU'LL REPRESENT
OUR CLASS

446
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,500
IN THE ALL-SCHOOL
SPELLING BEE.

447
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,060
I'M GOING HOME
AND REALLY BEAR DOWN.

448
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,430
(Charlie)
I'M GOING TO STUDY
THE WHOLE DICTIONARY.

449
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,360
THIS IS ONE OF THE RULES
I MUST REMEMBER.

450
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:15,360
"'I' BEFORE 'E'

"'I' BEFORE 'E'

457
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,030
NO "I" AFTER "E"
AFTER "C."

YOU KNOW STICKING
AN "E" FOR "I" OR "Y."

466
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,800

THE FIRST THING
WE MUST CORRECT
IS YOUR POSTURE.

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,030
JUDGES OF A CONTEST
CAN BE INFLUENCED
BY POOR POSTURE.

621

LIKE HE USUALLY DOES.

A LITTLE COACHING
WILL HELP THOUGH.

631

TOO BAD HE DOESN'T HAVE
NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.

632
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,600

NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.

YOU'VE GOT A SMILE
LIKE A SICK PUMPKIN.

638
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,460
AND FURTHERMORE
YOU HAVE TO BE
UNDERSTOOD.

639
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,160
THE JUDGES MUST BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU!

640
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,000
YOUR DICTION
MUST BE PERFECT!

00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,200

THE ECONOMIC FUTURE
OF YOUR MANAGER.

HOW I GET INTO THESE MESSES.

IF I HADN'T VOLUNTEERED
IN THE FIRST PLACE

I WOULDN'T HAVE WON

647
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,030
AND NOW I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE TRYING
TO MEMORIZE THE DICTIONARY.

648
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,760
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A HERO

649
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,900
I'LL MAKE
A BIGGER FOOL OF MYSELF
THAN EVER.

650
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,760
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED
CHARLIE BROWN

651
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,330
YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE.

652
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,260
YOU'LL EITHER BE A HERO
OR A GOAT.

WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE ME TO A MOVIE?

658
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,330
HOW WOULD I EVER
TAKE YOU TO A MOVIE?

659
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,730
WELL THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

660
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,300
BOYS CALL UP GIRLS
AND SAY

661
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,300
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO A MOVIE?"

662
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,830
AND THEN THE GIRLS SAY

663
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,130
"WHY YES
I'D LIKE IT VERY MUCH."

664
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,960
AND THEN THE BOY
GOES OVER
TO THE GIRL'S HOUSE

666
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,330
AND HE SAYS TO HER
"I'VE COME

667
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,400
HAVE YOU COME
TO TAKE ME
TO A MOVIE LINUS?

668
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,100
GOOD GRIEF NO.

669
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,730

THE CUTEST THING?

670
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,430

00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,630
THINK OF IT THIS WAY
CHARLIE BROWN

677
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,300

680
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,130
NOT TO MENTION MY FUTURE
ECONOMIC SECURITY
CHARLIE BROWN.

681
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,360
AS YOUR AGENT

682
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,130
IN OUR ENDEAVORS.

683
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,830
GO OUT THERE

OK CHARLIE BROWN
I GUESS
YOU'D BETTER GET ABOARD

686
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,430
THE BUS IS

687
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,600
INCIDENTALLY CHARLIE BROWN
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS.

688
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,600

692
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,230
I DON'T THINK I--

693

694
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,230

704
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,030
SCHROEDER DO YOU THINK
CHARLIE BROWN WILL WIN?

705
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,300
DO YOU THINK
THAT CHARLIE BROWN
HAS A CHANCE?

706
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,500
WELL HE'S BEEN
PRACTICING A LOT.

707
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,700
I THINK
HE HAS A GOOD CHANCE.

708
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,860
THE YOUNG MAN THESE DAYS
HAS TO PRACTICE A LOT
DOESN'T HE?

709
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,130
A YOUNG MAN THESE DAYS
HAS TO WORK VERY HARD

710
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,100
TO BE ABLE
TO SUPPORT A WIFE
DOESN'T HE?

711
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,430
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A WIFE?

712
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,300
DO PIANO PLAYERS
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
SCHROEDER?

713
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,030
SOME DO.

714
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,830
IF THEY PRACTICE
VERY HARD I GUESS.

715
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,930
KEEP PRACTICING KIDDO.

716
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,700
INCIDENTALLY
WHO IS THIS?

717
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,430
GEORGE WASHINGTON?

00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:07,330
WELL?

720
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,230
I CAN'T HELP IT.

721
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,900
I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GIVING MY BLANKET
TO CHARLIE BROWN

722
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,130
TO TAKE TO THAT SPELLING BEE
FOR GOOD LUCK.

723
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,860
NOW I KEEP FAINTING.
I KEEP PASSING OUT.

724
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,200
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUTSIDE

725
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,200
AND GET A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR?

726
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,960
[gasping]

727
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,500
OH.

728
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,960
[whimpering]

729
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,030
WOE IS ME. I'M DYING.
MY RACE IS RUN.

730
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,960
WHY DID I LET CHARLIE BROWN
TAKE MY BLANKET?

731
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,660
I'VE GOT TO GET
MY BLANKET BACK.

00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,930
SEE I'M ALWAYS PASSING OUT.

735
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,930
SNOOPY
IT'S UP TO YOU
TO HELP ME.

736
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,600
I JUST GOTTA HAVE
MY BLANKET BACK.

737
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,730
I GOTTA HAVE MY BLANKET.

738
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,060
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

739
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,200
MAYBE YOU CAN COME WITH ME
TO FIND CHARLIE BROWN

740
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,460
AND GET MY BLANKET BACK.

741
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,500

743
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,860

D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E.

745
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,600
DISGRACE.

746
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,000
IN CHOOSING BETWEEN
"I-E" AND "E-I"

747
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,600
"E-I" IS USED
AFTER THE LETTER "C."

748
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,760
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

749
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,800
I'M SO TIRED I CAN
HARDLY STAY AWAKE.

750
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,760
MAYBE I'D BETTER GO TO BED.

751
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:01,160
BUT IF I GIVE UP NOW
THE KIDS WILL
NEVER FORGIVE ME.

752
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,030
I CAN'T KEEP UP THIS PACE.

753
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,330
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST TELL 'EM ALL

754
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,360

HAVEN'T GONE ANY PLACE

(Charlie Brown)
I DON'T CARE.

1016
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:29,760
YOU WEREN'T IN SCHOOL TODAY
CHARLIE BROWN.
ALL THE KIDS MISSED YOU.

1017
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:33,630
I'M NEVER GOING
TO SCHOOL AGAIN
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

1018
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,600
WE HAD A BALLGAME
AFTER SCHOOL.

01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:36,830
I DON'T CARE.

1020
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,000
I'M NEVER GOING TO
PLAY BALL EITHER.

1021
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,230
I'M NEVER GOING TO DO
ANYTHING AGAIN.

HOW YOU FEEL.

AND I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL
YOU LET EVERYONE DOWN

1027
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,600
AND YOU MADE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF
AND EVERYTHING.

1028
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,160
BUT
DID YOU NOTICE SOMETHING
CHARLIE BROWN?

1029
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,800
WHAT'S THAT?

1030
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,860
THE WORLD DIDN'T
COME TO AN END.
