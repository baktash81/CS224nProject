1
00:00:22,142 --> 00:00:25,339
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely kind of a guy...

2
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:28,472
who'd resigned himself
to the fact that love was blind.

3
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:32,109
"Now, if love is blind, "
he thought to himself...

4
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,553
"How will it find me?

5
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,188
"lt honestly seems such a crime.

6
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:40,855
"For how many times
has love knocked on the door...

7
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,624
"when it should have been
knocking on mine?"

8
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:49,129
And so one day, he went off
in search of the aloof creature.

9
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:52,467
He soon happened upon
the cute and fuzzy bunny gang.

10
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,507
Perhaps they could help him.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,504
"Pardon me, cute and fuzzy bunnies, "
he said.

12
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,113
"l wonder if you could help me find love. "

13
00:01:03,984 --> 00:01:05,849
"Love would have nothing to do...

14
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:09,912
"with such a stupid-looking creature, "
said the first cute and fuzzy bunny.

15
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,251
"With that nose. And those shoes. "

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,922
"And that stomach. "

17
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:16,292
"And those eyes. "

18
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:17,990
"And those ears. "

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,191
"Roses are red, violets are blue...

20
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,105
"but love will have
nothing to do with you! "

21
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:29,474
They chanted and danced around him.

22
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,804
Naturally, our hero
was very saddened by this, so...

23
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,370
he....

24
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:38,176
Actually, he....

25
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:40,682
He reached into his suitcase...

26
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,154
and pulled out an lsraeli submachine gun...

27
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:46,056
and he sawed those
cute, fuzzy bastards in half...

28
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,060
with hot lead!

29
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:50,696
lt was beautiful!

30
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:53,392
Wait, stop! No, no.

31
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:56,594
It's supposed to be a love story
not a Rambo bloodbath.

32
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:59,896
Forget it. It's not your fault. It's me.

33
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:09,148
Morty, how am I going to get this done?

34
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,908
What do you know?
You're not a man. You're a cat.

35
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:14,749
Go back to your feline world.
Get out of here.

36
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,985
You better move it, Hoops.
You'll miss graduation.

37
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:24,257
Okay, Mom.

38
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,865
Here's your cap and gown. All clean.

39
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:30,131
-What do you mean, "All clean"?
-Hoops, these are rented.

40
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,296
Do you know
how many people wear them?

41
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:33,669
I washed them.

42
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:34,705
Rita Segal.

43
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,710
Solomon Shapiro. Frank Stephens.

44
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,640
Shirley Strom.

45
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:49,383
I got to get out of Generic this summer.
I'm gonna lose my mind.

46
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:52,152
Come to Nantucket with me.
We'll have a blast.

47
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:55,285
-We'll scale the mermaids.
-I can't be a party monkey.

48
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,624
I got to buckle down.

49
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:59,461
I've got two weeks to submit
my scholarship assignment.

50
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,627
It's my only chance to get into
Rhode Island School of Design.

51
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:05,365
It's summer.
We're high school graduates now.

52
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:10,166
It's time to reap the rewards of four years
of hard, grueling, mind-expanding work.

53
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:14,274
-What's this word?
-Your last name.

54
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,107
Georgina Williams.

55
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,719
The assignment is supposed to be
an illustrated love story.

56
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,689
What do I know about love?
I've never been in love.

57
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:28,592
l would like to congratulate
the 1986 graduating class...

58
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,892
of Generic New York High School!

59
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:53,443
I think what you really need
is a break from your mom.

60
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,615
You're gonna end up
being a street cleaner...

61
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,181
because you didn't get
your basketball scholarship?

62
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,693
-I guess she's taking it hard.
-Of course she is.

63
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:04,458
It's like my mom saying
I'm an irresponsible louse.

64
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,227
I know that she knows
I'm not irresponsible.

65
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,805
Your mother still has faith in you, Hoops.

66
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:15,635
Just because you can't
play basketball worth a shit...

67
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,939
doesn't mean
you got no other option in life.

68
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,206
-I guess you're right.
-There you go.

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,771
Nothing proves that more
than being surprised...

70
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,908
with your brand-new graduation wheels.

71
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,944
That final, parental confirmation
that you're going somewhere in life.

72
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,918
And this is just the vehicle
to take you there.

73
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,358
Nantucket. When can we leave?

74
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,324
Just got to pick up my sister.

75
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:44,063
And, Hoops, remember...

76
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,867
never say anything about her dog.

77
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:13,257
Bye-bye. Have a nice summer.

78
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,359
Squid, you and old Boscoe
going to visit Grandma this summer?

79
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:19,200
Dog from Mars!

80
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:23,441
It's so ugly. Someone put it to sleep.

81
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:33,014
Girls, if you make faces like that
and somebody slaps you on the back...

82
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,950
you'll stay that way forever!

83
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:41,959
Stop that! Go on! Have a nice summer!

84
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:46,326
Dog from space!

85
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:21,029
There sure are some ugly-looking kids
running around here.

86
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,676
Where's this place, anyway?

87
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,378
First stop's a little place called
Woods Hole.

88
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,433
Okay, Cassandra...

89
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,733
all I want is my money.

90
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,571
It's my money, and you know it!

91
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:14,080
No! It's definitely mine.

92
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,980
Trust me.

93
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,378
Excuse me, guys. Looking for this?

94
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,579
Get him!

95
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,585
George, get us out of here!

96
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,717
So long, sucker.

97
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,727
It's my money!

98
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,837
-Who are your friends?
-Maniacs! Get us out of here! Go!

99
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,902
Hurry up! They're gaining on us!

100
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,043
-Hi.
-Hi. Who are you?

101
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:51,106
-I'm Cassandra.
-George. The pleasure's mine.

102
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:53,049
We're heading for the docks!

103
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,144
-We got to make the boat.
-What boat?

104
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:58,622
You think we're driving to Nantucket?
Come on, it's an island!

105
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,754
You never mentioned any boat.
I'm not getting on any boat.

106
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,195
I beg to differ.

107
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,400
What are you doing? It's already left!

108
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:14,804
-We'll make it.
-We'll make it?

109
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:17,365
You might want
to brace yourselves, though.

110
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,364
Get me out of here!

111
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,170
Now!

112
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:00,382
This is going to be a great summer.

113
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,852
I want you to die.

114
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:08,460
Once upon a time,
there was a lonely guy...

115
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,462
on a quest for love.

116
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:13,794
The cute, fuzzy bunnies
were quick to cooperate this time.

117
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,536
The path they sent him on
landed him on an ocean-going vessel.

118
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:21,005
Our hero hated boats,
but he was desperate on his quest...

119
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:25,104
and once again he fell victim
to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies.

120
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,408
And he was sucked
into the cold, dark sea...

121
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,471
and he never found love.

122
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,355
-Are you all right?
-Me?

123
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,499
Yeah, great. Really good. Why?

124
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,738
I don't know,
you look pretty uncomfortable.

125
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:55,437
Are you afraid of water?

126
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:01,372
No, not really. Yeah.

127
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,613
Actually, I am afraid of the water.

128
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:08,984
But this is a big boat,
a lot of safety equipment...

129
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:10,622
I can see the land.

130
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,724
Clean, fresh air....

131
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,389
Chilidog.

132
00:11:17,664 --> 00:11:19,154
Go away.

133
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,593
-You live on the island?
-Just for the summer.

134
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,606
-I'm helping out my grandfather.
-What kind of help?

135
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,541
He's got a houseful of friends
he's taking care of.

136
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,873
He's having money problems.
I was working in a dive...

137
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:36,211
trying to help him out, but I got ripped off.

138
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:39,046
Is that what that was about,
the big scene back there?

139
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:42,247
-Wish I could've helped more.
-Come on, you were great.

140
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:44,584
You sure? Last bite.

141
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,920
Will you get out of here with this?

142
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:53,396
You kids!

143
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:19,723
Come on! This is gonna be funny.

144
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:24,657
All the eggs, they're broken!

145
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:29,162
Clay, if you don't stand on the right side...

146
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,260
you're defeating the entire purpose...

147
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,237
of buying them, you big mess!

148
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,674
Mess!

149
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:41,407
There they are. The Stork twins.

150
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,205
Those guys? They're twins?

151
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:45,217
Clay's a couple minutes older.

152
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:47,683
The Stork twins!

153
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,287
-This is Hoops.
-Aloha!

154
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,081
Hi, Hoops!

155
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,060
I'm gonna go get the car.

156
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,653
Hey, Squidly!

157
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,166
This is going to be a great shot.

158
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,236
-Maybe we'll see each other.
-Hope so.

159
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,675
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you, too.

160
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:13,839
Hey, Stork guys!

161
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,847
Hi, Hoops. How do you do?

162
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:18,042
Hi. It's very, it's very....

163
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:21,052
Nice to meet you.

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,112
Yeah. Me, too. What's with the big fish?

165
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,557
They're shooting the sequel
to that movie Foam.

166
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:32,428
About the giant dolphin with rabies
that terrorizes a small New England town.

167
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:36,597
We're gonna work part-time
as security guards on the set.

168
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,570
Stork twins!

169
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,039
Clay!

170
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,476
You guys got the day off from the garage?

171
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,570
No, we're doing a job.

172
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:52,239
-We're picking up a boat.
-Whose boat is it?

173
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,809
His.

174
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:18,072
-You touched my car.
-What?

175
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,546
You touched my car!

176
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,514
Right! Let me get it clean, then!

177
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,016
You touched it again!

178
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,552
Don't ever touch my car again, ever!

179
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,323
Don't touch my car ever again!

180
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:35,394
Teddy, honey,
can we go pick up your boat?

181
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,553
Ever!

182
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,030
Remember? Your new boat?

183
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,639
Ty, bring in the Stork twins!

184
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:54,910
Come here.

185
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,582
I would've come anyways.

186
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,449
-Now move that tow truck!
-Let's go! Hustle!

187
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,329
That is some tuna.

188
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,816
Grammy.
The high school graduates are here.

189
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:39,183
Look who it is.

190
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,757
My pride and joy.

191
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,298
There's my little girl.

192
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:51,192
Look what Grammy bought for you.

193
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,335
Would you like
some nice milk and cookies?

194
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,503
Come on, Grammy will show you
where we go.

195
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,540
Nice meeting you, too.

196
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,014
-She's nuts about me.
-Yeah.

197
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:08,650
You got to meet my Uncle Frank.

198
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:11,515
$1 million!

199
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:14,557
This is it. We guarantee it.

200
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:16,925
This is your summer to win!

201
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:20,227
Keep it here and listen for this jingle:

202
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:23,632
95.5 FM. Music-money time.

203
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:28,129
lf you, yes, you, are our fiftieth caller...

204
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:31,468
$1 million is all yours!

205
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,273
That's right. $1 million.

206
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,280
Uncle Frank.

207
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:38,780
Georgie, what the hell
are you doing in here?

208
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,279
Still at it.

209
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:43,652
God, would you get out of here?
You think I'm playing games?

210
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:45,918
Just leave me alone!

211
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,453
Every summer he sits there
trying to win that radio show.

212
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,725
Every summer he loses
a bit more of his mind.

213
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:56,097
Why don't they just leave me alone
with my dream?

214
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,102
Okay. There.

215
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,707
Billy, take this in the back room.

216
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:11,272
Field strip it.

217
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,748
Careful with that thing!

218
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:19,123
Boys, tourniquet!

219
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:26,222
-Calamari.
-Mr. Raymond.

220
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:28,529
Thought you'd be in prison by now.

221
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,000
What can I do for you?

222
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,866
We're looking for Acky.

223
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:34,372
This is my friend, Hoops McCann.

224
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,374
Quit monkeying with that thing!

225
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,739
Sorry.

226
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,842
Another wasted summer, boys?

227
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:43,381
Why don't you go in with Acky?
Just think of it.

228
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,883
Death from above! Airborne!

229
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:50,047
Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir,
but Acky throws up on the ferris wheel...

230
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,749
at the children's park.

231
00:17:51,824 --> 00:17:54,122
You've got no college acceptance.

232
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:57,390
You've got no direction with your lives.
No plan.

233
00:17:57,463 --> 00:18:00,990
When there's no plan, there's no attack.
No attack, no victory.

234
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:05,737
This! This is what makes men, men.

235
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,934
I'll have to pick one up.

236
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,074
Anyway, where's Acky?

237
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,441
He's out on a mission for his old man.

238
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,277
A mission, sir?

239
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,712
He's on the beach collecting shells.

240
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:21,347
That's a little more like Acky's speed.

241
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:31,326
Acky, what are you doing?

242
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:33,627
George, take cover.

243
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,598
Your dad said you were collecting shells.

244
00:18:40,673 --> 00:18:43,005
Shells. 57 millimeter.

245
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:47,144
My dad gets $12 apiece for them.
They make great paperweights.

246
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,180
Hi, I'm Ack Ack.

247
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:53,579
-Let's get out of here.
-Over the top, boys!

248
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,011
Nobody lives forever!

249
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:00,521
My God!

250
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,101
You could have waited
till they were done bombing the beach.

251
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:16,370
When the man says go, you go.

252
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,376
You could have been killed.

253
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:20,835
My god!

254
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,051
Do you realize
for every lost, mangled doll...

255
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:38,756
there's a little girl with a broken heart?

256
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,790
Sure you want to be a Marine, Acky?

257
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,898
I just don't see you
having the killer instinct.

258
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:57,807
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

259
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,417
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...."

260
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,154
What's going on?

261
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,817
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

262
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,883
"thou anointest my head with oil.

263
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:12,892
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life."

264
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,038
For God's sake.

265
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,472
Excuse me for just one....

266
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,615
Leave me.

267
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:58,065
Old man Eldridge finally kicked, Ted?

268
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,136
Doing my laps, Dad.

269
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:07,217
I would like to have a word with you.

270
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,719
In a minute, Dad.

271
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:16,327
I'll try not to take up
too much of your time.

272
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:17,828
Okay.

273
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,992
Are you ready for the regatta, Ted?

274
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:24,969
Sure, I'm ready.
The new sloop's a beauty. I can't lose.

275
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:27,904
If you screw it up this year,
you and I are out....

276
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,331
Hi, Daddy.

277
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,368
-Hi, Grandpa.
-How are you?

278
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,047
Good.

279
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:41,052
If you screw it up this year,
that decaying old man, your grandfather...

280
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,553
takes everything away.

281
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:44,248
Do you understand, Ted?

282
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:47,554
If you don't come home with that trophy,
we lose it all.

283
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,659
No more pools, no more Ferrari.

284
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,356
Do you know what happens then?

285
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,294
-Don't say it, Dad.
-That's right, Ted.

286
00:21:57,369 --> 00:21:59,200
You'll have to go to....

287
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:01,271
-No!
-Work, Teddy, work!

288
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,807
Don't say that word!

289
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,537
I'll win! Just don't say that word!

290
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:07,875
That's why I need this Eldridge land.

291
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:11,047
With this land, I can finally start building...

292
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:13,176
Beckerstead Estates.

293
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:14,549
And that crazy old man....

294
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,757
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Grandpa!

295
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:20,348
Have a wonderful day.

296
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,856
That crazy old man can't hold
that race over my head every year.

297
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:30,299
What did you find out about this place?

298
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,904
Chong says he left it to his granddaughter.

299
00:22:33,973 --> 00:22:36,271
She's got one week
to pay the back mortgage.

300
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,833
I've seen this girl. She's a real hippie type.

301
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:40,845
She wears these braids.

302
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,441
What do they call them, cornhusks?

303
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:46,811
If she don't get the money,
you get the house.

304
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,644
They're already doing the paperwork.

305
00:22:53,926 --> 00:22:55,416
Wonderful.

306
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:00,999
This will be...

307
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,399
my most beautiful restaurant yet.

308
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:09,333
I used to come down here
with him all the time.

309
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:15,470
Your grandfather sounds
like he was a really nice man.

310
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:17,272
I'm really sorry.

311
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,180
Old Mr. Peckerhead's been trying--

312
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:20,946
-Who?
-Beckerstead.

313
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,512
He's been trying to drive Grandpa
out of that house since I was a baby.

314
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,387
I guess he finally got him.

315
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,688
So what's gonna happen to the house
and all his friends?

316
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,761
The bank's given me one week...

317
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:35,323
to come up with
the back mortgage of $3,000.

318
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:37,335
It might as well be $1 million.

319
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:40,332
I can't let those people
be thrown out on the streets.

320
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:42,670
I just wish I had more time.

321
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,498
I wish I could help.

322
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,910
I'm not going to give up.

323
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:49,607
I figure I can sell some of the furniture...

324
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:51,673
and I'm going to do some clubs.

325
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,776
-You sing?
-Yeah, I try.

326
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:57,522
Cool. I bet you're really great.

327
00:23:58,257 --> 00:23:59,417
Thanks.

328
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:03,922
I guess basketball is your thing,
with a name like Hoops.

329
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:08,292
It's kind of in the family blood.
My dad was really great.

330
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:13,096
But I want to do something
a little more challenging, a little different.

331
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:15,538
I'm trying to get a scholarship
to art school.

332
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,098
What do you draw?

333
00:24:18,611 --> 00:24:21,478
Nothing, lately. I'm in kind of a rut.

334
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,972
Draw me something?

335
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,073
Okay.

336
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:29,117
What can I get for you?

337
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:31,418
I don't know.

338
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:34,956
How about a gorilla? Or me, or....

339
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:39,364
-How about a gorilla and me?
-You and a gorilla.

340
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:41,655
Okay.

341
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,159
Okay.

342
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,615
Lose the nose. Fix that, and...

343
00:24:58,884 --> 00:25:00,511
change the feet.

344
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,027
Best I could do with short notice.

345
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,097
It's great.

346
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:19,627
If this is what you do second best,
I'd love to see you play basketball.

347
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:22,371
It's quite a sight, let me tell you.

348
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,065
Thanks for cheering me up.

349
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,011
My pleasure.

350
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:31,076
I better go.

351
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:32,741
Yeah, me, too.

352
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:36,283
Thanks.

353
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,979
Thanks a lot.

354
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,756
Maybe you can come by later.

355
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:47,658
Okay.

356
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,431
'Bye.

357
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:58,241
Cassandra!

358
00:25:58,677 --> 00:26:00,542
Cassandra, can you help me a minute?

359
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,843
Could you help me out? I'm stuck.

360
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:11,616
$1 million.

361
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,523
lt could happen at any time, any day...

362
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:17,323
any hour, any minute, any second!

363
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:20,987
We're giving away $1 million...

364
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,899
and it could happen now, right now!

365
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:27,097
But it's not going to happen yet...

366
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,538
so keep listening for this jingle:

367
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:31,098
95.5--

368
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:38,474
To win $1 million!

369
00:26:57,436 --> 00:26:58,698
Hey, Egg!

370
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,173
Really smart.

371
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:03,932
What if that went in my eye?

372
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:06,871
Where's Hoops?

373
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:10,308
He went over there.

374
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,311
You guys better look after him.

375
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:15,842
He's got a tendency
to wallow in his artistic miseries.

376
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:17,887
Yeah.

377
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,049
Egg, cut me some shade, will you?

378
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:25,323
Okay, thank you.

379
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:29,600
Excuse me.

380
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:31,636
Little boy, will you hold this for me?

381
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:32,965
Thank you very much.

382
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,307
-Mommy!
-Sorry.

383
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:37,768
Jimmy?

384
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:42,276
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi.

385
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:45,449
Hoops, how about a brew?

386
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:47,542
Thanks, guys. That's good.

387
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,086
Please, Mr. Dog, don't.

388
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:54,688
What are you doing?

389
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,460
Nothing much, guys.

390
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,791
Hoops, if you run out of things to draw...

391
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:01,298
you can draw us, you know.

392
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,297
Yeah, you could draw us nude.

393
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,135
Yeah, bare naked with no clothes on!

394
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,467
No, button up!

395
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,166
Thank you. I appreciate that.

396
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,731
I'll come up with something.

397
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:13,277
I offer you my body and...

398
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:15,677
and now I'm the jerk of the world
or something.

399
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,078
It was a nice gesture.

400
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:19,546
Hi. I met you at the docks yesterday.

401
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:22,086
Hello. I'm Hoops.

402
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:22,916
Cookie.

403
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:24,621
-How's it going?
-Great.

404
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:26,957
These are the Stork twins.

405
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:27,923
Hi, Cookie.

406
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,123
Hi, Cookie. I'm Egg.

407
00:28:30,562 --> 00:28:31,460
Gemini!

408
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:35,257
I know them. They work for my boyfriend.

409
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:36,798
What can I do for you?

410
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,335
We're gonna go sailing...

411
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:40,394
and we were wondering if you guys...

412
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,531
could help us get our boat in the water?

413
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:44,442
What do you say, fellas?

414
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,377
Can we help these lovely ladies
get their boats in the water?

415
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:50,308
No. It sounds like work.

416
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:53,016
Boats are heavy. I'll get a hernia.

417
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,116
Come on, let's do it. Just get up!

418
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,687
-Sure. Love to.
-Great.

419
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,756
Anything else we can do for you...

420
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,261
like shovel your driveway?

421
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,392
You guys!

422
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:17,170
You guys!

423
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:19,369
You have anything heavier we could carry?

424
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:20,342
Like a car?

425
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:26,584
Yeah, sure. Forsake me for eight chicks.

426
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:29,052
Come on, hey!

427
00:29:32,157 --> 00:29:34,125
No! Mister, please!

428
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:35,251
Please, sir!

429
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,823
You don't understand. I've had a bad day.

430
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,571
Do you want to come sailing?
There's room for one more.

431
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:56,205
No. Really, I can't.

432
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:57,475
I don't like boats.

433
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,517
You're not afraid, are you?

434
00:29:59,985 --> 00:30:01,111
No, of course not.

435
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,849
I got a lot to do on the beach.

436
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:06,055
How about a movie, then?

437
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,126
What about your boyfriend?

438
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,662
He's going to a reception.

439
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:13,196
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

440
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,680
Come on, have a heart, dude.

441
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:39,288
No, not those. No!

442
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:42,054
Please, Your Enormousness,
anything but chili!

443
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:44,392
She really likes you!

444
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:46,862
Too bad George wasn't here to see that.

445
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,462
George!

446
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:54,032
Far out! Dead man on the beach!

447
00:31:04,449 --> 00:31:05,882
Chili?

448
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,751
Phil, do the CPR.

449
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:12,756
-You do it.
-No. I have seniority.

450
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:14,758
I want you to give him CPR.

451
00:31:14,826 --> 00:31:16,453
Phil, give him CPR!

452
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:18,758
George was alive, just barely.

453
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:21,056
Nobody wanted to perform CPR on him...

454
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,828
so it was a complete nightmare.

455
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:26,193
But enough about old George.

456
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:28,466
How's the dollar count?
Get any more money?

457
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,804
So far so good. I sold some furniture...

458
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:33,777
and I have a gig tonight
at a club called the Dew Drop Inn.

459
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:35,142
Maybe you can come by.

460
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:37,240
Yeah, sure.

461
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,139
I'll try.

462
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:41,252
I might have something to do tonight.

463
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,547
If you can.

464
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,289
It'd be nice to have a friend there.

465
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:48,451
I'll be there, at the first table.

466
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:49,755
You can count on it.

467
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:53,029
I got to go.

468
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:55,065
George's grandma is making us supper.

469
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:57,693
You know how grandmas are
about that kind of thing.

470
00:31:57,769 --> 00:31:59,236
It means the world to them.

471
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,904
Are you sure you don't want
a little bit more?

472
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,501
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
It was delicious, though.

473
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,139
All right, then.

474
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:19,253
I got it.

475
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:22,856
Keep it.

476
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,259
Thank you very much.

477
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:26,563
Yeah, it was really good.

478
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:29,292
So, why aren't you going out with Cookie?

479
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:32,267
You're here to write a love story, Hoops.

480
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:33,736
Cookie is a love story.

481
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:36,706
George, her boyfriend is like
Cro-Magnon teen.

482
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:39,141
No way. Besides, I said
I was helping Cassandra.

483
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:40,769
I promised to go to her show.

484
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:43,041
Yeah, but like, Cookie asked you out first.

485
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:45,341
We were there.

486
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:48,815
Teddy's not even gonna be around tonight.

487
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:51,253
You know where Teddy's going to be?

488
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,423
At a little reception
celebrating the rape of the land...

489
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:56,461
that Cassandra's house now stands on.

490
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:59,156
-The Stork brothers told me.
-That's true!

491
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:01,796
Cookie seems like a real nice person.

492
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,858
Maybe she'd like to help Cassandra out.

493
00:33:03,935 --> 00:33:06,495
I don't think she's interested.
You know what I mean?

494
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:13,175
Come on, Hoops.
Quit thinking about yourself all the time.

495
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:17,505
Go out with Cookie,
and get her on your side.

496
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,583
Then go see Cassandra.

497
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:23,253
I'd rather keep the original bone structure
of my face.

498
00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:26,084
-Do you want to help Cassandra?
-Of course.

499
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,287
The Stork twins are going
to the reception after work.

500
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:31,452
If Teddy does anything...

501
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,957
they'll call me at the drive-in and...

502
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:36,033
the big guy'll be watching your back.

503
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,297
Trust me.

504
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,367
Once upon a time...

505
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:45,274
there was a happening guy,
who'd stumbled onto a girl...

506
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:47,311
who embodied all that love should be.

507
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,239
All seemed well.

508
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,477
Those cute and fuzzy bunnies...

509
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,018
weren't so bad after all.

510
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,148
Until....

511
00:33:58,423 --> 00:33:59,822
Her boyfriend showed up...

512
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:02,758
and pounded him into something
that resembled a wet prune.

513
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:06,927
Ouch.

514
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:13,100
"Never! "

515
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,138
I am going to die.

516
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:20,906
Forget about it.

517
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,274
Where're you going?

518
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:24,838
I'm going to see Cassandra.

519
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:25,980
Baby.

520
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,481
Are you ready for me, Hoops?

521
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:44,558
Wait. Pull over. I know her.

522
00:34:44,636 --> 00:34:45,762
You need a ride?

523
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:52,975
That was a friend of mine.

524
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:54,601
I don't pick up hitchhikers.

525
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:04,716
The humanity!

526
00:35:05,824 --> 00:35:07,587
Thank you very much for the ride.

527
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:10,287
I enjoyed it thoroughly. Clay!

528
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:14,056
Clay! Hi.

529
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:16,100
Hi. I didn't hear you come in.

530
00:35:16,835 --> 00:35:21,363
I'm relieving you because
Dad needs you pronto at the gas station.

531
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:24,740
Okay. But don't forget at 9:00...

532
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,674
you have to be at the Beckersteads'.

533
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:29,403
Watch Teddy.
If anything weird is going on...

534
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,642
call George at the drive-in right away.

535
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,240
We can't let Hoops down.

536
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:34,945
Okay. No problem.

537
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:40,213
Egg, don't forget. No matter what...

538
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:43,021
don't touch anything on this prop truck.

539
00:35:43,962 --> 00:35:45,862
Like I'm really gonna!

540
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,782
Are you nervous about something?

541
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:10,479
Me?

542
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:11,947
Yeah.

543
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:15,450
No, I'm having a great time. Enjoy.

544
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,054
Are you sure?

545
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,866
Can I ask you something?

546
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:24,763
Yeah.

547
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:27,433
Aren't you going out with Teddy?

548
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,435
Yeah.

549
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,335
Why aren't you with him tonight?

550
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:34,073
Because he's got
some silly reception to go to...

551
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:35,976
and he's got his vang shoo classes.

552
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:38,374
What's vang shoo?

553
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,011
The martial art...

554
00:36:41,186 --> 00:36:42,414
of disemboweling...

555
00:36:42,954 --> 00:36:44,251
another human being...

556
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,653
with a popsicle stick.

557
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:47,818
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

558
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:49,325
I'll go get some treats.

559
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:50,622
Stay right here.

560
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,928
I'll get us some treats.

561
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:59,732
Could you bring me some popcorn?

562
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:00,566
Popcorn.

563
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,566
Check it out. It's that McCann guy.

564
00:37:07,245 --> 00:37:08,610
And he's with Cookie.

565
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,743
I like that one. I like that. I want a....

566
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:19,656
Now, that is a....
I could wear that anywhere.

567
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,738
I'm going to look nice.

568
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:48,710
Michael?

569
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:53,419
Michael?

570
00:37:55,393 --> 00:37:56,621
Michael!

571
00:37:58,797 --> 00:38:00,025
Michael!

572
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,061
Michael?

573
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,031
Michael?

574
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,609
Hoops. Good party, eh?

575
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:15,172
George, where're your friends, the twins?

576
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:16,941
Are they watching that monster?

577
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:19,176
Don't worry about it. They're very reliable.

578
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:20,213
Trust me.

579
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,154
Thank you very much.

580
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:33,288
It feels good to be back here
at the Club Tokyo.

581
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:34,626
Hi! How're you doing?

582
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:37,065
Where're you from?
What do you do for a living?

583
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,131
9:00? Shit!

584
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,137
9:00!

585
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:43,999
Goddamn it!

586
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:53,580
Shit!

587
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,120
Relax.

588
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:05,921
Would you get over here,
you two stupid clowns?

589
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,432
I can't wait all night.

590
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:16,773
Look at this.

591
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:27,216
Damn. That looks like
one of those medical experiments...

592
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:28,343
that went astray.

593
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:30,717
Little girl, I'm gonna have nightmares...

594
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:32,620
just knowing that dog exists.

595
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,851
Looks like it's been microwaved
or something.

596
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:38,088
Why, Wilbur, I believe that's a case...

597
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,687
for a mercy killing.

598
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,491
What do you say, little girl?

599
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,467
Want us to put it out of its misery?

600
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,265
I can't wait any longer.

601
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,214
Hi. How you doing?

602
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:02,384
l want to thank everybody for coming.

603
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:43,689
Mary Ann?

604
00:40:56,741 --> 00:40:57,605
Thank you.

605
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:03,372
In honor of our very special guest...

606
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:04,915
Mr. Chong Freen...

607
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,210
of the Charter Bank of Nantucket...

608
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:09,152
who assures me...

609
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,155
that the Beckerstead Estates
are only weeks away...

610
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,157
from the start of construction...

611
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:16,760
I will allow Mr. Freen...

612
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:18,829
the honors.

613
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,254
Thank you.

614
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:42,846
Did you bring me my popcorn?

615
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:56,861
Thank you very much.

616
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:58,629
I think I will have a cookie.

617
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:08,908
Hello.

618
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:15,975
Michael?

619
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:19,745
Hi. Cookie?

620
00:42:19,824 --> 00:42:21,519
Teddy? Yeah, this is Ty.

621
00:42:22,093 --> 00:42:23,117
Ty. What's up?

622
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:25,595
She's doing what?

623
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,691
Stay right there.

624
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:30,393
No, Ty, stay right there, you idiot!

625
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:32,121
Really nice party.

626
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,159
That's a hearty appetite.

627
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:44,405
Let's get out of here.

628
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:47,642
Let's go to the point
and watch the moon rise.

629
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:49,973
I don't know, Cookie, I was...

630
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:51,743
kind of enjoying this fine film.

631
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:53,044
l never touched her!

632
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:57,147
-You touched my girlfriend, didn't you?
-No!

633
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:58,517
No!

634
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:01,057
l knew l'd find you at the drive-in.

635
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,491
No! No! Please!

636
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:07,624
I guess you don't get
to see the moon rise very often.

637
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,931
Egg.

638
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:14,162
Egg?

639
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:20,835
Egg, I'm about to teach you...

640
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:22,276
a very valuable lesson.

641
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:32,184
In an emergency situation...

642
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,020
the victims cannot
and must not be allowed...

643
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:36,526
to think for themselves.

644
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,992
The shock and the horror
of what just happened...

645
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:43,158
will surely impair their judgment.

646
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,364
You must do the thinking
in order to save them.

647
00:44:46,704 --> 00:44:48,069
In this case...

648
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:51,575
a plane has just crash-landed on this point.

649
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,345
Now, there are going to be
bodies everywhere...

650
00:44:55,847 --> 00:44:57,940
just gushing blood and...

651
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:02,145
their faces will be
pulled off of their heads and...

652
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:05,320
armpits will be hanging from trees.

653
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:08,119
Their eyeballs will be
sticking out of their heads.

654
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:11,957
You'll have to push them back in
with a stick or something.

655
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:13,723
Now, remember...

656
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:16,225
you are the only thing...

657
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,325
that will stand between life and death.

658
00:45:20,271 --> 00:45:21,431
Let's do it!

659
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,302
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

660
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,703
Dad, I really wish we could discuss this.

661
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,814
There's nothing to discuss, Ack Ack.

662
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:33,942
I want you out of the house by 0800 hours.

663
00:45:34,552 --> 00:45:36,611
My home is not a den for cowards...

664
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:38,746
who will not serve in the armed forces.

665
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:41,355
Yes, sir.

666
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:56,667
There's a beautiful clearing just up ahead.

667
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:59,265
Listen, Cookie,
I want to know if you can help me--

668
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:05,346
Save him!

669
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,775
Hoops, what are you doing?

670
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,151
Cookie, for God's sake, help me.

671
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:12,280
Save her!

672
00:46:17,728 --> 00:46:19,025
I don't know, Teddy.

673
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:21,492
We followed them up this far.

674
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,566
Goodness knows
what they came up here to do.

675
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,539
-Cookie, what are you doing here?
-They're chasing me!

676
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:37,239
Who?

677
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:38,907
McCann and his weird friends.

678
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:49,819
George! Stop!

679
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:50,861
Jesus!

680
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:53,419
Go, George, get out of here!

681
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:55,624
Save him!

682
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:05,099
It's just a costume! You little jerks!

683
00:47:05,943 --> 00:47:07,274
Get out of the way!

684
00:47:15,753 --> 00:47:17,050
Great, we missed her.

685
00:47:17,121 --> 00:47:18,782
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Ack.

686
00:47:24,295 --> 00:47:26,058
Get me out of this!

687
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:29,330
Get me out!

688
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:33,596
We got to call Hoops. Teddy left the party.

689
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,004
Good work, buddy.

690
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:41,575
I'm going to kill you, after I kill this guy.

691
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:43,680
$100 says you don't.

692
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:49,476
What?

693
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,688
"$100 says you don't."

694
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,414
What are you talking about?

695
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:57,893
I'm sure that you can beat him up.
He's smaller than you.

696
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,026
That never stood in my way before.

697
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:03,430
I'll bet you $100 that even though
he's smaller, he's a better athlete.

698
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:06,831
-Say at a sport like basketball?
-What are you doing?

699
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:09,439
This wimp? Give me a break.

700
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,805
-Are you in or out?
-Please don't do this. I'm begging you.

701
00:48:12,943 --> 00:48:15,070
-You must be high. Is she high?
-High.

702
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:16,811
In or out?

703
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,717
All right, let's go.

704
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:25,687
Darn, no net. Can't play.

705
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,851
Maybe we can play water polo.
I could get some horses.

706
00:48:39,904 --> 00:48:41,337
Make a hoop.

707
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:56,745
-All right.
-Lucky shot!

708
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,365
Okay. Here you go.

709
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:19,098
Okay, Hoops, come on.

710
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,778
Come on.

711
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:52,439
If you don't mind, I'd like to get back
to beating the shit out of these guys.

712
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,502
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-Why? You know Karate?

713
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,910
No. I know Dow.

714
00:49:58,048 --> 00:49:59,538
What is Dow?

715
00:50:00,017 --> 00:50:02,577
Dow is the chemical company
that makes Mace.

716
00:50:12,296 --> 00:50:15,265
Cassandra, wait up a minute. Come on!

717
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:18,927
I'm really sorry about that.

718
00:50:19,904 --> 00:50:21,599
Thanks for saving us.

719
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:24,668
It's no big deal, McCann.
I guess we're even.

720
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:36,518
-Now?
-No, not yet. Be patient.

721
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:38,243
Now?

722
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,579
Okay.

723
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:45,023
Hello, ladies. l am here for your daughters.

724
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:53,026
So, you finally told the Führer no?

725
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,336
How'd it go?

726
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:57,331
He threw me out.

727
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:01,941
Don't worry about it, man.
You can stay at my grandmother's house.

728
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,446
She's got room and reasonable rates...

729
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:08,212
-if you're not in the family.
-Thanks, George.

730
00:51:08,886 --> 00:51:12,447
You can throw your stuff
in Uncle Frank's room. He'll never know.

731
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,852
Did you ever notice
people die in alphabetical order?

732
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:22,963
Cheer up, McCann.

733
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:25,627
She's not the only girl on the island.

734
00:51:26,237 --> 00:51:28,102
There's plenty of them to be found.

735
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,669
-Like that one.
-Go for it, dude.

736
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,408
Excuse me, fellas.

737
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:50,484
How you doing? Here you go.

738
00:51:50,794 --> 00:51:52,421
-Hi.
-Hi, Hoops.

739
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:54,191
-How're you doing?
-Fine.

740
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:57,300
-Look, Cassandra...
-Hi. Here you go.

741
00:51:57,368 --> 00:52:01,065
...I want to apologize. I shouldn't have said
I was a basketball player.

742
00:52:01,138 --> 00:52:02,833
I shouldn't have lied. I'm sorry.

743
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:07,844
I really am a decent artist. If I could
help you, I'd like to make it up to you.

744
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:09,545
You really want to help?

745
00:52:09,613 --> 00:52:11,672
-Yeah.
-Buy a ticket.

746
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:13,647
Hi. How you doing?

747
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:33,163
We are from the planet of the toes.
We bring you....

748
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:35,835
And we bring you produce.

749
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,403
-Hi, fellas.
-Hi, Hoops.

750
00:52:38,475 --> 00:52:39,874
-Hi, Hoops.
-Hi, Hoops.

751
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:43,647
A giant dolphin with rabies.

752
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:46,409
Turn it around. Open it up.

753
00:52:46,684 --> 00:52:49,016
About as believable as Superman.

754
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:01,531
They sure can do incredible things
in movies nowadays.

755
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:03,158
Yeah.

756
00:53:07,504 --> 00:53:11,372
Good idea. I've got it. Up.
Stork twins, bring that camera.

757
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:17,471
No! No, please!

758
00:53:19,516 --> 00:53:21,643
Guys, what about George?

759
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:25,420
George!

760
00:53:26,624 --> 00:53:28,819
I refuse to do this!

761
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:31,326
-Give him CPR.
-I am your superior!

762
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:15,628
These are satanic hemorrhoids from hell.
We must stop them before they kill again!

763
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:19,131
Doctor, no!

764
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,404
l must save the free world.

765
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:55,545
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you at the show.

766
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:41,251
Weather for the Cape and the islands...

767
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:44,385
looks like we can expect some rain,
but nothing to worry about.

768
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:48,591
Nantucket's big news tonight
is Cassandra live at the Dew Drop lnn.

769
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:50,098
Come on, come on.

770
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,634
Good luck to her...

771
00:55:51,702 --> 00:55:54,796
and good luck to you
in our $1 million summer.

772
00:55:54,872 --> 00:55:56,635
lt could happen at any minute.

773
00:55:56,707 --> 00:56:00,268
-You could win $1 million.
-Come on, come on.

774
00:56:00,677 --> 00:56:02,702
Stand still, Teddy.

775
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,408
Dad, I got to do my laps.

776
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:08,076
I have not yet mastered this contraption.

777
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:10,985
When I have,
then you may continue your laps.

778
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:13,816
Damn it.

779
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:17,193
Do you know who this is?

780
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,364
-No.
-That is trouble.

781
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:33,966
That is the girl that just might ruin
my restaurant on the bluff.

782
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:38,346
She's singing or something
tomorrow night.

783
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:42,878
If people do actually show up to hear her...

784
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:44,782
she might make some money.

785
00:56:45,222 --> 00:56:48,055
She might make enough
to pay back the bank.

786
00:56:48,258 --> 00:56:50,522
What are we going to do about it?

787
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,088
Stop her from singing?

788
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,155
Good, Teddy. Good.

789
00:56:59,937 --> 00:57:01,131
Get it.

790
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:04,736
We're here to pick up your father's Jag.

791
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:08,171
He called us. We will need the keys.

792
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:18,247
-Get rid of this.
-Okay.

793
00:57:22,092 --> 00:57:23,286
Come on.

794
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:34,501
ln sports, we've got the Nantucket Regatta
coming up...

795
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:38,029
and Cape Cod's own Mr. Congeniality....

796
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:39,132
Hi, guys.

797
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,767
-Hi, Ack Ack.
-Hi, Ack.

798
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:42,402
How you doing?

799
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:46,106
That's the last of it.

800
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,611
I'm history.

801
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,418
I wish I could make my father understand.

802
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:55,956
Hey, Ack...

803
00:57:58,128 --> 00:57:59,618
I understand.

804
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:00,964
You do?

805
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:07,599
Let me tell you a story...

806
00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:12,407
about a little fat boy that nobody loved...

807
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:15,976
and all the other kids,
they used to make fun of him...

808
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:19,582
and they would pick on him...

809
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:23,677
and they used to say
that he talked funny and stuff...

810
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:26,384
and he had a twin brother...

811
00:58:26,456 --> 00:58:27,946
and everybody said...

812
00:58:28,025 --> 00:58:31,483
that he didn't look
anything like his twin brother...

813
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:33,923
but he wanted to.

814
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:35,294
Egg....

815
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,960
Were you the little fat boy?

816
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:43,330
No. But I used to like to beat him up.

817
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:45,773
I'd go, "Why are you so fat?"

818
00:58:45,842 --> 00:58:48,310
And I'd beat the shit out of him.

819
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:51,706
Isn't that a great story?

820
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:55,977
Yeah, thanks.

821
00:58:58,522 --> 00:59:00,854
Are you a little nervous? No?

822
00:59:01,525 --> 00:59:03,186
Nobody's going to show up.

823
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:07,494
Everybody's going to show up. It's been
the greatest media blitz in Nantucket.

824
00:59:07,564 --> 00:59:10,556
-I don't want to hear another word.
-What about Beckerstead?

825
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:14,092
-Will he pull something?
-It's covered, I promise you.

826
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:17,698
You just relax and have a good time,
because you're going to be great.

827
00:59:17,874 --> 00:59:19,432
Okay? Trust me.

828
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:22,003
Hoops...

829
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:25,847
I just want to tell you....

830
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,684
I guess I know what you mean.

831
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,886
Hoops?

832
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:39,986
Yeah. Got to run. See you at the club.

833
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,133
This one's for Cassandra.

834
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,900
Come on!

835
01:00:46,163 --> 01:00:49,257
Teddy? Don't forget about tonight.

836
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:50,999
Dad, I'll go.

837
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:53,361
I'll go after I do my laps!

838
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:56,134
Thank you, Teddy.

839
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:19,418
Have a nice swim.

840
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,229
Come on in.

841
01:01:27,537 --> 01:01:29,937
Come on in, Cookie wookie wookie.

842
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:40,881
-Cookie, help me!
-What's wrong?

843
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:41,883
Come here!

844
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:11,357
Two. Enjoy it.

845
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:02,612
What?

846
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,480
I'm sorry, Miss...

847
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:08,249
but all the money in the world
won't get you that house.

848
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:11,352
But it's my house,
and that's the money I owe you.

849
01:05:11,428 --> 01:05:12,861
I understand.

850
01:05:12,929 --> 01:05:16,126
Mr. Beckerstead bought the mortgage
from the bank.

851
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,298
He can foreclose when he wants.

852
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:21,504
You gave me until today.

853
01:05:21,705 --> 01:05:23,036
I'm sorry.

854
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:26,367
The bank was lenient
for as long as it could be.

855
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:31,310
What about those people? It's their home.
How could you sell it to him?

856
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:34,616
Mr. Beckerstead is a lot wealthier
than you.

857
01:05:45,729 --> 01:05:47,959
What's going on? What happened?

858
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:54,401
What does it matter? The house is theirs.

859
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:55,961
That's right.

860
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,337
And get this ugly mutt...

861
01:05:58,408 --> 01:06:00,035
off my property.

862
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:05,274
Boscoe!

863
01:06:07,851 --> 01:06:09,876
Dr. Balson to ER.

864
01:06:16,192 --> 01:06:19,389
Squid, it's okay.
Boscoe's going to be just fine.

865
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:22,463
I don't know. They've been in there awhile.

866
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,523
I think I smell gas, too.

867
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:29,003
Cassandra, will you really leave?

868
01:06:29,172 --> 01:06:32,505
Why should I stay?
There's nothing left here for me.

869
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,041
How can you say that?

870
01:06:37,714 --> 01:06:40,547
What about the house
and all those people?

871
01:06:40,617 --> 01:06:43,177
Will we just give in to the Beckersteads?

872
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:46,188
We can't let them walk away
with everything.

873
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:50,852
If we give in, we're giving in
to all the cute, fuzzy bunnies in the world.

874
01:06:52,762 --> 01:06:55,458
Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.

875
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:59,731
What I mean is, we can't give up.
We got to think of a plan.

876
01:07:00,003 --> 01:07:01,231
A plan.

877
01:07:03,339 --> 01:07:05,807
"Without a plan, there's no attack.

878
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,139
"Without attack, no victory."

879
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:10,303
Where have I heard that before?

880
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,577
A plan. Oh, boy, I've got a plan.

881
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,585
-Acky's got a plan! What is it?
-The regatta.

882
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:18,086
The regatta?

883
01:07:18,755 --> 01:07:21,280
The regatta. The sailing boat race.

884
01:07:21,524 --> 01:07:25,460
The one-boat rowing, sailing,
motoring regatta around Nantucket.

885
01:07:25,528 --> 01:07:27,496
Your plan involves a boat?

886
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:29,122
But Teddy will win it.

887
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,326
He wins every year.
Everybody knows that.

888
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:33,631
But what happens if he doesn't?

889
01:07:33,703 --> 01:07:37,503
His grandfather takes away everything
he and his father own...

890
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:40,042
making his life as dreary as ours.

891
01:07:40,376 --> 01:07:41,741
Poor guys.

892
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:43,103
And?

893
01:07:43,179 --> 01:07:44,942
So we win the race.

894
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:49,910
He can't live without the trophy.
We can't live without the house.

895
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:52,013
We make a trade.

896
01:07:52,956 --> 01:07:55,982
Great, Ack Ack.
There's just one thing missing.

897
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,422
The boat.

898
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,677
The boat.

899
01:08:21,284 --> 01:08:23,411
She's really in good shape.

900
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:28,350
Mind you, she could use a little help.

901
01:10:02,418 --> 01:10:03,612
George?

902
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:09,652
Welcome, all,
to the christening of the boat.

903
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:11,921
For this gala occasion, I got something...

904
01:10:11,995 --> 01:10:14,725
my parents brought me back from France.

905
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:19,967
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
I think this is it.

906
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:25,001
That's really nice.

907
01:10:25,074 --> 01:10:27,599
Cassandra, would you do the honors?

908
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:38,118
To the boat.

909
01:10:38,187 --> 01:10:39,620
To the boat!

910
01:10:43,793 --> 01:10:46,728
-We'll patch that up.
-We'll fix that later.

911
01:10:46,829 --> 01:10:50,356
Listen, Hoops, here's a little something...

912
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:53,131
from all of us to all of you.

913
01:10:53,269 --> 01:10:56,102
What, for me? What is it?

914
01:10:58,808 --> 01:11:01,470
Thank you. What is this for?

915
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:05,576
The captain has to have his captain hat.

916
01:11:08,818 --> 01:11:12,584
I can't accept this.
Acky, you be captain. It was your idea.

917
01:11:12,655 --> 01:11:15,783
It's decided, Hoops.
You're the man for the job.

918
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:19,060
I can't be captain.
I won't even be on the boat.

919
01:11:19,128 --> 01:11:21,028
I'll be on land. Sorry, fellows.

920
01:11:22,765 --> 01:11:23,959
Hoops?

921
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:28,469
Let's have a look at that engine.

922
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:31,072
-Yeah.
-Sure, that'll be great.

923
01:11:55,498 --> 01:11:56,988
What's wrong?

924
01:11:57,233 --> 01:11:58,495
Nothing.

925
01:11:59,502 --> 01:12:02,164
I just don't like boats. I hate boats.

926
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:05,067
Since I was a kid, I don't like boats.

927
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:09,604
Maybe you just haven't had
the right kind of experience on a boat.

928
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:13,511
Maybe you're right.

929
01:12:25,828 --> 01:12:27,455
That's it, boys.

930
01:12:29,031 --> 01:12:32,262
We got to have an engine
for part of this race.

931
01:12:32,935 --> 01:12:34,368
I'll get it.

932
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:38,404
Most of those guys
will have Evinrudes and Mercuries...

933
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:39,907
heavy stuff.

934
01:12:40,576 --> 01:12:43,977
I don't think this puppy
is going to cut the mustard.

935
01:12:44,347 --> 01:12:46,781
Well, that's the best my dad had.

936
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:55,520
Clay!

937
01:12:55,892 --> 01:12:57,382
What happened?

938
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:01,191
Teddy brought his car in for a tune-up.

939
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:03,589
Did he hit you?

940
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:45,038
One, two, three, four.

941
01:14:04,827 --> 01:14:06,727
What the hell is that?

942
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:32,318
Hi, Ted.

943
01:14:33,222 --> 01:14:34,917
How you doing?

944
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:36,219
McCann.

945
01:14:38,995 --> 01:14:42,123
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

946
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:46,700
Welcome to the Nantucket Regatta.

947
01:14:47,904 --> 01:14:50,270
The first part of the regatta...

948
01:14:51,107 --> 01:14:54,235
will test your strength and stamina.

949
01:14:54,644 --> 01:14:57,010
From this line, you will row....

950
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,404
You!

951
01:14:58,481 --> 01:15:00,449
You will not....

952
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,242
Get down! Come here.

953
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:03,784
Go! Go! Go!

954
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:08,352
Come on, save it for the race.

955
01:15:09,525 --> 01:15:12,619
There, you will drop your sails...

956
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:15,054
and start your engines...

957
01:15:15,331 --> 01:15:17,322
for the final stretch...

958
01:15:17,767 --> 01:15:20,235
back into Nantucket Harbor.

959
01:15:21,137 --> 01:15:22,331
Now....

960
01:15:22,805 --> 01:15:24,966
lf everyone is ready....

961
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,422
Go! Go!

962
01:15:45,728 --> 01:15:47,355
-Hey, Egg.
-What?

963
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:51,066
Tito Ramirez is wrestling
Mr. Congeniality...

964
01:15:51,367 --> 01:15:53,301
in a half-hour.

965
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:57,701
Teddy says Mr. Congeniality
doesn't have a chance.

966
01:16:06,816 --> 01:16:08,249
Go! Come on!

967
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:11,277
Go!

968
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:58,326
Come on, guys. They're gaining on us!

969
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:09,143
We'll take care of this right now.

970
01:17:09,712 --> 01:17:11,145
Dad? Shit.

971
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,273
You just steer the boat,
you stupid, imbecilic retard.

972
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:19,014
You're not my son. I knew I couldn't
trust you to do this without me.

973
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:22,985
-What are you doing?
-First, we just take out that halyard.

974
01:17:23,059 --> 01:17:24,686
This race is yours.

975
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,627
-Come on, Dad, I can win--
-Shut your mouth, Teddy!

976
01:17:27,696 --> 01:17:29,323
That's an order.

977
01:17:37,606 --> 01:17:39,403
Shit! What happened?

978
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:42,170
Now, you may proceed.

979
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:47,180
-The halyard snapped.
-It couldn't have just snapped.

980
01:17:49,485 --> 01:17:50,611
Look.

981
01:17:52,488 --> 01:17:53,978
You bastards!

982
01:17:57,059 --> 01:17:59,084
Fix that Australian boat.

983
01:17:59,295 --> 01:18:01,820
Well, there goes Cassandra's house.

984
01:18:01,931 --> 01:18:03,364
That's that.

985
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:07,234
We can't quit!
We got to do something. Think!

986
01:18:07,303 --> 01:18:10,431
We got to get the halyard
back through its holder.

987
01:18:10,506 --> 01:18:11,666
We can't do that out here.

988
01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:15,672
We're not dead yet.

989
01:18:18,948 --> 01:18:21,007
Man, we're getting smoked.

990
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,375
What are you doing, Hoops?

991
01:18:23,452 --> 01:18:25,113
Desperation move.

992
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:50,076
Two points!

993
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:17,532
Ty, take out the main sheet!

994
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:21,170
Come on!

995
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,550
-Man overboard!
-Jesus!

996
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:35,123
Drop the sails, fellows.

997
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:38,792
Acky. God.

998
01:19:40,863 --> 01:19:43,491
Hold on, buddy. We'll be there in a minute.

999
01:19:43,566 --> 01:19:44,931
All right!

1000
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,166
Acky!

1001
01:19:52,508 --> 01:19:53,702
Go on!

1002
01:19:54,476 --> 01:19:55,670
I got him!

1003
01:19:55,744 --> 01:19:57,075
Are you sure?

1004
01:19:57,146 --> 01:19:58,943
I got him. Beat it!

1005
01:20:00,749 --> 01:20:02,182
Let's do it!

1006
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:04,910
Go get those scum, mates!

1007
01:20:07,022 --> 01:20:09,081
Come to me. Help me, boys!

1008
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:20,859
Check this out.

1009
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,631
I don't believe it.

1010
01:20:22,705 --> 01:20:25,037
Aloha! We're back! How are you?

1011
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,108
Teddy, go faster.

1012
01:20:28,344 --> 01:20:31,643
The wind's dying down.
We're almost to the engine buoy.

1013
01:20:31,714 --> 01:20:33,841
I'm not taking any chances.

1014
01:20:34,717 --> 01:20:37,686
Dad, damn it. Why don't you listen to me?
I can win!

1015
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:40,252
The only way to win, Theodore...

1016
01:20:40,489 --> 01:20:42,514
is to cheat. Remember.

1017
01:20:43,459 --> 01:20:47,225
A little hole in their hull
will slow them down just enough.

1018
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:50,391
He's lost his mind! Get down!

1019
01:20:55,838 --> 01:20:57,305
What the hell is that?

1020
01:20:57,373 --> 01:20:59,273
Teddy, come back here!

1021
01:20:59,742 --> 01:21:02,006
Come back here right now, boy!

1022
01:21:02,144 --> 01:21:03,338
Teddy!

1023
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:05,972
My god. A giant dolphin with rabies.

1024
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,739
Come back here!

1025
01:21:09,585 --> 01:21:10,882
Theodore!

1026
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:15,313
Come back here. Help me!

1027
01:21:25,267 --> 01:21:29,033
The wind's coming up.
Let's set sail! Let's get out of here!

1028
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:31,401
Boy, if I ever get out of this...

1029
01:21:31,473 --> 01:21:34,101
I'm going to make you into a stew!

1030
01:21:34,476 --> 01:21:35,738
Help me!

1031
01:21:39,815 --> 01:21:41,476
Somebody help me!

1032
01:21:54,697 --> 01:21:57,222
All right! There's the engine buoy!

1033
01:21:59,668 --> 01:22:01,329
There's the buoy!

1034
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:07,805
Come on, let's get out of here.

1035
01:22:08,077 --> 01:22:10,568
Hustle! Come on, move it, move it!

1036
01:22:11,714 --> 01:22:13,739
Come on, ladies! Let's go!

1037
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,817
Start up the engine.

1038
01:22:20,322 --> 01:22:23,917
Good luck trying to beat a Merc
with a lawnmower engine!

1039
01:22:37,706 --> 01:22:40,334
Gentlemen, prepare to blow the hatch!

1040
01:22:48,917 --> 01:22:51,351
Gentlemen, I am blowing the hatch!

1041
01:23:17,379 --> 01:23:19,074
Teddy, step on it.

1042
01:23:19,214 --> 01:23:22,672
I've got her full throttle.
She doesn't have any more.

1043
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:29,216
What the hell they got in that thing?

1044
01:23:33,162 --> 01:23:34,390
My car.

1045
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,259
Thank you very much.

1046
01:23:40,335 --> 01:23:42,269
Bye-bye. See you later!

1047
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:10,762
I'd like to thank everyone
that made this possible.

1048
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:20,674
Hey, Cookie.

1049
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:23,907
Why don't we quit
playing all these games?

1050
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:34,417
Look what I caught!

1051
01:24:35,123 --> 01:24:36,818
How you doing? Are you hurt?

1052
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,723
Squid! Look at that.

1053
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,458
Boscoe!

1054
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,640
-Thanks again, mate.
-You're welcome.

1055
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:11,717
I heard what you did, Ack Ack.
It's all over the island.

1056
01:25:12,261 --> 01:25:13,751
You're a hero.

1057
01:25:14,129 --> 01:25:15,994
I'm proud of you, Son.

1058
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:17,596
Damn proud.

1059
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,871
I want you to come home.

1060
01:25:24,973 --> 01:25:28,033
Does this mean
I have to give back the bazooka?

1061
01:25:30,112 --> 01:25:32,910
Let's talk about it over a hot chocolate.

1062
01:25:40,756 --> 01:25:41,950
Hey, Teddy.

1063
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:45,791
What if we make a deal?

1064
01:25:45,861 --> 01:25:47,988
You need the trophy, we need the house.

1065
01:25:48,063 --> 01:25:50,588
And everybody's happy. Come on, Ted.

1066
01:25:52,568 --> 01:25:53,660
Okay.

1067
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,868
You're only half right, McCann.

1068
01:25:58,073 --> 01:26:01,065
That house won't do you
or your father any good.

1069
01:26:01,143 --> 01:26:04,340
I'm not putting a dime
in the Beckerstead Estates.

1070
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,640
This is the real investment, Teddy:
Friendship!

1071
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:10,250
Here's your house back.

1072
01:26:10,352 --> 01:26:12,047
Thank you so much.

1073
01:26:12,187 --> 01:26:14,621
The little lady has quite a voice.

1074
01:26:15,357 --> 01:26:16,881
Come on, Teddy.

1075
01:26:38,947 --> 01:26:40,380
Once upon a time...

1076
01:26:40,449 --> 01:26:43,543
there was a happy guy
that love finally found...

1077
01:26:43,952 --> 01:26:46,648
and this time, love didn't pass him by.

1078
01:26:46,755 --> 01:26:49,053
Old boy finally caught a break.

1079
01:26:49,358 --> 01:26:52,054
This love story lasted all summer long.

1080
01:26:52,394 --> 01:26:55,625
There was nothing
even the cute and fuzzy bunnies...

1081
01:26:55,697 --> 01:26:57,892
could do about it, thank you.

1082
01:27:24,693 --> 01:27:26,558
95.5 F.M...

1083
01:27:26,628 --> 01:27:28,391
music-money time.

1084
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:32,091
This is it. We're looking
for caller number 50!

1085
01:27:32,234 --> 01:27:33,565
Good luck.

1086
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:36,431
You're on the air!

1087
01:27:36,505 --> 01:27:37,995
-Hello?
-Hello!

1088
01:27:38,073 --> 01:27:40,166
This the contest at the radio station?

1089
01:27:40,242 --> 01:27:43,609
l hope you're sitting,
'cause you've won $1 million!

1090
01:27:43,845 --> 01:27:46,439
-Jesus Christ, I won!
-lt's all yours!

1091
01:27:46,581 --> 01:27:48,981
This changes everything for me.

1092
01:27:49,051 --> 01:27:52,077
I deserve this. I've been sitting, waiting,
day after day...

1093
01:27:52,154 --> 01:27:54,384
in this room waiting for your lousy song...

1094
01:27:54,456 --> 01:27:57,448
and I've gotten through!
I feel so lucky, so blessed...

1095
01:27:57,526 --> 01:27:58,925
so powerful!

1096
01:28:00,429 --> 01:28:02,397
-Congratulations!
-Hello?

1097
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:03,724
Hello?

1098
01:28:03,865 --> 01:28:07,028
We seem to be cut off.
Let's take another caller.

1099
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:08,796
You're on the air.

1100
01:28:09,137 --> 01:28:11,128
-Did l win?
-You sure did.

1101
01:28:11,606 --> 01:28:14,973
You better believe it, lady.
$1 million is all yours!

1102
01:28:15,077 --> 01:28:16,806
l can't believe it!

1103
01:28:16,912 --> 01:28:19,813
It's certainly been a great summer for you.

1104
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:22,941
Just a second.
There's a rocket coming in here.

1105
01:28:23,285 --> 01:28:24,547
A rocket?

1106
01:28:24,986 --> 01:28:27,011
Wait, what about my money?

1107
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:29,957
Hello? Hello?

1108
01:28:30,692 --> 01:28:32,284
ls anyone there?

1109
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,300
Clay, look! A bonfire!

1110
01:28:42,671 --> 01:28:44,502
Get the marshmallows!

1111
01:28:46,308 --> 01:28:48,242
Thank you very much.

1112
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:17,435
