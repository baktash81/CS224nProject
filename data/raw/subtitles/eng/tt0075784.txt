1
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,229
Is hard to remember now,
but Europe was like this in 1944.

2
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,436
The Second World War was in its
fifth year and still going Hitler's way.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,629
German troops
controlled most of Europe.

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,797
D-day changed all that.

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,310
D-day: June 6, 1944,
when the Allied forces,

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,113
under their commander
General Eisenhower,

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,357
landed on the northern coast of France.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,669
By July they were able to begin their own
offensive. By August Paris was liberated.

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,477
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,398
But with the Allied victories
came problems.

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,752
Supplies still had to be driven from
Normandy, over 400 miles away,

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,110
and became dangerously short.

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,789
The Allied advance
began to come to a halt.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,390
Another problem
facing Eisenhower was this:

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,149
his two most famous generals,
Patton who was in the south

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,239
and Montgomery in the north,
disliked each other intensely.

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,797
Their long-standing rivalry
had never been more fierce.

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,151
There simply were
not enough supplies for both armies.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,272
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,233
Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,876
In September, 1944, Montgomery
devised a new and spectacular plan

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,912
given the codename Market Garden.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,316
Eisenhower, under great pressure
from his superiors,

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,556
finally sided with Montgomery,

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,275
and Operation Market Garden
became a reality.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,115
The plan, like so many plans
in so many wars before it,

27
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,630
was meant to end
the fighting by Christmas

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,957
and bring the boys back home.

29
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,070
ARNHEM. HOLLAND. SEPTEMBER 1944

30
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,072
What is that noise?

31
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,597
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

32
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,829
The Germans have collapsed.

33
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,116
Then the war is over?

34
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,355
Soon.

35
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,872
But what is that noise?

36
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,514
Panic.

37
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,150
GERMAN WESTERN FRONT. ARMY H.Q.

38
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,473
You may begin.

39
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,593
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

40
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,518
how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

41
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,240
that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the west.

42
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,356
Speeches are for victory celebrations.

43
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,159
Les get to the point. Air power?

44
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,796
Air power, Field Marshal?

45
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,029
Briefly, please.

46
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,914
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

47
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,559
Also minimal.

48
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,711
Tanks... Troops... Replacements?

49
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,319
- Minimal.
- Morale?

50
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,118
Nonexistent.

51
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,157
What do you think we should do?

52
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,672
End the war, you fools.

53
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,789
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

54
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,070
We have such confidence in you.

55
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,470
Everyone knows you have
never lost a battle.

56
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,590
I'm still young. Give me time.

57
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,313
The first thing we must do

58
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,479
is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

59
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,556
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

60
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,236
They seem to have paused in Belgium.

61
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,113
Most likely supply problems.

62
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,032
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

63
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,033
I think is because we're retreating

64
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,390
faster than they can advance.

65
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,955
How many vehicles in the past hour?

66
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,275
Fifty-four.

67
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,079
And for the same hour yesterday?

68
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,236
Ninety-eight.

69
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,359
Last week your mother and I
could have captured Holland alone.

70
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,551
Already the panic has stopped.

71
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,269
It isn't over yet
and those idiots don't realise it.

72
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,750
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

73
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,672
I was nine when they got here.

74
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,593
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.

75
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,230
Father, the Allies will come?

76
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,872
But when?

77
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,993
GENERAL BROWNING'S H. Q... ENGLAND

78
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,634
I've just got back to England
from Brussels,

79
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,673
where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

80
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,874
There was an earlier one with General
Eisenhower. They both feel, as I do,

81
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,833
that when the field marshal's plan
has succeeded,

82
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,112
we should be able to end the war
by christmas in less than 100 days.

83
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,750
Actually, the plan's really very simple.

84
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,955
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles
and drop them behind enemy lines.

85
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,751
Ill be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

86
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,594
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

87
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,518
- Where's this all gonna take place?
- Holland.

88
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,354
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.

89
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,588
Right.

90
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,158
Ground forces: 30 corps
commanded by General Horrocks.

91
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,717
20,000 vehicles. And this, as you know,
is the German front line.

92
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,354
We're going to lay a carpet,
as it were,

93
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,155
of airborne troops,
over which 30th corps can pass.

94
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,352
We shall seize the bridges -
is all a question of bridges -

95
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,998
with thunderclap surprise,
and hold them until they can be secured.

96
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,990
Now, first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor: Eindhoven.

97
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,669
You take and hold
the bridges there with 101 st.

98
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,631
General Gavin, with your 82nd,

99
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,514
you get Nijmegen.
You take and hold the bridges.

100
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,588
And, Roy, you get the prize: Arnhem.

101
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,670
Arnhem Bridge.

102
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,598
- And you hold it.
- For how long?

103
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,958
Well, Monty assures me that
30 corps will do the 63 miles in

104
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,752
two days.

105
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,270
- 63 miles in two days.
- They'll handle that.

106
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,278
I'm sorry. General Sosabowski.

107
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,712
You go with your Polish brigade
with Roy Urquhart. I'm so sorry.

108
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,276
Roy,

109
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,632
when you've secured your bridge
and 30th corps have got across it,

110
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,788
we can turn east right into
the industrial heart of Germany-the Ruhr.

111
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,517
Once we control their factories, there's
not much they can do. That is the plan.

112
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,836
- And we go next Sunday.
- Seven days?

113
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,950
Why not? The sooner we go, the better.
We've got them on the run.

114
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,035
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

115
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,555
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely. Your silences are thunderous.

116
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,439
General Browning, I am a Pole,

117
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,232
considered by some to be smart.

118
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,911
If that is so, it makes me
a member of a true minority group.

119
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,071
Minority groups
are more comfortable in silence.

120
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,113
Really? I should have thought the
opposite was true. But you do disapprove.

121
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,916
I am thrilled that your great field marshal
has devised such a plan.

122
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,952
I promise you
I will be properly ecstatic if it works.

123
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,436
- When it works.
- Of course. When it works.

124
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,955
Thank you.

125
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,113
Well, now les get down to the details.
First thing, we shall have to have a...

126
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,152
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

127
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,072
Montgomery or Patton?

128
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,710
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

129
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,796
He is their best.

130
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,235
Patton will lead the assault.

131
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,312
I would prefer Montgomery

132
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,715
but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid.

133
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,709
Bittrich's panzer troops need some rest

134
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,350
if they're to stop Patton.

135
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,553
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

136
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,474
Safe, quiet, out of the way. But where?

137
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,079
Arnhem?

138
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,675
Arnhem.

139
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,035
U.S. 82nd AIRBORNE DIVISION H. Q... ENGLAND

140
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,475
- Why the emergency meeting?
- Keeping me abreast of the little changes.

141
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,151
- How big are the little changes?
- With British understatement: gigantic.

142
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,671
They can't get us all in. Too many men,
too much equipment, not enough planes.

143
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,271
Is going to take three days to get the
men into Arnhem - Poles and the British.

144
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,029
- How about us?
- Except for parachuting in daylight,

145
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,869
- We have nothing to worry about.
- Daylight?

146
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,470
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.

147
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,990
- You think there's a reason for that?
- Les hope not.

148
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,998
- What do you think?
- Is a no-moon period anyway.

149
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,795
We have to go in daylight.
Just so they get us over the target area.

150
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,074
- Half a mile away. I'll settle for that.
- I don't wanna hear anything else.

151
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,670
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.

152
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,756
I forgot to tell you something?

153
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,078
Only that the Germans first tried to take
Nijmegen Bridge themselves in 1940,

154
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,873
and got slaughtered.

155
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,353
Go back!

156
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,433
Go back!

157
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,633
Do as I say!

158
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,911
But my friend lives down the road.

159
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,158
Is my birthday
and she has a present for me.

160
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,630
Please let me through.

161
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,471
All right. Be quick.

162
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,113
Are you sure about the colours?

163
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm sure, Father. Believe me.

164
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,794
Model?

165
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,873
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

166
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,150
The British will have an explanation.

167
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,077
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

168
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,953
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

169
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,472
You're a good boy and a wonderful spy.

170
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,875
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

171
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,232
Sir!

172
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,591
- Yes, Fuller.
- We've got some information on tanks.

173
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,870
Dutch underground reports from Arnhem.

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,560
- Established their strength?
- No, but...

175
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,114
- Have they been identified?
- Not by us, sir.

176
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,994
- So is the same rumours as before.
- I believe these rumours, sir.

177
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,396
Why? The general consensus
is that our opposition

178
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,159
will consist entirely
of Hitler youths or old men.

179
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,558
I don't really know why, sir. Perhaps
because no one in intelligence does.

180
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,391
I just want to be sure our airborne carpet
consists of live troops, not dead ones.

181
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,830
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir.

182
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,191
But I would like to order
another low-level reconnaissance.

183
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,392
If thas all right with you, sir.

184
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,955
Very well.

185
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,593
All right, Wilson.

186
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,073
Very well.

187
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,668
- Fuller, Fuller.
- Yeah. Sir.

188
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,749
I wouldn't be too concerned
about what people think of you.

189
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,318
You happen to be somewhat brighter than
most of us. It tends to make us nervous.

190
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,272
We'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements.

191
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,310
But, please, keep in mind the one factor
which is crippling all our plans.

192
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,355
It may seem improbable to you, but we
are desperately short of transport aircraft.

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,677
- I am aware of that.
- I'm surprised that nobody told Monty

194
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,995
when he dreamed up this operation.

195
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,035
I need drop zones as close as possible
to the bridge. This area is no use at all.

196
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,993
can't have my chaps
landing on top of chimneys.

197
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,317
Now, this looks inviting here.
Whas the terrain like?

198
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,150
Sorry, sir. Our reports indicate that
this terrain is too soft for glider landings.

199
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,990
The nose digs in on touchdown, the thing
goes arse over tip... Total write-off.

200
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,395
All right. What about there?

201
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,593
No, afraid not, sir. After the drop
when we bank for our return,

202
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,396
we run into a whole lot of flak and
rubbish from this Jerry airfield at Deelen.

203
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,115
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere.

204
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,756
Ooh, yes. Hopefully, sir.

205
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,637
But, as I was saying, we cannot afford to
lose a single aircraft. That is the problem.

206
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,710
My problem is
I don't just need drop zones.

207
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,877
I need drop zones I can hold and defend.

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,833
The rest of my division
arrives with a second drop

209
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,155
and General Sosabowski's with a third.

210
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,716
I understand, sir. But we really think
we've found the right place.

211
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,675
Is large enough for your needs,
is flat and firm, and also easily defended.

212
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,199
- Where the hell is it?
- Is not actually on this photograph.

213
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,390
It should be... excuse me, sir.

214
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,353
It would be about here, I think.

215
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,159
- That could be ten miles from the bridge.
- Just under eight, actually.

216
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,794
If you'd like to have a look at this.

217
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,390
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.

218
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,956
All our information substantiates that.

219
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,235
Yes, sir?

220
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,079
Just making sure whose side you're on.

221
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,597
Now, a drop zone
eight miles from Arnhem Bridge

222
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,793
- Might be thought to present problems.
- My God. He can't mean it.

223
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,310
I'm afraid he does.
He must know what he's doing.

224
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,716
Thas more than I know. Why should
he have the corner on the market?

225
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,311
...cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal.

226
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,989
The gliders will bring in
a reconnaissance squadron of Jeeps

227
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,759
fitted with twin Vickers machine guns.

228
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,590
Now, the instant we land, they will
race ahead to the bridge and hold it

229
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,669
- Until the other battalions arrive on foot.
- They'll be able to secure both ends?

230
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,152
- Most certainly.
- Good. You all know where I shall be.

231
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,840
My headquarters will be
in the centre with 82nd.

232
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,795
Remember we're all totally interlocked.
This is a bottom-to-top operation.

233
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,593
101 st pass 30 corps on to 82nd.

234
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,917
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.

235
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,079
If any one group fails,
is total failure for us all.

236
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,715
All we need now
are three days of clear skies.

237
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,434
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

238
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,550
Only the weather can stop us now.

239
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,916
Weather! Chrystus!

240
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,752
General Browning, what of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know

241
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,112
that Arnhem is so crucial to their safety,
they might know that too?

242
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,911
The few troops in the area
are second class.

243
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,397
They're not front-line calibre.
Not at all. Do you understand?

244
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,317
Have more faith
in Montgomery's intelligence reports.

245
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,829
He's done pretty well for us
in the last few years.

246
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,918
I will tell you the extent of my faith.

247
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,476
I'm thinking of asking for a letter stating
that I was forced to act on your orders,

248
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,194
in case my men are massacred.

249
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,236
I see.

250
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,476
Yes, I do see.

251
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,636
Do you wish such a letter?

252
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,439
No.

253
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,279
- No, of course not.
- In the case of massacre,

254
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,834
what difference would it make?

255
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,959
- You mean you don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.

256
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,277
All right, boys. NAAFI's up.
Take your break.

257
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,389
- God Almighty!
- Sorry about that, sir. But what, then?

258
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,469
The radios aren't strong enough to carry
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

259
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,319
- You don't have any cigarettes, do you?
- No.

260
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,671
They're perfectly OK. I've used them
God knows how many times.

261
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,314
You've told me that
God knows how many times.

262
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,591
Well, I didn't have any problems
with them in the desert.

263
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,156
Yes, I know. You see,
colonel, what bothers me,

264
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,475
what has me more than a bit disturbed,

265
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,958
is that Holland being half underwater
is soggier than most deserts you find.

266
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,990
Tends to have a lot more trees.

267
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,669
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

268
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,275
- Tell the general, if you're so certain.
- If I were, believe me, I would.

269
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,551
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?

270
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,069
The general will be
on the bridge by nightfall.

271
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,876
He won't have to make contact
with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?

272
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,709
Well... if anyone rocks the boat,

273
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,400
is not gonna be me.

274
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,396
The regular projector chap's at lunch.
I'll have it in a moment.

275
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,798
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.

276
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,717
Damn!

277
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,833
Nearly there, sir.
Is really worth your time, sir. Believe me.

278
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,713
There.

279
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,673
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
No tanks.

280
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,272
Wait a moment, sir. Is a lot clearer
in the next picture. If I can just...

281
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,271
Now.

282
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,595
- Next.
- Yes, sir. I've had this one enlarged.

283
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,312
Yes. I shouldn't worry about them.

284
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,270
- But, sir, you see, they are tanks.
- I doubt if they're fully serviceable.

285
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,277
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

286
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:57,272
But, sir... if they weren't serviceable,
why would they try to conceal them?

287
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,349
- Normal routine, Fuller.
- We keep getting reports from the Dutch.

288
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,598
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

289
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,156
Now, look here. There have been
thousands of photographs

290
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,751
from this sortie and all the others.
How many of them have shown tanks?

291
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,838
- Just these, sir.
- You seriously want us to cancel

292
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,751
the biggest operation mounted since
D-day because of three photographs?

293
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,115
- No, sir.
- 16 consecutive drops

294
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,028
have been cancelled in the last
few months for one reason or another.

295
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,790
But this time the party's on.
And no one is going to call it off.

296
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,392
Is that fully understood?

297
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,954
Yes, sir.

298
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,790
GENERAL HORROCKS' XXX CORPS. H.Q.

299
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,917
LEOPOLDSBURG ON THE BELGIAN-DUTCH BORDER

300
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,593
Thank you, Waddy.

301
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,111
Thank you, gentlemen!

302
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,114
Do sit down, gentlemen. Please sit down.

303
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,954
Look after these for me, will you?

304
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,836
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

305
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,473
Gentlemen, this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren.

306
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,797
And mightily bored they'll be!

307
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,038
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.

308
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,995
Market is the airborne element
and Garden the ground forces-thas us.

309
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,954
Now, this is our position
on the Belgian border here.

310
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,512
Tomorrow three airborne divisions
will begin landing in Holland.

311
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,590
35,000 men taking off from 24 airfields in
troop-carrying planes or towed in gliders.

312
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,075
The American 101 st here,
around Eindhoven.

313
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,637
The American 82nd here,
south of Nijmegen,

314
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,437
and our own 1 st Airborne boys
and a Polish brigade here at Arnhem,

315
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,155
64 miles behind enemy lines.

316
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,193
Now, their job is to take and hold
all the bridges in these three areas.

317
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,599
Our job is to punch a hole
through the German front line here

318
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,996
and then drive like hell up this road,

319
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,636
linking up with each airborne division
on the way up.

320
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,310
Speed is the vital factor.

321
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,070
The plan is to reach Eindhoven
in two to three hours,

322
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,919
and Arnhem in two to three days.

323
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,313
That, gentlemen, is the prize.

324
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,594
The bridge over the Rhine.
The last bridge between us and Germany.

325
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,555
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

326
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,990
The Irish Guards and colonel Vandeleur
will take the lead.

327
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,839
- Christ. Not us again.
- What ïyou say to that, Joe?

328
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,994
Delighted, sir. Truly delighted.

329
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,993
I've selected you to lead us, not only due
to your extraordinary fighting ability,

330
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,238
but also because, in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you,

331
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,796
they will assume from your attire
that you're a wretched peasant

332
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,357
and immediately send you on your way.

333
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,390
Now, maintaining the speed of our
advance will no doubt be tough going,

334
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,556
as is a single highway.

335
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,755
But, no matter what, we must reach
those 1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours.

336
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,270
Now, gentlemen,
I'm not saying that this will be

337
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,358
the easiest party
that we've ever attended.

338
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,836
But I still wouldn't miss it for the world.

339
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,557
I like to think of this as one of those
American Western films.

340
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,959
The paratroops lacking substantial
equipment, always short of food.

341
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,719
These are the besieged homesteaders.

342
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,957
The Germans,
well, naturally, they're the bad guys.

343
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,550
And 30 corps, we, my friends,

344
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,719
are the cavalry on the way to the rescue!

345
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,270
COLONEL FROST'S QUARTERS

346
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,358
BRITISH 1st AIRBORNE DIVISION. ENGLAND

347
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,553
Oh. Do you want me
to pack that as well, sir?

348
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,319
- No, thank you, Wicks. I'll carry it.
- Sir.

349
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,350
- You haven't forgotten my golf clubs?
- They'll be coming later in the staff car.

350
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,198
What about...?

351
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,117
Sorry, sir?

352
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,595
What about my dinner jacket?

353
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,274
Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir?

354
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,755
Well, les hope so.

355
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,719
U.S. 101st AIRBORNE DIVISION. ENGLAND

356
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,791
This is chock full of vitamins.

357
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,673
Here, Eddie. Have a little strength.

358
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,789
Hey, where'd you put that?

359
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,071
- Dammit, Eddie. Give it back.
- Right.

360
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,756
There you are.

361
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,120
I wish you hadn't done that.

362
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,988
You see, my problem is I'm not totally
crazy about the prospect of dying.

363
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,076
So don't die.

364
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,916
- That garbage isn't gonna keep you alive.
- Well, what is?

365
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,996
What is? Well...

366
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,436
- Not gettin' shot.
- What can guarantee that?

367
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,915
Nothin' - For sure.

368
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,556
You will.

369
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,592
- I will what?
- You tell me, Eddie.

370
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,075
You tell me I won't die.

371
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,759
- All right. You won't die.
- No, no. Guarantee me.

372
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,838
I want you to guarantee me I won't die.

373
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,869
I guarantee you.

374
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,951
come on.

375
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,958
Les get some food in ya. Come on.

376
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,036
I wasn't kidding.

377
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,790
Hey, Eddie! Were you kidding?

378
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,116
Major Fuller.

379
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,352
My name is Sims. Mind a bit of company?

380
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,876
Of course not, sir.

381
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,795
Busy times.

382
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,275
You must be exhausted.

383
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,195
Are you? Exhausted?

384
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,236
Who isn't?

385
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,835
We've been getting reports
from a number of your friends.

386
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,590
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.

387
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,349
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

388
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,039
Is it because I rocked the boat?

389
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,233
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.

390
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,315
I think perhaps you ought to take
a bit of sick leave.

391
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,516
But why?

392
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,240
I'm not ill or anything.

393
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,314
I haven't done anything wrong.

394
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,830
No, of course not. You're just a little tired.

395
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,070
Yes.

396
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,555
I am tired.

397
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,635
I think perhaps we might go.

398
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,998
can't it be stopped?

399
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,599
No.

400
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,549
I don't want to be left behind. Please.

401
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,040
Is out of my hands, laddie.

402
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,040
I didn't want to miss the party.

403
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,955
come on. Move it, buddy.

404
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,514
- Come on! Move yourselves!
- Get up there. Move on down.

405
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,835
Home, sweet home.

406
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,593
When you think we only had seven days
to get everything organised, is quite a...

407
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,679
Bloody miracle. It took six months
to set up the D-day drop.

408
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,598
And that was only half as big as this.

409
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,517
- How ïyou feel?
- Fine.

410
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,837
I'll feel even better when we're in Holland.

411
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,758
A few months back
when I was appointed to this command

412
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,395
I told you I had never jumped
but thought I ought to give it a go.

413
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,478
- Well, you did me a big favour.
- Oh, really? What?

414
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,196
You said "Roy, you're far too old
for that kind of thing and much too large."

415
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,470
Did I? What was the favour?

416
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,752
Well, I didn't quite
tell you everything at the time.

417
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,875
- But I'm prone to airsickness.
- Good gracious! Every flight?

418
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,033
We'll soon find out, won't we?

419
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,636
Soon be home, Harry.

420
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,270
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?

421
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
Easier than walking, sir.

422
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,440
If you say so, Hancock.

423
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,035
Yeah. Fine, sir.

424
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,189
The artillery should be able to clear
the way pretty well-your initial advance.

425
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,880
We'll move as soon as
their barrage has got going.

426
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,676
- Yes, thas absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.

427
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,839
But this isn't going to be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is.

428
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
No, I didn't think so.

429
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,838
Morning, Alan! Your sleeping beauties
know there's a war on, do they?

430
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,997
Is it true that the Germans
have put more troops ahead of us?

431
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,556
Yes. They don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

432
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,832
Hello, Bob! Hope thas not
my funeral they're going to!

433
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,029
And I'm still worried about
having to throw everything up this road.

434
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,118
But there's no alternative. Morning, Tom!

435
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,993
So I've decided
to run the road like a railway.

436
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,114
Nobody will be allowed to put any vehicle
on that road without my permission.

437
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,196
- Including me?
- Good luck, sir!

438
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,676
You too! Especially you, Joe.

439
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,874
Morning, Derek! Glad to see
somebody knows where we're going.

440
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,477
Time, Joe. Thas the killer.

441
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,876
We can't afford to drop behind schedule.

442
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,995
So, for Goïs sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

443
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,548
Good God Almighty.

444
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,117
Thas just the 101 st. The other
two groups are on the northern route.

445
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,436
H-hour in 90 minutes.

446
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,791
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.

447
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,911
Any last-minute changes, Bob?

448
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,555
If we run into difficulty, we call in
the air force with purple smoke.

449
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,037
- First class! And good luck, Joe!
- Thank you, sir.

450
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,076
- Do you think you'll be able to manage it?
- I've got nothing else planned for today.

451
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,436
Ta.

452
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,075
I told you
you should have had the bloody thing out.

453
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,591
What the hell's that?

454
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,676
Is flak.

455
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,673
GENERAL BITTRICH'S H.Q.

456
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,671
SOUTH OF ARNHEM

457
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,233
General Bittrich!

458
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,277
In here, Matthias.

459
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,480
Fantastic, isn't it?

460
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,269
Just once to have
such power in my hands.

461
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,679
- Red on!
- Red on.

462
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,159
If there's no more opposition than this
on the road, we shall be all right.

463
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,556
B company to me!

464
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,194
A company over there!

465
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,397
FIELD MARSHAL MODEL'S H.Q.
HARTENSTEIN HOTEL NEAR ARNHEM

466
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,676
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...

467
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,149
British paratroopers have landed...

468
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,833
three kilometres from here.

469
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,349
Why should they do that?

470
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,715
There is nothing important here.

471
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,672
Me! I am important.

472
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,710
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

473
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,478
call my chauffeur and car.

474
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,954
Evacuate the headquarters.

475
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,638
And don't forget my cigars.

476
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,436
Oh, God!

477
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,594
General, are you all right?

478
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,790
Yeah.

479
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,992
OK, you guys. Come on.
Gather your stuff and move!

480
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,755
- This is it, Jim.
- OK, sir.

481
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,639
You OK?

482
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,557
Right. Les go.

483
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,636
Then keep trying.

484
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,876
There must be someone there!

485
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,272
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

486
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,829
They say thousands of troops
are dropping over Holland.

487
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,197
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

488
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,318
I can't get through to his headquarters.

489
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,352
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

490
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,557
Nijmegen? They're after the bridge.

491
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,749
That doesn't matter.

492
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,871
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal's soup.

493
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,915
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.

494
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,071
I'll take care of Arnhem.

495
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,431
You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can.

496
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,828
Take anything thall move...

497
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,555
every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

498
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,199
No. Field Marshal Model.

499
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,240
Nothing must cross it. Is that clear?

500
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,233
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstances.

501
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,994
- Understood?
- Clear.

502
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,190
- Ryan and Ross, come with me!
- Cover the right flank.

503
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,271
- How far away is headquarters?
- Half a mile. Maybe more.

504
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,588
Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir.
2nd Battalion are on the river road.

505
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,998
Good. Thank you, Baker. Any news
of Freddie Gough's Jeep squadron?

506
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,190
- Is unconfirmed...
- Bad luck,

507
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,869
considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

508
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,870
A lot of the special Jeeps failed to arrive.

509
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,468
Those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

510
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,832
So no one's going to get to
Arnhem Bridge except on foot. Splendid.

511
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,909
They must be from the lunatic asylum, sir.
Is located on the far side of the wood.

512
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,828
They escaped
when it was bombed this morning.

513
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,954
Do you think
they know something we don't?

514
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,070
All guns commence firing!

515
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,231
Get moving.

516
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,715
Driver advance.

517
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,472
Message received. Thank you. Out.

518
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,756
Start the purple!

519
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,715
Start the purple!

520
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,593
Take cover!

521
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,789
- Smoke loaded!
- Fire!

522
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,713
come on. Get the wounded down the line.

523
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,800
Get that wreck off the road.

524
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,956
Joe, how the hell...?

525
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,188
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

526
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,470
You don't know the worst.

527
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,114
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?

528
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,957
Is the wide part.

529
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,950
Peter-general's coming in.

530
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,395
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.

531
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,877
We haven't made contact with
General Browning, 30 corps or England.

532
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,750
- So no one knows we've arrived safely.
- Not as far as we know, sir.

533
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,635
What about those VHF sets?

534
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,594
It appears the sets have been delivered
with the wrong crystals.

535
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,759
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid they are.

536
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,749
Do Brigadier Lathbury and colonel Frost
know about the Jeep squadron?

537
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:29,671
Not as far as we know, sir. We're unable
to contact any units moving into Arnhem.

538
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,912
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs, Steele.

539
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,474
- No, sir.
- We can't quite understand it, sir.

540
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,036
- Is perfectly good equipment.
- Then get it sorted out,

541
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,709
before we have
a bloody disaster on our hands.

542
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,756
Sir.

543
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,312
Hancock, I've got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods,

544
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,513
my original plan has been scuppered
now that the Jeeps haven't arrived,

545
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,349
my communications
have completely broken down.

546
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,270
Do you really believe that any of that
can be helped by a cup of tea?

547
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,556
Wouldn't hurt, sir.

548
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,629
GENERAL BITTRICH'S FORMER H.Q.

549
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,672
NOW TAKEN OVER BY FIELD MARSHAL MODEL

550
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,078
Forgive me for returning, Field Marshal.

551
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,838
I must press for permission,

552
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,309
if it becomes necessary,

553
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,349
to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

554
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,118
That is out of the question.

555
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,515
Never. Is that clear?

556
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,437
We need them for our counterattack.

557
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,120
counterattack? With what?

558
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,038
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

559
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,116
Isolated they are lost.

560
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,714
I have spoken to Von Rundstedt.

561
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,190
All reinforcements come to us first.

562
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,312
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

563
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,758
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

564
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,911
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

565
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,794
they would have landed
12 kilometres away?

566
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,712
Is ridiculous.

567
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,796
Thank you for the tea.

568
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:20,358
Our lightning-like assault on Arnhem
Bridge is certainly a smashing success.

569
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,313
I've an aversion to apples. I'm so sorry.

570
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,635
I'm sure the Germans will be surprised.

571
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,548
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.

572
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,319
Thank you for coming. Thank you!

573
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,070
- This isn't a victory parade, you know.
- Come on, sir. Enjoy the moment.

574
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,909
I will enjoy the moment when
we reach the bridge and find it intact.

575
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,555
It will be. Things couldn't be going better.
Nothing's wrong.

576
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,070
Yes, I know.
Thas exactly what is wrong, Harry. Yes.

577
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,355
U.S. 101st AIRBORNE AREA

578
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,516
THE SON BRIDGE

579
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,396
Jesus christ!

580
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,476
Stay down!

581
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,236
Shit!

582
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,113
- There's still no contact, sir.
- Keep at it. I shall be back shortly.

583
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,629
Brigadier Lathbury
can't have gone that far.

584
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,958
I'm sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

585
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,997
can you get a message
down to 30th corps on that dingus?

586
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,157
Yes, sir. We just got word
from the 82nd up ahead.

587
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,589
They captured the Grave Bridge intact!

588
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,316
Terrific. Except 30th corps ain't about to
reach the goddamn intact Grave Bridge

589
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,954
until the goddamn Son Bridge is fixed!

590
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,197
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

591
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,151
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven.

592
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,990
Tell those schmucks to do this right
and have their Bailey stuff at the front.

593
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,356
- And be sure to say "please".
- Yes, sir.

594
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,039
Joe! I make it just under six miles
to Eindhoven.

595
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,630
We won't make it tonight.
Ill be dark shortly.

596
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,673
Well, I hope to God
the 101 st can hang on till tomorrow.

597
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,509
Giles, remember what the general said.

598
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:39,351
We're the cavalry. It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

599
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,192
In the nick of time would do nicely!

600
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,039
These plans should have
been left in England.

601
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,309
They're top secret.

602
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,869
And now we have all we need -

603
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,828
units, defence plans, objectives

604
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,315
and the schedule for further drops.

605
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,789
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition

606
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,275
if I blow it up tonight.

607
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,432
This Operation Market Garden must fail.

608
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,515
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

609
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,200
come, Ludwig. We'll have dinner.

610
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,151
Dinner?

611
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,077
But what about these plans?

612
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,555
These plans? They are false.

613
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,989
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

614
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,917
White wine or red?

615
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,229
We're still getting nothing
from colonel Fross battalion, sir.

616
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,316
Thank you, cole.

617
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,035
- I hope Johnny's meeting less resistance.
- We've got to get to the bridge.

618
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,153
We're blocked ahead. There's more
resistance than we were led to expect.

619
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:51,353
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, cole! What is their strength?

620
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,519
I can't estimate yet. Dutch underground
people were here trying to explain.

621
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,200
I'm just not sure how much they know.

622
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,717
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it, sir.

623
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,549
christ Almighty! They've got round behind
us! You should spend the night with us.

624
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:27,116
- Gerald, I've got to get back to HQ.
- Yes, but alive, sir.

625
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,198
If we can reach them,
there are some houses over there.

626
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,678
We can get ourselves organised and try
and find out what the hell's happening.

627
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,472
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.

628
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,355
come on, lads! Get a move on!

629
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,875
Something just occurred to me.
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

630
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,994
Is all very well for the country, but
I doubt if ill fool anyone in the towns.

631
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,076
come on.

632
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:56,399
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're
going to have to occupy your house.

633
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,592
All right, chaps. We're in here. Come on.

634
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,117
- And Dick.
- Yes, sir?

635
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:06,028
Take your men and occupy that house.
Make sure you can cover the bridge.

636
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,752
Right, sir. Sergeant.

637
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,919
Hello, Dog charlie Fox...

638
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:19,231
Rip down those curtains. Pile all this
furniture against the window. All right?

639
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,557
Hello, Dog charlie Fox.
We have reached our objective.

640
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,240
What is your position? Over.

641
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,309
There's nothing, sir.
I can't contact Brigade at all, sir.

642
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,431
Tried the other battalions?

643
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,516
Any luck?

644
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,756
- Keep trying.
- Hello, Dog charlie Fox.

645
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,311
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.

646
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,715
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.

647
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,518
Tomorrow?

648
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,432
Yes, Mother.

649
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,956
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

650
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,834
Having a go is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

651
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,149
But you'll let us try, sir?

652
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,190
- Down! Take cover!
- Cover fire! Quick!

653
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,396
Smoke!

654
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,028
Right! Come on, lads!

655
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,835
come on! Keep going!

656
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,315
Pull back!

657
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,828
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

658
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,190
We'll deal with them later.

659
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,276
When it gets dark.

660
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,154
- Made it so far, Doddsy, eh?
- Aye.

661
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,673
Hey, corp.
You'd better hit that slit first time.

662
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,077
Hey, corp. I said you'd better hit that slit
first time or we've bleedin'...

663
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,158
- I heard you, boyo.
- Oh, great.

664
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,996
After you, corp.

665
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,514
come on. Les get on with it.

666
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,474
Now!

667
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,750
Now we're in trouble!
You bloody missed it!

668
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,749
You knocked my arm, you clumsy
bastard! Now we'll never get out of here!

669
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,950
We've hit an ammunition dump!
A bloody ammo dump! Shit!

670
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,751
Fool's courage.

671
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,914
She says you are much too noisy.

672
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,759
She does realise
there is a war going on, doesn't she?

673
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:05,395
She has never liked noise.
She hates it. Hates it!

674
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,717
- Colonel Frost! They're coming, sir.
- Excuse me.

675
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,548
- Many of them?
- Can't tell, sir.

676
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,672
can only hear them at the moment.

677
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,754
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

678
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,315
command. Wait for the command.

679
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,435
Over there, Whitney! Look after that man!

680
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,754
Open fire! Fire!

681
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,036
Jesus!

682
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,476
cease firing!

683
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,430
cease firing!

684
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,229
Sorry, ma'am.

685
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,830
Whitney, try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

686
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,312
I'm going to check up with cornish.
See you later.

687
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:18,991
Get him patched up, will you, doc?
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

688
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,436
- Wicks.
- Sir.

689
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,876
Right, off you go.

690
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,356
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

691
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,876
Here we go.
