1
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,546
Let us finish it.

2
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:44,472
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

3
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,770
Then what do we do?

4
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,869
We break through.

5
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,532
There!

6
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,765
I see him.

7
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,719
Pagans!

8
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,767
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

9
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:23,669
No! Do not stop.

10
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:48,895
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

11
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:51,865
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

12
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,596
Never!

13
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,514
No!

14
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,358
We're almost there.

15
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,071
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

16
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,234
You're strong enough.

17
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:54,241
Finish it.

18
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:11,456
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

19
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,557
I just need to take a little.

20
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,071
Finish it.

21
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:14,555
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

22
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:16,614
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

23
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:19,957
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

24
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,929
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

25
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,535
I'm sorry.

26
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,594
I am.

27
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,576
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,266
Finish it.

29
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,973
Please, leave me alone.

30
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:25,035
I don't know how it ends.

31
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,175
All right.

32
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,842
I trust you.

33
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,907
Take me.

34
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,545
Show me.

35
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,428
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

36
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,490
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

37
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,401
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

38
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,598
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

39
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,632
I'm sorry.

40
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,008
I am.

41
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,481
I'll see you tonight, OK?

42
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,613
Izzi.

43
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:44,381
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

44
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,520
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

45
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,360
Dammit.

46
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,164
Come on.

47
00:14:55,237 --> 00:15:01,142
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

48
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,874
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

49
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,075
- Call him.
- OK.

50
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:14,610
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

51
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:18,181
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

52
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,093
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

53
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,223
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

54
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,070
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

55
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,935
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

56
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:39,947
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

57
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,977
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

58
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,851
Yup.

59
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:51,085
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

60
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,266
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

61
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,672
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanize.

62
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:12,975
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

63
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,982
Dammit!

64
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,061
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

65
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:12,063
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

66
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,873
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

67
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:23,645
<i>- That one.
- "Natul tortuosa. 82-A46."</i>

68
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,346
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

69
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:31,984
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

70
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,460
- That's it.
- What's happening?

71
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,896
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

72
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:41,959
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

73
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:46,268
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

74
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,775
woman on top.

75
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,141
They have complementary domains.

76
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,737
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

77
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:57,979
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

78
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:02,284
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

79
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,552
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

80
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,890
Keep him under.

81
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,397
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

82
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:23,240
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

83
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,302
Let's do it.

84
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,678
.751, 1.25.

85
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:31,241
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

86
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:35,348
Manny, give me light.

87
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,153
Lowering.

88
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,130
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

89
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:51,332
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

90
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,719
- What's up?
- My ring.

91
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,281
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

92
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,352
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

93
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,594
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

94
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,101
- One second.
- What are you doing?

95
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,833
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

96
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:30,367
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

97
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,004
Tommy...

98
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:40,512
- I'm concerned.
- What?

99
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:45,753
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

100
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,490
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

101
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,032
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

102
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,729
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

103
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:59,603
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

104
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:08,004
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

105
00:20:09,484 --> 00:20:12,942
Spend a little time with Izzi.

106
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:16,388
I'm here for her.

107
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,636
Izzi.

108
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,552
Izzi?

109
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,420
Iz?

110
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,628
Izzi?

111
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,662
Izzi.

112
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,602
Izzi!

113
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,941
Izzi!

114
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:12,946
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

115
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,748
That's funny.
Very funny.

116
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,683
What are you doing?

117
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,718
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

118
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:33,392
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

119
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,198
You're an old fart.

120
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,236
OK.

121
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,939
OK.

122
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,381
Go on. Look.

123
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,018
- You see it?
- The gold star?

124
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:02,688
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

125
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,833
What?

126
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,198
- I took science.
- When?

127
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,171
Junior high.

128
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,904
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

129
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:26,652
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

130
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,246
What? What are you talking about?

131
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:31,416
My book.

132
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:34,620
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

133
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,789
It begins there.

134
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,128
Ends there.

135
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,395
Are you done?

136
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:43,869
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

137
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:57,180
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

138
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:02,518
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

139
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,753
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

140
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:09,459
how did they find one that was dying?

141
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,391
Where are your shoes?

142
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:22,300
Izzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

143
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:27,210
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

144
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,272
OK. I'll get it.

145
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,710
Careful. Iz?

146
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:37,622
Stop. No!

147
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,592
Get inside.

148
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,719
Serves you right.

149
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,652
Is she a redhead?

150
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,688
What?

151
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,527
I left it in Surgery.

152
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:50,587
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

153
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,025
I'm joking.

154
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:59,903
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

155
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:06,311
I want you to heat it.

156
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:39,843
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

157
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,643
Tommy.

158
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,512
- I'm calling Dr. Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

159
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,284
Jesus, I'm sorry.

160
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,819
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

161
00:25:56,898 --> 00:26:00,231
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

162
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:03,361
Because I feel different inside.

163
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,997
I feel different.

164
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,371
Every moment.

165
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,637
Each one.

166
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,310
Tommy?

167
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,024
Oh, Jesus.

168
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:31,690
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

169
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,825
I will always be here.

170
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,166
I know. Yes, I know, Iz.

171
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,785
Got you.

172
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,347
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

173
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:05,358
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

174
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:10,159
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

175
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:16,795
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

176
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:20,363
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

177
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:23,274
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

178
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:30,584
Don't answer it.

179
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:34,018
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

180
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,784
- What is it?
- Donovan.

181
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,848
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

182
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,156
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

183
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,822
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

184
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,893
No, I can't now. I can't.

185
00:28:57,411 --> 00:29:00,676
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

186
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:03,342
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

187
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:06,682
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

188
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,690
What? It can't be.

189
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:18,623
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

190
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:22,499
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

191
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,664
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

192
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,804
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

193
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:36,441
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

194
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:43,450
- And the tumor?
- No change.

195
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,062
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

196
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:54,158
- We should tell Dr. Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

197
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:04,143
Antonio,

198
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:07,910
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

199
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:10,041
What?

200
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,347
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

201
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,580
But this could be a medical first.

202
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:18,091
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

203
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,959
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumors, not ageing.

204
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:27,160
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

205
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:30,121
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

206
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,631
Everything's all right.

207
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,380
Inquisitor?

208
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,419
Enter.

209
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,252
The heretics.

210
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:46,629
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

211
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,191
They await yourjudgment.

212
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:53,605
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

213
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,546
Soon she will be powerless against me.

214
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:05,310
Queen of nothing but her sins.

215
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,413
What will you do with her?

216
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:12,016
She too will confess,
and then

217
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:15,221
she too will die.

218
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,024
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

219
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:57,332
She is surrounded.

220
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:59,998
The inquisitor demands blood.

221
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,379
Then there is no more time.

222
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,153
What is our response?

223
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:19,090
Go now.
Warn the queen.

224
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:22,621
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

225
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:25,324
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

226
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,525
This is our only hope.

227
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,514
Stay. Stay.

228
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:13,336
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

229
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:20,445
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

230
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,718
But fear not.

231
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,918
All flesh decays.

232
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:31,091
Death turns all to ash,

233
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,829
and, thus,

234
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,564
death frees every soul.

235
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:44,238
You, the condemned,

236
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:47,109
you have confessed.

237
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,913
You admit to protecting a queen

238
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:56,250
who twists the word of God

239
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:59,850
and drowns all Spain in sin.

240
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:07,397
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

241
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:10,265
This is heresy.

242
00:37:10,337 --> 00:37:12,828
She leads you towards vanity,

243
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:15,841
away from the spirit.

244
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:18,377
But this is foolishness,

245
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,912
for death exists.

246
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:23,415
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

247
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,844
All life must be judged.

248
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,028
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

249
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:49,041
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

250
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,977
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

251
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,947
She desires a private audience.

252
00:37:56,016 --> 00:38:01,579
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

253
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:05,147
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

254
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:01,137
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

255
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,741
To see Spain brought so low,

256
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:09,687
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

257
00:39:09,756 --> 00:39:12,520
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

258
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:14,924
Dare not pity Spain.

259
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:19,894
These times are dark,

260
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:25,404
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

261
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,633
Of course.

262
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,040
This loyalty of yours

263
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,739
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

264
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:38,208
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

265
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:41,784
Europe would have my head.

266
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:47,055
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

267
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:49,755
I will die for Spain.

268
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:54,423
I know, Conquistador.

269
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:55,991
I know.

270
00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:00,096
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

271
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:04,707
For Spain has a plan.

272
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:07,872
There is hope.

273
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,576
- There's hope?
- Father.

274
00:40:30,437 --> 00:40:34,100
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

275
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,836
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

276
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,842
Father.

277
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,574
Guards, leave us.

278
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:47,750
Conquistador,

279
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:53,817
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

280
00:40:54,861 --> 00:41:00,322
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

281
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,391
with a secret so great,

282
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:05,961
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

283
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:10,032
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

284
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,511
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

285
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,174
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

286
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:21,380
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

287
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:24,150
But we have not yielded,

288
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,125
and now we will defeat him.

289
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:38,602
This is our hope.

290
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:42,631
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

291
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,542
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

292
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:50,646
The marking on the hilt...

293
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:55,454
Do you see it?

294
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:03,454
It is a map.

295
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:07,727
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

296
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:13,103
Greater than Chichen Itzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

297
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:18,201
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilization,

298
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:22,715
we will find a lost pyramid.

299
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,116
No.

300
00:42:26,186 --> 00:42:28,017
Not lost.

301
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:33,617
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

302
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:37,185
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

303
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:40,062
built upon the navel of the Earth,

304
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:43,102
the birthplace of life.

305
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,833
A special tree sprouts there.

306
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:52,306
They say whoever drinks of its sap

307
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:55,280
will live forever.

308
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,045
Eternal life?

309
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:04,748
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

310
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:07,418
They are not yarns.

311
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,759
Remember,

312
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,264
our own Bible confirms it.

313
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:17,269
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

314
00:43:17,337 --> 00:43:21,068
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

315
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,542
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

316
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:28,513
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

317
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,571
Could it be?

318
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:09,211
Could it be?

319
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:13,156
Kneel, Conquistador.

320
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:21,431
Let in the morning light.

321
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,051
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

322
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,990
He has isolated me,

323
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:50,121
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

324
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:55,231
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

325
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:15,178
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

326
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:18,190
Upon my honor and my life.

327
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:33,471
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

328
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:39,775
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

329
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,371
and when you return,

330
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,644
I shall be your Eve.

331
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,779
Together, we will live forever.

332
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,238
Iz?

333
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:13,876
Izzi?

334
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:42,307
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

335
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:47,108
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

336
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:52,641
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

337
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,949
Is he dead?

338
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,684
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

339
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:02,319
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

340
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:08,163
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

341
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:12,227
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

342
00:47:12,305 --> 00:47:14,773
All that remained
was First Father's head.

343
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:18,777
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

344
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:21,336
Xibalba? The star.

345
00:47:21,414 --> 00:47:23,541
Nebula.

346
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:26,084
- So what do you think?
- About?

347
00:47:26,152 --> 00:47:28,120
That idea.

348
00:47:28,188 --> 00:47:31,180
Death as an act of creation.

349
00:47:34,027 --> 00:47:36,188
Stay together, guys.

350
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:40,924
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

351
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:05,748
Iz. Iz!

352
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,114
- Tommy.
- Hey.

353
00:48:34,821 --> 00:48:36,618
Tommy.

354
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,924
You're all right.

355
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:50,167
- I'm close.
- No.

356
00:48:50,236 --> 00:48:52,033
There are options.

357
00:48:52,105 --> 00:48:55,973
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

358
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:03,105
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

359
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:05,548
- The next time...
- No!

360
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,076
No.

361
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,349
We had a breakthrough.

362
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:13,153
I know I can translate it to help you.

363
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,456
I just need a little more time, OK?

364
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:19,055
There's hope.
There's real hope.

365
00:49:19,132 --> 00:49:22,363
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

366
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:29,708
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

367
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:32,472
You're very strong.

368
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:34,376
No.

369
00:49:35,615 --> 00:49:38,607
- No.
- What?

370
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,017
When I fell

371
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:45,480
I was full.

372
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:49,818
Held.

373
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:54,767
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

374
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:05,604
It's OK, Iz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

375
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,979
There's time.
We have time.

376
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:48,881
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

377
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:52,982
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

378
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:54,959
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

379
00:50:56,396 --> 00:51:01,891
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

380
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:05,404
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

381
00:51:05,905 --> 00:51:08,237
And the tumor?

382
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:14,975
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

383
00:51:15,047 --> 00:51:17,538
Please!

384
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:22,554
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

385
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:26,285
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

386
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:40,603
First cut.

387
00:51:43,443 --> 00:51:46,469
Tommy.
Dr. Lipperjust called.

388
00:51:46,546 --> 00:51:52,542
He said Izzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

389
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:10,565
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

390
00:52:15,308 --> 00:52:18,607
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

391
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,291
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:45,827
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

393
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:51,468
Confirmation that the tumor's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

394
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,535
Tommy.

395
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,914
She had a seizure.

396
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,579
I'm so sorry.

397
00:53:06,526 --> 00:53:08,790
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

398
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:12,153
Who's with her?

399
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,228
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

400
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:21,272
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

401
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,309
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

402
00:53:24,377 --> 00:53:30,543
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

403
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:41,149
Shit.

404
00:54:46,592 --> 00:54:48,787
I'll leave you two alone.

405
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:53,297
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

406
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,494
She's amazing.

407
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,266
Lillian,

408
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,902
could...

409
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:10,005
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

410
00:55:10,082 --> 00:55:12,277
- OK.
- Thanks.

411
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:17,412
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:23,391
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

413
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:30,861
How are you feeling?

414
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,699
Good.

415
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,933
I'm sorry.

416
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:44,073
What about?

417
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:54,152
There's been progress at work.

418
00:55:56,295 --> 00:56:00,527
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

419
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,036
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

420
00:56:05,938 --> 00:56:08,702
It's for me? What is it?

421
00:56:08,774 --> 00:56:10,799
Open it.

422
00:56:32,131 --> 00:56:34,759
Pen and ink. For writing.

423
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:46,435
It's all done except the last chapter.

424
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,371
I want you to help me.

425
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:53,649
How?

426
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:55,880
Finish it.

427
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:00,624
Finish it.

428
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:03,161
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

429
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,560
You will.

430
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,623
Stop.

431
00:57:14,373 --> 00:57:17,706
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

432
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:22,610
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

433
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:27,979
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

434
00:57:28,053 --> 00:57:30,078
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

435
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,785
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:37,522
He said if they dug his father's body up,

437
00:57:38,764 --> 00:57:40,755
he would be gone.

438
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:45,232
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

439
00:57:45,304 --> 00:57:47,295
The seed became a tree.

440
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:53,173
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

441
00:57:53,245 --> 00:57:57,682
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

442
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:03,884
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

443
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:07,453
his father flew with the birds.

444
00:58:09,228 --> 00:58:11,219
He said

445
00:58:13,566 --> 00:58:16,467
death was his father's road to awe.

446
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:21,097
That's what he called it.

447
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:24,265
The road to awe.

448
00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:28,669
Now,

449
00:58:28,747 --> 00:58:33,207
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

450
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:35,753
Why are you telling me this?

451
00:58:36,689 --> 00:58:39,214
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

452
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:55,705
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

453
00:58:55,774 --> 00:58:58,106
No, stop it!

454
00:59:00,546 --> 00:59:04,710
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

455
00:59:05,885 --> 00:59:08,285
I'll always be with you.

456
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:12,484
I promise.

457
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:20,488
Will you stay with me tonight?

458
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:24,666
Yeah. I'll stay.

459
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:34,469
I'll stay.

460
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:26,059
Don't worry,

461
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:28,890
we're almost there.

462
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:36,866
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

463
01:00:40,579 --> 01:00:43,742
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

464
01:00:45,484 --> 01:00:48,681
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

465
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,014
You will bloom.

466
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:01,422
And I will live.

467
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,563
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

468
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:27,902
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

469
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:32,833
Circles.

470
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:36,173
He leads us in circles.

471
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:41,544
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

472
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,317
He killed them all with this blind quest.

473
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:51,490
It's time. Time to stop him.

474
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:15,810
Captain, we are lost.

475
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:19,823
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

476
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:22,121
There is no hope for us here.

477
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,753
There's only death.

478
01:05:26,732 --> 01:05:31,169
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

479
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:33,904
Damn the maps!

480
01:05:38,744 --> 01:05:41,269
We're close and I will find it.

481
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:44,406
Captain! Captain! Captain!

482
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,213
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

483
01:05:48,186 --> 01:05:50,245
In the jungle...

484
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:52,722
The marking on the hilt.

485
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:56,818
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

486
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:21,877
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

487
01:06:33,832 --> 01:06:37,529
- You fool.
- Captain!

488
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:39,661
Father.

489
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:41,968
Take it.

490
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,837
We are here.

491
01:06:43,909 --> 01:06:46,343
- Where?
- The temple is there.

492
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:54,084
Sorry, Father.

493
01:06:55,253 --> 01:06:57,915
For you, there is only death.

494
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:02,121
But our destiny is life.

495
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,885
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

496
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:36,485
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

497
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:48,864
Iz! Iz!

498
01:07:54,913 --> 01:07:57,040
Come on, come on, come on!

499
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,481
Oh, no. Please! Please!

500
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,547
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

501
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:06,716
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Izzi!

502
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:09,727
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

503
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:11,126
- Pads.
- Charging.

504
01:08:11,196 --> 01:08:12,356
- Pulse?
- Thready.

505
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:13,625
Pressure?

506
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:19,860
Oh, God.

507
01:08:41,193 --> 01:08:42,922
Tommy.

508
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,923
I know. I know.

509
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,796
I've never seen anything like it.

510
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:52,166
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

511
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:55,673
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

512
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,174
It's like the disease is cured.

513
01:09:00,912 --> 01:09:03,073
Izzi.

514
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:05,139
Izzi!

515
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:10,521
Izzi!

516
01:09:14,092 --> 01:09:16,686
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

517
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:17,955
Sir!

518
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,988
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

519
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,865
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

520
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:27,803
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

521
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:02,630
No.

522
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:05,602
No.

523
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:06,939
No!

524
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:09,503
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

525
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:12,141
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

526
01:10:12,217 --> 01:10:14,117
No! No!

527
01:10:14,185 --> 01:10:16,210
No!

528
01:10:45,383 --> 01:10:51,879
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

529
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,421
Complete enough when we die

530
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,797
to achieve a measure of grace.

531
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:06,660
Few of us ever do.

532
01:11:08,506 --> 01:11:14,274
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

533
01:11:18,683 --> 01:11:23,484
But somehow Izzi, young as she was,

534
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:27,786
she achieved that grace.

535
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:30,987
In her last days she became whole.

536
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,889
She saw her...

537
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,761
Tommy!

538
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,996
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

539
01:11:49,214 --> 01:11:53,150
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

540
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:55,982
And there's a cure.

541
01:11:56,054 --> 01:11:57,487
A cure.

542
01:11:57,555 --> 01:12:00,046
And I will find it.

543
01:12:14,406 --> 01:12:15,634
No!

544
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,718
All these years.

545
01:14:53,398 --> 01:14:55,730
All these memories.

546
01:14:58,503 --> 01:15:00,528
There's been you.

547
01:15:11,316 --> 01:15:12,340
You...

548
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:14,749
You pulled me through time.

549
01:15:26,631 --> 01:15:28,394
Dr. Creo?

550
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:47,743
Dr. Creo, we heard you were back.

551
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,156
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

552
01:16:04,636 --> 01:16:07,298
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

553
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,608
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

554
01:16:13,678 --> 01:16:15,873
Right, let's build on it.

555
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:18,472
Stop ageing, stop dying.

556
01:16:18,549 --> 01:16:20,744
Stop dying, that's our goal.

557
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:24,549
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

558
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:33,194
Come on, let's get to work.

559
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:03,093
Xibalba.

560
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,131
We're here.

561
01:17:40,932 --> 01:17:42,923
We almost made it.

562
01:17:47,905 --> 01:17:49,896
I'm sorry.

563
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,310
I'm sorry.

564
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:56,040
Finish it.

565
01:17:59,017 --> 01:18:02,077
Stop it. Stop it!

566
01:18:03,955 --> 01:18:06,287
What do you want?

567
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,783
Leave me! Leave me alone!

568
01:18:11,796 --> 01:18:14,924
Please, please. I'm afraid.

569
01:18:59,477 --> 01:19:02,207
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

570
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:07,117
I don't know.

571
01:19:07,185 --> 01:19:09,585
I'm trying. I don't know how.

572
01:19:09,654 --> 01:19:11,747
You do.

573
01:19:12,924 --> 01:19:14,949
You will.

574
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:19,352
You do.

575
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,965
You will.

576
01:19:34,112 --> 01:19:37,639
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

577
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:44,417
I'm gonna die.

578
01:19:49,193 --> 01:19:51,593
I'm going to die.

579
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,790
Together we will live forever.

580
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:58,358
Forever.

581
01:19:58,436 --> 01:20:00,597
Forever.

582
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:22,782
Forever.

583
01:20:32,403 --> 01:20:34,871
We will live forever.

584
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,571
Finish it.

585
01:20:46,184 --> 01:20:48,209
OK.

586
01:20:50,988 --> 01:20:53,354
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

587
01:20:53,424 --> 01:20:56,359
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

588
01:20:56,427 --> 01:20:58,918
They're waiting on me.

589
01:20:58,996 --> 01:21:02,022
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

590
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:06,267
I'm sorry. I am.

591
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:09,764
I'll see you tonight, OK?

592
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:17,141
Izzi.

593
01:21:17,215 --> 01:21:20,082
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

594
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:24,979
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

595
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:28,989
Come on. Let's go.

596
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:34,395
Dr. Creo, where are you going?

597
01:21:35,967 --> 01:21:37,935
Izzi!

598
01:21:38,069 --> 01:21:39,058
Izzi.

599
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,831
No!

600
01:22:58,082 --> 01:23:00,778
Finish it.

601
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:06,043
Behold.

602
01:26:29,126 --> 01:26:31,356
My queen.

603
01:26:32,463 --> 01:26:34,454
Now and forever.

604
01:26:35,299 --> 01:26:37,324
We shall be together.

605
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:57,924
Bye, Iz.

606
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:13,407
I finished it.

607
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:15,918
Is everything all right?

608
01:30:15,986 --> 01:30:18,079
Yes.

609
01:30:18,155 --> 01:30:20,214
Everything's all right.
