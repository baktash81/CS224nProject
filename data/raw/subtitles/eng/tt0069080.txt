96
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,425
Incidentally, Father,
is it true what I hear

at the church are fixed?

98

it was her husband

131

She won't even tell us

132
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,796
Now, here's our plan.

133
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,865
We'll just be sitting
around casually

134
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,200
and Heldon Pritcher will
bring up John Kennedy.

135
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,702
"Isn't he marvelous looking?"

136
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,003
"Isn't he
a marvelous president?"

137
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,073
Et cetera, et cetera,
and then, Tillie...

138
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,509
That is your name,
isn't it?

139
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,546
But you just ask
a casual question like,

140
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:02,516
um, um, "Who was the first
president you ever voted for?"

141
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,551
And several people will

142
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,985
volunteer information.

143
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:05,986
And then it will be
Gertrude's turn--

144
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,054
It won't work.

145
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,088
That presidential ploy

146
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,057
was tried on Gertrude years ago

147
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,859
under Harry Truman, I think.

148
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,828

better than that.

00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,241
Thank you.

176
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,744
After 12:00

177
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,912
we turn the clocks back tonight,
don't we?

178
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,247
Yes, we do.

179
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,050
That's such a good idea,
turning our clocks back.

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,218
It gives us an extra
hour of insomnia.

181
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,888
Go on home, dogs.

182
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,389
Shall we go?

183
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,057
Oh, I have a car.

184
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,892
Thanks just the same though.

185
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,060
But I don't.

186
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,797
- Don't what?
- Don't have a car.

187
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,732
You want me to drop you?

188
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,300
No, no, no, I'll take you home,

189
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,935
and I can get a cab from there

190
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,171
or a cable car or something.

191

for an insurance company.

199
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,391
I think you're wondering
how can she afford a car

200
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,161
in San Francisco
on a secretary's salary?

201

Well, it isn't much of a salary,

202
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,135

203

Oh, I see.

204
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,273
What kind of work
do you do, Pete?

205
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,008
Motivational research.

206
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,278
We send canvassers out to
discover what the people think.

207
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,814
- Think about what?
- Products mostly.

208
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,816
What they're looking for
in the way of an automatic

209
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,284
contaminator or, uh,

210
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,320
an aftershave mint,
things like that.

211
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,156
Fascinating products.

212
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,490
Anything else?

213
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,192
Well, we've just completed
a survey

214
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,894
for a dietetic shampoo

215
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,330
and are now helping to launch
a reversible mayonnaise.

216
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,033
Lovely.

217
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,301
Say, maybe you could
help us out.

218
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,903
There's a new men's cologne

219
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,904
coming out on the market.

220
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,305
They're looking for a name.

221
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,240
I suggested "Armpit."

222
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,913
Did they go for it?

223
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,281
No.

224
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,785
And that, in case you're
wondering, is why I have no car.

225
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,862
I don't believe it,
a parking space

226
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,363
right in front of the house.

I woke up this morning
with a touch of something,

233

and I don't know what it is.

234
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,851
Headache, upset stomach.

I wasn't asking about me.

I was asking about

there's some Scotch,

Scotch with water or soda?

No photo of father.

276

He wasn't around long enough

277
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,273
to have his picture taken.

278
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,508
He disappeared 20 years ago.

279
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,310
And mother alive and well,
I hope?

280

281
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,114

in a minute

282
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,016

about yourself?

288

Don't wear a girdle.

bumpers a chance.

290
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,131
I mean, you haven't
got that much

291
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,133
that you need to go around
with it in a sling.

292
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,467
Let it breathe.

293
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,669
Same thing with the upstairs.

294
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,538
You're the kind of woman
who could go without

295
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,141
a bra altogether,
let alone folding your arms

296
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,043
on top of it like an Indian.

297
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,278
With sweaters and
even the right dress

298
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,248
let the merchandise
gallop a little.

299
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,549
When father was still around

300
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,052
mother said she sometimes
crossed the street

301
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,320
just to avoid him.

302
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,587
Or she'd flop into a closet

303
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,589
as he passed her in the hall.

304
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,992
You won't have to go that far.

305
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,296
What are my chances of being

306
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,364
mugged on the way to a cab?

308
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,267
Could I phone for one?

309
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,336
No, that would take all night.

310
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,040
Would you like me to
walk you to the corner?

00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,642
No, thanks,
I'll take my chances.

- Or any other man.
- Please, let me finish.

338

and she said,

"After you left last night"

340
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,546
"I found a gold
cigarette lighter."

341
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,148
Now, she didn't know
such thing, of course.

342
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:04,817
"It's from Dunhill's.
Is it yours by any chance?"

343
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,156
- Well?
- Well.

344
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,458
Since there was no lighter
in the first place

345
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,593
he said,
"No, it isn't mine."

346
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,762
"I wish I could
afford a Dunhill."

347

"Thank you just the same."

348
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,665

00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,738
that she was seeing a
Dunhill kind of man.

352
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,508
It reopened the lines
of communication.

353
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,877
He couldn't just hang up.

354
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,846
Then he said before he knew
what he was saying,

355
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,315
"What are you doing
Friday night?"

356
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,549
And et voila.

357
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,652

358
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,558
- Call Pete.
- Don't be silly.

359
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,626
Just because it worked for you.

360
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,861
Oh, must be after 2:00.

361
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,863
Yes, it is,
he's in his office.

362
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,932
You go call him.
You know the number?

363
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,403
Look it up.
Supreme Survey Incorporated.

364
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,870
Go ahead.

365
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,639
Gertrude.

366
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:03,243
I am not that entranced
by Pete Seltzer.

367
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,477
Tillie,

368
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,646
there are phones
in the powder room.

369
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,425
I didn't even notice
if he smokes or not.

372
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,775
Uh, what happened,
for God's sake?

373
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,710
He's coming over tonight.

374
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,745
Good, then it worked.

375
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,714
Why do you look so furious?

376
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,783
Why do I look so furious?

377
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,518
Because I said to him,
"After you left"

378
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,353
"I found a
gold Dunhill lighter."

379
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,854
"Is it yours by any chance?"

380
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,323
And that son of a bitch says,

381
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,458
"Yes, I'll drop by
tonight to pick it up."

382
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,893
"Thanks a lot."

383
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,363

386
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,458
Hello.

387
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,727
May Allah smile upon you.

388
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,529
I tried to call you at home,

389
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,530
but you're not in the book.

390
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,731
I have an unlisted number.

391
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,733
I hate myself for it.

392
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,401
Well, I wanted
to save you a trip.

393
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,536
I looked at the lighter again,

394
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,803
and there were initials on it.

395
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,005
- And they weren't mine.
- Yes, how did you know?

396
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,942
I suddenly remembered
that I don't smoke.

397
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,744
Well, why didn't you phone me?

398
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,547
I never call girls
whose numbers are listed.

399
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,682
I hate myself for that too.

400
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,517
Besides, I thought you might

401
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,018
rustle me up some dinner.

402
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,356
Oh, I don't think I have
enough food for two.

403
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,359
I could run down to the market.

404
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,061
Don't bother.
Do you like Greek food?

405
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,596
Not particularly.

406
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,897
Good, there's a place
down the street

407
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,333
guaranteed not to make
you change your opinion.

408
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,501
We can walk.

409
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,803
I'll go get my coat.

410
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,590
<font color="#ffff80">PETE:</font> No, actually it could be
any part of the city.

411
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,458
Yesterday I was
assigned Palo Alto,

412
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,927
day before Berkeley.

413
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,529
We don't wanna run
into the same people

414
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,398
asking the same questions.

415
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,732
Where were you today?

416
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,801
At the office, all day.

417
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,503
Big conference, new account.

418
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,971
Would you believe missionaries

419
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,974
testing slogans
for fundraising?

420
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,511
Of course, my suggestion
was turned down.

421
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,878
I thought it was rather good.

422
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,014
Take a cannibal to lunch.

423
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,384
Vice versa would
be even better.

424
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,556
If you're trying to top me,
you're gonna find yourself

425
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,824
paying for the dinner.

426
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,559
And it's every bit
as indifferent

427
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,661
as you said it would be.

428
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,763
Why would we come here?

429
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,433
Do you see that tiny man
in the aisle there?

430
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,569
That's Mr. Drogaris.

431
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,037
He owns the joint.

432
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,006
You notice anything
strange about him?

433
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,777
Just that he's obviously
wearing elevator shoes.

434
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,978
Is that it?

435
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,046
Exactly.

436
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,583
And it gives me an
opportunity to say to my dates

437
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:06,385
beware of Greeks wearing lifts.

438
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,789
I hope you won't say that to me.

439
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,123
I won't.

440
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,162
You, uh, like Chinese food?

441
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,998
And you know a place

442
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,834
with pretty mediocre
Chinese food,

443
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,470
but there's somebody there

444
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,905
or something that
gives you a chance

445
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,508
to get off what you
consider a bomoh.

446
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,711
Right.

447
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,080
How, um...
What's today?

448
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,515
Tuesday.

449
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,783
How about Thursday?

450
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,651
Uh, busy Thursday.

451
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:40,119
Friday?

452
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,522
Friday fine.

453
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,192
Mr. Drogaris?

454
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,830
<font color="#ffff80">PETE:</font> Um, thank you.
Thank you.

455
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,902
One of the most disappointing
evenings in years.

456
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,804
Something I said?

457
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,740
Something I didn't say?

458
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,242
The only reason we came here
is because of Chang.

459
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,078
He's my favorite waiter
in the whole world.

460
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,780
Every time he spills
a plate of food

461
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,482
or a bowl of soup
all over you

462
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,183
his look of
oriental resignation

463
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,919
is simply not to be missed.

464
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,587
I mean, it's a classic.

465
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,788
And tonight of all nights

466
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,057
he doesn't spill anything.

467
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,626
Chang, you're a disgrace

468
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,828
to Madame Lee's Hanging Gardens.

469
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,797
One thing puzzles me.

470
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:28,535
This place is called,
it says here, "Little P. King."

471
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,669
Why do you keep calling it

472
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,605
"Madame Lee's Hanging Gardens?"

473
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,842
Where, for heaven's sake,
are the hanging gardens?

474
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,477
On Madame Lee, of course.

475
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,586
Pay the check.

476
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,090
Well, I suppose you can
look at it at two ways.

477
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,825
I could say, "Well,
it's only been a week,"

478
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,193
or "For God's sake,"

479
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,530
"the whole week
and he hasn't called."

480
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,198
Now I don't know whether
I'm sorry or not.

481
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,300
Sometimes I think he's fun.

482
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,902

morning. Best to Bert, bye-bye.

- Fine.

You were-- were just passing by

494
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,969
and saw a light in the window.

495
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,571
You're line's been busy
for an hour.

496
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,207
- Oh, I was talking to Gertrude.
- I know, I called her.

497
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,710
Her line's busy too.
Have you had dinner?

498
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,678
- Yes.
- Good.

499
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:55,021
- What'd you have in mind?
- Oh...

500
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,224
Movie and then
a certain hamburger joint

501
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,894
that late at night takes
on a character all its own.

502
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,896
Would you like a drink first?

503
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,633
Oh, you've stocked up on liquor.

504
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,636
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call one bottle of Scotch

505
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,238
and one bottle of vodka
stocking up.

506
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,942
No, thanks, I'll-- I'll have
a beer with the burger later.

507
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:21,781
- Any particular movie?
- Just so it isn't a Western.

Look around you,
what do you see?

515
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,745
Another hamburger joint.
What do you see?

516
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,814
Look at all the couples
at all the tables.

517
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,349
Look at the way they're
all huddled together.

518
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,719
Isn't it plain as day
they've all come here

519
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,420
straight from the sack?

520
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:38,190
It's this way every night,

521
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,092
and it's what
makes my suggestion

522
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,428
to Bing over there
so brilliant.

523
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:47,399
Aren't you gonna ask me what
the brilliant suggestion is?

524
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,268

she didn't like being

556

nearly seven feet tall,

Here, let me have
your thinking cap.

1060
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,094
Six divided by three fourths.

1061
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,497
Six times three,
the numerator is 18

1062
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,399
divided by four,
the denominator,

1063
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,701
it's four and a half.

1064
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,369
Doesn't sound right to me.

1065
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:22,806
Well, thank you to show a
little respect for your father.

1066
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:26,143
I'm not sure, but I think
when you divide fractions

1067
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:29,179
you invert the denominator
and the numerator,

1068
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:33,450
so that six times four is 24,
divided by three is eight.

1069
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:34,718
How does that sound?

1070
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,853

01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:47,663
Always a little joke.

1360
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:51,000
Anything to hide
your true feelings.

1361
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:53,602
Let me tell you something
about true feelings.

1362
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:57,273
I've made quite a study
of true feelings.

1363
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:00,143
Most of them deserve
to be hidden.

1364

<font color="#ff8000">[FOOTSTEPS]</font>

1365
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,622
I suppose I should
be grateful you did

1366
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,425
deign to discuss it,
that's something.

1367
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,196
Anything disturbs you,
you keep it to yourself.

1368
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:22,198
Clam up.

1369
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:23,732
If something bothers me...

1370
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:26,335
I know, I know, it makes you
feel better to talk about it.

1371
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:28,504
Well, it makes me feel worse.

1372
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:36,479
God, how have we ever
stayed married for 11 years?

1373
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,747
Because I'd rather not
discuss things with you

1374
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:41,584
than with any other woman
in the world.

1375
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,323
I'm going to bed.

1376
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,792
You have my very best wishes.

1377
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:16,319
I just saw a film
of rare beauty

1378
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,154
on the late, late show.

1379
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:21,090
Tarzan was complaining
to his buddy the ape

1380
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:22,458
about his sex life...

1381
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,228
Tarzan's, not the ape's.

1382
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:27,263
Which reminds me,
we should be celebrating

1383
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:29,165
an anniversary pretty soon.

1384
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:31,234
It's been almost a year
since you and I--

1385
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:33,136
You're smashed.

1386
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:34,170
Possibly.

1387
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:39,408
I'll bet you've killed
conservatively half a bottle.

1388
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,477
How does one kill
conservatively?

1389
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,546
I can see killing madly,
angrily,

1390
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,849
indiscriminately, mechanically,
but conservatively?

1391
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,720
Goodnight, Pete.

1392
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,864
Expect I'll be home late again
tomorrow night.

1393
01:25:01,897 --> 01:25:04,300
Some reports
to rush out to some poop

1394
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,735
in South Jesus Idaho somewhere.

1395
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,705
Stay in town all night
if you want.

1396
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:13,609
I mean, I don't mind.

1397
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:17,813
Even if you've got somebody.

1398
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:21,817
You've gotta live, I know.

1399
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,252
I have no right to starve you

1400
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:25,688
just because I've
lost my appetite.

1401
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,527

Have you ever refused a request?

1419
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:25,548
I adore the limelight. Hmph.

1420
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:29,585
Well, anyway, I'm going to
the police department tomorrow

1421

1422
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:34,390
It's a state law or something.

1423
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:35,691
Certainly is.

1424
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:36,992
And you're not going
with Laura Colton,

1425
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,728
you're going
with Gertrude Wilson

1426
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:42,531
because among
the routine questions

1427
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:43,799
the police will ask you

age still unknown

1534
01:32:23,338 --> 01:32:26,742
is in the Bahamas
for a much needed vacation,

1535
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:29,745
and I'm here in this
so-called rest home

1536
01:32:29,778 --> 01:32:32,080
trying to pull myself together.

1537
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:34,883
And Pete...

1538
01:32:34,917 --> 01:32:37,019
Who knows where Pete is.

Come in.

1541
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,261
You have a visitor,
Mrs. Seltzer.

1542
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:50,633
Jimmy.

1543
01:32:55,103 --> 01:32:57,906
Oh, <font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font> must they
throw a pistachio at you

1544
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,174
at this hour of the day?

1545
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:01,343
Couldn't they wait
until evening? Heh.

1546
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,083
You smell better
than your flowers.

1547
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:11,219
My dear girl, I am going
to get you out of this

1548
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,055
if it takes a letter
to Washington.

1549

<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font>

1550
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:19,728
Well, ah, may I sit down
in one of your chairs?

1551
01:33:19,762 --> 01:33:22,931
Mm. From what mortician
were they rented?

1552
01:33:22,965 --> 01:33:24,266

01:33:25,701 --> 01:33:26,501
<font color="#ff8000">[SIGHS]</font>

1554
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:28,704
Last time I was
in a room like this

1555
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:31,640
was when I visited
an old aunt of mine in Chicago.

1556
01:33:31,674 --> 01:33:32,775
She was nearly 90 then.

1557
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:37,680
And it has long since been
torn down, but no matter.

1558
01:33:37,713 --> 01:33:40,816
<font color="#ff8000">[SIGHS]</font>
Well, pit.

1559
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:44,352
This is going to give
mental health a black eye.

1560
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:46,955
For a long time, I had two.

1561
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:48,223
It was all for nothing.

1562
01:33:48,256 --> 01:33:50,993
I never did find out
how old she was.

1563
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:52,695
Well, while she's
in the Bahamas

1564
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:55,130
I'm spreading the word
that she's 53.

1565
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:57,065
Let her straighten us out
when she gets back.

1566
01:33:57,099 --> 01:33:58,734
<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font>

1567
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,769
But to hell with Gertrude.

1568
01:34:00,803 --> 01:34:02,971
I wanna talk to you.

1569
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:05,974
You'll, um, forgive my prying,
darling,

1570
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:07,843
because I'm interested.

1571
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:11,714
But your marriage
is definitely over, isn't it?

1572
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:14,850
Or, um, se fini nes pah,

1573
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:17,019
to put it more elegantly.

1574
01:34:18,086 --> 01:34:20,088
I guess it is.

1575
01:34:20,122 --> 01:34:22,157
Right.

1576
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:26,294
Now, I shall proceed
to astonish myself.

1577
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:28,797
Why don't you take
a whack at it with me?

1578
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:30,766
Ah, you could do worse.

1579
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:32,968
Indeed you already have.

1580
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,871
I've never married.
Not for lack of opportunities.

1581
01:34:35,904 --> 01:34:39,875
I've had several propositions
in my time.

1582
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:42,177
Some of them from women.

1583
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:46,715
I'm healthy,
solvent and amusing.

1584
01:34:46,749 --> 01:34:48,183
I shall never beat you.

1585
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:50,819
I'm not that interested
in women.

1586
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:53,288
And I shall make you chic.

1587
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:55,958
I'll dress you
from head to foot.

1588
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:57,025
I'll do something
with your hair.

1589
01:34:57,059 --> 01:34:58,794
I'll make you over,

1590
01:34:58,827 --> 01:35:02,898
because you do
have possibilities.

1591
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,733
There'll never be a dull moment.

1592
01:35:04,767 --> 01:35:06,034
We'll see all the shows.

1593
01:35:06,068 --> 01:35:08,103
We'll travel abroad once a year

1594
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:10,305
always eating at least
as well as at home

1595
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:12,374
because flanking my cookbooks

1596
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:13,909
is a shelf full of eating guides

1597
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:15,243
beginning with the Michelin.

1598
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:18,113
Pete always called them
"Belly Baedekers."

1599
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:21,383
Please not while
I'm proposing.

1600
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:26,221
Well, you'll find
everything a woman can

1601
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:29,191
reasonably expect in this world.

1602
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:33,228
Food, shelter, clothing,

1603
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:36,832
and... a sort of a husband.

1604
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,902
Oh, my mother.

1605
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:42,437
I have a mother someplace.

1606
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,506
This will sum up
my mother for you.

1607
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:47,209
She'd vote for Ronald Reagan
for president

1608
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:49,511
because any man
who had both legs amputated,

1609
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:52,948
as he did in that movie
that keeps being reshown,

1610
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:55,317
and then went on to become
governor of California,

1611
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:57,452
deserves our admiration.

1612
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,454
We'll see her once a year.

1613
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:02,224
And we'll phone her
every Christmas Eve.

1614
01:36:03,859 --> 01:36:06,261
Well, I guess
that just about wraps it up.

1615
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:09,798
Done and done.

1616
01:36:09,832 --> 01:36:11,466
Goodbye for the present.

1617
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:14,002
Now, I must go
and prattle about us.

1618
01:36:14,036 --> 01:36:15,170
Jimmy.

1619
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:20,375
Could we make it our secret
for the time being?

1620
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:24,346
Of course, else what would
there be to prattle about?

1621
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:26,314
Don't breathe a word.

1622
01:36:26,348 --> 01:36:29,151
One busybody
in the family is enough.

1623
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,012
Hello, Mrs. Seltzer.

1624
01:36:57,045 --> 01:36:58,881
Hello, Pete, how are you?

1625
01:36:58,914 --> 01:37:01,549
What the hell are you
doing here in Disneyland?

1626
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:04,286
<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font>
I don't even know for sure.

1627
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:06,121
Are you keeping busy?

1628
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,589
How are things in town?

1629
01:37:07,622 --> 01:37:09,992
Well, you know,
San Francisco this time of year.

1630
01:37:10,025 --> 01:37:12,360
Crawling with Americans.

1631
01:37:12,394 --> 01:37:15,397
Why didn't you call a man?

1632
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,900
I looked in your room,
I noticed your bags were packed.

1633
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:19,267
Yeah, I'm leaving.

1634
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:22,570
I was just taking
a last little walk.

1635
01:37:22,604 --> 01:37:24,439
Listen, Tillie, we're
going to have to be strong.

1636
01:37:24,472 --> 01:37:26,508
We're going to have to face
the cold hard facts.

1637
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:29,477
This separation of ours,
it just isn't working out.

1638
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,079
I mean, my plumber tells me

1639
01:37:31,113 --> 01:37:34,116
that the pursuit of women
is flight from woman.

1640
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:35,350
What does that mean?

1641
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:38,020
What the hell do I know,
am I a plumber?

1642
01:37:38,053 --> 01:37:39,254
<font color="#ffff80">WOMAN:</font> Come on now, cool it.

1643
01:37:39,287 --> 01:37:41,456

1644
01:37:41,489 --> 01:37:42,657
Come on.

1645
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,092
Hey, kiddo, that's--

1646
01:37:44,126 --> 01:37:45,560
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

1647
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:47,495
Now, that was very rude of you!

1648
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,231
You mustn't run
in between people like that.

1649

You know,
this is the first time

1653
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,385
you've ever cried for Robbie.

1654
01:38:10,418 --> 01:38:13,221
<font color="#ff8000">[SNIFFLES]</font>
Not quite correct.

1655
01:38:13,255 --> 01:38:15,523
The first time
I've ever cried aloud.

1656
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,427
Oh, God, Pete.

1657
01:38:20,662 --> 01:38:22,497
When I think of all
the wonderful things

1658
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,500
you never said to me.

1659
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:28,103
You should've heard them anyway.

1660
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:29,504
Yeah.

1661
01:38:29,537 --> 01:38:33,241
I suppose there was
a lack in me somewhere.

1662
01:38:33,275 --> 01:38:34,977
<font color="#ff8000">[SIGHS]</font>

1663
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:38,546
When I think of all the times
I was so irritated with you...

1664
01:38:40,315 --> 01:38:42,550
and yet right now,

1665
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:45,988
I don't think I've ever
loved you more.

1666
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:49,524
Well, love without irritation
is just lust.

1667
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:53,228
Not that there's anything
particularly wrong with lust.

1668
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:54,596
<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font>

1669
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:58,400
I just realized
something about you, Pete.

1670
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,202
I tried for years
to put my finger

1671
01:39:00,235 --> 01:39:02,570
on what was wrong with you.

1672
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:05,473
What your faults were,
your flaws.

1673
01:39:07,175 --> 01:39:10,078
And now it's come to me.

1674
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:12,347
You have no faults at all.

1675
01:39:13,548 --> 01:39:15,717
You're just hopeless.

1676
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:21,023
Did you drive up?

1677
01:39:21,056 --> 01:39:22,724
Car is up front.

1678
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:25,460
Your bags and coat
are already in it.

1679
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:28,230
Oh.
<font color="#ff8000">[CHUCKLES]</font>

1680

What's so funny?

1681
01:39:29,397 --> 01:39:31,399
Oh, I was just thinking.

1682
01:39:31,433 --> 01:39:33,468
Thank God I have Pete Seltzer
to see me

1683
01:39:33,501 --> 01:39:36,504
through the disillusionments
of a marriage.

1684
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:40,408
