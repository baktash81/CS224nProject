2
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,843
And how are we today?

3
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,814
You feeling better?

4
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:17,586
Be good.

5
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,475
£16.83, please.

6
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,444
£32.28, please.

7
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:25,187
- Hi, Jan.
- Hi, Jan.

8
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,522
All right, Cath? Anne?

9
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:29,592
Mam?

10
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,562
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, love.

11
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,865
I just knelt down
to try and light the fire.

12
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,000
Couldn't get up again.

13
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:41,603
As I was here,
I thought I'd have a little sit down.

14
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,806
Oh! Quite comfy,
really.

15
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,140
She looked
a goner to me.

16
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,977
If I'd tried
to get her up,

17
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,979
I'd have ended up
on the floor myself.

18
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,949
So I said,
"Best get Jan."

19
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,686
And I said, "Don't bother her.
She'll be at Tesco's."

20
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,989
Co-op, Mam. I work at the Co-op.

21
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,024
And how many times have I told
you to leave the fire to me?

22
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,860
I hate for you to feel you
have to do everything for us.

23
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:07,563
Rubbish.
All she's got

24
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,865
is that useless lump, Brian,
to look after.

25
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,200
She hasn't even got
the pigeons anymore.

26
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:16,038
Besides, what's a daughter for if it's
not to look after her mam and dad?

27
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,326
I told you before, son, if you
lived closer I could do it

28
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,262
and you wouldn't need
to pay for a babysitter.

29
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,831
All right. Bye-bye.

30
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:48,202
State of my parents.

31
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:51,005
Dad calls,
said Mam's had a fall.

32
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,175
Dashed round
thinking she'd had a stroke.

33
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,712
- She all right?
- Yeah. She's just had another funny turn.

34
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:59,915
It'd be so much easier
if they moved in here with us.

35
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:02,817
We got the room now Dennis
and Sasha have flown the nest.

36
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,654
I know you and Dad under the same roof
might not be a bed of roses, but...

37
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,891
Didn't use a glove in my day.
It was just spit, rub and shove.

38
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:15,163
There was that time I lost
my watch up there, mind.

39
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:16,264
Brian?

40
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,734
I've won
the EuroMillions.

41
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,271
I'm having an affair
with John the post.

42
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,775
Absolutely bloody clueless.

43
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,377
- I'm leaving you, Brian.
- I've seen it all now.

44
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,913
What's for tea, love?

45
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,036
I nearly
crashed my car earlier.

46
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,672
Those wild ponies are down
off the mountain again.

47
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,207
Aye. Lured by chips
and curry sauce.

48
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,777
Cheer up, Gerwyn.
Might never happen.

49
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,415
You mean you paying your bar tab?
I'd already drawn that conclusion.

50
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,651
No more credit.

51
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,129
I'm telling you, boys.

52
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,698
Our horse, Sweet Gemma,
was in the race of her life.

53
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:25,834
And you know what gave her
the edge? Her good breeding.

54
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,703
Bona fide
thoroughbred she was.

55
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,805
Coming round the far
bend, she's still going well.

56
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,774
She's about four lengths
clear of the third horse.

57
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,276
I'm already running
down to the front.

58
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,178
And then I
lose sight of her.

59
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,881
I think she's gone down.
My horse has fallen.

60
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,783
And so I panic, and I'm fighting
my way down to the track.

61
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:45,086
And there she is, Sweet Gemma,
giving it everything she's got,

62
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,156
and she comes through
on the outside and wins!

63
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,093
- I duck under the rails...
- Totally illegal.

64
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,828
Totally illegal, and I run
across the track to congratulate her.

65
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,963
She was my horse,
and she won!

66
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,433
Haven't seen him
in here before.

67
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,002
You gotta dream big.

68
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,237
Howard Davies,
accountant-type.

69
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:04,173
Used to drink
up the Cross Keys.

70
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,709
Started coming in here
Thursdays after squash.

71
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,477
Owns a racehorse, does he?

72
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,247
Owned. Part of a syndicate.
Till it all went tits up.

73
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,183
- What happened?
- He doesn't like to talk about that bit.

74
00:07:15,216 --> 00:07:16,951
Oh, aye.

75
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:18,920
Word is, he almost
lost everything:

76
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:21,090
pile of cash,
house, missus.

77
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:23,125
Bitter's gone.

78
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,127
Who's having
one more? Before we go?

79
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:35,471
Six Stella, please.

80
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,745
- Howard, is it?
- That's right.

81
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,882
Owned a racehorse,
I gather?

82
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,252
Couldn't help overhearing.

83
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:52,421
- Must be an expensive business.
- What?

84
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,490
To buy one.

85
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,492
Well, let's see,

86
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:00,028
Sheikh Omari just shelled out
16 million for French Over,

87
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,163
winner of
the Welsh Grand National.

88
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:04,031
Mind you, that was dollars,
not pounds,

89
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:06,802
so it's more affordable
than you think.

90
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,036
Bring them over
can you, please? Thanks.

91
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,171
You've got arms,
haven't you?

92
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:23,185
Gerwyn said
to put it on my slate.

93
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:46,034
There's a spillage
in aisle six.

94
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:49,004
It looks like
chicken korma.

95
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,036
- What's for tea, love?
- Just starting on it now.

96
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:23,438
Hello.

97
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,485
You are not
gonna believe this.

98
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,519
The goat's
got ringworm.

99
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:43,057
And now this duck has got
bumblefoot like the others.

100
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,211
Here, this fella's making a complete
balls-up of castrating this alpaca.

101
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,014
It's a two-man job, see.

102
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,152
One to hold him down by the legs and
the other to nip off the squealers.

103
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,321
Could you turn that off?

104
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,631
I want you to help me
buy a mare.

105
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll never learn to ride
at your age.

106
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,069
I'm going to breed
a racehorse.

107
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:30,604
Aye, and I'm gonna play fly-half
for Wales next Saturday.

108
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:33,307
I bred budgies,
rabbits, whippets.

109
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,977
Won prizes, didn't I?
And pigeons.

110
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,312
First woman to win the
Welsh Open back in the day.

111
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:40,315
Then let's get you another pigeon.
Or two even.

112
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:44,185
I'm breeding a racehorse.
I've done my research.

113
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,620
A lot more to learn,
I'm sure.

114
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,288
But there's this fella
that comes in the club.

115
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:51,259
- What fella?
- Howard. Bit arrogant.

116
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,428
But he's an expert,
and I'm hoping he'll help.

117
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:57,265
It's absolute madness.

118
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,002
I mean, to even think
of breeding a racehorse,

119
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:02,770
you're gonna need to buy
a thoroughbred mare.

120
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,038
Where you gonna get
one of those?

121
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:11,713
"Retired pedigree racehorse
for brood mare."

122
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,314
£300?

123
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:16,585
Oh, Jan, man.

124
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,125
£300.

125
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,194
Could have gone
to Benidorm for that.

126
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:30,598
- Top racehorse, she was.
- No, she wasn't. I checked.

127
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,466
But she got good ancestry,
though.

128
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,302
And her father's father's
father, what a stallion.

129
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,272
His semen has gone
all over the world.

130
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,510
You're lovely.
Yes, you are.

131
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,581
Where the bloody hell
are we gonna keep her?

132
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:53,021
What the hell is that?

133
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,568
Oi.

134
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,404
I hope you got planning
permission for that, Daisy.

135
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,607
Sod off, Maldwyn.

136
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,275
According to
council regulations,

137
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,776
a wooden outbuilding
should not exceed

138
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,579
a maximum eaves height
of 2.5 meters.

139
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:23,217
Oh, what's that racket?

140
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:27,655
I hope it's got
its emissions certificate.

141
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,530
No business bringing a
vehicle that size down here.

142
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,370
Thanks for the help, Goose.

143
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,406
You're lucky the box
was available, Jan.

144
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:48,443
Been using it all winter to store Hoovers.
All totally legit, mind.

145
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,614
Hello.

146
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,217
Hello.

147
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:00,754
All right.

148
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,292
Come on, Rewbell.
Come on.

149
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,796
Come on, Rewbell.

150
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:09,564
Come on, Rewbell.

151
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:11,332
Come on.

152
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,302
- Come on, lovely.
- Here, let me.

153
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,872
How many animals
do they think they need?

154
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:19,907
Hope they're
gonna clean up after it.

155
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,277
Don't worry about
this bloody circus.

156
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:23,744
They can't
get the bloody thing out.

157
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:26,247
What about one of these?

158
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,650
You like that?

159
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:31,819
Wanna come down, yeah?
Down we go.

160
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:41,362
Yeah.

161
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:45,300
All right.

162
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:47,334
Good girl.
Come on. Come on.

163
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:48,937
There you are.

164
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,605
Not much,
but it's home.

165
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,848
All right,
two pints, please.

166
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,620
So... made a start,
haven't I?

167
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,389
Sorry?

168
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:10,591
Rewbell, she's called.

169
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,693
Found it working
on the beach

170
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:15,429
with the other donkeys
down Barry Island.

171
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:17,932
Keeping it on the bloody
allotment, I heard.

172
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:20,268
You mean, you've actually gone
and bought a mare?

173
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,804
Gotta find
the right stallion now.

174
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:25,240
Seen a couple
I like the look of.

175
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,676
Yeah?

176
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,910
You got the ten grand
for the stud fees, have you?

177
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:33,280
Vet's charges,
stabling, insurance?

178
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,350
And that's all before it starts racing.
If it ever does.

179
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:37,952
But I read up about it.

180
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:39,955
There's ways of doing these
things, isn't there?

181
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,556
We set up a syndicate.

182
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,325
'Cause if, say,
20 people in the village

183
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:45,259
put in a tenner a week
for two years.

184
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:47,596
I mean, I know
it's complicated, but...

185
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:50,498
Yeah, it is.
But most people in the village

186
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,367
haven't got two beans
to rub together.

187
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,271
It's normally wealthy, professional
men who go in for this kind of thing.

188
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,408
Bring them over,
would you?

189
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,510
I wasn't asking for
your help, anyway.

190
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:12,287
<i>♪ Sounds good ♪</i>

191
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:23,897

192

<i>♪ That I'm hurt deep inside ♪</i>

196
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,451
Right.
And that's what I'm doing.

197
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:45,954
I'm going to kick you out.

198
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:52,293

200
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:59,400
Don't judge me, Jan.
They're my only solace.

201
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,535
Have a look at that.

00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:04,505
<i>♪ When I dream, it's of you ♪</i>

203
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,841
What do you think?

204
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,809
Sorry, Jan,
no call for it these days.

205
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:11,946
Not since that scandal
with the lasagna.

206
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,481
Happily take those geese
off your hands, mind.

207
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,684
Dead or alive.

00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:20,488

211
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,835
The tax compliance
framework for Sinclair Beatty.

212
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,436
Need that done by 3:00.

213
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,085
And I need this one done
by lunchtime.

214
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:38,667
It's that fella
from the club.

215
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:43,137
All right.

216
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:50,112
I, uh... I thought maybe I
was a bit hasty in the club.

217
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,880
Lucky I've got
thick skin, then.

218
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,019
This is Brian.

219
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,054
But you can
call me Daisy.

220
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:01,690
Oh.

221
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:45,900
Just as I thought. Having to beat
them back at the door, are you?

222
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,701
Very funny, Gerwyn.

223
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,471
Well, Jan, no one can say
you didn't try, love.

224
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,040
One more minute, Brian.

225
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,644
Your missus know
you're doing this, Howard?

226
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:59,780
No danger of losing your house
with this non-starter.

227
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:05,887
Oh.

228
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,692
Evening, all. Gerwyn.

229
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,664
I'm fully briefed and ready to
assess the viability of this venture.

230
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:25,506
Maureen!
Glad you could make it.

231
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,641
Nothing on the telly.

232
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,041
I just gotta say,

233
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:31,913
I know absolutely sod all
about racehorses.

234
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:35,215
That's all right, Maureen.
I've done the research for all of us.

235
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:39,086
- Well, well.
- Hi, Goose.

236
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,154
- All right.
- Have a seat.

237
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:42,590
- Goose, is it?
- Yeah.

238
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,892
- Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

239
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:46,059
- Goose.
- Maldwyn.

240
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,197
I'd have been in sooner,
only I had to de-gunge the mincer.

241
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,500
You can't mix your meats.

242
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,935
Take a seat, Nerys.

243
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:57,038
Sorry, Howard.
Got totally lost, mate.

244
00:20:57,672 --> 00:20:59,039
Hello. Peter.

245
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,642
Daisy.

246
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,676
Bloody satnav tried to
send us into the lake.

247
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,578
Oh, they will do that, yes.

248
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:06,714
Peter and Gordon,
mates from work.

249
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:08,750
And this is Kev,
he's my neighbor.

250
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:11,685
Right.
Welcome, everyone.

251
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,988
Let's crack on.

252
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:14,556
Ha!

253
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,892
God's sake.

254
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:19,993
If you lot are good enough
to own a bloody racehorse,

255
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:21,263
so am I.

256
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:25,933
- It's a tenner every week, Kerby, you pillock.
- Oh.

257
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,970
So...
the purpose of this meeting...

258
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:32,006
Brian, have you got 50p?

259
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,807
Where's the
organization in this place?

260
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,175
There you go, love.

261
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,077
No one touch my tenner.

262
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,281
- Oh, yes.
- There you go. Bob's your uncle.

263
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:44,852
Not sure
I understood that last point.

264
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:49,089
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I still
don't quite understand.

265
00:21:49,123 --> 00:21:53,961
Jan is the owner
of the mother, yes?

266
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:57,864
When the foal is born,
then everyone will be the owners.

267
00:21:57,897 --> 00:21:59,600
We'll all have
an equal share.

268
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,636
So, who would take
the critical decisions?

269
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,238
Which critical decisions?

270
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,009
The horse's diet, for example.
Look here.

271
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,913
"Racehorses should be given a
high-energy feed rich in nutrients.

272
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:17,150
Excess consumption of grass may
lead to colic and flatulence."

273
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,319
We'll have enough of that with Kerby.

274
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:24,192
But this foal doesn't exist yet.
So who's the daddy?

275
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:26,793
Bien Bien, he's called.
American.

276
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:31,298
Ten year old, won 2.3 million
dollars before he retired.

277
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:33,801
They wanted three grand stud fee,
but I knocked them right down.

278
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,037
- Which we will pay.
- Gonna rob a bank, are you, Daisy?

279
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:39,139
Which we will pay
out of our retirement fund,

280
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:42,009
until the syndicate is up and
running and can reimburse us.

281
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:44,244
One thing
I must stress, above all else.

282
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:47,649
If you do join, don't do it
expecting to make money.

283
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:52,252
There's a less than one percent chance
this horse will ever win a race.

284
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:56,758
So, do it for the "hwyl."
That's what this is all about.

285
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,226
You mean like,
the "craic"?

286
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:02,730
With respect, the "hwyl" is
not the same as the "craic."

287
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:04,365
The "craic"
is a Gaelic term,

288
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:07,067
whereas the "hwyl" comes
from the Brythonic branch

289
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:09,804
of the Celtic languages
and means "a feeling

290
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,807
of emotional motivation
and energy."

291
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,276
Right.

292
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:17,444
I'll do it
for the "hwyl."

293
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:18,913
Of course I will.

294
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,962
Yeah, go on.
We'll both do it for the...

295
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,400
- What's it called again?
- The "hwyl."

296
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,336
English.

297
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:42,871
Yeah.

298
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:45,405
In.

299
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,841
- Yes.
- Yeah, me too.

300
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:48,942
In.

301
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:51,311
Gerwyn?

302
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:53,248
Well...

303
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:56,750
if there's gonna be
a circus in town,

304
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:58,820
may as well have
a ringside seat.

305
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:39,728
Mrs. Vokes?

306
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,067
- I'm James.
- Sorry we're late.

307
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:47,534
Oh, that's all right.
This won't take long.

308
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,002
Bien Bien
doesn't mess about.

309
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:51,740
Oh, God,
he's handsome, though.

310
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:56,176
And this is Rewbell.

311
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,047
I'm not gonna lie. One of us has
left a present in the corner.

312
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,448
Come on then, girl.

313
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:03,518
What do you think?

314
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,354
Here we go. Yeah.

315
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:12,894
Well, Bien Bien is known to
upgrade his mares.

316
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:21,468
- Go get him, girl.
- Brian.

317
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,807
We should have watched.

318
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:29,409
Would you like
to be watched?

319
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,212
I'm not a stallion.

320
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,783
You can
say that again.

321
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:38,218
I've had my moments,
haven't I?

322
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:45,992
Still, having a bit of fun
now, aren't we?

323
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,863
Never knew how much I missed
messing about with horses.

324
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:55,202
It's more than "a bit of fun"
and "messing about," Brian.

325
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,538
Yeah.

326
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,906
What do you mean?

327
00:26:00,207 --> 00:26:01,476
I don't know. I mean...

328
00:26:05,645 --> 00:26:11,249
I need something to look forward
to when I get up in the morning.

329
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:16,256
To remind me
that things can... change.

330
00:26:21,228 --> 00:26:22,596
That was good cover!

331
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,067
I hope he bought her
a drink first!

332
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,251
What are you
looking at?

333
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:52,159
What do you want,
then? Eh?

334
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,261
What do you want?

335
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:57,098
Oh, I know.

336
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:59,934
I know. It's my mints
you're after, isn't it?

337
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,503
Eh? You only want me
for my mints.

338
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,404
Brian?

339
00:27:38,204 --> 00:27:39,973
Oh, my God. I said!

340
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,076
Didn't I say it'd be
this week? I'm on my way.

341
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:44,544
Jan.

342
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:45,980
Jan, can I have
a word?

343
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:49,516
Jan!

344
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,075
Hello.

345
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,551
Oh, God, he's gorgeous,
isn't he?

346
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,592
Hello.

347
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,234
Where's Rewbell?

348
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,073
We've lost her, love.

349
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:49,509
I come down first thing
and the foal had been born.

350
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:53,447
There he was,
bright as a button.

351
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,616
But I could see straightaway
that Rewbell wasn't right.

352
00:28:58,117 --> 00:28:59,619
So I called Ron and...

353
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,161
There was nothing we could do,
was there, Ron?

354
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,292
Lovely, isn't he?

355
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:42,463
Maureen. Goose.

356
00:29:50,104 --> 00:29:52,338
Aw.

357
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:55,375
I wasn't sure we should
carry on after Rewbell.

358
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,378
Poor old girl.

359
00:29:57,411 --> 00:30:00,614
But look at him.
He's a real fighter.

360
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,515
Will you look at that.

361
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:04,285
What about Foal Throttle?

362
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:06,586
- Butcher's Boy.
- Daisy Chain.

363
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,154
- Lost Youth.
- Colt Leader.

364
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:10,091
- Don't Tell The Missus.
- Welsh Wind!

365
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,358
Kerby's the expert
on Welsh wind.

366
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:15,062
What about Colin?

367
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,132
After Colin Jackson.

368
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:21,735
I used to love seeing him
fly over those hurdles.

369
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:25,239
What about Dream Alliance?

370
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,609
It's our dream
and we're all in it together,

371
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:32,212
like an alliance,
so Dream Alliance.

372
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,482
- Very good.
- I like that, Jan. That's good.

373
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:35,650
Nah.

374
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:37,684
Let's have a vote.

375
00:30:37,718 --> 00:30:40,388
"Cefn Rocket,"
three votes.

376
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:45,225
- "Kerby," one vote.
- Worth a shot.

377
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,128
"Dream Alliance," 12 votes.

378
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,529
Hey!

379
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:51,832
So, I am completely chuffed
to the bollocks

380
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:55,301
to announce the winner
is Dream Alliance!

381
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,171
Dream Alliance!

382
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,907
- Dream Alliance!
- Dream Alliance!

383
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:03,810
- Go on, Dream.
- Go on, Dreamy boy.

384
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:08,816
So, you got a name.

385
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,652
Dream Alliance.
What do you think?

386
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,163
One time when I was a girl,

387
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:26,699
Dad and me took Sammy and Murphy,
our whippets, to a dog show in Pontypridd.

388
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:31,404
Didn't think we had a hope in hell,
us nobodies from the back of beyond.

389
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:33,908
But we got first
and second prize.

390
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,848
Dad was so proud of me.

391
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:47,922
Took me for a milk shake at
Gambarini's café after to celebrate.

392
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:58,766
Mmm. Seemed like anything
was possible.

414
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,857
This driveway's
longer than our high street.

415
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,694
Are you sure
about this, love?

416
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:09,028
Philip Hobbs is the
best trainer in the country.

417
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:10,764
This is where
Dream should be.

418
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,447
Hello?

419
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,416
Well, you've missed the turning.
It's a mile back down the road.

420
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:32,885
No, mate, no. I've come about
the position of trainee jockey.

421
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,389
- Pardon?
- We've made an appointment with Mr. Hobbs.

422
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,892
Uh... I'm afraid the
guv'nor's with an owner.

423
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:42,496
- Let's get him out, Brian.
- Aye.

424
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,369
- Guv'nor?
- Excuse me.

425
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:52,806
They say they've
got an appointment?

426
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,607
I'm afraid I know
nothing about this.

427
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,945
Howard arranged an appointment
with your office.

428
00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:02,782
- Who's Howard?
- Howard Davies. Helps me run our syndicate.

429
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:07,087
Come on, then, boy.
Come on, let's show them.

430
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:10,791
This is our boy.
Dream Alliance.

431
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:13,527
You've actually brought
the horse with you?

432
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,429
I'm sorry. I'm busy right now.
If an appointment was made,

433
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:18,632
it would have only been
for a preliminary chat

434
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:22,402
so you could view the facilities
and discuss our charges.

435
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,506
I know about your charges and I'm
sorry we didn't come in a helicopter.

436
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:27,674
We'll take
our custom elsewhere.

437
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:28,742
Brian.

438
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:33,447
Come on, boy.
Back to the valleys for us.

439
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,958
Look, you've obviously
come a long way.

440
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:48,695
Johnson, get the horse saddled
up and put him in the arena.

441
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:51,065
I'll give you
an honest opinion.

442
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:53,867
Brian.

443
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:56,936
- What?
- Get him out.

444
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:00,974
Come on, boy. Come on.

445
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:10,050
Whoa.

446
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,785
Whoa.

447
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:14,488
Eh, eh.

448
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:17,124
Calm. Come on, boy.
Come on. Come on.

449
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,961
Come on. Come on.

450
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:23,630
With a bit of work...

451
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:27,534
be worth giving him a crack at
your local gymkhana. Good luck.

452
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,639
Come on. Walk on.

453
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,875
He's not having it, Jan.

454
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,478
Come on, boy.
Walk on. Come on.

455
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:39,045
Come on, lad.

456
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:42,849
Come on.
Ooh! Whoa.

457
00:36:42,882 --> 00:36:44,851
Come on. Come on, boy.
Walk on.

458
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:46,854
Come on. That's it.
Come on.

459
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:49,989
Come on. Good boy.

460
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:51,225
Good boy.

461
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,740
Guv'nor?

462
00:37:37,637 --> 00:37:39,039
Well?

463
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:41,175
He's pretty rough
around the edges...

464
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,278
but he's definitely got
something about him.

465
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,546
It's...

466
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,181
spirit.

467
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:49,782
Character.

468
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:50,850
Like his owners.

469
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:04,999
We'll take him for a couple
of months, see what we can do.

470
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:10,003
- No promises.
- Thank you. That's all I wanted.

471
00:38:10,036 --> 00:38:14,875
Johnson will sort you out with a
stable and we'll go from there.

472
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,954
I'll miss you, Dream.

473
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:31,891
I'll be thinking of you
every day.

474
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,063
This is what
you were born to do.

475
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:40,900
Be brave and brilliant.

476
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,383
Okay.

477
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,985
Walk on.

478
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:46,099
Hello?

479
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:48,268
Any news
about your pony, love?

480
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,369
Racehorse, Mam.

481
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:52,039
- No, nothing.
- Oh, thank you.

482
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:55,375
Howard calls occasionally and all they
say is they're still assessing him.

483
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,243
A horse
raised on an allotment

484
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,945
has got a cat in hell's chance
of ever racing.

485
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:02,948
Howard says while they've still got
him, there's hope.

486
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:08,221
Brian had a horse once, didn't he?
Lovely big teeth it had.

487
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:12,858
Now, he hasn't got
the horse, or the teeth.

488
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:15,061
- Let me, Brian. You get off home.
- It's damp.

489
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:24,070
Well, a fat
lot of use he was.

490
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:26,872
He can't help
his arthritis.

491
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:31,445
He could have helped getting our Janet
in the family way when she was only 17.

492
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:42,056
It's been 30 years, Dad.
Can you just leave it, now?

493
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:52,865
Hello?

494
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:55,001
We're going to the races.

495
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,003
- What?
- <i>Philip Hobbs just e-mailed us.</i>

496
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:00,873
But he's gonna put Dream in
a bumper race for beginners.

497
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:02,742
Oh, my God,
he's gonna race?

498
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:04,411
Our horse is gonna race!

499
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:07,080
Whoo!

500
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,351
Right, I'm off!

501
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:13,954
Was Davina okay with you
taking the day off?

502
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,490
Oh, yeah. Not to worry, love.
All taken care of.

503
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:18,892
How come you're leaving
so early, anyway?

504
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:20,961
Chepstow's not that far.

505
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:23,463
Well, Kev and I just wanted
to make a real day of it.

506
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:24,998
You know,
savor the atmosphere.

507
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,266
Have a couple of bevvies
and a bar snack.

508
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,935
Ta, love.

509
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:37,043
You still haven't told Angela
about all this?

510
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:39,146
You know,
I'll let her know in time.

511
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,349
She'll be absolutely fine
with it.

515
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:26,560
<i>♪ We're off
To see our horse race ♪</i>

516
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:28,928
<i>♪ We're off to see
Our horse race ♪</i>

517
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:52,284
- Here he comes!
- Fine figure of a man.

518
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:54,086
Ooh...

519
00:42:56,422 --> 00:42:57,990
Slept in, did we, Kerby?

520
00:42:58,023 --> 00:42:59,393
No, no.
You're not sitting here.

521
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,961
Your flies are undone.

522
00:43:01,994 --> 00:43:04,297
The cage may be open,
but the beast is asleep.

523
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:06,365
Room for two more?

524
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,307
- Oh, the dynamic duo.
- We are off to the races!

525
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,949
- Oggy, oggy, oggy!
- Oi, oi, oi!

526
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:24,985
Oh, I haven't been
so excited

527
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:28,188
since Wales beat England
that day at Wembley!

528
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:30,657
Shat on them, we did!

529
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:34,595
Whoo!

530
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,565
Here we go, here we go!

531
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,936
What a sight.
The jockeys are so small.

532
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:46,338
Come on, everyone.
Owners' and trainers' bar, here we come.

533
00:43:59,152 --> 00:44:00,920
I suppose
we should put a bet on.

534
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:03,556
Yeah, 10-to-1
Kerby gets drunk.

535
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:05,659
Do you know how to make
a small fortune out of horses?

536
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:07,159
Start with a large fortune.

537
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:09,262
Sorry, sir.
Owners only.

538
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:12,465
I am a bloody owner.

539
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:15,135
- May I look in your bag?
- You haven't asked to look in their bags.

540
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:17,037
You can't bring alcohol
onto the course.

541
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,673
Who says I've got alcohol?
Cheese sandwiches, that's all.

542
00:44:19,706 --> 00:44:21,441
He's gonna
get us all chucked out.

543
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:25,278
All right, then.

544
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,949
- Bloody knew it.
- Come on, mate.

545
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:32,418
Look out.
Welsh champagne.

546
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:34,054
Be here all day.

547
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:35,422
You'll be pissing
like a racehorse.

548
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:36,722
Come on.

549
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:40,126
Never mind him. Come on.

550
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:44,129
Classy in here,
ain't it? Nice soft lighting.

551
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:45,998
All the big knobs are in here.

552
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:49,702
I seem to have
misplaced mine.

553
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:53,005
Strictly no admission into the
owners' enclosure without a pass.

554
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:56,542
Ooh, finger food, is it?

555
00:44:57,275 --> 00:44:58,610
- Some for later?
- Brian.

556
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,446
They're free, love.

557
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,182
Oh, here he is.

558
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:05,052
Had to get Philip Hobbs
to vouch for me, didn't I?

559
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:07,753
How about this, eh?

560
00:45:07,786 --> 00:45:11,156
Do you think that Clare Balding
off the telly will be here?

561
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,193
38 quid,
the cheeky buggers!

562
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:14,760
- Ooh.
- That'd buy a drink

563
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:17,063
for the whole
bloody room in my club.

564
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:20,333
Look, look, look.
It's Lord Avery.

565
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:24,070
He owns White Knight and Conquering Hero.
And most of Oxfordshire.

566
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:25,505
Pals, are we?

567
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:28,507
We're Lord Snooty's
bloody equal today.

568
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,745
- Oh, look out. He's off again.
- Ooh...

569
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,312
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

570
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:36,215
We have now, butt.
Tempt you to a can?

571
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:38,451
It's nice to share a drink
with a fellow owner, isn't it?

572
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:39,686
Ah, you're an owner.

573
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,588
How many?

574
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:44,224
Well, there's
about 20 of us.

575
00:45:44,257 --> 00:45:45,358
All right!

576
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:50,096
I mean, how many horses
do you own?

577
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:53,799
- Just the one.
- Excellent. Enjoy it.

578
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,468
A little tip
before the race.

579
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:57,303
Ah, go on.

580
00:45:57,335 --> 00:45:58,637
If you're using the gents,

581
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,706
give the first cubicle
a few minutes.

582
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:02,608
<i>And
the horses for the bumper race</i>

583
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:04,376
<i>are making their way
to the paddock.</i>

584
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:05,744
- Here we go.
- We're up next.

585
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:07,379
- Everyone got your bets on?
- Yeah.

586
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:09,349
Wait. We must have a toast.

587
00:46:09,382 --> 00:46:10,416
That's right.

588
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:13,219
To us.

589
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:15,121
To us.

590
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:16,523
To Dream.

591
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,257
To Dream.

592
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:21,494
Come on.

593
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:23,496
<i>We're
moving on here at Chepstow.</i>

594
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:25,498
<i>The conditions are good,
so we should have</i>

595
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,134
<i>quite a tussle
in this race for beginners.</i>

596
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:31,503
<i>Jockeys are mounting and they're
making their way down to the start.</i>

597
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:34,139
So, he's there. He's up on
the big screen. There he is.

598
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:35,741
Oh, look, there he is.

599
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,345
<i>They're all on the racecourse
and should be good to go.</i>

600
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:42,548
<i>Horses are circling
at the starting line.</i>

601
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:45,585
<i>Number six, Inarco,
in the purple and orange.</i>

602
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:48,153
<i>Dream Alliance, number three,
in the red and white.</i>

603
00:46:48,186 --> 00:46:51,223
<i>And Forgive Me Mary,
an impressive winner at Kelso.</i>

604
00:46:51,257 --> 00:46:54,693
<i>A bit reluctant to join the others
at this stage is Dream Alliance.</i>

605
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:57,362
<i>He's become a bit playful
down at the start.</i>

606
00:46:57,396 --> 00:46:58,532
Oh, God.

607
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,869
<i>Tapes are across.
Starter's getting up there.</i>

608
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:07,206
<i>Perhaps they'll have to
go around again and walk in.</i>

609
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:08,640
<i>Hopefully with Dream Alliance.</i>

610
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:10,610
He doesn't look happy.

611
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:12,579
His first race.
Bound to be a bit edgy.

612
00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:16,148
Edgy? He's facing
the wrong way.

613
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:18,550
<i>Let's see if he settles down.</i>

614
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:21,487
If he keeps going in that direction,
he'll end up back in the village.

615
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:24,289
- <i>They are under orders.</i>
- Turn around, boy.

616
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:26,225
<i>Dream Alliance still having
a bit of bother.</i>

617
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:27,760
- <i>Will he let them go?</i>
- Turn him around!

618
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:29,463
Turn him around!

619
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:34,400
He's at the back! Look!

620
00:47:34,432 --> 00:47:35,501
He can't let them go, can he?

621
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,805
Turn around. Come on.

622
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:40,640
Turn around, man!
They've all gone!

623
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:42,174
He'll be in front

624
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,610
if he waits for
the next race to start.

625
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,512
Come on!

626
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:48,213
<i>It's a disastrous start
for Dream Alliance.</i>

627
00:47:48,246 --> 00:47:50,149
<i>He's about ten lengths
behind the pack.</i>

628
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:51,784
I hope you're gonna
give us a refund, Jan.

629
00:47:57,389 --> 00:47:59,158
Come on, Dream, boy.

630
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:02,661
- Come on.
- He's miles behind the others.

631
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:04,664
<i>Then on the inside,
Forgive Me Mary.</i>

632
00:48:04,697 --> 00:48:07,367
<i>And still trailing by six,
possibly eight lengths,</i>

633
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,402
<i>is Dream Alliance looking very
green at the back of the pack.</i>

634
00:48:09,434 --> 00:48:10,603
Even Daisy could run faster.

635
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:12,172
It was fun
while it lasted.

636
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:13,438
Come on, Dreamy boy,
you can do it.

637
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:15,242
Mate, what a waste of money!

638
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:19,379
<i>Inarco and Forgive Me Mary
in the middle of the field.</i>

639
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:42,601
Look at him now.
He's found the accelerator.

640
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:44,738
<i>Clawing back some ground
is Dream Alliance.</i>

641
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:47,773
He's our boy!

642
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:57,183
Come on, lad.
Come on, my boy.

643
00:49:02,487 --> 00:49:04,723
He's coming! He's coming!

644
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,231
<i>Dream Alliance pushes forward.
And he's on Inarco's heels now.</i>

645
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:18,237
<i>And as Cornell goes for broke,
Penelope Star in second.</i>

646
00:49:18,271 --> 00:49:19,806
<i>Inarco slips back.</i>

647
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,608
Go on, Dream.

648
00:49:22,641 --> 00:49:24,910
<i>Dream Alliance battles
his way into fourth.</i>

649
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:26,378
Go on, Dream!

650
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:27,646
Come on, Dream!

651
00:49:29,748 --> 00:49:31,583
<i>Dream Alliance
making a real challenge</i>

652
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:33,519
<i>to get amongst
the top three.</i>

653
00:49:33,552 --> 00:49:34,653
Come on!

654
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:36,422
<i>Cornell takes it,</i>

655
00:49:36,454 --> 00:49:37,690
<i>second Penelope Star.</i>

656
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:39,826
<i>High And Clear in third.</i>

657
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:42,761
<i>And Dream Alliance coming in
a strong fourth place.</i>

658
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,898
Fourth! Fourth! Fourth!

659
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,634
I had him down for fourth!

660
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:55,575
Yes! I won 20 quid!

661
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:57,644
No bloody chips!

662
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:02,414
Well done, my boy.

663
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:05,050
Your mam would have been
so proud of you.

673
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,942
Hi, love. How's things?

674
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:10,416
Angela?

675
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:19,025
You promised me you'd never,
ever even think of doing it again.

676
00:51:19,057 --> 00:51:22,461
You can't possibly have forgotten
what it was like last time.

677
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,599
Coming this close
to losing the house.

678
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:33,573
Having to raid the kids' uni fund
to pay off the mortgage arrears.

679
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:35,975
All for some bloody horse.

680
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:40,946
And worst of all,
you've lied to me, Howard.

681
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,882
I know.
I shouldn't have lied.

682
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:46,085
I swore I'd leave you if you
ever got into another syndicate.

683
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:50,422
And I've learnt my lesson,
and this won't get out of hand, I promise.

684
00:51:50,456 --> 00:51:52,959
I'm gonna have those words
written on your bloody gravestone.

685
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:54,994
It's completely different
this time.

686
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:57,063
There's a few of us just
chipping in a tenner a week

687
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:59,498
to have a bit of fun.
That's all it is.

688
00:52:04,202 --> 00:52:08,375
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

689
00:52:09,074 --> 00:52:10,576
This family.

690
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:12,878
Well, you have to make
your own choices.

691
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:15,381
But I don't want
anything to do with it.

692
00:52:16,748 --> 00:52:20,386
And if you dare jeopardize
what we've got again...

693
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,224
And that was when I pinched
Dai Fats' prized cock!

694
00:52:59,257 --> 00:53:01,693
Have a look at this!

695
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:04,596
We made
the front page of the <i>Argus!</i>

696
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,900
Must be building a
tidy balance in the bank now.

697
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:11,503
Aye, all that prize money, but no
mention of when we'll see any of it.

698
00:53:11,536 --> 00:53:15,607
You must be a witch, Jan Vokes.
Gotta be some reason you got so lucky.

699
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:18,778
We'll win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, one day.
I swear we will.

700
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,615
Come on.
Let's go play some dominos.

701
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:24,851
No, let's have
a game of darts.

702
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,802
Hello, gorgeous.
How are you doing?

703
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:50,776
Oh.

704
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:52,245
You're looking lovely.

705
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:58,851
The other day at work I spent two
hours stacking tinned sweet corn.

706
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:03,155
And all I could
think about was...

707
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,159
Well...

708
00:54:09,827 --> 00:54:11,530
All my life...

709
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,899
I've never been me.

710
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,036
I've been Elsie's daughter,

711
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,039
Dennis and Sasha's mother...

712
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:23,008
or Daisy's wife.

713
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:27,914
But watching you race...

714
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:30,717
I'm Jan.

715
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:35,121
Mrs. Vokes.

716
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:37,923
Don't wanna disturb you.

717
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:41,726
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what? He's your horse.

718
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,732
Anyway, glad you dropped by.
Got some news for you.

719
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,601
Really? Newbury?

720
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:59,010
- Where's the owners' bar, then?
- There, boy.

721
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:01,580
My God, Howard.

722
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:04,550
You weren't wrong.
This really is something else.

723
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:12,358
Have any of you spotted Clare Balding?
She must be around somewhere.

724
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,061
- There's a rumor Mick Jagger's here.
- Ooh.

725
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,329
Not that I'm
bothered, mind.

726
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:17,863
I suppose
you're used to this,

727
00:55:17,896 --> 00:55:19,865
hanging out
with the big knobs.

728
00:55:19,898 --> 00:55:22,602
- How do you mean?
- That's what you do all day, isn't it?

729
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:25,972
Telling them rich buggers
how they can avoid paying tax.

730
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:27,974
Bit more complicated
than that, Kerby.

731
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:31,077
I call it legalized
robbery, myself.

732
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:36,816
I've just had a pee next to
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

733
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:41,754
I told him I thought <i>Evita</i> was a far
superior work to <i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

734
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:43,722
Right, so look here.

735
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,692
Dream's still way out
at 16-to-1.

736
00:55:46,724 --> 00:55:50,028
Fearless Pursuit is massive odds-on.
He's one of His Lordship's horses.

737
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:52,931
He's won the last
nine out of ten races.

738
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:56,068
This time he really is
up against the big boys.

739
00:55:58,003 --> 00:56:00,740
And she bred the damn horse
on an allotment!

740
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:02,141
An allotment!

741
00:56:04,009 --> 00:56:06,144
<i>It's almost time
for the main event here</i>

742
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:07,846
<i>at Newbury Festival,</i>

743
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,282
<i>the King Edward Challenge
over two miles.</i>

744
00:56:10,315 --> 00:56:13,786
<i>Lord Avery's horse, Fearless
Pursuit, is the bookies' favorite,</i>

745
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,755
<i>hoping for
yet another victory.</i>

746
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:17,923
<i>He's shaping up to be
a true legend of the track.</i>

747
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:21,661
- You all right, girl?
- It's a big race, Brian.

748
00:56:21,693 --> 00:56:26,065
Hurdles and everything. He's never
done that on a course this size.

749
00:56:28,266 --> 00:56:32,437
<i>Out next is My Heaven, in the light
blue, followed by reigning champion,</i>

750
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:35,840
<i>Fearless Pursuit, number four,
in yellow and lilac.</i>

751
00:56:35,873 --> 00:56:37,909
<i>Owned, of course,
by Lord Avery.</i>

752
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:44,315
<i>And the horse raised on
an allotment, Dream Alliance,</i>

753
00:56:44,349 --> 00:56:47,385
<i>number three, in the
red and white striped cap.</i>

754
00:56:49,221 --> 00:56:51,990
<i>The horses taking a look
at the first hurdle</i>

755
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:53,992
<i>in the King Edward Challenge.</i>

756
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:56,961
<i>A wide range of experience
amongst our runners today.</i>

757
00:56:56,994 --> 00:57:00,132
<i>For some of them, this is
their first time over jumps.</i>

758
00:57:05,938 --> 00:57:08,708
- <i>They're being called back now.</i>
- Come on, then, boy.

759
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,909
<i>And they'll soon
be good to go.</i>

760
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:13,345
- There we go.
- Come on, hurry up.

761
00:57:13,378 --> 00:57:15,847
<i>Dream Alliance
yet to win a race.</i>

762
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,350
<i>Fearless Pursuit looking
every inch the aristocrat.</i>

763
00:57:19,384 --> 00:57:21,454
<i>Trained at
the Berkshire court stables,</i>

764
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:25,791
<i>let's see if Fearless Pursuit
can reign victorious again.</i>

765
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:28,927
<i>I think we're good to go for this
famous race. The flag is raised.</i>

766
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,229
I've got sweaty palms. Feel.

767
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,770
<i>Bunched nearly together.
It's a pretty good start.</i>

768
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:40,940
<i>Chauncey Lad taking
the early lead at the front.</i>

769
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:44,943
<i>A certain amount of jockeying
for position in behind.</i>

770
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:47,078
<i>Now muscling
past Spring Morning</i>

771
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:50,081
<i>is Lord Avery's
Fearless Pursuit, number four,</i>

772
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:53,218
<i>asserting his dominance early as
they approach the first hurdle.</i>

773
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:56,889
<i>My Heaven in third, then Kelly's
Nan, then Justice Jones</i>

774
00:57:56,922 --> 00:57:59,391
<i>and Dream Alliance right
in the middle of the pack.</i>

775
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:03,061
<i>First jump,
always a challenge.</i>

776
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:07,031
<i>The leaders are over,
followed by the rest of the pack.</i>

777
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:09,467
Good job!

778
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:12,538
<i>Fearless Pursuit and Spring
Morning, neck and neck</i>

779
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:14,440
<i>as they come over the next hurdle.</i>

780
00:58:14,472 --> 00:58:17,442
<i>That's a nasty fall.
Jeanguin, out of the race.</i>

781
00:58:17,476 --> 00:58:21,748
<i>Both rider and horse up on their feet.
That's good to see.</i>

782
00:58:23,514 --> 00:58:26,752
<i>Dream Alliance takes it pretty smoothly.</i>

783
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:31,489
<i>Setting a fast pace
is Fearless Pursuit,</i>

784
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:34,961
<i>who won this race in
commanding fashion last year.</i>

785
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:37,429
<i>They approach the next jump.</i>

786
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,367
<i>Dream Alliance inching his way
up the pack.</i>

787
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,169
Come on.
You can do this, boy.

788
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,510
Come on, my boy!

789
00:58:56,414 --> 00:59:00,186
<i>Dream Alliance muscles past
and finds his way into fourth</i>

790
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:01,854
<i>as they round the far bend.</i>

791
00:59:04,856 --> 00:59:06,257
Oh, my God, he's doing it!

792
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:08,928
<i>Heading round
to the final straight.</i>

793
00:59:10,394 --> 00:59:13,365
<i>Dream Alliance
giving all he's got.</i>

794
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:16,335
Come on, Dream!
Come on, my boy!

795
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:19,137
<i>Dream Alliance
showing real spirit.</i>

796
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,274
<i>The boy from the valleys scrapping his
way past My Heaven and Spring Morning,</i>

797
00:59:23,307 --> 00:59:28,581
<i>letting Fearless Pursuit know he's
got a real fight on his hands.</i>

798
00:59:28,614 --> 00:59:32,585
<i>Dream Alliance threatening the
reigning champion, Fearless Pursuit.</i>

799
00:59:32,617 --> 00:59:36,020
<i>This is now a two-horse race
as they take the second last.</i>

800
00:59:36,054 --> 00:59:37,856
Come on, Dream!

801
00:59:37,889 --> 00:59:39,490
<i>They're safely
over the last hurdle.</i>

802
00:59:39,523 --> 00:59:41,025
<i>It's a titanic battle.</i>

803
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,528
He's gonna do it!

804
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:44,530
<i>Dream Alliance pulls ahead
of Fearless Pursuit.</i>

805
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:46,432
- He's gonna do it!
- <i>This rank outsider</i>

806
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:48,367
<i>digging deep
and showing his class.</i>

807
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,202
<i>We did not see this coming!</i>

808
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:53,405
Fight back! Come on, boy!

809
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:56,407
<i>Could we be witnessing
the arrival of a new champion?</i>

810
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,913
<i>The young novice is powering ahead,
a length clear. Now two lengths!</i>

811
01:00:00,945 --> 01:00:05,518
<i>Dream Alliance, he smells victory.
Untouchable now as he pulls ahead.</i>

812
01:00:06,652 --> 01:00:08,554
<i>And wins!</i>

813
01:00:09,454 --> 01:00:10,589
Oh, my God!

814
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:18,898
Oh, my God!

815
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,303
<i>Dream Alliance stealing the
crown from Fearless Pursuit</i>

816
01:00:24,335 --> 01:00:27,138

01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:30,909

<i>Please welcome

<i>the King Edward Challenge

01:00:52,396 --> 01:00:53,665
Not on my hat!

824
01:00:56,268 --> 01:00:59,972
We are so proud of you.
So proud.

825
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,144
<i>And now it's time to present
the Challenge Cup to Janet Vokes</i>

826
01:01:06,177 --> 01:01:08,681
<i>and the Alliance Partnership.</i>

827
01:01:15,353 --> 01:01:16,554
Is that real gold?

828
01:01:19,257 --> 01:01:24,329
And not forgetting, of
course, the check for £26,250!

829
01:01:26,097 --> 01:01:27,967
Split evenly.
Of course.

830
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,604
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

831
01:01:32,637 --> 01:01:35,374
Bad luck about your
Fearless Pursuit, butt.

832
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:43,015
Has it occurred to you this might
be time to take a tidy profit?

833
01:01:43,047 --> 01:01:44,482
How do you mean?

834
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:46,684
I'm prepared to make
a substantial offer.

835
01:01:46,717 --> 01:01:50,588
Oh, God.
I'd never sell him. Never.

836
01:01:50,621 --> 01:01:52,423
You haven't
heard the offer yet.

837
01:01:52,456 --> 01:01:54,659
I wouldn't sell him
for 500 million.

838
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:58,664
Well, if you change
your mind.

839
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:04,003
Hang on a minute.
That's not right.

840
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:05,503
What, the idea
of selling Dream?

841
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:07,239
No, it's bloody
ridiculous.

842
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:09,474
No, I mean him offering
to buy him off Jan.

843
01:02:09,507 --> 01:02:11,609
The horse belongs
to all of us.

844
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:14,679
Correct. Any financial offer
should be put formally

845
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:16,749
to the syndicate
for consideration.

846
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:19,050
We're not selling him
and that's that.

847
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:22,387
With respect, Jan,
that's not for you to say.

848
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,688
Are you deaf,
Gerwyn, or what?

849
01:02:23,722 --> 01:02:25,290
She's just bloody said it.

850
01:02:25,322 --> 01:02:26,759
Legally she has
no right to.

851
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:29,161
But morally
she has every right.

852
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:31,329
Surely we can
all agree about that?

853
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:33,097
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

854
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:35,466
Come on, boys.
Let's just celebrate our win.

855
01:02:39,503 --> 01:02:44,275

857
01:02:47,144 --> 01:02:50,048
Oi, Rossi,
feet off the chairs.

858
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:53,284
It's absolute pandemonium in here.
I don't recognize half this lot.

859
01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:55,153
I know. Once upon a time,

860
01:02:55,186 --> 01:02:57,355
people didn't even want to admit
they came from this village.

861
01:02:57,389 --> 01:02:59,591
Now half the valleys
reckon they live here.

862
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:02,693
How much do you reckon Lord Snooty
would have offered us for Dream?

863
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:04,695
Tens, maybe hundreds
of thousands.

864
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:09,568
Thanks for standing up
for me before.

865
01:03:10,534 --> 01:03:11,670
That's okay.

866
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:14,606
We both know
this has always been about

867
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:16,809
something much more
important than money.

868
01:03:33,224 --> 01:03:34,527
Oh!

...e-mail you sent yesterday
to Sinclair Beatty.

878
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:14,266
Care to read it?

879
01:04:20,838 --> 01:04:24,275
"Just quit moaning
and pay up, you bastards."

880
01:04:26,478 --> 01:04:31,717
They had a tax bill. I'm a tax advisor.
I advised them to pay it.

881
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:35,688
You know, Howard, I've started to wonder
lately why you came into this profession.

882
01:04:37,188 --> 01:04:39,557
Oh, you're not
the only one.

883
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:44,328
'Cause I have no idea why I
sit behind this desk all day,

884
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:47,166
helping rich bastards,
who can well afford to pay their share,

885
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,434
save millions in tax

886
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:53,372
while people out there can barely
afford to put food on their tables.

887
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:55,875
You know, it's...

888
01:04:56,574 --> 01:04:58,409
legalized robbery.

889
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:00,179
Howard, mate.

890
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:10,488
Has to be something better
I can do with my life.

891
01:05:14,893 --> 01:05:17,630
He's taking the lamp.
Why is he taking the lamp?

892
01:05:19,597 --> 01:05:22,433
Resigned?
What were you thinking?

893
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:25,771
I wasn't thinking.
That's the whole point. I was just...

894
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:31,610
It's what I feel.

895
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:34,713
It's what I felt for years.
I can't do that job anymore.

896
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,416
This is that bloody horse
again, isn't it?

897
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:39,985
Being involved with Jan and
the syndicate has made me feel

898
01:05:40,018 --> 01:05:44,789
like I'm part of something important
for the first time in years.

899
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:46,791
And it's bloody fabulous.

900
01:05:46,824 --> 01:05:49,594
It's selfish!
And it's reckless!

901
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,263
I can work it out.
We'll manage.

902
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,965
Oh, how exactly?
On my wages?

903
01:05:56,768 --> 01:05:59,704
So, I've been talking to Philip,

904
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:03,808
and he reckons Dream's bouncing,
in the form of his life.

905
01:06:03,842 --> 01:06:07,445
Howard reckons it's partly that
new probiotic food they got him on.

906
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:09,614
And they've got him in that
new equine swimming pool.

907
01:06:09,648 --> 01:06:11,950
Dream absolutely loves it,
apparently.

908
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:14,553
Howard says swimming is brilliant
for building up muscle strength

909
01:06:14,585 --> 01:06:15,920
in the hindquarters.

910
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:17,723
Brian?

911
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:19,658
What's the matter?

912
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:21,926
Nothing.

913
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,930
Come on, spit it out.

914
01:06:30,735 --> 01:06:33,672
I miss him, is all... Dream.

915
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:37,375
It's stupid, isn't it? Missing
something I didn't even know I wanted.

916
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:39,911
No, it's not stupid.

917
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:41,313
But still...

918
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:43,282
that's the way life is.

919
01:06:43,315 --> 01:06:44,416
I shouldn't grumble.

920
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:51,022
But life's not like that, Brian.
That's the whole point.

921
01:06:51,056 --> 01:06:52,858
There's a whole world
out there you don't see

922
01:06:52,891 --> 01:06:54,659
because you're just sat
watching the telly.

923
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:56,928
You what?

924
01:06:58,063 --> 01:06:59,965
Look, when Dream arrived...

925
01:07:01,032 --> 01:07:02,934
I saw you light up.

926
01:07:06,338 --> 01:07:09,508
Look, I know you miss him.
But don't just...

927
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:12,911
settle back into
your old ways again.

928
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:14,579
I shouldn't have said
anything.

929
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,715
I don't mind really.
I'm happy enough.

930
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:21,619
No, Brian, you're always "happy
enough." You lost your job,

931
01:07:21,652 --> 01:07:24,789
you said, "Never mind, another one
will come along." And it never did.

932
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:28,527
You got arthritis, you said, "Oh, well,
we all get old and ill sooner or later."

933
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,730
I mean, when I first met you,
you were a fighter.

934
01:07:31,762 --> 01:07:35,634
And now
you just accept things.

935
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,435
You don't fight anymore.

936
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,713
So, what your dad said
was right.

937
01:07:50,782 --> 01:07:53,352
You could have done
a lot better for yourself.

938
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:17,975
So I can evade tax,
but I can't avoid it.

939
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:21,712
Other way around, Nerys.
Avoid, not evade.

940
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:25,617
- Evasion they don't like.
- Got it. Um...

941
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:30,021
things are a little tight
cash-wise these days, so...

942
01:08:31,622 --> 01:08:33,024
best sirloin.

943
01:08:34,591 --> 01:08:36,627
- Cheers, Nerys.
- Enjoy.

944
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:41,466
- Oh. Hello, Nerys.
- Jan.

945
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,536
Whoo.

946
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:47,405
It's looking very smart,
Howard.

947
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,411
Well, the refurbishment
is, um, ongoing.

948
01:08:52,444 --> 01:08:55,647
How come, though?
You had a good job in Cardiff, didn't you?

949
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,917
Uh, well, I realized
I couldn't do it anymore.

950
01:08:58,949 --> 01:09:03,587
And I wasn't gonna live a life
of lost chances like my dad.

951
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:06,190
- What happened to him?
- Uh...

952
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:10,494
ran away from home at 14 with a
dream of being a famous jockey.

953
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:13,465
Lied about his age,
got a job at a racing stables.

954
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:15,966
The coppers tracked him
down, bought him home.

955
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,670
Became a lifer
at the steelworks and...

956
01:09:18,703 --> 01:09:20,872
that was that.

957
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:23,908
"Don't let them crush your
dreams," he used to say.

958
01:09:26,944 --> 01:09:30,614
And at least I've had plenty of time to
keep on top of the syndicate finances.

959
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:34,720
Believe it or not, we're showing an
overall profit of about a hundred grand.

960
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:36,887
Good God.

961
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:38,690
I never in
a million years thought

962
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:40,559
we'd make
this kind of money.

963
01:09:40,591 --> 01:09:42,226
That's not
the only good news.

964
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,831
Philip Hobbs wants to race
Dream at Aintree on Saturday.

965
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:47,565
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know.

966
01:09:52,804 --> 01:09:55,173
- A wedding, is it?
- No, Mam.

967
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,243
It's two of
the yellow ones, Dad.

968
01:09:58,275 --> 01:10:00,878
- I've taken two.
- No, you've only taken the white.

969
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:04,615
Sasha?
Is our Sasha getting married?

970
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:07,719
No, Mam. I told you.

971
01:10:07,752 --> 01:10:10,555
I'm off to Aintree
'cause Dream's racing there.

972
01:10:10,587 --> 01:10:14,492
Aintree!
Bert, did you hear that?

973
01:10:16,226 --> 01:10:20,198
We'll watch it on the telly, Jan.
We love doing that.

974
01:10:23,967 --> 01:10:26,938
I need you to pick up my
prescription from the chemist.

975
01:10:33,912 --> 01:10:35,881
Is that all
you can say, Dad?

976
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:38,850
- What?
- The horse I bred

977
01:10:38,882 --> 01:10:40,851
is racing in the biggest
meet in the calendar,

978
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:42,921
and that's all
you can say?

979
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,059
I'll see you later.

980
01:11:02,873 --> 01:11:05,143

01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:26,831
All right, Daisy?

988
01:11:27,998 --> 01:11:29,635

01:12:35,432 --> 01:12:36,801
Come on, Dream!

1015
01:12:38,069 --> 01:12:40,305
<i>...as they approach
the next flight of hurdles.</i>

1016
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:46,945
<i>Dream Alliance is jumping with real confidence now.</i>

1017
01:12:46,978 --> 01:12:48,846
- Come on, Dream. Come on, boy!
- <i>He's up into third place,</i>

1018
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,981
<i>chased hard
by both Superior Wisdom,</i>

1019
01:12:51,015 --> 01:12:53,285
- <i>and then comes Aurora's Encore.</i>
- Come on, Dream!

1020
01:12:55,353 --> 01:12:57,756
Come on, Dream!

1021
01:12:57,788 --> 01:13:00,826
<i>Dream Alliance now just
a length and a half behind.</i>

1022
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:04,863
<i>Dream Alliance and According
to Pete neck and neck.</i>

1023
01:13:04,895 --> 01:13:07,264
<i>Nothing between these two
as they take the next.</i>

1024
01:13:10,033 --> 01:13:11,869
<i>And the field
head round the final bend.</i>

1025
01:13:11,903 --> 01:13:13,371
<i>Buena Vista continues
to lead the way.</i>

1026
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:15,774
<i>According To Pete
on his outside.</i>

1027
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:19,010
<i>Superior Wisdom in third and
behind them Aurora's Encore.</i>

1028
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:20,711
Where's Dream?

1029
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:22,180
I can't see him, either.

1030
01:13:22,212 --> 01:13:24,215
Howard, can you
see anything?

1031
01:13:25,349 --> 01:13:26,652
He's not there.

1032
01:13:27,784 --> 01:13:29,153
- Can you see him?
- Oh, Jesus.

1033
01:13:29,186 --> 01:13:30,822
Oh, what's happening?
Let me see.

1034
01:13:31,788 --> 01:13:33,358
They're putting screens
around him.

1035
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:36,695
Means they're gonna
shoot him, don't it?

1036
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:38,230
Stay calm, everyone.

1037
01:13:40,297 --> 01:13:41,465
The vet's arrived.

1038
01:13:41,498 --> 01:13:43,702
They can't shoot him.

1039
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:45,936
If his leg's broken
they'd have to, Jan.

1040
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,204
Okay, I'm calling Philip.

1041
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,309
What are they saying?

1042
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,746
Pick up, Philip, pick up.

1043
01:13:55,912 --> 01:13:57,247
Philip?

1044
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,451
Put him on speaker.

1045
01:13:59,484 --> 01:14:01,753
- <i>Philip, what's happening?</i>
- They can't tell how bad it is,

1046
01:14:01,786 --> 01:14:03,253
but it looks like
he's severed a tendon.

1047
01:14:03,287 --> 01:14:05,090
That's serious, isn't it?

1048
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:07,324
<i>If confirmed,
then he'd never run again.</i>

1049
01:14:09,092 --> 01:14:11,429
- Philip?
- Yeah. Hold on.

1050
01:14:11,462 --> 01:14:15,133
Oh, please, God, we can't lose him.
We can't lose him. We can't.

1051
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:18,869
It's kinder to put
a horse down immediately

1052
01:14:18,903 --> 01:14:20,805
in these circumstances,
you know.

1053
01:14:22,006 --> 01:14:24,409
Whoa! Stand clear!

1054
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:26,478
Hello, Howard?
Vet thinks the tendon

1055
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:28,046
may not be
completely severed

1056
01:14:28,078 --> 01:14:30,914
and there's a chance
it could be repaired.

1057
01:14:30,948 --> 01:14:34,452
Then try, for God's sake! If there's
the faintest chance of saving him!

1058
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:37,087
<i>I have to warn you,
if the tendon can't be repaired,</i>

1059
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:38,957
<i>he'd still have to be
euthanized.</i>

1060
01:14:38,989 --> 01:14:42,760
- Right, Philip.
- <i>And if we remove him from the course</i>

1061
01:14:42,793 --> 01:14:44,828
<i>and the operation
does fail,</i>

1062
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:46,931
you'd lose
the insurance money

1063
01:14:46,963 --> 01:14:50,434
and, of course,
face substantial bills.

1064
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:56,807
Philip, we don't have time.
I really need an answer.

1065
01:14:57,942 --> 01:14:59,409
Well, how much
is he insured for?

1066
01:14:59,443 --> 01:15:02,280
Currently,
120 thousand pound.

1067
01:15:02,313 --> 01:15:04,181
Maybe we need
to discuss this.

1068
01:15:04,215 --> 01:15:06,985
No, there's nothing to discuss.
What's there to discuss?

1069
01:15:07,018 --> 01:15:10,855
Well, 120 grand, to start with.
That's a hell of a lot of money.

1070
01:15:10,887 --> 01:15:12,422
Look, he belongs
to all of us,

1071
01:15:12,456 --> 01:15:14,993
and any decision about
what happens to him

1072
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:16,961
should be taken
collectively.

1073
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:18,962
- It's a fair point.
- Yeah, but...

1074
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:21,966
Like it should have been that day
Lord Avery offered to buy him.

1075
01:15:21,998 --> 01:15:23,967
You're not still on
about that, Gerwyn?

1076
01:15:24,001 --> 01:15:26,905
- Wait. Listen.
- This is a syndicate, isn't it?

1077
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:28,806
He's suffering and all alone!

1078
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,844
Everybody be quiet
and just listen to Janet!

1079
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:41,019
Look, before Dream...

1080
01:15:41,051 --> 01:15:42,420
who were we?

1081
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,055
Gerwyn?

1082
01:15:46,323 --> 01:15:47,391
Kerby?

1083
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:51,095
We lost our jobs,
our community.

1084
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:53,965
Even lost our pride.

1085
01:15:55,498 --> 01:15:57,335
And then Dream came along

1086
01:15:57,368 --> 01:16:00,939
and reminded us all what life
is like when you have hope.

1087
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:05,409
Dream's out on that course
in agony,

1088
01:16:05,443 --> 01:16:07,912
his life hanging by a thread,

1089
01:16:07,944 --> 01:16:09,880
and you're talking about
putting a gun to his head

1090
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:12,082
so you can have a couple
of grand in your pockets.

1091
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,989
Too bloody right.

1092
01:16:19,023 --> 01:16:21,391
Dream's never asked us
for anything before.

1093
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:24,095
- He's just given us his all.
- Yeah.

1094
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:27,064
Dream has given me
a second chance.

1095
01:16:27,097 --> 01:16:29,333
He's given us all
a second chance.

1096
01:16:30,268 --> 01:16:32,069
And now...

1097
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:35,139
I think we need to
give him one.

1098
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:38,108
- Fair enough.
- Yeah.

1099
01:16:39,609 --> 01:16:41,246
Hmm?

1100
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:42,314
Right.

1101
01:16:45,015 --> 01:16:46,951
Philip.

1102
01:16:46,984 --> 01:16:50,521
Tell them they gotta do whatever
they can to try and save him.

1103
01:16:50,554 --> 01:16:54,492
Steady! Steady, Dream.

1104
01:17:05,536 --> 01:17:06,904
Anything?

1105
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:20,218
Brian, I...

1106
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:22,554
It's...
It's all right, girl.

1107
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:48,578
Dream's had an accident.

1108
01:17:48,612 --> 01:17:51,016
They've been operating on him
through the night.

1109
01:18:19,176 --> 01:18:21,079
Philip? What's the news?

1110
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:26,484
I see.

1111
01:18:29,286 --> 01:18:30,454
Right.

1112
01:18:32,222 --> 01:18:33,591
Okay, thanks.

1113
01:18:36,493 --> 01:18:38,095
Well?

1114
01:18:38,128 --> 01:18:40,597
We hope he'll be able
to walk again.

1115
01:18:40,631 --> 01:18:44,068
But you do understand,
the chances of him racing again

1116
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,435
are virtually nonexistent.

1117
01:18:45,469 --> 01:18:47,672
All I care about
is he gets well.

1118
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:57,015
And if the tendon
won't heal and he's lame,

1119
01:18:57,047 --> 01:19:00,350
well, then we'll have to
consider his quality of life.

1120
01:19:00,384 --> 01:19:01,418
Aw.

1121
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:03,221
Hello.

1122
01:19:07,425 --> 01:19:08,693
God, Dream.

1123
01:19:08,725 --> 01:19:10,394
You had me worried.

1124
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:59,811
<i>♪ I would not ask

1125

Thank you.

1133
01:20:58,769 --> 01:21:00,137
Mrs. Davies?

1134
01:21:01,238 --> 01:21:02,673
Angela?

1135
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:05,176
I'm Jan.
From the syndicate.

1136
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:07,845
Oh, right.

1137
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,280
Hi.

1138
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:14,152
How's Howard?
Haven't seen him in a while.

1139
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:15,753
Not since what happened
with Dream.

1140
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:18,256
Yes, I heard.

1141
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:23,261
I was, um, so sorry
about his accident.

1142
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:26,264
Thanks. He's alive.
That's the main thing.

1143
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:27,364
Yes.

1144
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:32,737
Well, I...

1145
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:35,940
I just, um...

1146
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:38,176
wanted to say I think
it's brilliant...

1147
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:42,779
supporting Howard the way you did
with the syndicate and everything.

1148
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:47,451
I mean, after the last time,
a lot of wives wouldn't have done that.

1149
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:50,254
It wasn't until he told me that
story about his dad running away

1150
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:52,289
and becoming a jockey

1151
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:54,926
that I really understood why
this mattered to him so much.

1152
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,896
But I guess
you knew that all along.

1153
01:22:02,233 --> 01:22:03,333
Yes.

1154
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:05,936
Well, thanks.

1155
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:09,173
That's £18.90, please.

1156
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:16,780
Thanks.

1157
01:22:24,654 --> 01:22:26,657
- Brian?
- <i>Listen, Jan. It's your dad.</i>

1158
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:28,692
<i>I'm sorry. I've called
an ambulance, but...</i>

1159
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:29,927
I'm two minutes away.

1160
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:47,518
Well, there he is.

1161
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,496
Oh, good God.

1162
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:11,509
You said he could walk.
But is he really up to being ridden?

1163
01:27:36,832 --> 01:27:39,036
Oh, he's going
pretty well, isn't he?

1164
01:27:41,637 --> 01:27:43,006
Well done, boy.

1165
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:50,248
Unbelievable!

1166
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:56,020
My God.

1167
01:28:11,702 --> 01:28:15,139
- I swear he winked at me.
- It's miraculous.

1168
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:17,640
The stem cell treatment
was a complete success.

1169
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:19,777
The vet thinks
the tendon's stronger now

1170
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:22,046
than before the injury.
He's running faster than ever.

1171
01:28:22,078 --> 01:28:24,347
How come you never mentioned
he was coming on so well?

1172
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:27,685
Didn't want to raise any false
hopes until we were sure.

1173
01:28:27,717 --> 01:28:29,619
Of what?

1174
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:32,755
We think he's ready
to race again.

1175
01:28:32,788 --> 01:28:36,292
- You're joking.
- We're thinking The Welsh National.

1176
01:28:36,326 --> 01:28:40,030
- That would be incredible.
- But after all he's been through...

1177
01:28:42,966 --> 01:28:45,936
I need to be sure
it's what you want.

1178
01:28:51,774 --> 01:28:54,110
I can't bear the thought
of him risking his life again!

1179
01:28:57,146 --> 01:29:00,350
I just don't think we can take the risk.
Not after all that's happened.

1180
01:29:00,384 --> 01:29:02,286
But it'd be the comeback
of all comebacks!

1181
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:04,822
That's rich. You were ready
to write him off.

1182
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:07,991
- We'd all written him off.
- You saw him on the gallops.

1183
01:29:08,024 --> 01:29:10,893
And you heard what Philip Hobbs said.
It's miraculous.

1184
01:29:10,926 --> 01:29:14,998
I mean, surely it's a sign.
Dream wants to keep going.

1185
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:17,668
- He lives to race.
- It's in his blood, innit?

1186
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:20,637
Out on that track,
when he was hurt,

1187
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,908
you said we owed him a chance
because of what he'd done for us.

1188
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:28,345
What was that chance for if
not to let him race again?

1189
01:29:28,377 --> 01:29:31,180
But not at The Welsh Grand National.
It's too dangerous.

1190
01:29:31,213 --> 01:29:34,018
Tell him, Brian.
It's just too big a risk.

1191
01:29:36,853 --> 01:29:38,154
I would, Jan.

1192
01:29:39,155 --> 01:29:41,257
But I can see
what they're saying.

1193
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:56,206
How could you?

1194
01:30:07,317 --> 01:30:09,319
That's why I'm single, see?

1195
01:30:22,932 --> 01:30:24,301
Jan.

1196
01:30:24,333 --> 01:30:26,970
- I thought you cared about Dream.
- I do.

1197
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:31,041
Of course I care about him.

1198
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:37,014
When Dream come along,
took me right back to when I was young.

1199
01:30:38,414 --> 01:30:40,184
Wanting to be a farmer.

1200
01:30:43,987 --> 01:30:47,123
All those hopes
I'd given up on.

1201
01:30:47,157 --> 01:30:50,461
And it hurt like hell when he
went to live at the stables.

1202
01:30:52,462 --> 01:30:55,966
Almost as much as it hurt
when he fell at Aintree.

1203
01:30:58,135 --> 01:31:00,838
You spoke for him then,
when he couldn't.

1204
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:04,007
But if Dream was here now
and he could speak...

1205
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:08,278
...he'd tell you
he wants to race.

1206
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:11,716
It's in his blood.

1207
01:31:14,451 --> 01:31:16,220
You know I'm right.

1208
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,823
Let him run, Jan.

1209
01:31:21,123 --> 01:31:24,427
I just can't bear the thought
of him getting hurt again.

1210
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:25,829
I know.

1211
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:29,198
But you were right.

1212
01:31:29,231 --> 01:31:33,770
We can't stop ourselves from
dreaming of bigger things.

1213
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:45,081
Come on, love.

1214
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:48,451
Come on.

1215
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:44,375
There you go.

1216
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,409
See ya.

1217
01:32:46,443 --> 01:32:48,512
Hey, Kerby.
Where's your glad rags?

1218
01:32:48,545 --> 01:32:50,881
You better get a shift on,
mate, or you'll miss the coach.

1219
01:32:50,913 --> 01:32:52,550
I'm not going.
Can't afford it, butt.

1220
01:32:53,649 --> 01:32:56,219
You gotta come.
Come, we'll have a whip-round.

1221
01:32:56,252 --> 01:33:00,122
Bugger off. I'll put the money
I'm saving by not going on Dream.

1222
01:33:00,155 --> 01:33:02,525
Twenty quid,
Dream Alliance to win.

1223
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:06,630
I'll watch it in the club
with a pint in my hand.

1224
01:33:06,662 --> 01:33:10,033
Now, you tell our boy
to run the race of his life.

1225
01:33:11,001 --> 01:33:12,369
Right, I'm off.

1226
01:33:15,404 --> 01:33:17,073
Why are you all...

1227
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:19,475
We thought we might come along, too.

1228
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,979
What the hell is that?

1229
01:33:23,012 --> 01:33:25,582
What do you reckon?

1230
01:33:25,614 --> 01:33:28,585
Angela and the kids in there.
Howard, you're lying down in the hearse.

1231
01:33:28,618 --> 01:33:31,555
I couldn't fit you all in the coach!
We had to think laterally!

1232
01:33:31,587 --> 01:33:33,657
- Come on. Follow me.
- In you go, love.

01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:57,094
Oh, my God,
is that Rod Stewart?

1268
01:36:57,127 --> 01:36:59,162
Oh, he never misses the Welsh.

1271

<i>in the Welsh Grand National.</i>

1272
01:37:07,136 --> 01:37:10,206
<i>Dream Alliance there. First race
back after a long convalescence.</i>

1273
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,675
<i>Looking
a little bit unsettled.</i>

1274
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:14,644
Oh, God, there he is.

1275
01:37:16,279 --> 01:37:18,482
<i>His ruptured tendon the cause
of his nerves, perhaps.</i>

1276
01:37:18,515 --> 01:37:19,682
<i>Understandable.</i>

1277

<i>Le Beau Bai, number nine,</i>

1278
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:26,456
<i>is the bookies' favorite

1279
01:37:26,488 --> 01:37:29,692
<i>Tapes go across and we'll be
under starter's orders.</i>

1280
01:37:31,927 --> 01:37:35,364
<i>Anxious wait while
the starter raises his flag.</i>

1281
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:37,201
Under starter's orders!

1282
01:37:41,871 --> 01:37:43,340
Come on, Dream.

1283
01:37:51,314 --> 01:37:52,548
Come on, man.

1284
01:38:05,895 --> 01:38:09,833
<i>The flag drops and we're
off on this Welsh Grand National!</i>

1285
01:38:09,865 --> 01:38:13,336
<i>A grueling race that has seen
plenty of drama in its time.</i>

1286
01:38:13,368 --> 01:38:15,604
Come on, Dream. Go on, boy.

1287
01:38:15,637 --> 01:38:19,242
<i>Leading now is Operation
Houdini, in the yellow and black.</i>

1288
01:38:19,274 --> 01:38:21,944
Get around safely, eh?
Just get around safely.

1289
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:25,681
<i>Having work to do at the rear of the
pack is Dream Alliance, number three.</i>

1290
01:38:26,315 --> 01:38:27,917
Come on, boy!

1291
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:30,420
<i>As they head
into the first bend,</i>

1292
01:38:30,453 --> 01:38:33,290
<i>Operation Houdini still holds
his position in the lead.</i>

1293
01:38:33,323 --> 01:38:36,459
- He's coming over the rise down there.
- Come on, man.

1294
01:38:36,492 --> 01:38:40,363
<i>The pack are now climbing
steeply on this punishing course.</i>

1295
01:38:40,395 --> 01:38:43,866
<i>Ahead of them looms the
challenge of the first fence.</i>

1296
01:38:55,377 --> 01:38:57,246
Coming to the first now.
Here we are.

1297
01:39:02,952 --> 01:39:04,354
Come on, Dream!

1298
01:39:12,395 --> 01:39:14,932
<i>Dream Alliance still the back
marker approaching the second fence.</i>

1299
01:39:22,438 --> 01:39:23,606
He's got it!

1300
01:39:34,317 --> 01:39:35,851
<i>And they're all over clear.</i>

1301
01:39:39,988 --> 01:39:42,925
<i>Approaching the far bend,
Operation Houdini slipping away.</i>

1302
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:44,527
Come on, lad.

1303
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,296
Come on, my boy.

1304
01:39:46,328 --> 01:39:48,864
<i>Dream Alliance looks like
he's making a move!</i>

1305
01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:51,868
<i>Muscling through, pushing Cornish
Chef then Nositch out of the way.</i>

1306
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,871
- He's away!
- Go, Dream!

1307
01:39:54,904 --> 01:39:56,906
<i>The pack rounding the far bend</i>

1308
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:00,543
<i>and Dream Alliance sneaks past
Hello Bud and Old Benny.</i>

1309
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:02,746
Go on, boy!

1310
01:40:07,817 --> 01:40:09,752
Look, Jan!

1311
01:40:09,786 --> 01:40:13,657
<i>Dream Alliance battling his
way past Operation Houdini</i>

1312
01:40:13,689 --> 01:40:15,457
<i>as he barges
into second place!</i>

1313
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:16,926
<i>This is incredible!</i>

1314
01:40:19,662 --> 01:40:23,432
<i>Silver By Nature has got a
real scrap on his hands now!</i>

1315
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:34,778
<i>Dream Alliance and Silver
By Nature locked in a duel</i>

1316
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:36,545
<i>as they approach
the second to last.</i>

1317
01:40:40,716 --> 01:40:42,685
Come on, boy! Come on!

1318
01:40:47,122 --> 01:40:50,760
<i>Dream Alliance tightening every
sinew as they take the final jump.</i>

1319
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:55,931
<i>A slip by Silver By Nature,
and Dream Alliance lands ahead</i>

1320
01:40:55,965 --> 01:40:59,036
<i>and steals the lead for the
very first time in the race!</i>

1321
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:04,541
- Yes, yes!
- Come on!

1322
01:41:04,573 --> 01:41:06,742
<i>Dream Alliance in first place,</i>

1323
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:09,378
<i>but Silver By Nature
is fighting back!</i>

1324
01:41:12,481 --> 01:41:14,117
<i>He's pulling away
from Dream Alliance!</i>

1325
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:15,885
Go, my boy!

1326
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:23,659
<i>Both horses giving it
everything they've got.</i>

1327
01:41:23,693 --> 01:41:26,096
- My boy!
- <i>Dream Alliance pulling ahead!</i>

1328
01:41:27,896 --> 01:41:30,065
- Go on!
- <i>The boy from the valleys</i>

1329
01:41:30,099 --> 01:41:32,436
<i>proving he's up there
with the best in the world!</i>

1330
01:41:33,703 --> 01:41:34,938
Go, Dream!

1331
01:41:56,057 --> 01:41:57,360
Hey!

1332
01:42:09,104 --> 01:42:11,740
<i>First place, Dream Alliance.</i>

1333
01:42:11,774 --> 01:42:15,612
<i>A fairy-tale return from injury to
conquer this Welsh Grand National!</i>

1334
01:42:15,645 --> 01:42:17,514
Oh, lovely!

1335
01:42:17,546 --> 01:42:19,481
Dream, Dream, Dream!

1336
01:42:19,515 --> 01:42:20,650
Yay!

1337
01:42:25,887 --> 01:42:29,393
I bloody knew he was a
champion right from the start!

1338
01:42:31,993 --> 01:42:33,429
You did it.

1339
01:42:35,163 --> 01:42:36,800
Hey, well done, girl.

1340
01:42:38,701 --> 01:42:39,735
Well done.

1341
01:42:52,148 --> 01:42:56,653
<i>Please give a rapturous welcome

1342

<i>and now the Welsh Grand National
champion, Dream Alliance!</i>

1343
01:43:06,628 --> 01:43:08,664
Come on, Dreamy boy!

1344
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:15,505
You gorgeous, clever,
lion-hearted boy, you.

1345
01:43:15,537 --> 01:43:16,972
Well done!

1346
01:43:17,006 --> 01:43:18,608
Well done.

1347

01:44:04,886 --> 01:44:06,655
Quiet word with Dad...

1359
01:44:07,989 --> 01:44:09,960
about how this win
was for him.

1360
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:18,168
He'd be very proud.
