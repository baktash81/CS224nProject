1
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:02,661
<i>You follow</i>
<i>the rules and we're through.</i>

2
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,196
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>
<i>Move back.</i>

3
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,731
<i>You're surrounded,</i>
<i>fellows.</i>

4
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,267
<i>When answering</i>
<i>your questions,</i>

5
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,835
<i>we've made a statement and</i>

6
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,437
<i>you should need to be satisfied</i>
<i>with that.</i>

7
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,005
<i>We all know</i>
<i>of course that this case</i>

8
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,840
<i>has had a great deal</i>
<i>of publicity.</i>

9
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,475
<i>The lawyers involved</i>
<i>in this case...</i>

10
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,045
<i>Not a word!</i>

11
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,280
<i>You should bear in mind</i>

12
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:22,581
<i>that much of what you see</i>

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,783
<i>and read is propaganda</i>

14
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,385
<i>from the prosecution.</i>

15
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,187
<i>It's not a fair appraisal</i>

16
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,721
<i>of what in fact occurred.</i>

17
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,990
<i>Some of it is</i>
<i>downright false.</i>

18
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,899
Stay focused.

19
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,468
Stay calm.

20
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:45,471
Stay honest.

21
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,007
Look them in the eye.

22
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,344
Be polite.

23
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,981
Be respectful.

24
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,950
Listen to the questions.

25
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,451
Think about your answers.

26
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,223
Take your time,
but not too much time.

27
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,758
Give the detail...

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,928
not too much detail,
they'll confuse.

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,133
Don't stare at the jury,
don't joke with the jury,

30
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,236
don't flirt with the jury.

31
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:20,172
They're your mother,
they're your father.

32
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,409
They are your fucking future.

33
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,062
What is happening?

34
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,966
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

35
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,204
FBI, please vacate the aircraft.

36
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,805
- What is going on, Jim?
- It's...

37
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm sure it's some sort of
misunderstanding or--

38
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,809
- Mr. Hoffman, please vacate...
- Why do you know his name?

39
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,144
- Make no sudden moves.
- Why do they know your name?

40
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,912
Honey.

41
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,214
Vacate the aircraft!

42
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,416
We are vacating
the aircraft, okay.

43
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,551
Let them do their job.

44
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,253
- I don't know.
- It's alright.

45
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,688
Maybe they're confused
or something.

46
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,756
Probably just some
accident.

47
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:49,161
It's kind of cool.
How old are you guys? Huh?

48
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,762
- Kind of cool, right?
- Babe.

49
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,031
Mr. Hoffman,
you're under arrest.

50
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,700
You have the right
to remain silent.

51
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,668
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

52
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,003
in the court of law.

53
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,705
- Any--
- What are you doing?

54
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,573
- Anything you say--
- We are on vacation!

55
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,275
These are my children!

56
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,910
- If you need a lawyer--
- We're at Disney Land, asshole!

57
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,445
Oh, fuck it,
just take them away.

58
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:12,184
What are you doing
with my husband? Jim!

59
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,890
So, tell me about them?

60
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,194
What can I say?
They were a nice couple.

61
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,729
A nice Christian couple.

62
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,064
This nice Christian couple
we can find no trace of?

63
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,034
Oh, I can be held responsible
for that now, can I?

64
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,535
I'm a pilot, man.

65
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,105
I make a living
transporting shit.

66
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,740
I-- it's all in the manifest.

67
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,208
Sorry, I-- I don't know
what you want from me here.

68
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,476
Here's the thing, Hoffman.

69
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39,711
I meet scumbags
like you all the time.

70
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,247
You're the sort of guy
if you could make a 1000 bucks

71
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,949
honest or ten bucks
doing it crooked

72
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,151
you'd do it crooked every time.

73
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,487
I-- I bet you, you'd fuck
your own mother for a quarter.

74
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:51,623
If you're trying
to charm me, sir,

75
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,924
you're not doing a great job--

76
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,959
But worse than fucking
your own mother

77
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,827
you'd fuck your own kids?

78
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,596
You take them on a drug run?

79
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,464
- That is the lowest.
- I took them to Disney World.

80
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,434
- You took them to Bolivia.
- To deliver Bibles.

81
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,770
Okay, I thought
they would have fun.

82
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,105
Except it turns out that Bolivia
is a shithole.

83
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,774
So, we took them to Disney World
on the way back.

84
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,509
You took them
to Bolivia as cover

85
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,010
and you picked up so much coke
you thought

86
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,246
you'd celebrate
in Disney on the way back.

87
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:15,814
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

88
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,316
Don't call me Ben.

89
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,017
It said, Ben, on your badge.

90
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,820
It says, Benedict J. Tisa,
special agent in charge

91
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,622
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

92
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,023
Special agent in charge?

93
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,626
I like that.

94
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,795
I like you, you know.

95
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,663
And I really like your suit.

96
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,765
You look great, you're the best
dressed guy here.

97
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,000
You know that.

98
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,869
Dressed for the job
you want, right?

99
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,805
Okay, look,
special agent in charge

100
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,273
I swear to you on my life

101
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,241
I knew nothing about
any of this.

102
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,450
Seems like you got a sweet
family out there.

103
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,488
But you're not gonna
see them for 30 years.

104
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,256
So, do yourself a favor.

105
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,333
Good lookin' fellow.

106
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,068
I don't know who this other
guy is though.

107
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,970
You know exactly who it is,
because Morgan Hetrick--

108
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,438
Sir?

109
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,980
You landed in Pensacola,
Florida.

110
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,749
You subleased out your plane
and it was

111
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,685
out of your possession
for three nights.

112
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,887
Three magical nights
at Disney World, yes.

113
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,691
Are we done here?

114
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,827
- So, that's it?
- That's it, yeah.

115
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,028
Yeah, I mean I had
the paperwork, you know

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,530
you can't argue with paperwork.

117
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,732
Jim, some of those people
that you work with

118
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,034
I do not think
have your best interest in mind.

119
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,770
I agree, no, I-- I think, uh

120
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,371
Bolivia was a pretty
big clue, huh?

121
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,206
- This is a wake up call.
- It's a wake up call.

122
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,609
- We need to start fresh.
- Somewhere new, absolutely.

123
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,377
This time I'm gonna pick where.

124
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,579
- No, no, no, no. No.
- Yeah. We'll put it to a vote.

125
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,047
What do you mean we're gonna
vote? We're not gonna vote.

126
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,416
Yes, we will put it to a vote,

127
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,117
we live in a democracy.

128
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,620
No, no, no, no. No, you think
you live in a democracy.

129
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,456
All in favor of mom choosing
where we live next.

130
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,625
Oh, hey, guys,
come on, think about it.

131
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,959
We're gonna end up
livin' in some dump.

132
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,061
You know, your mom has no taste.

133
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,563
She married you.

134
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,100
Yeah?

135
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,102
It's a really nice neighborhood,
honey.

136
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:54,072
Yeah, don't worry,
it'll be fine.

137
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,674
Only the best for my family.

138
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,243
Go ahead, door's open.
Go in, check it out.

139
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,278
Mr. Hoffman.

140
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,048
Who are you exactly?

141
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,584
- Well, I'm not really--
- No, no, no.

142
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,419
Don't answer that,
Mr. Hoffman.

143
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,955
It was a rhetorical question.

144
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,823
So, we're to find out
exactly who you are,

145
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,792
we're gonna find out
what wasn't quite forthcoming

146
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,495
with the prosecution evidence.

147
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,031
Pauma valley,
it's beautiful up there.

148
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,333
Not cheap though, is it?

149
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,836
Sorry, do you want me
to answer that one?

150
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,641
- Yes.
- No, sir, not cheap.

151
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,644
- You have a mortgage? Renting?
- Renting.

152
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,980
- And what's the rent like?
- Sixteen hundred a month.

153
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,816
That's, uh,
that's a lot of money.

154
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,619
Why don't we take a quick look
at your, your IRS returns,

155
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,354
see how you can, uh,
afford such, uh,

156
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,055
a nice spread in Pauma valley.

157
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,291
What would you say, at random,

158
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,660
you filed for in 1980?

159
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,128
I did not file in 1980.

160
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,563
Did you file in 1979?

161
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,131
- No, sir, I did not.
- 1978?

162
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,466
- No, sir.
- '77?

163
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,534
1977?

164
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,406
You think this is funny,
Mr. Hoffman?

165
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,807
No, sir.

166
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,310
You do realize
that it is illegal

167
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,845
not to file a tax return?

168
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,213
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,683
But you did file in 1982.

170
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,084
How come?

171
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,920
Just tryin'
to do the right thing.

172
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,255
Well, there is a first time
for everything.

173
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,563
- You're in prison.
- Yeah, try to escape.

174
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,765
Try to escape.
Try to escape.

175
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,501
Yeah, just keep distracting her.

176
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,102
Hey! Guys, what's going on here?

177
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,039
Dad, dad, o-- okay
if we go play in their pool?

178
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,440
- Please.
- Please let us play.

179
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,575
Hold on, buddy,
I mean, these guys

180
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,776
look like trouble if you ask me.

181
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,110
- Mom?
- It's time to go home.

182
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,579
- Mommy.
- Hi, my love.

183
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,080
Good, good, good.

184
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,249
Hi, I hope they're not being
a nuisance.

185
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,351
No, not at all, no.
More than welcome.

186
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,087
Oh, we haven't had a chance to
welcome you to the neighborhood.

187
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,457
We're always coming and going.
Cristina.

188
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,226
Oh, I'm... Sorry. Uh, hey.
Hi, Jim.

189
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,728
Hi.

190
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,463
Mom, can they come swim with us?

191
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,865
It's alright with me if that's
alright with their dad.

192
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,567
Yeah, no, of course.
They're very good.

193
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,402
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, no problem.

194
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,571
- Ni-- nice to meet you.
- Let's go! Come on.

195
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,039
Come on, baby.

196
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,441
Mommy. Are we going?

197
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,776
Am I gonna try on
my new bathing suit now?

198
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,978
Aye-aye-yay!

199
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,372
Come on.

200
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,411
- Damn it.
- That's a nice looking car.

201
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,148
O-- oh! Yeah, thanks.

202
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,184
389 cubic inch V-8 engine.

203
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:58,023
Three double barrel carburetors,
speed, performance, handling.

204
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,292
Back in the day...

205
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,561
the girls loved it.

206
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,766
Would you mind if I, uh...

207
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,503
Yeah, be my guest.

208
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,343
Yeah, there she is.

209
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,644
Alright.

210
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,346
Turn it over.

211
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,681
Okay.

212
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,457
How the hell did you do that?

213
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,426
Ah, beginner's luck.

214
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,563
And I designed it.

215
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,966
You designed it?
What, what, you designed what?

216
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,704
What, you designed the GTO?

217
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,575
Holy shit. Holy shit.

218
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,377
You're John DeLorean,
aren't you?

219
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,216
Amazing. Well, that, I... Hey,
great job on this, you know.

220
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,484
I mean, Shakespeare writes
a play, he at least

221
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,652
gets to put his name on it.

222
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,554
Well, I might do that yet.

223
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,357
Yeah. Uh... Hey, hold on
a second, okay? Will you?

224
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,326
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

225
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,931
- Where are the beers?
- In the fridge!

226
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,933
No, I'm in the fridge here.

227
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,234
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got 'em. I got 'em.

228
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,802
Thank you.

229
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,942
- You a pilot?
- Um... Here you go.

230
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,677
- I-- I used to be.
- Good.

231
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,911
You know, it's been a long time

232
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,347
since I got my hands dirty.

233
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,949
Well, I mean, you know,
if it's in the blood

234
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,685
it's in the blood.

235
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,054
Ha, John DeLorean!

236
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,557
In my house?
It's something else.

237
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,593
Uh, so, I mean, what are you...
What are you doing now?

238
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,962
You-- you still over
at the GM, yeah?

239
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,698
No, I got out of that racket.

240
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,234
Now, I'm working on something
for myself.

241
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,403
Um. Nice. Nice. Good for you.

242
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,606
What, um, may I ask, um...

243
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,008
She still doesn't sound right.

244
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,780
So what, they,
they won't let you

245
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,615
do your own thing
over a Pontiac?

246
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,984
Oh, Christ, no. General Motors.

247
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,119
Ford. Chrysler.

248
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,155
There's hasn't been a single
honest to God innovation

249
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,590
in 20 years,
all they do is tinker.

250
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,992
They'll, uh,

251
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,227
smooth a corner
or automate a wiper

252
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,496
and hype it as
some great new model.

253
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,765
Oh! Oh-oh.
Better get that.

254
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,735
- But it's all just bullshit.
- Oh, where are you?

255
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,070
Oh, here it is.

256
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,439
Ah! Shit! Shh!

257
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,808
- You alright?
- Yeah.

258
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,944
I cut myself.
Fucking rust bucket.

259
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,013
Take this.

260
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,514
Oh. Thanks.

261
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,149
I think you'll live.

262
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,619
Rust.

263
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,354
Every car in America is dying

264
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,157
the minute
it leaves the factory.

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,660
But my car...

266
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,929
now my car is...

267
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:58,002
My car will be made of
brushed stainless steel.

268
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,871
Rear mounted engine.

269
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,507
The underbody will be
made of two large molded parts.

270
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,843
uh, the frame and the body are
one and it's made of

271
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,846
of stainless steel, you see,
so, it'll last forever.

272
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,347
It'll be safest car on the road.

273
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,982
- Mm.
- And, um, and airbags, Jim.

274
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,151
- Do you know about airbags?
- Uh, no.

275
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,620
I want this car
under 2200 pounds.

276
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,021
0 to 60 in 8 seconds.

277
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,323
20 miles per gallon
in the city,

278
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,191
30 miles per gallon
on the highway.

279
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,728
I want a suspension system
that is designed by a computer.

280
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,030
And the doors, Jim...

281
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,867
The doors... Heh.

282
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,538
- They're gull-winged.
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,340
- Right?
- Look at this, they're some...

284
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,408
Oh, sorry, um...

285
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,177
Yeah, it's like science fiction
or something.

286
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,812
It's the future.

287
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,480
- They lift straight up.
- Oh.

288
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,216
Right? You can park it
almost anywhere.

289
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,318
It's more expensive 'cause
you've got to counter balance it

290
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,887
against gravity,
but it's worth it.

291
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,688
Sure, sure, so, you just
kinda come up with, like, uh

292
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,424
an affordable
anti-gravity device.

293
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,626
And, uh...

294
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,729
I-- I-- I don't know
what I'm talking about.

295
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,163
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha...

296
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,433
- Well, just you wait.
- Oh, yeah. He-he.

297
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,269
So what are you you doing
on Friday?

298
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,774
So, guess what? We got invited
to a party on Friday.

299
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,042
- Oh.
- Yeah.

300
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,578
So why don't you...

301
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,113
Um, yeah, get your hair done.

302
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,617
- Whatever you say, Rockefeller.
- Ha-ha.

303
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,722
¶ Let your body go
you know you can do it ¶

304
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:29,060
¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo
there's really nothin' to it ¶

305
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:33,031
¶ Dance let your body go
you know you can do it ¶

306
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:37,468
¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo
there's really nothin' to it ¶

307
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,804
¶ You can do it
and you know... ¶¶

308
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,774
- Hey. How's it hangin', Ben?
- Don't call me Ben.

309
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,375
I'm Special Agent.

310
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,779
Special Agent. Okay.

311
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,115
You don't make your wife
call you that at home, do you?

312
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,952
You really wanna talk wives,
Jim?

313
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,486
I don't know why you bother
with the charade,

314
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,088
it'd be a lot less stress
if you just told her

315
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,457
what you're really doing
to pay the bills.

316
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,327
What doesn't pay the bills,
Special Agent?

317
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,928
Well, it's your choice
if you want to live high end

318
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,997
on the pay of a low end snitch.

319
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,073
I'm not a snitch, you know?

320
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,442
I'm a paid employee
of the United States government.

321
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,077
That's what I said.

322
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,845
- Just coffee, thanks.
- Okay.

323
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,348
Um, I'll take
half a grapefruit please.

324
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,582
And the smallest scone
you got.

325
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,817
Alright.

326
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,854
So, what's it been, Jim?
A couple of months?

327
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:30,989
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

328
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,123
Yeah. Settling in alright?

329
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,524
You-- you like the house okay?

330
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,326
- Oh, I love the house.
- Kids happy in school?

331
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,695
Uh, I mean, as happy as any kid
during school, right?

332
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,163
Getting along
with the neighbors okay?

333
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,798
Oh, yeah, getting along great.

334
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,133
You know John DeLorean
actually lives on our block.

335
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,668
- All sounds pretty idyllic.
- Yeah?

336
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,436
Yeah. No, it is.
It's pretty idyllic.

337
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,638
Do you think something's missing
missing from this equation now?

338
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,141
Something a little...
imbalanced?

339
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,276
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe. I...

340
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:53,878
Maybe? Listen.

341
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,280
We're not in the business
of arresting

342
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,483
every street corner dealer
that catches your eye.

343
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,218
We've got bigger fish to fry.

344
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,953
Uh, no. No, no, no. Hey, look.

345
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,222
I told ya, I can't go there,
okay? The guy'll kill me.

346
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,457
Well, there's two versions
of the Morgan Hetrick story.

347
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,126
Version one, he's your pal,

348
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,660
and yet he sent you to Bolivia

349
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,330
and he hid a shitload of coke
in your plane.

350
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,965
Or you're in cahoots.

351
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,803
Your buddy organizes more
flights than Pan-Am.

352
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,272
He flies in half the coke
that comes into California.

353
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,709
Your buddy, Morgan Hetrick,
has millions

354
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,844
sitting in the Cayman Islands
he can't access

355
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,212
and we'd like to get
our hands on it.

356
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,914
So, you have a choice.

357
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,750
You work with us on this,

358
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,119
we bring him in, you go free.

359
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,655
You say no,

360
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,857
we fuck you out
of your nice house,

361
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,359
you go to prison,

362
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,094
your wife goes to prison

363
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,862
as an accessory

364
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,265
and your kids go in
to the system.

365
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,436
Actually, you don't have
a choice.

366
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,453
¶ I'm lucky so lucky ¶

367
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,720
Boy, look at this place.

368
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,855
How is this house across

369
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,856
the street from our house?

370
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,858
Hi...

371
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,027
- Well, not bad.
- Jim.

372
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,628
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

373
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,030
- Good. How are you?
- Oh.

374
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,398
- Great.
- Heh-heh.

375
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Hi, I'm Cristina,
I'm John's wife.

376
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,901
- Ellen.
- So great to meet you.

377
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,570
You look so lovely.

378
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,138
Well, let me introduce you.

379
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,940
- Come on.
- Okay. Um...

380
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,944
- Ladies, this is Ellen.
- Hi.

381
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,946
Ellen's Jim
is in the airline business.

382
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,314
- Oh, neat.
- Yes.

383
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,915
We just moved in
across the street.

384
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,550
- Oh.
- Oh, lovely.

385
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,752
- Hi. Uh, can I get a drink?
- Yes, sir.

386
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,822
Um, whiskey on the rocks,
please.

387
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,826
Ladies and gentlemen!

388
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,062
Come out of the bar!

389
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,464
Come out of the half rooms.
Gather around.

390
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,933
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce you

391
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,636
to a man who needs
no introduction.

392
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,006
The most successful
auto executive in living memory.

393
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:05,243
The youngest ever, head of
a division at General Motors

394
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,612
and now founder
of the DeLorean Motor Company,

395
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,248
I give you Mr. John DeLorean.

396
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,316
- Thank you.
- Glad to meet you.

397
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,651
It's good to see you here.

398
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,253
Oh, hey, thank you so much.

399
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,255
Well, thank you, Bill.

400
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,323
Thank you, all. Um...

401
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,492
Boy, it's lovely
to see you all here,

402
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,462
um, but you know there's no
such thing as a free beer...

403
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,498
So you'll have to listen to me

404
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,100
bang the drum for our new car.

405
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,137
I know some of you
haven't signed up yet,

406
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,106
and I wanted to show you
something I received

407
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,774
in the mail today.

408
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,676
- It's a check...
- Ooh.

409
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,113
From a new investor
for $600,000.

410
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,848
- Wow.
- Yeah.

411
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,817
And, uh, what's the name
on that check?

412
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,452
It's a Mr. Johnny Carson.

413
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,393
And that's all well and good,
but I...

414
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,129
You know I wanted
to get serious for a minute.

415
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,298
In the America I grew up in,

416
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,868
a man was defined
by the work he did.

417
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,804
But there was precious
little work to be had.

418
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,339
Very few opportunities.

419
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,910
But that didn't stop me
from dreaming.

420
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,414
My father,

421
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,316
oh, he knew hard times.

422
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,585
But he was a smart man.

423
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,653
He said, "It's okay to dream

424
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,156
as long as you combine
those dreams

425
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,325
with hard work."

426
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,493
When I was 14,

427
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,662
he bought this battered down,
old Chevy

428
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,198
and took it apart
into 500 pieces

429
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
on our front lawn.

430
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,669
He said, "Son,

431
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,772
if you can put that car
back together, then it's yours."

432
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,210
And that's exactly what I did.

433
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,346
Three days and nights
it took me.

434
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,515
I didn't eat or sleep,
but I did it.

435
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,219
And when it was done...

436
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,389
that car drove like a dream.

437
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,425
And that is my intention
with the DeLorean motorcar,

438
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,295
to build a dream car,

439
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:08,799
something the great American
public can aspire to owning.

440
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,203
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
great pleasure to present to you

441
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,439
the latest design
for the DeLorean motor car.

442
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,774
Uh, Roy, Bill.

443
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,754
We're going to design a car,

444
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:31,489
we're going to build a factory,

445
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,625
we are going
to create 2000 jobs,

446
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,728
we are going to produce
30,000 cars a year

447
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,565
and we are going to do it all
in 18 months.

448
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,801
If you haven't signed up yet,

449
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,671
what are you waiting for?

450
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,808
- Nice job.
- Roy.

451
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,078
You know that's so amazing...

452
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,713
Everybody...

453
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,184
You really think
he can pull this off?

454
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,586
- Oh, I know he can.
- Yeah?

455
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,688
How long you been working
with him?

456
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,156
Since the very beginning.

457
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,457
Hey, good to see you.
Good to see you.

458
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,692
I want you take a look
at that car.

459
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,461
It's a good looking car.
Thank you.

460
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:28,546
¶ Tu-ru-rut tu tu-ru ¶

461
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,349
¶ Winner take all ¶

462
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,651
¶ Winner
take all ¶

463
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,020
¶ Winner take all ¶

464
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,355
¶ Winner take all... ¶

465
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,027
Uh, what do you say we go home
and see what happens?

466
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,628
Yeah, it's starting to rain
in here.

467
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,031
Mm-hm.

468
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,666
- It's the DeLoreans.
- Okay, okay.

469
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,136
Thank you so much
for a lovely evening.

470
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,705
Oh, thank you. It was lovely
to finally have you over.

471
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,374
- It's a beautiful house.
- Oh, thanks.

472
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,875
- Really. Absolutely.
- Jim, right?

473
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,643
- Yes, sir.
- Bill Mercer.

474
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,646
Vice president of whatever
the fuck he has me doing next.

475
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,548
- That's my wife, Ellen.
- Hi.

476
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,816
Why don't you
join us downstairs?

477
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,917
We're just lettin'
our hair down,

478
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,152
now that the pressure's off.

479
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,720
Oh, yeah. Uh-- uh,
that'd be great.

480
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,089
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, fine.

481
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,324
I'll see you tonight.

482
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,896
That husband of yours
is quite the charmer.

483
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,765
Only until you get to know him.

484
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,034
After tonight,
we have 175 dealers signed up.

485
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,936
That's $25,000 each,

486
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,572
plus a commitment to take
100 cars in the first year.

487
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,608
It needs to be 250, 300.

488
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,476
We'll get there, John.
It's a done deal.

489
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,782
- Nice shot.
- He-he-he.

490
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,118
You serve.

491
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,753
What so funny?

492
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,557
Guys, I've been around,
I know when I'm being pitched.

493
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,393
Uh-- uh, look, I-- I-- I know
I'm living in a nice house

494
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,262
in a swanky neighborhood,
but, uh,

495
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,197
I'm behind on the rent
and I don't know

496
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,865
where next month's is coming
from, so if you're looking

497
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,268
for an investment from me,
you might be, uh...

498
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,702
Well, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

499
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,373
Well, fuck you then.

500
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,091
If you're runnin' low on cash,
maybe you'd like to earn some.

501
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,961
- Ooh. Ooh-ooh.
- Oh?

502
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:28,098
Sure, I'm always up
for a little table tennis.

503
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,401
You mean, ping-pong?

504
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:32,403
Yeah. I call it table tennis.

505
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,804
Jim, it's ping-pong.

506
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,941
Alright.

507
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,077
Alright, 50 bucks if you can
take a point off me.

508
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,446
Hmm, I believe I might be

509
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,182
getting hustled here, sir, huh?

510
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,750
How do you hold this thing?
Is this right?

511
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,486
- Yeah, exactly like that.
- Am I doing this right?

512
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,488
Stop fuckin' around, come on.

513
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,256
Alright, John.

514
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,657
Alright.

515
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,838
Ooh!

516
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,448
Uh-oh.

517
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:25,055
Oh, no, John, John, come on.
Don't worry about it.

518
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,158
I mean, hell,
it's only table tennis, right?

519
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,361
Let me walk you out.

520
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,032
You know, Jim, I'm sorry
you're havin' a hard time.

521
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,035
And if there's anything I can do
to help, you let me know.

522
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,504
Oh, yeah. No, I mean,
I got a few things cookin'.

523
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,039
But, uh, I mean,
it should all work out,

524
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,641
but thank you for the thought.

525
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,743
Ah, that's what friends are for.

526
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,144
Yeah.

527
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,083
You know,
the thing about ping-pong...

528
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,885
When the game
first came to America

529
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,021
it was trademarked ping-pong
by these guys,

530
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:58,489
the Parker Brothers.

531
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,991
And they kept a strict control
over that name,

532
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,894
but it still made it
into the lexicon.

533
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,563
It's not a car.

534
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,565
It's not a sports car.

535
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,401
It's a DeLorean.

536
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,037
Hmm.

537
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,672
Yeah.

538
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,640
You don't hang out much,
do you?

539
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,009
Well, uh...

540
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,013
- I travel a lot. I do.
- Yeah.

541
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,582
Hey, speakin' of which,
do you want me

542
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,884
to keep an eye on the house
when you guys are gone?

543
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,552
You know,
like clean the pool or...

544
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,087
This area probably
turns into a jungle--

545
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,456
Well, that would be, um...

546
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,291
Alright, I-- I can arrange
payment.

547
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,960
No, no, John, John, come on.

548
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,394
You don't have to pay me.

549
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,196
Really. It's okay.

550
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,398
Thank you, Jim.

551
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,934
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

552
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,540
I'm kidding, come here.

553
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,543
There it is.

554
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,080
Friends hug.

555
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:58,716
Alright, uh, please tell
Cristina thank you

556
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,050
from both me and Ellen.

557
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,004
Check, check, check.

558
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,917
<i>Hi, I was looking</i>
<i>for Morgan.</i>

559
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,887
- Who wants to know?
- Jim. Jim Hoffman.

560
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:38,756
I'll go check.

561
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,526
Check, check, check, check...

562
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,827
What?

563
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,696
- What's that?
- Check.

564
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,198
Please go check, yeah.
Thank you.

565
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,233
Alright.

566
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,954
- He says, come on in.
- Oh, well, I mean, you know...

567
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,489
If he's busy, I can always come
back another time.

568
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,957
Get in here!

569
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,359
Okay, yeah.

570
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,568
Jim Hoffman.

571
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,339
Hey, Morgan, hi.

572
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,809
- Long time, Jim.
- Uh, the place looks great.

573
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,077
You know, so do you.

574
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,513
Um, so, you still flyin'?

575
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,716
Where's my three million bucks?

576
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,918
Come on, Morgan,
we talked about this, okay?

577
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,520
- You know what happened.
- Well, I thought I did.

578
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,723
- And then you disappeared.
- I... No, I... No.

579
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,192
No, I didn't disappear.
No, no, I-- I just, you know,

580
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,260
I had to lie low for a while.
But I'm not hiding.

581
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,663
I wasn't, you know.
We're in the phonebook.

582
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,832
So, it's, yeah,
at least had to

583
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,401
go straight, you know for the...
for the family, so...

584
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,069
I'm-- I'm now doing some
consulting work

585
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,437
now with John DeLorean.

586
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,106
You know, the car guy?

587
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,408
So, he's makin'
this amazing car.

588
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,410
It's a car... It's got wings.

589
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,178
A flying car?

590
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,581
No, I mean, it doesn't fly,
you know it's just that--

591
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,750
- A flying car that doesn't fly.
- Yeah.

592
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,019
Sound like a sure fire fucking
hit to me, Jim!

593
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,223
- Yeah, I know it's a littl--
- A flying car?

594
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:21,558
- That doesn't fuckin' fly.
- What're you doin', Morgan?

595
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,794
- Come on.
- What do you think, Katy? Huh?

596
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:26,096
I should just whack
this motherfucker?

597
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,598
Sure, why not?

598
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,233
- Come on, man...
- Hey, wait, Morgan. Stop.

599
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,901
- Calm down, okay.
- Calm down?

600
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,536
- Yeah, I'm your friend.
- You're my friend?

601
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,238
- Yeah! I was at your wedding.
- You know what?

602
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,206
My ex-wife
was at my wedding, Jim.

603
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,875
She fucked me over, too!

604
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39,643
- Okay, that's a bad example.
- That is a bad example.

605
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:40,978
I'm gonna bash
your fuckin' head in.

606
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,079
Come on, Morgan, stop it.

607
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,380
- Stop it?
- Yeah.

608
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,481
What the fuck
are you doin' here, Jim?

609
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,283
The FBI!

610
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,554
Okay?

611
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,755
They came to talk to me.

612
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:53,390
They're askin' questions
about you.

613
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,726
- FBI? What kind of questions?
- Yeah.

614
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,461
Like, how we met,
how long we know each other--

615
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,562
And what did you
fuckin' tell them, Jim?

616
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,097
I told them the truth, okay?

617
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,899
- You told them the truth?
- Well, not everything.

618
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,001
Obviously, but, come on, Morgan,
look, look, look, look, look.

619
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,502
I may be many things, okay?

620
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,504
But I'm not a snitch.

621
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,100
Forgetting something?

622
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,504
Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

623
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,206
Hi, how are you?

624
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,640
Tape, the fucking tape.

625
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,442
The tape, yes, right.
Uh, I dumped it.

626
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,978
I dumped it.
I had to dump it.

627
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,379
- You dumped it?
- Yeah, the tape, the wire.

628
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,348
The whole thing,
I-- I-- I got rid of it.

629
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,050
- You dumped it where?
- In the trash.

630
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,284
But, no, no, no.
It's fine. It's okay.

631
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,319
Don't worry. It's good.
It's fine.

632
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,520
- It's fine?
- Yeah.

633
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,654
So he just goes to take out

634
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,389
the trash and he finds it.

635
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,725
And then it just fucks our whole
operation, but it's fine.

636
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,460
I got nervous.
I'm not Mr. Fuckin' Superspy.

637
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,962
- Jesus Christ, Jim.
- Okay, okay.

638
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,130
But, hey, at least
he and I are talking now.

639
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,565
That's a good thing.

640
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,167
I mean, we discussed,
the-- the, uh, money

641
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,902
in the Cayman's
and how to access it.

642
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:14,705
But we only have your word
for it and that's worth shit.

643
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,673
Look, from now on,

644
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,042
every time you see that fucker
you're wearing a wire.

645
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,143
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

646
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,145
Wh-- which I, you know,

647
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,480
I could say brings me
to my second issue.

648
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,082
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

649
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,583
Hey, look, hey, hold on, okay,
look, I realize that

650
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,718
you and I, we have never, uh...

651
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,319
We never discussed about my, uh,

652
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,255
you know, my cut.

653
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,522
- Your cut?
- Yeah, my cut.

654
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,825
My, you know, my percentage.

655
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:37,928
Look, man, Morgan finds out
what I'm doing, I'm a dead man.

656
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,731
It's only fair
that I'm, you know, entitled to

657
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:43,066
a little piece of whatever
you recoup from him, right?

658
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,935
You know what, just maybe
a little tiny piece.

659
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,404
You know, something like, um...

660
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,072
Well, I don't know what's fair.
Ten percent? Ten percent?

661
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,341
- Hm. Alright.
- A little. Yeah. Just a sliver.

662
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,343
- Entitled?
- Yeah, yeah.

663
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,711
Well, you see it's pretty
simple, Jim.

664
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,747
We have a way of working
these things out.

665
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,550
You get ten percent
of suck my fucking dick!

666
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,253
You're already
a paid government informant.

667
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,522
- Am I? Barely I would say. I--
- Jim.

668
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,857
- What?
- Must I remind you?

669
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,091
I'm the only thing

670
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,094
standing between you and prison.

671
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,931
Your job is to hook
Morgan Hetrick.

672
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,766
Is he hooked?
Isn't that why I'm here?

673
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,634
'Cause the last I checked,
he was in the Cayman Islands

674
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,902
countin' his fuckin' money.

675
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,203
I told you it was gonna take...

676
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,271
It's gonna take a little time

677
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,739
for me to earn back his trust.

678
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,107
I think you've been
spending so much time

679
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,475
partying with John DeLorean,
you forgot

680
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,910
what you're supposed
to be doing here.

681
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,146
I need less champagne...

682
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,248
- More cocaine.
- That's clever, you know.

683
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,417
And if you've got some sort of
misplaced loyalty

684
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,585
to Morgan or you think
you're protecting your family

685
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,555
by fucking this shit up,
you're sadly fuckin' mistaken.

686
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,923
The next time you call me,

687
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,224
it better be
for a good fuckin' reason.

688
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,626
Ten fuckin' percent?

689
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:46,396
The FBI will never ever
pay you ten percent.

690
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,032
You owe us. We don't owe you.

691
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,804
Your next check
is gonna be short a 126 bucks,

692
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,340
because that's how much
those wires cost.

693
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,508
Hey.

694
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,711
I could probably get you a
better deal on those, you know?

695
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,999
Hey, that's a groovy little
camera you got.

696
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,467
- Hello.
- Betamax, man.

697
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,202
Uh-huh.

698
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,703
Any money you're not putting
into DeLorean,

699
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,005
put it into Betamax.

700
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,406
What money?

701
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,844
I don't know
why she bothers with him.

702
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,648
You know, he's chained
by a grandmaster.

703
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,883
Really?

704
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,619
Oh.

705
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,964
James Hoffman.
What is that German?

706
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,399
Yeah, I guess so.

707
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,667
You know, Jim,
everything is out there.

708
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,302
It just takes a bit of leg work.

709
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,470
But that's what I do.

710
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,908
I gotta say,
most people are kinda straight.

711
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,344
But every once in a while,
you come up against someone

712
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,047
who's just 90 % bullshit.

713
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,582
Wants to hitch a ride.

714
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,853
The thing is, I haven't been
able to turn up

715
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,288
anything about you at all.

716
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,258
That worries me.

717
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,395
Yeah, that worries me too,
actually.

718
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,464
Oh.

719
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,835
- Hey, Ellen.
- Yeah?

720
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:34,838
Roy here thinks
I'm 90 % bullshit.

721
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,006
Ninety?

722
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,912
James D'Jong.

723
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,014
Or is it D'Yong?

724
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:48,085
- This is your birth name?
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:52,889
Is your wife even aware
that you are James D'Jong?

726
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,391
I mean, I think so. I-- I...

727
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:57,294
I actually don't know
if it's ever come up.

728
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,730
And what about Mr. DeLorean,
was he aware of your real name?

729
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,632
Your checkered history?

730
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,534
- I believe he was.
- You believe?

731
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,971
- You-- you discussed it?
- No, but I alluded to it.

732
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,407
One of his executives
had me background checked.

733
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,610
Background check on a man
who has no criminal history,

734
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,278
never spent a night in prison,

735
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,315
has only filed one
somewhat suspect tax return

736
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,983
in the last ten years?

737
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:22,385
What background was there
to check?

738
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,754
James D'jong on the other
hand...

739
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:29,326
Well, one can see why you might
wanna change your name.

740
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,294
Hmm.

741
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,402
Oh, don't worry about him.

742
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:43,240
He's just antsy because
we're stalled on the money.

743
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,341
What're you talkin' about?
I thought you guys were

744
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:45,642
signin' 'em up left and right.

745
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,910
Not gonna raise 90 million

746
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,913
with penny antique
car dealerships.

747
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,582
GM thinks they've created
a monster and it scares them.

748
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,087
If Detroit is scared of you,
so is corporate America.

749
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,025
The fact is, I don't think
I've got a chance in hell

750
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,027
of raising 90 million.

751
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,297
So take it somewhere else.

752
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,599
Just like that, right?

753
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,001
I'm being serious.

754
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:13,837
Look, John...

755
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,041
Roy digs deep enough

756
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:20,177
he's probably gonna find
something you're not gonna like.

757
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,481
Truth is, I've flown

758
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,883
all kinds of shit
all over the world.

759
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:30,887
Bangkok, Bolivia...
There're all types of people.

760
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:36,393
The one thing I've learned is
that there is a deal to be made

761
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,461
everywhere, always.

762
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,332
Right now we might be livin' in,

763
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,167
oh, sad cynical times,

764
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:47,270
but you're the goddamn
American dream, man.

765
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,808
People around the world
love that shit.

766
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,477
So I say, you know,
they don't love you here...

767
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,413
just, uh, take it
somewhere they will.

768
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,448
Bring the American dream
to them.

769
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:07,657
It's an entire Atlantic ocean
away from your primary market

770
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,594
and it's in the middle
of a fucking warzone.

771
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:11,895
Do you know
how many people were killed

772
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,565
in Northern Ireland last year?
Ninety.

773
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,235
Do you know how many people
were murdered in Detroit?

774
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,669
Nine hundred!

775
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:20,870
Do the fucking math.

776
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,573
You'd be starting from scratch.

777
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,543
The last thing they built
was the Titanic.

778
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,745
It's
John DeLorean's new sports car,

779
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,413
the DMC12.

780
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,415
Thirty thousand a year,
the production target

781
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,384
for the Northern Ireland plant,

782
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:37,687
with the first cars
to go to dealers this fall.

783
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,055
Oh! What's wrong?

784
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,057
Is your little buddy
in a faraway land

785
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,360
and can't come out and play?

786
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,228
Mm-hmm.

787
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,230
It think it's cute how you
always gets sad

788
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,531
when he's out of town.

789
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,033
Oh, come on.

790
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,301
The British
government spent

791
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,104
$120 million
for the plant.

792
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,773
For John DeLorean,
it's the realization of a dream

793
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,876
that started a long time ago.

794
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,811
<i>So for 18 months,</i>

795
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:06,082
while John DeLorean
was building his factory

796
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:10,387
providing jobs, helping bring
peace to a blighted country

797
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,255
you barely heard from.

798
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,324
No, you're not understanding
what I'm saying, okay?

799
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,893
Look, we'll... I will set up
the meeting, okay?

800
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,261
<i>Well, I was tryin' to get</i>

801
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,729
<i>Morgan Hetrick to part</i>
<i>with his money.</i>

802
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,398
If we set up a meeting,
you probably will.

803
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,632
See, she's smart.

804
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,067
Look, are you gonna
call him or not?

805
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,835
I'm on it. Alright?

806
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,470
The Dayglow Bank.

807
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:35,445
<i>For 18 months, that is</i>
<i>a... that is a very long time.</i>

808
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:36,746
<i>Yeah, well, he had three</i>
<i>million reasons</i>

809
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:37,814
<i>not to trust me.</i>

810
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:45,021
Mr. Hoffman, we've heard of your
escapades in the drug business.

811
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,756
Yet, no jail time.

812
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,926
We've heard of your dealings
with nefarious criminals,

813
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,128
yet still alive
to tell the tale.

814
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,165
Mr. Hoffman, it must be said

815
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,600
you live a charmed life.

816
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,202
Not sure my wife would agree
with you.

817
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,373
We never seem to really get
ahead of ourselves, you know?

818
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,775
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you'll get there.

819
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,510
Now, just look at John,
one minute

820
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,346
he's tryin'
to sweet talk car dealers.

821
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,981
The next, he's got
this office on Park Avenue.

822
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:14,617
- Park Avenue.
- Oh, my God, yes.

823
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,119
You should see it.

824
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,687
Marble everywhere.

825
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,523
Marble.

826
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,559
Fuck them and fuck their marble.

827
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,461
What... What're you
talkin' about? Who? Who? Who?

828
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:25,962
- What's wrong?
- John and Cristina.

829
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,031
It's marble this
and marble that.

830
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,999
- Why don't we have any marble?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

831
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,501
What are you doing? Come here.
Here, look at me.

832
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:34,003
Hey, marble's only good
for two things, okay?

833
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,740
Gravestones and marbles.

834
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,308
You do know
marbles aren't made of marble,

835
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,211
they're made of glass.

836
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,579
I don't know that.
I had no idea. I-- I didn't...

837
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,680
I didn't know that.

838
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,382
What would I do without you?

839
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,917
I would run around
sounding like a dipshit.

840
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,053
Hey, look, baby. You know,
you got to realize something.

841
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,821
In the America that I grew up in

842
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,324
a man was defined
by the work that he did.

843
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:57,093
But it never stopped me
from dreaming, okay?

844
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,363
When I was nine months old,
my daddy

845
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,365
bought me a beat up,
old Chevrolet.

846
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,602
He broke it down
to 42,000 pieces

847
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:08,605
and I put it together
with my hands and my tool.

848
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:11,841
My tool! What? What? What?

849
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,086
I know
it's incredibly complicated,

850
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,554
but you just have to trust me.

851
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,122
I do trust you,
but then...

852
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,757
you can't move money around
like that.

853
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,059
- Why not? It's my money.
- No, it's not.

854
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,461
Christ, John.
If someone finds out--

855
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:34,097
Well, that's why
we're switching...

856
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,366
Jim.

857
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,368
Jim!

858
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,637
What?

859
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,207
Hurry! Hurry! Quick.

860
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,409
- Jim, come here. Look.
- What's goin' on?

861
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:48,445
I think it's clear
what's going on.

862
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,081
Oh, come on.

863
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,783
They work together.

864
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,984
Something's going on.

865
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,319
He's just trying
to calm her down.

866
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,954
I-- I don't know
what the big deal is.

867
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,889
Oh, my God, you think
you're so good with people,

868
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,926
but you don't even see when it's
right in front of your face.

869
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:03,960
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

870
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,962
H-- He's so full of shit.

871
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,764
- He cheats at chess.
- How do you know?

872
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,799
- You don't play chess.
- And now this thing with Molly.

873
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,234
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.

874
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,802
John is as straight
as an arrow, he is.

875
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,938
You think that,
but look at his chin.

876
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,573
That's where
the bullshit starts.

877
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,174
Okay, I'm sorry, his chin?

878
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,642
Wh-- what about his chin?

879
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,277
Haven't you ever looked
at those old pictures

880
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,946
hanging in their house?

881
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,515
He has no chin.

882
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,784
Now he has a chin.
Think about it.

883
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,986
- Really?
- Think about...

884
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,322
- Hey, uh, I better go, okay?
- What is that?

885
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,590
What time are you
pickin' up the kids from school?

886
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,024
- Baby! Baby!
- It's a button.

887
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,627
What is that? No, no, no, no!
This...

888
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,796
- What the fuck?
- It's just a gadget that...

889
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,098
- Oh, shit! Okay--
- What is going on?

890
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,633
Let me explain, okay?
I-- I-- I'll explain.

891
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,034
- What's going on?
- It's not a big deal, hon.

892
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,669
Okay, here, look, look, look.

893
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,037
Let's just sit down
and I'll explain everything.

894
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,772
No, no, no, no, no, you sit down

895
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,774
and you tell me
what the fuck?

896
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,042
- Here, it's no big deal--
- Sit!

897
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,979
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, look, I...

898
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,448
Okay, no better way to say it
than just to say it, right?

899
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,217
You know, I can beat around the
bush or sugar coat, I'm gonna--

900
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,052
I'm about to lose
my shit right now.

901
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,521
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

902
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,122
Look, I, um...

903
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,225
I... I work for the FBI.

904
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,194
- You're in the FBI?
- Yes.

905
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,830
I mean, no.
No, I-- I-- I'm not in the FBI.

906
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:15,832
I-- I work for the FBI.

907
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,734
You know, u-- undercover,
like a spy.

908
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,536
- You're a spy?
- Exactly, yeah. Or no!

909
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,971
No, I'm not a spy. I'm...

910
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,140
They would classify me
as an informant.

911
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,643
But I am part of, you know,
President Reagan's

912
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,645
War on Drugs, so I just
never told you about it,

913
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:29,712
because I didn't want you
to worry.

914
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,180
I don't understand.

915
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,649
Well, that's because
it's a lot to take in.

916
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,883
No, no, no. I understand
what you're saying.

917
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,184
But I-- I don't understand

918
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,719
what you're fucking saying.

919
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:38,488
You're in the airplane business.

920
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,690
Well, no, not anymore, but
that's how this all got started.

921
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,559
How long has this been going on?

922
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,494
Ah, six months.
Six months, that's it.

923
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:46,195
I mean, three years total,
I guess.

924
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,564
Three years?

925
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,265
Mm-hmm, yeah, that's all.

926
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:51,100
- Three years.
- Mm-hmm.

927
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,269
- Three fucking years?
- Oh, no, no, baby, baby.

928
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:54,404
- Three fucking years?
- Hey, listen to me.

929
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,872
- You--
- Listen to me.

930
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,774
We moved here to start over.
You promised!

931
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,542
- Hon, we did start over, okay?
- You promised!

932
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,177
- I know, we did.
- You promised me!

933
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,947
Look, it's all incredibly
complicated.

934
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,449
Remember the guy that I told you
about Morgan, Morgan Hetrick?

935
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:08,618
He's the one that organized
our whole Bolivia trip.

936
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,420
- He set you up.
- Yeah, exactly.

937
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,590
He set me up, okay?
Baby, look, I...

938
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,725
They caught me with a plane load
of cocaine, alright?

939
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,860
They were never gonna
just let me walk away, alright?

940
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,228
I have to give them Morgan,

941
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,563
otherwise
they will send me to prison

942
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,398
for a very, very long time.

943
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,801
Okay, and I know that it must be
very upsetting to you to think

944
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,904
about it, but-- but it is
situation that we are in.

945
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,272
- We?
- Yeah, we.

946
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,573
Why we? What's we?

947
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,208
Because you were on the plane
too.

948
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,743
They've been threatening me
with all sorts of stuff.

949
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,144
You wouldn't even believe it
lately.

950
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,212
What they would do with you or

951
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,580
where they'd send our kids.

952
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,815
- It's overwhelming.
- Oh, my God.

953
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:39,882
I mean, I feel so good,
I've been living

954
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:41,150
with this burden for so long,

955
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,819
it feels so good
to finally share it...

956
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,420
- No. Nothing to worry about.
- Oh, my God!

957
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,155
Honey, I'm not happy
about it either, hon.

958
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:48,257
Look, you really think
I wanna take the government

959
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,292
payin' our fuckin' rent.

960
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,927
They pay our rent?

961
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,895
- Yeah, they pay for everything.
- They pay our rent?

962
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,564
Yeah, but not enough in my
opinion, but that's

963
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:55,598
a whole separate issue.

964
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,633
I could really use your help

965
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,934
strategizing about it, you know.

966
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,402
Hey, honey,
look, look, look, look!

967
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:00,837
Once I-- I get through
with this,

968
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,505
then we're home free, alright.

969
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:04,273
I am doing this for us!

970
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,975
Hell, I'm doing this
for America!

971
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,411
You are delusional!

972
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:10,747
What the...
We have children.

973
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,682
- What if this-- this-- this...
- What? Who? Morgan?

974
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,517
- Morgan, what if he finds out?
- He won't.

975
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,918
He won't. He's not gonna.

976
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,120
Hon, look, I've actually
found something

977
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:18,521
that I'm kinda good at.

978
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,756
Fuck you!

979
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,324
Okay, stop. Ellen, stop!

980
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,492
Okay, where-- where
are you goin'?

981
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,993
I'm gonna go and get the kids

982
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,628
and take 'em to my mom.

983
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,030
No, please, don't. Okay,
what do you want me to do?

984
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:28,297
I'll do anything.
What do you want?

985
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,701
- What do I want you to do?
- Yeah.

986
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:34,637
I want you to just stop.

987
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,376
Can you please, please
just stop fucking up my life?

988
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,378
Please.

989
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,615
Every time, every time like
a little piece of sunshine

990
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:48,584
starts to shine, you just come
and you stomp on it.

991
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:53,990
What if this guy comes
and kills us?

992
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:19,482
The DeLorean
is the most awaited sports car

993
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,384
in automotive history.

994
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,821
Drive the DeLorean
and live the dream.

995
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,763
Hey, is this him?

996
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,599
That guy with the flying car?

997
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,703
Yeah, that's him. Yeah.

998
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,406
Looks like your buddy's
flying car's really taken off.

999
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,108
Yeah, you can say that again.

1000
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,878
Hey, you should meet him.

1001
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,447
- Meet John DeLorean?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

1002
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,382
In-- in fact, you know they're
having a party this Saturday.

1003
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,184
You guys should go. Yeah?

1004
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,789
I gotta make a call.
I'll be right back.

1005
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,758
Do you think he would mind?

1006
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:05,128
Morgan. Morgan. Morgan.

1007
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,430
Can we party with John DeLorean?

1008
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,031
Sure, we can.

1009
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:12,201

00:46:46,771 --> 00:46:48,938
¶ Get down on it ¶
¶ Baby baby ¶

1027
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,907
¶ Get down on it ¶
¶ Get on it ¶

1028
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,475
¶ Get down on it ¶

1029
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,210
¶ I say people ¶

1030
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,214
¶ What? ¶
¶ What you gonna do? ¶

1031
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:05,121
¶ You've gotta get
on the groove ¶

1032
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:07,657
¶ If you want your body
to move ¶

1033
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,691
¶ Tell me baby ¶¶

1034
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,293
Cut the music.

1035
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,262
Hello?

1036
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,164
Yeah, hold on just a second.

1037
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,166
Sorry, folks, we'll get back
to the dancing

1038
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,534
in just one second.

1039
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,803
John DeLorean.

1040
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:23,372
I've got Johnny Carson
on the phone.

1041
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,310
Hey, Johnny!

1042
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,711
DeLorean, you sold me

1043
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:29,779
a piece of shit.

1044
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,048
Good joke, Johnny.

1045
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,649
How's it taking those corners?

1046
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,184
God dammit, I'm serious!

1047
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,819
It broke down five minutes
from the showroom.

1048
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,955
Johnny, you've got one
of our first models

1049
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,790
and there's bound
to be teething problem,

1050
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:44,327
so we'll send a new car out to
you first thing in the morning.

1051
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,395
You already did that
and it broke down again,

1052
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:47,964
you fucking fraud!

1053
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,398
What the fuck!

1054
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,534
Hey, that's why
I used the number one

1055
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,970
talk show host
in America, right?

1056
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,073
Alright, let's kick it!

1057
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:00,509
¶ Dancin' dancin' dancin' ¶

1058
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,178
¶ She's a dancin' machine ¶

1059
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,315
¶ Oh babe move it baby ¶
¶ Mmm bop doo wop ¶

1060
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,384
¶ Automatic systematic ¶

1061
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:12,021
¶ Full of color self contained
tuned and gentle... ¶

1062
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,824
Never take a call from that
cocksucker Carson again.

1063
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:17,260
And never ever fucking ever
put him on speaker phone

1064
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,695
unless you know exactly
what he's going to say.

1065
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:23,232
You made me look
like a fucking idiot!

1066
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,868
¶ She's movin'
she's groovin'... ¶¶

1067
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,370
You've been
flapping your mouth

1068
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,105
and you don't know
what you're talking about.

1069
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,040
I know more about this than
the lot of you put together.

1070
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,109
I would keep my mouth shut
if I were you.

1071
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,377
- What, you now threatening?
- Hey, hey, hey!

1072
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:36,345
- Get your hands off...
- Hey, hey, hey!

1073
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:39,181
Everything okay here?

1074
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,517
Everything's fine.

1075
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,286
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1076
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:44,453
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1077
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,289
Mind your own business.

1078
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:49,859
There you are.

1079
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:51,861
I hear you're expecting someone.

1080
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:54,630
Oh, yeah, I hope it's okay,
I invited a couple of friends,

1081
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,632
you know, I...
People I wanted to...

1082
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,871
Uh...

1083
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,243
- Hi.
- Hi.

1084
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:10,079
- Nice to see you.
- You as well.

1085
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,882
You know, it's important
for us that our friends, um,

1086
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:16,218
share in our success and we
wanted to give you something

1087
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,388
as a, uh, a token
of our friendship.

1088
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,830
I will be getting this
in the divorce, anyway.

1089
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,269
¶ Funtime ¶

1090
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:36,973
¶ Strolling
in the sunshine... ¶¶

1091
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,441
So, why did you come back?

1092
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,242
- The sex.
- Oh!

1093
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,914
And I knew what I was getting
into when I married you.

1094
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,751
You're not a bad man.

1095
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,119
You're just an idiot.

1096
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,194
Oh, hell yeah.

1097
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:01,297
Whatever you have to do
just do it,

1098
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:03,032
but finish it.

1099
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,266
Okay.

1100
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:09,271
Hey, Morgan! Hi!

1101
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,173
I-- I didn't think you guys
were gonna make it.

1102
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,142
- Helen. Finally.
- Ellen.

1103
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:16,879
We have heard so much about you.

1104
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:20,116
All lies I'm sure.

1105
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:22,184
I have a migraine,
so I'm gonna go

1106
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,953
drive home
and, um, I'll see you later.

1107
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:27,490
Did the FBI suggest you invite
Mr. Hetrick to the party?

1108
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:28,724
No, that would've been my idea.

1109
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,192
Okay, why? Wha...

1110
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,029
He-- he wasn't an acquaintance
of Mr. DeLorean.

1111
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:34,330
No, sir, not of John.

1112
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,564
Come on, uh,
let me introduce you.

1113
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:36,732
Hey, John. John.

1114
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,167
I-- I-- I just wanna

1115
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,301
introduce you
to a good friend of mine.

1116
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,337
This is Morgan Hetrick and Katy.

1117
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,805
Well, welcome, welcome.

1118
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:45,074
John, I'm hearing great things
about your car.

1119
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,810
What then was the purpose
of inviting a man

1120
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:52,148
who is the subject of a major
FBI investigation

1121
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,716
to a social event

1122
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,719
w-- with your friend
John DeLorean?

1123
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,320
Ah, well, I suppose
in retrospect

1124
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:00,423
I was showing off for Morgan.

1125
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,725
At that point, you know,
John was a pretty big deal.

1126
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,760
Let me get you some drinks.
Come on.

1127
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,266
Cristina.

1128
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:17,206
Why did you bring that man here?

1129
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,908
- Who, Morgan?
- Yeah.

1130
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,609
- Well, I...
- Yeah, Morgan Hetrick.

1131
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:23,579
He's, he's a drug dealer.

1132
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,948
What? He is?

1133
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,917
- A-- are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

1134
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,518
I know him from a long time ago.

1135
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,953
You wanted him to think
that you moved

1136
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,588
with the movers and the shakers.

1137
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,291
- Sure.
- And how'd they get on?

1138
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,793
Was this the beginning
of the alleged plot?

1139
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,029
No, no, but, um,

1140
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,931
Mr. Hetrick certainly
made an impression.

1141
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:47,369
Are you fucking kidding me? This
is the bedroom! Get out of here!

1142
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:49,738
- They're like Ken and Barbie!
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me?

1143
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,273
- Hey, put those back right now!
- Oh...

1144
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,909
She's just so delicious
and elegant.

1145
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,611
We're gonna get out
of this room. Get out.

1146
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,947
Come on. Let's go, guys.
It's important. Okay?

1147
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,716
It's a... Can you put
the dresses back, please? Okay?

1148
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,152
Can you put 'em back? Beautiful
singing voice, alright?

1149
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,588
Oh, I would fuck her for sure.

1150
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,090
Oh, I know you would, baby.

1151
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:09,291
Come on, let's get out
of here, please?

1152
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,559
- Jim, Jim!
- Alright? Please?

1153
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,128
He said to make ourselves
at home!

1154
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,796
- This is not what he meant...
- No, he didn't.

1155
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,598
- But come here.
- What? What're you doing?

1156
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,299
- Okay? I...
- It's worth a blowie.

1157
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,968
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no.
Clean this up.

1158
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,070
- Don't do this in here.
- Oh, this ain't for me, Jim.

1159
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,671
- What're you talking about?
- This is for you.

1160
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,007
No, I'm... What? No, no,
no, no. I'm good, okay?

1161
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,176
I'm not gonna...
What the fuck are you doing now?

1162
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,611
She has so many clothes.

1163
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,779
I just, I wanna see
if she even notices.

1164
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,681
Yeah, she's gonna notice. Okay?
Please, don't put that dress on.

1165
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,150
Jim, I insist.

1166
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,918
If we are gonna work together,

1167
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,952
we gotta be able
to play together.

1168
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,354
I'm not gonna do it, okay?

1169
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,421
- Jim?
- I'm not gonna do it.

1170
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:40,689
Do it, Jim!

1171
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,291
- Do it!
- Do it!

1172
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:43,859
- Do it! Do it!
- Okay. Okay.

1173
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,694
Okay, fine. God, this isn't
funny. I'll do...

1174
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,630
I'm gonna do a, just a,
a half a line here.

1175
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,865
- Okay?
- Yes!

1176
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,133
Good? Good. Okay?

1177
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:52,468
Can we go now, please?
Everybody?

1178
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,602
Let's go.

1179
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,840
Oh, my God. Wh-- wh-- what
is going on right now?

1180
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,177
What was that?
What is going on?

1181
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,281
- Jim...
- Oh, boy. What?

1182
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:06,949
We'd like to cut in
little angel dust.

1183
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,051
- Oh, my God.
- Dad's a little bad.

1184
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,020
Okay, I've noticed.
I really--

1185
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,122
- You okay, Jim?
- That's not, that's not funny.

1186
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:15,691
I'm gonna be fine,
but I need you to...

1187
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,195
Katy! Hey! Hey!

1188
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,667
¶ Boogie no more ¶

1189
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,068
¶ Listen to the music ¶

00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,469
Hey, what you're doing?

1191
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,739
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Come on, now!

00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:47,323
¶ Let's get this show
on the road ¶

1194
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,557
Mm! Mm!

1195
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,226
Don't touch me!

1196
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,627
Yummy!

1197
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:56,732
Shit. Katy!

1198
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,568
What the hell
were you thinking...

1199
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,270
I know, I know, I just...

1200
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:07,176
¶ Listen to the music and... ¶

1201
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,246
She's wearing my dress!

1202
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,214
I've got it under control, okay?

1203
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:13,349
It's fine. Don't worry...

1204
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:15,050
Oh!

1205
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,288
Whoo!

1206
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,925
- Hey, lady?
- Ah! Oh, my...

1207
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,129
Now it's party!

1208
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,766
Hey! Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1209
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,234
Give me your hand.
Get out of the pool.

1210
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:33,535
Hey! Don't do that!

1211
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:35,471
Morgan! Morgan!

1212
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:37,806
- Stop it.
- Morgan!

1213
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,408
Are you fucking kidding?

1214
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,110
Oh, fuck!

1215
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:42,144
Oh, fuck!

1216
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:43,445
Hey.

1217
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:48,917
Hey. Hey.

1218
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:53,789
Goddamn it!

1219
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:58,294
- I got you!
- I love you, baby!

1220
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,595
¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶

1221
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,297
¶ Get down ¶

1222
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:03,565
¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶

1223
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,267
¶ Get down ¶

1224
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:07,836
¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶¶

1225
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,175
John and Cristina are pissed.

1226
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,244
Whole night was a fucking
nightmare!

1227
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:18,614
The only good thing about it
is that you're back home.

1228
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:20,582
Oh, there's one other
good thing.

1229
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:27,189
Oh, that's right.

1230
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,257
Wait...

1231
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:31,827
But where's the key?

1232
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,197
What the hell's this?

1233
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,032
It's a coupon for 25 percent off

1234
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,601
a brand new DeLorean
at our nearest dealer.

1235
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,870
- What the fuck?
- What did you think?

1236
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,939
He was gonna give you
a brand new car?

1237
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,541
Yes! Yeah!

1238
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:47,710
I mean, come on.
The guy's got thousands of 'em.

1239
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:50,612
What... it's a lot better than
this shit.

1240
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:53,882
Mr. Hoffman, did you expect
to benefit financially

1241
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:56,285
from your association
with John DeLorean?

1242
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:57,886
Uh, no, sir.

1243
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:01,623
You didn't repeatedly hint
that a free DeLorean car

1244
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,225
might be in order?

1245
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,194
- No, sir.
- Why not?

1246
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:07,730
You being such a important
consultant.

1247
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:09,465
Uh, well,
to tell you the truth,

1248
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10,632
it wasn't a very good car.

1249
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,235
Flattered to deceive.

1250
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:14,970
Uh, by the time
it came to market

1251
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:16,572
everything original about it
had been striped away.

1252
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,340
I mean, he just couldn't make
the car he wanted to

1253
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:20,242
with the, with the money he had.

1254
00:56:20,244 --> 00:56:22,644
I-- I-- I actually felt
sorry for him at that point

1255
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:25,247
'cause there he was schlepping
himself around the world

1256
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:26,882
attempting to sell this,

1257
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,717
this dream he didn't
even believe in any more.

1258
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,254
Well, that's quite an insight
for a man with no experience.

1259
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,655
Well, I know cars.

1260
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:36,258
You know, John knows cars.
Obviously, he...

1261
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,060
Boils down to the fact that
the car wasn't good enough.

1262
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,528
- You know, just ask him.
- Okay.

1263
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,397
- Mr. Hoffman, I don't think--
- Well, ask him.

1264
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,799
Eh, the car wasn't good enough,
was it, John?

1265
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,541
Am I right? Uh, I mean,
that's the problem here.

1266
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,344
- Not all this other shit.
- Mr. Hoffman!

1267
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:58,547
Settle! Settle down.

1268
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:01,784
Mr. Hoffman,
the car is not on trial here,

1269
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,185
and neither are you.

1270
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:06,789
I know. I know. Sorry.

1271
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,258
- Mr. Weitzman.
- Y-- y-- yes, Your Honor.

1272
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,126
But we are getting
to the crux of the matter.

1273
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,562
Mr. Hoffman,
if cars are clearly your thing

1274
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,597
and the DeLorean was,
in your eyes,

1275
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,634
such a disappointment,
is this perhaps reason enough

1276
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:21,036
to betray your friend
and neighbor?

1277
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,978
Oh, John, just this once.

1278
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,013
Alright, it's okay.

1279
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:32,714
Yeah.

1280
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,051
Fuck!

1281
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,252
John?

1282
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,388
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1283
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,290
No. Don't you say anything.

1284
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,393
If it comes from anyone,
it comes from me.

1285
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:47,429
That bitch! That fucking bitch!
You were right.

1286
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,964
What about Belfast?

1287
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:49,998
Alright.

1288
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,835
Do that.

1289
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:55,103
Molly's gone
to the fucking papers.

1290
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,338
- Fuck!
- Why would she?

1291
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,273
I got to go
to Belfast.

1292
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,341
- Now?
- Mm-hm.

1293
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:00,509
I'll get your case.

1294
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,115
Yep. Bill...

1295
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,018
No, I'm not gonna talk
to every fucking...

1296
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,421
Yeah, I'll take the "Times."
Patch 'em through.

1297
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:15,357
Molly. I told you.

1298
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,659
Hey, John, anything I can do?

1299
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,694
No. No.

1300
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,195
- Should we go?
- No.

1301
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:23,031
- Just finish the caviar. Yeah?
- Yeah.

1302
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:26,201
Yes, Jeff, I absolutely refute
these allegations.

1303
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:29,171
No company in the world has been
subjected to more scrutiny

1304
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,506
from you gentlemen in the press,

1305
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,641
from auditors, from accountants.

1306
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,311
Look, Jeff,
off the record...

1307
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:37,779
Okay. On the record,

1308
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:39,715
she's nothing more than
a glorified secretary,

1309
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,216
and she wasn't even
up to that job.

1310
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,851
Can we go, please?

1311
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,286
There are no such thing
as secret

1312
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:46,355
Swiss bank accounts.

1313
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:48,857
Molly Gibson had absolutely
no access

1314
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,059
to detailed financial records.

1315
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:53,529
That is it.

1316
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:54,863
She had access to everything.

1317
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,566
Fucking everything! Fuck!

1318
00:58:57,568 --> 00:59:00,135
Mr. Hoffman, you are aware
that these allegations

1319
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,905
of financial impropriety
were fully investigated

1320
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,173
by the British government
and dismissed.

1321
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,843
Dismissed. Absolutely.

1322
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:11,413
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth
is that while John DeLorean

1323
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:14,082
was in the eye of the hurricane,
so to speak,

1324
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,685
Mr. Hoffman's sole contribution

1325
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:20,322
was that of a glorified
groundskeeper.

1326
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,591
That is not true.

1327
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,226
I cleaned his pool as well.

1328
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:30,499
Doin' a good job
down there.

1329
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,769
Hey.

1330
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,371
What's up, John?
I didn't know you were back.

1331
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:38,407
Got in last night.

1332
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,412
You want a beer?

1333
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,746
Sure.

1334
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,952
There was a moment there
when it was absolutely perfect.

1335
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:01,129
I don't have the cash
to make payroll.

1336
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,466
Renault is going to stop
supplying our engines.

1337
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:06,201
Of the 8000 cars we've built,

1338
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,470
I've sold maybe 3000.

1339
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,908
I owe Bank of America
$20 million,

1340
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,844
and they own every car
on this side of the Atlantic.

1341
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:19,982
All of their loans
are being called in.

1342
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:23,185
That facility is cancelled.

1343
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,656
Well, I mean, you know,
things could get worse.

1344
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,996
It's over, buddy.

1345
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:36,498
Wait a minute.
That's not... No. Uh-uh.

1346
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,634
No. No, no, no.
I-- I-- I don't believe that.

1347
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,902
Not for a second.
Eh, look...

1348
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,472
You're-- you're gonna
think of something.

1349
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,307
You'll work it out.
You always do, you know.

1350
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,109
You know what? This is a lot
like that-- that...

1351
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:48,477
The car that your
dad bought you.

1352
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,511
No, it is.

1353
01:00:49,513 --> 01:00:51,246
Y-- y-- you got the whole thing

1354
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:53,015
laid out in front of you
in a million pieces,

1355
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:54,916
and-- and what did you do in
that situation?

1356
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:55,951
You put that thing back
together.

1357
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,486
You know, better than new.

1358
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:59,087
Because that's...
I mean, that's who you are.

1359
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,456
I appreciate your optimism, Jim.
But it's no good.

1360
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,525
No, no, no.
Th-- th-- this is not optimism.

1361
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:05,961
That's not what's goin' on here.
This is fact.

1362
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,696
You are a remarkable guy.

1363
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:08,830
You're a force of nature.

1364
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,766
You are.

1365
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,668
Me, I'm full of shit.

1366
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,169
Alright?
But I know I'm full of shit.

1367
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,270
So there's charm in that.
You know? I think.

1368
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,472
I hope. Right?

1369
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:21,209
But, no, really. You,
you actually get stuff done.

1370
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:23,111
Why don't you help me?

1371
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,846
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

1372
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:28,483
I need to raise $30 million
in the next ten days.

1373
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,485
And there's no bank,
no hedge fund,

1374
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,621
no investor who's going to
lend it to me.

1375
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,692
But you know people.

1376
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,701
I...

1377
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:47,703
Now I have a good business.

1378
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:52,808
I can make people very wealthy.

1379
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,010
It's a cash flow problem.
Alright?

1380
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,446
I need to raise
$30 million.

1381
01:01:58,582 --> 01:02:00,248
And you know people.

1382
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:05,153
Bolivia. Thailand.
All the rest of it.

1383
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,657
You know people.

1384
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,664
What are we talking about here,
John?

1385
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:23,338
That I need your help.

1386
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,712
I need this, Jim.

1387
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:34,683
There are 2000 workers
in Belfast that need this.

1388
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,720
You know, the joke is,
I could walk away now

1389
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:40,922
and still be a very rich man.

1390
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,159
But I can't do that.

1391
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:47,462
I'm not that guy.

1392
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,235
Can you help me, Jim?

1393
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,636
- You're early.
- Um-hm.

1394
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,239
DeLorean wants me to set him up

1395
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,308
with $30 million
worth of cocaine.

1396
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,511
What?

1397
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,915
John DeLorean...

1398
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,917
$30 million. Cocaine.

1399
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:43,451
If I put him and Hetrick
together,

1400
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,353
that'd be a pretty sweet deal
for you, yeah?

1401
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:47,956
Wait, wait, wait.
John DeLorean?

1402
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,457
Why on earth would
John DeLorean--

1403
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,093
Who gives a shit?
Hey, you want a big name

1404
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:54,596
for President Reagan?
You wanna stop drowning?

1405
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:58,700
I can give you John DeLorean
on a silver fucking platter.

1406
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:00,769
And I'll do it.

1407
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:03,939
All I ask is that,
my family and I go free,

1408
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,842
my record is expunged...

1409
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:08,109
and I get ten percent
of whatever

1410
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:10,078
Morgan transfers to Davrow.

1411
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:17,018
What's wrong, Special Agent?

1412
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,521
This kind of decision
outside your pay grade?

1413
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,792
I got to make a call.

1414
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,508
Look, we never thought this
whole thing was gonna happen.

1415
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,044
John was looking
for the funds legally but, uh,

1416
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,247
you know, this whole drug thing
was a weird fantasy.

1417
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:46,748
Right.

1418
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,149
But, you know, then, once

1419
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:49,417
the FBI got involved,

1420
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:51,353
they got very excited about it.

1421
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:54,422
And that's when we decided
to bring Davrow in.

1422
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,125
Ah. Davrow.

1423
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:00,161
Yeah, let's talk about Davrow.

1424
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:02,230
<i>There's nothin'</i>
<i>to understand.</i>

1425
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,199
It's a road trip. Okay? The guy
is under a lot of pressure.

1426
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,034
We're all under a lot of
pressure.

1427
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:08,670
Yeah, no, I know. Okay. But his
has a few more decimal points.

1428
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:12,073
Okay? I'm just introducing him
to a banker right now.

1429
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:22,684
Budget Rental Car's
talking about

1430
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,519
taking a thousand cars.

1431
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,388
They figure there are a lot of
people who don't necessarily

1432
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,623
want to own a DeLorean,
but they would love

1433
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,625
to experience driving one.

1434
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,195
John.

1435
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:37,365
- John.
- I just can't keep doing this.

1436
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:41,736
They walk us up the aisle and
fuck us before we take our vows.

1437
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,571
Alright, I got this other
meeting to go to.

1438
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,273
- Are we set?
- All set.

1439
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,042
- What other meeting?
- You're doin' a great job.

1440
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,811
- Keep it up.
- Why with him?

1441
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:52,547
Why would you go to a meeting
with him?

1442
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:00,822
Hey, hey, hey.

1443
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:04,392
You built it. You drive it.

1444
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:28,683
...specialize in building
money in high risk,

1445
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,151
high yield investments.

1446
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,220
That just won't work, Bill.

1447
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,121
What?

1448
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:12,961
When I get this money
I'm going right back to...

1449
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:16,031
going right back to that sketch.

1450
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,569
I want that feeling back.

1451
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:26,007
And how it felt

1452
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:28,810
when you're driving down
the street

1453
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:32,247
in the car you built yourself.

1454
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:34,616
And you know your dad's
watching you

1455
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,986
and you just...

1456
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:40,188
swell up.

1457
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,396
You know, John,
it's not too late to back out

1458
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,565
of this thing, right?

1459
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,700
Because these guys, I mean...

1460
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:55,036
they, um,
they're not good people.

1461
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:56,771
And once they get their
hooks in you, it can really--

1462
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:59,441
There are an awful lot of
families in Northern Ireland,

1463
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,942
who need this.

1464
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:06,981
Men and women not afraid
to stand up and be counted.

1465
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,985
And if they can do it...

1466
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:14,722
goddamn right, I can as well.

1467
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:37,412
Nice to meet you.
James Benedict.

1468
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:38,980
Um-hm.

1469
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,215
Hi.

1470
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:46,788
I can't believe I'm here
with John DeLorean.

1471
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,989
I saw you on TV.

1472
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,226
- Well, I'm on TV a lot.
- I...

1473
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:55,063
- Coffee?
- Black.

1474
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:58,867
I'm not sure that, uh,
TV is good for business.

1475
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:03,438
I don't exactly relish
the spotlight.

1476
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,507
Well, the way I see it,
the darkest dark

1477
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,442
is the dark besides the
spotlight.

1478
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,178
You can do anything there
and no one seems to notice.

1479
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:15,350
I like that.
The darkest dark...

1480
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:21,489
So, uh, John, I, uh,
I like what I see of the, uh...

1481
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,258
It's funny, they call it
the DeLorean

1482
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:26,294
in front of John DeLorean.
But, uh, yeah. Great things.

1483
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:30,298
Um, I love the wings.
They're futuristic.

1484
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,499
Maybe I'll get a car
out of this.

1485
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,543
John.

1486
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,147
I guess fate has dealt you
a dirty blow.

1487
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,216
- Well, I'm still swinging.
- Good for you.

1488
01:09:51,121 --> 01:09:53,655
- James Benedict.
- Morgan... Hetrick.

1489
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,723
- Uh, coffee?
- Nope.

1490
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:59,494
So, John.
What's the story?

1491
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,496
The story is, the British
government has written off

1492
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:04,299
two hundred twenty eight
million dollars of our debt.

1493
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:06,634
But they won't pay us
the 94 they still owe us.

1494
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:10,538
And that is exactly why
I stay away from anything

1495
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,639
to do with governments.

1496
01:10:14,144 --> 01:10:15,843
Morgan, I think we can all agree

1497
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,713
that this could be the start of
a very good relationship.

1498
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,348
Mutually beneficial.

1499
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,649
Shall we?

1500
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,929
Jim.

1501
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:39,167
You're the point man on this.
Do you wanna...

1502
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:42,870
Okay, well, we all know that

1503
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:46,874
John is one of the finest
businessmen in-- in-- in,

1504
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,610
on this planet. Umm--

1505
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:52,847
Don't need a fucking
biography, Jim. What's the deal?

1506
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:56,417
Uh, you know, I'm not really
sure where to start. Um...

1507
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:59,187
The deal is, my company's worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

1508
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:01,356
Anyone who's looked at our books
agrees on that.

1509
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,924
But I've hit a cash flow problem

1510
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,292
and I need to plug the gap.

1511
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:06,794
I have two million,
I need to turn it

1512
01:11:06,796 --> 01:11:09,130
into thirty million
within eight days,

1513
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,598
or we lose control.

1514
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,602
- Jim?
- Yeah.

1515
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,604
So, uh, we need you to go down
to Columbia

1516
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,206
and pick up the merchandise.

1517
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,475
I don't sell.
I don't distribute.

1518
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,876
It's not my game.

1519
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,244
Yeah, we're not asking you
to do that.

1520
01:11:23,246 --> 01:11:24,712
We have someone for that.

1521
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,247
Who?

1522
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:27,782
- I don't like--
- His name is John Vicenza.

1523
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,484
This is what he does.

1524
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:32,086
He put a lot of money
through this bank.

1525
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,321
A lot of money.

1526
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:34,989
So everything goes smooth,

1527
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,491
everybody gets their cut,

1528
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:38,259
John gets to keep his company,

1529
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:41,396
and, uh, we get an option
to invest, to diversify.

1530
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,931
Because if you do too much here,
it raises flags.

1531
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,900
Yeah, absolutely,
nature of our business,

1532
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,469
we move money all over the world
without explaining it.

1533
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,842
Okay.

1534
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:59,380
Got to admit.

1535
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,317
You make me nervous.

1536
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:11,426
Jim. Jim. Jim.

1537
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,099
We have history.

1538
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,269
What kind of history?

1539
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:24,172
The wrong kind.

1540
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:28,676
Look, I don't want
any kind of thing structured

1541
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,978
where Jim here has a chance
to fuck around.

1542
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,847
- Okay?
- Oh, boy.

1543
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,882
I mean, what if Jim
takes the monkeys.

1544
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:39,987
Jim says
I'm going to my dealer.

1545
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:42,623
Jim comes back with
some bruises.

1546
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,694
Jim says someone
stole the monkeys.

1547
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,997
That's not gonna happen, Morgan.

1548
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:52,734
First, Jim's money is
tied up with me.

1549
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,969
He knows if he does anything
funny, the money disappears.

1550
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,972
And second, Vicenza.

1551
01:12:57,974 --> 01:13:00,808
Jim's head would be
on a platter.

1552
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,611
And his wife's. And kids.

1553
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:08,416
So, there's no worries
on that front.

1554
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,886
You trust him?

1555
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,665
As much as any man here.

1556
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:28,202
Alright, now,
if the Brits make a move

1557
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:30,872
and, um, and the cash
isn't in the bank,

1558
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:32,774
maybe I need some sort
of promissory note

1559
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:34,542
I can present to them.
Would that be doable?

1560
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:37,412
There's a lot of factors
involved, but, uh...

1561
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,614
Yeah, we can look at that
all things being even.

1562
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,116
Morgan?

1563
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,023
I guess we got a deal.

1564
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:02,703
Well, that went pretty well.

1565
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,939
Morgan's a good pilot.
And he's careful.

1566
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,441
And a contact for the monkeys.

1567
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,242
- Stop saying monkeys.
- Morgan, he's--

1568
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,311
Yeah, Morgan says it because
he's a piece of shit criminal.

1569
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:12,246
Alright?
He's allowed to say monkeys.

1570
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:14,549
You're not allowed to say
monkeys. Stop saying it.

1571
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:16,517
You sound like a fucking idiot.

1572
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,892
- Hoffman residence.
- Hey. I'm not ready to go.

1573
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:26,994
But I ain't goin' nowhere
without John's two million.

1574
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:29,397
- Any word?
- Uh, no, but, um, let me...

1575
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:30,965
I-- I'll call you right back,
okay?

1576
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,800
Hey, these guys do not
hang around. Alright?

1577
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,802
You just get that fuckin' money.

1578
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,611
- Morgan, what?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1579
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:44,979
Hey, uh, don't worry.
Everything's under control.

1580
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,247
Okay? I-- I just, um...

1581
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,782
Look, John says
he has the money.

1582
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,116
Yeah, well,
I say I have a nine-inch cock.

1583
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,585
It doesn't make it true.

1584
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:51,919
We need to show
he's an active participant,

1585
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,654
not just a groupie.

1586
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,756
I understand, okay? You got to
trust me here, okay? I...

1587
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,358
Hello? He...

1588
01:14:58,127 --> 01:14:59,494
Shit! Shit!

1589
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:04,131
- Hello.
- John. Hey.

1590
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,833
Wh... Oklahoma?

1591
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,034
What the hell's in Oklahoma?

1592
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,503
Well, nothing, as it turns out.

1593
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,171
Has Morgan, um...

1594
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,305
Well, you know, I just got off
the phone with him.

1595
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,007
Okay? So, he's ready to go.

1596
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,710
He's not going anywhere until
you provide the finance.

1597
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,815
Uh, it's coming.
I have to be careful.

1598
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:23,551
Hey. You're the one with the,
uh, the deadline, man.

1599
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:26,454
I know that. I...
I will have the money.

1600
01:15:26,456 --> 01:15:28,222
Okay. Alright. W...
I just want you to understand.

1601
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:29,490
I mean, it's got to be tomorrow

1602
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:30,992
or-- or-- or the whole thing
is off.

1603
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:32,627
Yeah. Tomorrow. Absolutely.

1604
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:34,662
Okay. Hey, John...
John, just, you know,

1605
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:36,197
level with me here, okay?

1606
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,532
If you don't have the money,
just tell me now.

1607
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:39,133
No, I have the money.

1608
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:44,405
Okay. Okay.

1609
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,808
Oh, boy.

1610
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,311
- Hello.
- I don't have the money.

1611
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:52,213
Goddammit, John!

1612
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,415
I thought I had the money.
I don't have the money.

1613
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,317
Okay, well, what the hell
am I supposed to do with that?

1614
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,919
Well, cash flow has always
been the problem.

1615
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,687
No, no, no! No, John.

1616
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:02,657
No, you're fucking bullshit
has always been the problem.

1617
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,493
Damn it.

1618
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,332
- Now what?
- You tell me.

1619
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,035
John doesn't have the money.

1620
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:15,503
Yeah, I know he doesn't have the
money. What do you think?

1621
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:17,004
I've been listening
to the Bee Gees all day?

1622
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:19,173
So, fuck him, and fuck you!

1623
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:20,841
Wait, no, no, no. Hold on.
H-- hold on a second.

1624
01:16:20,843 --> 01:16:22,343
Okay? I'm... Look, I'm...

1625
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:24,078
Uh... We're not done yet. Okay?

1626
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,713
How the fuck did you
work that out?

1627
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:29,183
You... You-- you have to
lend him the money.

1628
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,751
What?

1629
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:31,919
Well, Davrow has to
lend him the money.

1630
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,187
Okay? It's an investment.

1631
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,122
Hoffman, let me
get this straight...

1632
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:38,392
You want the FBI to lend
John DeLorean

1633
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,696
two million dollars
so that he can buy the cocaine

1634
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,531
that we're going to
arrest him with?

1635
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:44,932
Yeah, that's right.

1636
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,534
You outta your fuckin' mind?

1637
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,470
No...

1638
01:16:49,472 --> 01:16:51,872
God!

1639
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:54,141
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1640
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,243
Okay.

1641
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:57,712
No, uh, Ellen,
it's not what it...

1642
01:16:57,714 --> 01:17:00,147
Morgan Hetrick, I get.
John is your friend.

1643
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:03,050
No, no, no.
He is not our friend. Okay?

1644
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:05,586
The guy waltz into our life
completely uninvited.

1645
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:07,221
Uh-- uh, look, I like him, okay?

1646
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:08,289
And, yes, he's done some
great things,

1647
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,757
but at the end of the day,

1648
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,425
he is as full of shit
as the rest of us.

1649
01:17:11,427 --> 01:17:13,628
- Don't you drag him down--
- Drag him?

1650
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,397
No, he came to me, Ellen.

1651
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:18,299
He wanted me to
set up a drug deal...

1652
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,600
cocaine!

1653
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,136
Okay? He wants to deal
in cocaine.

1654
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,404
I mean, how fucked up
you have to be

1655
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:24,639
to think you can
save your company

1656
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,806
with a coke deal.

1657
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:29,110
Huh? He's no better than Morgan.

1658
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,946
You know... You know what?
Actually, he's worse. He is.

1659
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:33,848
He sells this dream to people,

1660
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,650
and it's all bullshit.

1661
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:37,585
Okay, look,
if he goes through with this

1662
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,787
then you and me, the kids,
we're home free. Okay?

1663
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:40,921
We get millions.

1664
01:17:40,923 --> 01:17:42,590
Jim, what are you talking about?

1665
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:43,624
- Oh--
- Jim--

1666
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:44,925
I have a deal.

1667
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,594
I have deal cut.

1668
01:17:46,596 --> 01:17:49,363
Alright. Ten percent
of whatever the FBI recovers.

1669
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,032
Okay? We're talking millions.

1670
01:17:51,034 --> 01:17:53,968
You can have all the fucking
marbles that you want.

1671
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,103
You can, yeah.
And it is what you deserve.

1672
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,972
Honestly, it is.

1673
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,607
After all the bullshit
that I put your through,

1674
01:17:59,609 --> 01:18:01,342
all the-- all the,
all the promises...

1675
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:04,111
- This is another promise.
- No! No! Not...

1676
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,479
Oh, baby, no.

1677
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:07,448
Not this time. Okay, look.
Listen to me...

1678
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,817
You have to trust me.

1679
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:11,719
Okay? Just trust me
one last time, please.

1680
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,838
Hey.
Hey, where's Morgan?

1681
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,141
Oh, he's not here tonight.
He's got a hot date.

1682
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:36,811
Hey, psst.
Join the party.

1683
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,746
Go on.

1684
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:40,715
Thanks.

1685
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:46,554
Drink up.

1686
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:01,368
<i>I remember the first time</i>
<i>we came here.</i>

1687
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,671
<i>And I remember lookin' at you</i>

1688
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:06,674
and... thinkin' there was
something different about you.

1689
01:19:06,676 --> 01:19:08,843
I couldn't put my
finger on it, but...

1690
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:11,612
But Ellen...

1691
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:15,049
Ellen was... She, um...

1692
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,451
You know,
she spotted it right away.

1693
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:21,956
You know what it is?

1694
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,457
It's your chin.

1695
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,263
You alright?

1696
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,933
See, 'cause in your...
The old photos of you...

1697
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,935
you don't have much of a chin.

1698
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:39,206
Now you have a chin.

1699
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:41,142
See what I'm saying?

1700
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:43,577
It's no secret,
I had a procedure.

1701
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,112
You're chinless.

1702
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,514
Alright, Jim.

1703
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:51,819
You're a fake.

1704
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:53,554
Because I had a procedure?

1705
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:55,589
Half of California
has plastic surgery.

1706
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:56,824
No, no, no.
Not because of that.

1707
01:19:56,826 --> 01:20:00,761
Because you are
inherently chinless.

1708
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:04,298
I don't trust someone
who doesn't have a chin.

1709
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,834
Now, Jim, I've done everything
I could to raise this money,

1710
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:09,003
but unfortunately,
with the scrutiny I'm under,

1711
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:10,671
I've been unable to--

1712
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:12,239
No, no, no. I don't think
you had any intention.

1713
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:13,808
I think you're just
stringing us along

1714
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,409
'cause you're a fuckin'
chinless fake.

1715
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,012
- Cut the shit!
- Hmm?

1716
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:19,580
I was worried
you would fuck it up.

1717
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:21,782
- Me?
- Morgan thinks you're a snake.

1718
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,651
Morgan. Oh, yeah...
What, you talked to Morgan?

1719
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:25,319
I talk to everyone,
that's what I do.

1720
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,421
- Okay.
- You fucked him over.

1721
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:29,690
Oh, okay.
That's what he told you, huh?

1722
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,859
You guys have little chit-chats
and everything now?

1723
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,661
That's good. Well, did he...

1724
01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:35,162
Did he tell you about him
and Cristina?

1725
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,497
- Did that come up?
- Excuse me?

1726
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:37,798
Oh...

1727
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,134
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
See. No, she...

1728
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:42,636
Well, Morgan used to work
for this millionaire

1729
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:47,107
that, that Cristina used to,
uh, see, like, date, or, uh...

1730
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:48,142
Or how do you put it?

1731
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:52,213
What the fuck are you saying
about my wife?

1732
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:55,516
I, nothing... Nothing.

1733
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,618
I...

1734
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:06,393
- Hello?
- Uh...

1735
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:11,465
Well, I can't thank you enough.

1736
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,837
John, I'm sorry.

1737
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:18,572
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

1738
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,407
I... Well...

1739
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:23,210
It's probably for the best this
whole thing's falling apart.

1740
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:27,147
That was James Benedict
at Davrow.

1741
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:31,552
He's gonna loan me
two million dollars.

1742
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:37,725
Morgan just took off.

1743
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,599
With his firm,
and all the remaining jobs

1744
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:48,102
that depend on it
on the brink of extinction,

1745
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:50,170
DeLorean, a former
General Motors executive

1746
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,872
vowed to fight on.

1747
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:54,074
The company's going
to survive as long as

1748
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,743
I have a breath left in me.

1749
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,381
Up until now,

1750
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:02,616
the bank rolled DeLorean's plant
here at Belfast...

1751
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,051
Hoffman residence.

1752
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:05,486
Yeah. Morgan.

1753
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,622
Okay. Yeah.
No, sounds good.

1754
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:10,791
I'm on my way. Alright.

1755
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,426
...whether they'll
continue to bail out

1756
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,396
the firm that bears
John DeLorean's name.

1757
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:16,463
Let it sink.

1758
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,369
You look nervous.

1759
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:24,538
Yeah,
'cause I am fucking nervous.

1760
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:26,874
Where's the stuff?

1761
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:28,943
I told you,
it's in the car with Katy.

1762
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:30,311
Yeah, well, I hope,
there's some left.

1763
01:22:30,313 --> 01:22:31,879
You better hurry.

1764
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:34,048
Hey.

1765
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:36,283
Hey, gorgeous.

1766
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,920
Hey, lifesaver.

1767
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,555
- Hey.
- Let's show him.

1768
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:43,991
Uh-hmm.

1769
01:22:58,174 --> 01:22:59,640
- Holy moly!
- Mm-hm.

1770
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:04,979
Holy moly!

1771
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:17,291
Morgan Hetrick, Katy Connors,
you're under arrest.

1772
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:19,093
Motherfucking mother fucker!

1773
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:20,861
- Step away from the car.
- Morgan...

1774
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:23,831
How'd he... How does he...
How does he know me?

1775
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,599
You fucker!

1776
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,167
- I'm going to fuckin' kill you!
- Get the fuck away from me!

1777
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,836
You're fuckin' dead, Hoffman!

1778
01:23:28,838 --> 01:23:30,104
You're dead!

1779
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,672
Oh, yeah!

1780
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:33,040
Fucked me twice...

1781
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:36,010
Fucked me twice...
Ow! Okay, fuckhead!

1782
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,344
Yeah. You too.

1783
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,046
You'll pay, assholes!

1784
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:40,781
- Don't say a word, baby!
- Don't push me. I'm going.

1785
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,017
Don't say a fuckin' word!

1786
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:45,285
I thought you were my
fuckin' friend.

1787
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:46,920
You're dead, Hoffman!

1788
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:53,560
Oh, you, motherfuck!
Watch the fuckin' hat!

1789
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,701
One down, one to go.

1790
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:05,939
Hey, Jim.

1791
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:08,876
You did good.

1792
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:14,441
Hey, everybody, work quickly
but cleanly.

1793
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,076
Okay, he's gonna be
sitting there.

1794
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:17,644
I want to be able to see
the expressions on his face

1795
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:20,481
I want to be able
to see his hands on the coke.

1796
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:23,650
Suspect's in red vehicle heading
north towards highway five.

1797
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:52,379
What are you up to, John?

1798
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:02,523
You didn't actually
rebuild that car

1799
01:26:02,525 --> 01:26:04,591
on your father's lawn, did you?

1800
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,595
No.

1801
01:26:08,597 --> 01:26:10,697
If I so much as stepped
on daddy's lawn

1802
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:13,200
he'd have beaten six shades
of shit out of me.

1803
01:26:15,004 --> 01:26:17,070
Too bad. I like that story.

1804
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:22,142
My father was
a born again alcoholic.

1805
01:26:22,144 --> 01:26:24,711
He made everyone's life
a misery.

1806
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,116
You want me to tell them that?

1807
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,354
History is written
by the victors.

1808
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,090
I will be remembered.

1809
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:40,727
My car will be remembered.

1810
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:45,265
Our skuzzy coke deal will not.

1811
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:50,871
Ping-pong.

1812
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,045
Ping-pong.

1813
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,585
Ellen!

1814
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:09,623
I know you're in there.

1815
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:12,593
Open the door!

1816
01:27:15,264 --> 01:27:16,863
We have to talk.

1817
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:28,408
Come on!

1818
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:47,794
Dammit! Now, what?

1819
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,135
Great.

1820
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:02,442
- John.
- What the fuck's he doing here?

1821
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:04,878
Where are you going, John?
Open the window, Jim.

1822
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,580
Open the window, Jim. Jim!

1823
01:28:06,582 --> 01:28:08,949
- What do you want me to do?
- Do what you have to do.

1824
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:12,386
Come on, Jim.
You fuckin' piece of shit.

1825
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:13,954
Hey, what the...
Get your hands off me.

1826
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:15,389
- You're coming with us.
- I know my rights.

1827
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,293
Well, just make sure
you've got him

1828
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:20,661
head to toe in there.

1829
01:28:20,663 --> 01:28:22,229
Lift the glass up, please.

1830
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:28,969
I've got the champagne.

1831
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,804
Has this been bugged yet?

1832
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,473
So, what are you gonna do
if something goes wrong?

1833
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:36,643
It won't.
John always has a plan.

1834
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,579
I've been down this road before
and I love Jim,

1835
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:41,248
I'm never gonna leave him

1836
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,116
but if John
is just your golden ticket

1837
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:44,618
then you need to have
a plan 'cause you will be

1838
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,586
dragged down with him.

1839
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,461
- Jim?
- Ellen, it's Bill.

1840
01:28:54,463 --> 01:28:55,762
I'm looking for John,
do you have any idea

1841
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:57,497
where he is or Cristina or--

1842
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,766
- Has something happened?
- No. What do you mean?

1843
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:01,802
- What could've happened?
- No, nothing. Sorry, Bill.

1844
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:05,205
- No, I don't know where--
- Oh, let me talk to him.

1845
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:06,840
Give me the phone!

1846
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:09,343
Bill.

1847
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:11,545
Cristina, it's absolutely vital
that I speak to John

1848
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:13,113
immediately,
we know he's in LA

1849
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:16,083
but we can't find him.
You know where he is?

1850
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,205
Thank you.

1851
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,209
Well, you're moments away

1852
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:44,077
from being a very rich man.

1853
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:45,746
<i>Okay, let me rephrase</i>
<i>the question.</i>

1854
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:48,815
Who first raised the subject
of a possible drug deal?

1855
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:51,418
It's hard to say.
It just kind of came up.

1856
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,186
H-- how did it just "come up?"

1857
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:56,390
Well, one minute it wasn't there
and the next minute, it was.

1858
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:58,024
- Hurry up, come on.
- They're in the lobby.

1859
01:29:58,026 --> 01:29:59,259
Heading upstairs.
Let's get everything ready.

1860
01:29:59,261 --> 01:30:00,894
Okay. Got it.

1861
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,929
Hide that,
hide that. Go.

1862
01:30:09,037 --> 01:30:12,406
Mr. DeLorean, excuse me, sir.
Is it, Mr. DeLorean?

1863
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:14,908
I have a call for you, sir.

1864
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,913
I'll transfer the call to the
house phone, right over there.

1865
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,749
So did he-- he just call you
and-- and-- and say,

1866
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,851
"Hey, man, I need $30 million

1867
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:28,288
to save my company,
let's do a drug deal?"

1868
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:30,424
<i>What are we talking</i>
<i>about here, John?</i>

1869
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:34,127
That I need help.

1870
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:36,196
It's just not cut
and dry like you want.

1871
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:37,597
I-- I-- it really isn't.

1872
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,133
That's v-- very different
than suggesting

1873
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:42,402
a-- a-- drug deal,
don't you think?

1874
01:30:42,404 --> 01:30:43,970
Well, it is and it isn't.

1875
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,939
He may have alluded to it.

1876
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:49,910
You don't think
that Thomas Edison...

1877
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,912
or Ford or Kennedy didn't cut
a few corners

1878
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:54,014
every now and then
for the greater good?

1879
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,317
Is any of this alluding
to be found

1880
01:30:57,319 --> 01:30:59,920
in the many hours of FBI tapes

1881
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:02,489
of your phone calls
with Mr. DeLorean?

1882
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:04,124
Uh, no. This predates that.

1883
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:07,160
John DeLorean.

1884
01:31:07,162 --> 01:31:08,261
John, we have a deal

1885
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:09,563
to save the car, the factory...

1886
01:31:09,565 --> 01:31:11,798
- Everything.
- Bill.

1887
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,400
Minit Financial came
through with a 100 million

1888
01:31:13,402 --> 01:31:15,635
but you need
to sign it now, today,

1889
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,103
before the Brits get wind of it

1890
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,738
or there'll be no company
left to save.

1891
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:22,142
- I have a deal here.
- No, you don't.

1892
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,311
You have a life sentence.

1893
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,979
You need to sign this.

1894
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:30,317
- I can't do it, Bill.
- Why, for Christ sake?

1895
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:32,285
This is what we've been breakin'
our asses for.

1896
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:34,354
Because they'll own the company.

1897
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,023
At best,
I'll be a figure head

1898
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:39,659
and most likely
they'll push me out.

1899
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,761
You can't just throw it
all away like this!

1900
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:46,099
So, basically,
what it all comes down to

1901
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:48,268
is your word against his.

1902
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:51,104
The word of a man
who even according to you

1903
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:55,609
is one of the most respected
businessmen in the world.

1904
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:58,011
And that of a drug smuggler

1905
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,980
and government informant.

1906
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:10,857
Okay, we've got
about 30 seconds.

1907
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:16,296
Come on.

1908
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:19,566
You know
the biggest mistake we made?

1909
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:22,736
Making all the cars
the same color.

1910
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:25,705
Sure, they're futuristic
looking but...

1911
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:27,474
should've had a variety.

1912
01:32:27,476 --> 01:32:29,676
Once we secure the company,
we're going to come out

1913
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:30,977
with a whole range of colors

1914
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:33,914
and it's going to be amazing.

1915
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,549
Are you okay, John?

1916
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:38,151
Sure.

1917
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:43,723
You know, I never thanked you
properly, Jim,

1918
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:45,725
and I always meant to.

1919
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:51,498
W... Hey...

1920
01:32:56,505 --> 01:32:57,904
Don't do this, John.

1921
01:32:58,941 --> 01:33:01,074
Just go home to Cristina.

1922
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,209
Work somethin' else out.

1923
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:04,778
I'll go in here alone and just

1924
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:07,347
call the whole thing off,
alright?

1925
01:33:07,349 --> 01:33:09,316
No, you're missing the point.

1926
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:14,087
John DeLorean always leads
from the front.

1927
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:16,089
That's why he's John DeLorean.

1928
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:20,860
Right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1929
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:37,811
John, glad you could make it.

1930
01:33:37,813 --> 01:33:40,213
- This is John Vicenza.
- Hello. Alright.

1931
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:43,817
- Heard a lot about you, John.
- Hi.

1932
01:33:43,819 --> 01:33:45,251
Kind of a different
world for you, huh?

1933
01:33:45,253 --> 01:33:49,289
Well, you'd be surprised.

1934
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:52,425
I, uh, took the opportunity
of ordering some champagne.

1935
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:56,830
Well, it, it seems
like a day for champagne, huh?

1936
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:02,969
Now...

1937
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:14,447
Um, are the, uh,

1938
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:16,516
are the, uh, monkeys here?

1939
01:34:16,518 --> 01:34:17,984
Some.

1940
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,120
Uh, the rest are downstairs.

1941
01:34:20,122 --> 01:34:21,588
Mm-hm.

1942
01:34:35,504 --> 01:34:36,770
Oh!

1943
01:34:41,877 --> 01:34:43,877
We got a quite a party here.

1944
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:51,451
It's, uh...

1945
01:34:53,455 --> 01:34:55,121
Go ahead, John.

1946
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,359
Pick it up.

1947
01:35:26,822 --> 01:35:28,688
Well, that's better than gold.

1948
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:31,257
Gold weighs more than that,
for goodness sakes.

1949
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:38,264
So, here's to, uh,
to a lot of success for everyone

1950
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:41,735
and, uh, for all those,
those phone calls.

1951
01:35:43,004 --> 01:35:45,405
Huh? Jim?

1952
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:47,774
Thank you.

1953
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:57,517
Hi, John. Jerry West.
I'm with the FBI.

1954
01:35:57,519 --> 01:36:00,353
You're under arrest
for narcotic laws violation.

1955
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:09,262
I, um, I don't understand.

1956
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,030
I'm going to advise you
of your rights.

1957
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:12,599
You have the right
to remain silent.

1958
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,467
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1959
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:15,702
in a court of law.

1960
01:36:15,704 --> 01:36:17,203
You have the right
to an attorney.

1961
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:19,706
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided.

1962
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:21,307
Do you understand your rights?

1963
01:36:30,752 --> 01:36:33,653
John Z. DeLorean, former top
executive with General Motors

1964
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:35,655
more recently the creator
of a slick sports car

1965
01:36:35,657 --> 01:36:37,123
that bore his name,

1966
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,392
today faced federal drug charges
in Los Angeles.

1967
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:42,962
John DeLorean, the flamboyant
former GM executive

1968
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:45,632
remains in custody tonight
on federal drug charges.

1969
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:47,967
They found several
pounds of cocaine.

1970
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,435
The FBI
would rather call it

1971
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:50,937
an undercover investigation

1972
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:54,240
but it was a semi-classic
sting operation.

1973
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:57,243
The FBI agent said DeLorean
had been under surveillance

1974
01:36:57,245 --> 01:36:58,845
for five months.

1975
01:36:58,847 --> 01:37:00,346
$24 million
cocaine deal.

1976
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:02,248
The FBI says, he was the...

1977
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:09,088
DeLorean claims
Jim trapped him

1978
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:12,425
in the drug deal, while FBI
agents posing as drug dealers

1979
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:14,294
open a suitcase full of cocaine.

1980
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:17,864
They could receive federal
prison terms of up to 15 years.

1981
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:21,868
Driven and finally desperate
for success.

1982
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:24,871
DeLorean himself is
out of jail on bail

1983
01:37:24,873 --> 01:37:28,541
in California. We have more
on that from Dennis Murphy.

1984
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:30,877
Last night wearing
the same suit he was arrested in

1985
01:37:30,879 --> 01:37:33,146
eleven days before,
John DeLorean walked

1986
01:37:33,148 --> 01:37:35,815
from federal prison
and embraced his wife.

1987
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:37,350
His travel
is restricted to parts

1988
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:39,152
of California and New York.

1989
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:41,754
DeLorean 's next court
appearance is in a week...

1990
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,550
You fell for it.

1991
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:13,720
Fell for what?

1992
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:18,725
Jesus, John, what are you doing?

1993
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:20,727
I'd be within my rights
to shoot you dead.

1994
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:22,929
John, don't be an idiot. Okay?

1995
01:38:22,931 --> 01:38:24,864
It's only gonna
make things worse. Just stop.

1996
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:32,805
It's not really my style.

1997
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:43,750
How are you, Jim?

1998
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:46,653
I'm okay.

1999
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:49,522
You?

2000
01:38:55,563 --> 01:38:56,863
How's Cristina?

2001
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:01,200
Well, she's hired a designer
to make her a new outfit

2002
01:39:01,202 --> 01:39:03,469
for everyday of the trial.

2003
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:06,372
That's gonna be
a long trial so...

2004
01:39:06,374 --> 01:39:07,774
That's what we in the automobile
industry

2005
01:39:07,776 --> 01:39:09,943
call an exit strategy.

2006
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:12,645
Sorry to hear that.

2007
01:39:16,818 --> 01:39:19,018
- John, I'm sorry about--
- No.

2008
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:22,822
Don't.

2009
01:39:22,824 --> 01:39:25,825
You saw an opportunity
and you took it.

2010
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,030
I trust you were amply rewarded.

2011
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:37,370
No.

2012
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:42,175
Boy, they always find a way
to fuck us, don't they?

2013
01:39:47,849 --> 01:39:49,048
Yeah.

2014
01:39:59,127 --> 01:40:01,294
<i>Stay focused.</i>

2015
01:40:01,296 --> 01:40:02,929
<i>Stay calm.</i>

2016
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:05,164
<i>Stay honest.</i>

2017
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,333
<i>Look them in the eye.</i>

2018
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,203
<i>Be polite and respect.</i>

2019
01:40:10,205 --> 01:40:13,473
Mr. Hoffman,
i-- it's quite simple,

2020
01:40:13,475 --> 01:40:17,810
did John DeLorean suggest
the drug deal?

2021
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:20,613
Because if he did, then he is
a willing participant.

2022
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:23,449
But if he didn't,
then he is the victim

2023
01:40:23,451 --> 01:40:26,619
of an outrageous FBI entrapment.

2024
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:34,360
So, which is it?

2025
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:37,196
Did John DeLorean suggest
the drug deal?

2026
01:40:39,734 --> 01:40:41,000
Well...

2027
01:40:57,652 --> 01:40:59,819
Can you help me, Jim?

2028
01:41:08,897 --> 01:41:10,229
Well, it's hard to say.

2029
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:29,449
Settle.
Settle down.

2030
01:41:49,404 --> 01:41:52,705
"The United States of America
versus John Z. DeLorean.

2031
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:55,074
We, the jury, in the above
entitled case,

2032
01:41:55,076 --> 01:41:58,277
find the defendant,
John Z. DeLorean, not guilty

2033
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:00,313
as charged in count one.

2034
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:03,382
Not guilty as charged
in count two.

2035
01:42:03,384 --> 01:42:06,586
Not guilty as charged
in count three.

2036
01:42:06,588 --> 01:42:09,989
Not guilty as charged
in count four.

2037
01:42:09,991 --> 01:42:13,226
Not guilty as charged
in count five.

2038
01:42:13,228 --> 01:42:16,362
Not guilty as charged
in count six."

2039
01:42:31,346 --> 01:42:32,979
Mr. DeLorean,
will you plan

2040
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:34,814
to resume your career
in the auto industry?

2041
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,516
Would you buy
a used car from me?

2042
01:42:39,754 --> 01:42:43,022
All you had to say was
it was his idea.

2043
01:42:43,024 --> 01:42:44,724
That's all you had to do.

2044
01:42:47,929 --> 01:42:51,330
Well, you and your family
can kiss goodbye to California.

2045
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:56,802
And say hello to Boise, Idaho.

2046
01:42:56,804 --> 01:42:59,105
Because that's where witness
protection is sending you.

2047
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,008
I'll make sure of that.

2048
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:03,709
It's been a long journey,
but in the end,

2049
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:06,145
I think justice was served.
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

2050
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:21,861
Oh, that's a big help. Thanks.

2051
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:24,497
Jim. The phone's for you.

2052
01:43:24,499 --> 01:43:26,132
Can you pick it up?

2053
01:43:29,337 --> 01:43:30,703
Honey?

2054
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:34,907
Babe, the phone's for you.

2055
01:43:36,844 --> 01:43:38,978
Hello?

2056
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,047
Okay. Okay, leaving now.

2057
01:43:41,049 --> 01:43:42,548
Alright. Bye.

2058
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,313
Hello, John.

2059
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:23,122
How are you doing?

2060
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,261
My name will live in infamy.
But I'm free.

2061
01:44:29,931 --> 01:44:32,098
And single.

2062
01:44:37,472 --> 01:44:40,339
I guess not everyone needs
a DeLorean.

2063
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:46,812
Oh, that's good, that's good.

2064
01:44:50,885 --> 01:44:53,352
Mm, so, wh... Now, what?
What, uh...

2065
01:44:54,722 --> 01:44:58,090
Well, I'm designing another car

2066
01:44:58,092 --> 01:45:00,760
and this one is gonna have
all the bits

2067
01:45:00,762 --> 01:45:04,964
I was forced to leave out in the
last one and it's gonna be...

2068
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:06,799
It's gonna be really special.

2069
01:45:08,403 --> 01:45:10,036
Oh, you mean...

2070
01:45:11,773 --> 01:45:13,472
something like that?

2071
01:45:23,284 --> 01:45:24,817
Figured I'd hold onto that
for you

2072
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:27,219
on the off chance
you might want it back someday.

2073
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:38,097
It means a lot, Jim.

2074
01:45:49,711 --> 01:45:51,877
Well, I've got to...

2075
01:46:36,858 --> 01:46:38,557
Love this guy.

2076
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:13,225
Come on. Here we go.

2077
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:18,764
You gotta be kidding me.

2078
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:35,147
