00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,200
All right, ladies.
Let me be your Greek guide.

176
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
Each house has a reputation.

177
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,700
There's the Gamma Phis.

178
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,500
They're, uh... perky.
<i>(all squeal)</i>

179
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,700
Very perky.
Lots of cheerleaders.

180
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
And here's Pi Beta Omega.

181
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,900
Those girls can out-party
any fraternity on campus.

182
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
What was the first house?
The one with the Junior Tiger Guide?

183
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,700
Uh, that would be the vortex.
That's a weird name for a fraternity.

184
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not a fraternity.
It started off as overflow student housing.

185
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Now it's just kind a there.

186
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
Here's our stop.
Kappa Phi Nu.

187
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,400
Well, thank you for the tour, Tyler.
Yeah, th...

188
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,900
Sydney, you know what?
I'm gonna meet you inside.

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Why?

190
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>(mouths words)</i>

191
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,800
The illegally blondes...
You? Really?

192
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Yeah.
I... Is it the shoes?

193
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
(chuckles) No.
I love the shoes.

194
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,800
The Kappaâ€™s are just a little... intense.

195
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, well,
it was actually my mother's house.

196
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,800
Ah. Legacy.
Is she all over you about rushing?

197
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
No.
She... died nine years ago.

198
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's OK.

199
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,300
Kappaâ€™s could use a girl like you.
I should know - they're our sister sorority.

200
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh!
So we'll be like brother and sister!

201
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,900
Not in, you know,
the related, familial way,

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,900
but, you know,
more in the fraternal, sororal...

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Sororital? Is that a word?
Sorry. I kind a tend to over talk when I'm nervous.

204
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,100
It's a disease, one without a cure.
So stop me any time, please.

205
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
You're nervous?
Oh... No.

206
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,200
No, it's not you.
Tyler, was it?

207
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,700
No, it's because of the whole rush,
you know?

208
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,000
The very term "rush" is an amper-upper.
It amps up the old nerves.

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
I have to go.

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>(chatter)</i>

211
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,600
OK, ladies.
Listen up.

212
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
The doors are about to open.
Our objective is?

213
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
(all) Target cute pledges.

214
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,400
Exactly.
And what do we want to avoid?

215
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
(all) Fat losers.

216
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
Now, now.
We all remember the code.

217
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,500
When I ask you to show a girl
to the "koi <i>pond,"</i> ditch her.

218
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,000
We also have two legacies coming today -
Dinky Hodgekiss and Sydney White.

219
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,000
When you meet them,
find me immediately.

220
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,000
OK, girls.
Are we ready?

221
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,600
<i>(all chant)</i>
Here comes a Kappa, queen of the Row.

222
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,900
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.

223
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
She's got style, she's got class,

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,300
and from behind a kicking...

225
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,000
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

227
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,300
Excuse me, Amy.
Don't you remember?

228
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,000
You've been reassigned.
Kitchen duty.

229
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Go on.

230
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,900
That's what happens when you gain 27 pounds
of breakup weight over the summer.

231
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>(all chant)</i>
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

232
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,700
<i>(screaming)</i>

233
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Kappa! <i>(giggles)</i>
Kappa! Kappa!

234
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey.

235
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,600
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
<i>(chanting continues)</i>

237
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Hey!

238
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,900
We've been dating for two years.
I love him so much!

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
And next week,
he's gonna pin me.

240
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Pin you to what?

241
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Hi.
Hi.

242
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,300
(girl) Hi there.
Oh, hi.

243
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm Katy and this is Christy.

244
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm Sydney White.

245
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,400
You're one of our legacies.
Rachel's gonna be so excited!

246
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,200
Rachel, we'd like you
to meet someone.

247
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,700
Oh...

248
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,100
Hi.

249
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,300
Girls, why don't you show
this one the koi pond?

250
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
Ooh! I love koi ponds.

251
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
Great.
Off you go.

252
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,800
This is Sydney White.

253
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,800
Three words - Leg-a-cy

254
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,600
Sydney, so pleased to meet you.

255
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm so excited.
My mom had a great experience here.

256
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,700
Katy, have you offered our guest a drink
from the refreshment table?

257
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm actually not that thirst...
No, no. Katy.

258
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,200
The refreshment table?

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,400
We have a situation.
That girl is <i>not</i> Kappa material.

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
(Christy) Really?
I didn't see anything wrong with her.

261
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,200
Christy, you know you're not
as perceptive as I am.

262
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,600
She wouldn't know
her Gucci from her Pucci.

263
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Not to mention, I saw her throwing herself
all over Tyler before she came in the house.

264
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,400
It was embarrassing. Trust me,
we do not want a Kappa who behaves that way.

265
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
See what I mean?

266
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
But we have to give her a bid.
She's a legacy.

267
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,400
Her mom gets her the bid,
but she has to survive pledging all on her own.

268
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,100
Oh, my gosh. I saw him outside,
and he is definitely the hottest guy on campus.

269
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,600
Who's the hottest guy on campus?

270
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,300
Tyler Prince,
the Beta president.

271
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, you know, I know that guy.
He was really nice.

272
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He showed me around Greek Row.

273
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,900
Off limits. He's Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh.

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Yeah, they're off now,
but they'll be on again.

275
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,600
It's all part of
Rachel's 20-year plan.

276
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,200
He'll be a top litigator,
she'll be a senator.

277
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
It's so romantic.
Yeah, it does sound romantic.

278
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Because there it nothing more romantic
than a 20-year plan. Am I right, ladies?

279
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
<i>(laughs)</i>

280
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
So, Sydney,
where does your dad work?

281
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,500
Oh, he works mostly on construction sites.
Oh.

282
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,600
My uncle's made a mint building malls.
So, your dad's a developer, too?

283
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah...
something like that.

284
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,300
(Rachel) Night, girls.
Get your beauty rest.

285
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Now that you're Kappa pledges,
it's a requirement.

286
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,700
<i>(all) # Lay you down, dear sweet pledge</i>

287
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,500
<i># Lay your head on the pillow</i>

288
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
<i># May you have lovely dreams</i>

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,200
<i># Just as lovely as you are</i>

290
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,600
(Sydney)
Has anyone found the koi pond?

291
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
<i>(air horns blasting)</i>

292
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,200
It's 12:01!
Welcome to hell, skanks!

293
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,400
Over the next week, we'll be conducting
what I like to call..."pledge <i>enlightenment."</i>

294
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,800
We're not allowed to call it <i>"hazing,"</i>
not afterwhat happened to Suzie.

295
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,400
We're gonna find out which of you
Prada princesses has what it takes to be a Kappa,

296
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,200
and which of you don't.

297
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,400
This is your first pledge task -
the date dash.

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,900
You have until 12:15 to find a date
and meet me at the State Street Diner.

299
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,300
No changing clothes, no makeup,
no brushing your hair or teeth!

300
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,300
You have 15 minutes!
Let's go!

301
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,000
Go! Go!

302
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,100
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

303
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,000
(girl) Come on!

304
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Dinky! Dinky! What do we do?
Oh, you just grab a guy.

305
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Excuse me, sugar.
Can I borrow you for a date dash?

306
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,500
(laughs) Hurry up, girl. Come on.
OK.

307
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Come on!

308
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
(boy) Ah-choo!

309
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,200
Hello? Hello?!

310
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,300
Uh... Oh, uh, sorry.

311
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry. Uh...

312
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,400
Hi. Uh... I'm sorry I startled you.
Can you? Can you help me?

313
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,400
Ah-choo!
OK.

314
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
Thanks.
Sure.

315
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,300
Ah-choo! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, thanks.

316
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,600
What are you doing
in a, uh, bush?

317
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,200
I don't know what happened. I was walking home
and this crazed pack of girls came toward me.

318
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,100
So I dove for cover.

319
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,300
Yeah, vision not impaired.
Sense of balance restored.

320
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,700
Feeling in fingers and toes.
No visible...

321
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Wait!
You're a guy, right?

322
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,300
(uncertainly) Yeah.

323
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,000
What are you doing now?
I'm waiting for an antihistamine to take effect.

324
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I need you to be my date.

325
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,500
(laughs)
Your date?

326
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Yeah.
Let's go.

327
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, um, watch out.
When I get this excited, I tend to throw up.

328
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,400
It's OK. Just tell me when to duck.
OK.

329
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,200
(Sydney) Let's go!
Oh, um, no. I... I...

330
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,700
<i>(plates clatter)</i>

331
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What's good?

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Wonderful. You just made it.

333
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,700
(Sydney) How's the BLT?

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Mm!

335
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Oh, my God.
Look at her with that pie.

336
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,300
It's a so-rority, not a ho-rority.

337
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,100
So, tell me about the vortex.

338
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
What's it like?

339
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,700
Uh...

340
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I guess you'd call it a, uh... haven,
uh, for people who don't have anywhere else to go.

341
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,600
Some of us didn't get along with our roommates,
some of us made others feel uncomfortable.

342
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,300
Some of us wet the bed.

343
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Some of us wet the hallway.

344
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Uh, all of us are outsiders.

345
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeah, I know what that's like.

346
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,500
Uh, are you serious?
You're a Kappa pledge.

347
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,900
By definition, very much an insider.

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,900
Would all the Kappa pledges
join me over here for a moment?

349
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,100
OK. I guess I'll be right back.
Yes.

350
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,800
OK, girls.
It's time for your next pledge task.

351
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
The date-dash ditch.

352
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
This year's unsuitable date
belongs to...

353
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
Sydney.

354
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,200
Sorry, you're gonna
have to ditch him.

355
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,200
Ah-choo!

356
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,500
But my guy's really nice.
And I dragged him all the way down here.

357
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,900
And he has a sinus infection
and his athlete's foot is flaring up.

358
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,200
And he has glaucoma... he thinks.

359
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,100
I <i>cannot</i> just ditch him.
I don't make the rules, Sydney.

360
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,700
If being a Kappa is important to you,
then this is the price you pay.

361
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,200
Hey, "date."
Hey.

362
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
I ordered you
another cup of coffee.

363
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
Oh...

364
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,800
I need you to meet me
in the <i>girls'</i> bathroom.

365
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,100
Another pledge ritual.
Oh.

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Oh. <i>Oh.</i>

367
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

368
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,100
OK.
I'll meet you there.

369
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,800
<i>(door opens)</i>

370
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,900
Sydney?

371
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,000
<i>(both scream)</i>

372
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Pervert!
Ow!

373
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,800
Looks like you
get stuck with the check.

374
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,000
We live in a country that's considered to be
the ultimate model of government.

375
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,200
By the people,
for the people, and of the people.

376
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,600
But most Americans would be surprised to find
how afraid the Founding Fathers were

377
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,400
of what a direct democracy could do to the country.

378
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Can anyone tell me why?

379
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>(snoring)</i>

380
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
<i>(snores)</i>

381
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,100
The young man snoring there, perhaps?

382
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
<i>(chuckling)</i>

383
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
<i>(coughs)</i>

384
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,300
The Founding Fathers were afraid
that direct democracy

385
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,100
would do to America
what it did to Rome.

386
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Alexander Hamilton
even advocated a monarchy. <i>(snores)</i>

387
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,200
Exactly.

388
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,200
We are trained to think
the more power the people have, the better.

389
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,600
Can any of you tell me
some reasons why this isn't necessarily true?

390
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,800
Ah, Terrence.
Still here after eight years.

391
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,900
What do you say we give someone else
a chance to respond this time, huh?

392
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Um... Ms. Witch burn?

393
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,100
Most Americans
don't educate themselves about the issues.

394
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,700
There are some valid arguments
for keeping things a little bit more... elite.

395
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,900
You could even argue a case
for certain types of oligarchy.

396
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,300
Interesting.

397
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,700
Let's hear from someone else.
How about... you?

398
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Ms?

399
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,400
White.

400
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Ms. White.

401
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,300
Any thoughts?

402
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,400
Um...

403
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
I guess I think that's...

404
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,200
underestimating the masses a bit.

405
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,400
Not to mention
overestimating the elites.

406
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Apartheid was an oligarchy,
and no one wants that again.

407
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,900
Excellent.

408
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Alicia, what year
was Kappa Phi Nu founded?

409
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,000
1902.
Very good.

410
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,700
Mm!

411
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,900
Want some breakfast?
Yeah.

412
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,400
Help yourself.

413
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,600
Breakfast is <i>good.</i>

414
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,700
(Rachel) Ugh!

415
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,500
It's called moisturizer.
Try some.

416
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,200
Next.

417
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,900
Ugh.
Your pores are enormous.

418
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,700
They have a thing
called whitening toothpaste. Next.

419
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,900
Dinky.
Kappa founder Kitty Cooper's hometown?

420
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,000
Little Rock.

421
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,400
<i>(giggles)</i>

422
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,200

This isn't <i>Dallas.</i>

423
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,400
Bye.

424
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,200
Eyebrows... meet tweezers.

425
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Tweezers,
meet your worst nightmare.

426
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
<i>(chatter)</i>
I know.

427
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,000
Next. Next.
Next. <i>(sighs)</i>

428
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,700
(Rachel) OK, future sisters.

429
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Get your lazy asses up.
You're gonna clean the bathroom.

430
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,300
<i>(all groan)</i>

431
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,400
At the Beta fraternity house.
<i>(all groan louder)</i>

432
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,200
Sydney, the Kappa Phi Nu colors?

433
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,900
Green and white.
Wrong. Emerald and pearl.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,100
Sorry.
I'm still learning how to speak priss.

435
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,800
<i>(all gasp)</i>

436
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,700
<i>(both yelp/scream)</i>

437
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,700
You know what?
Don't change a thing.

438
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,800
You just keep walking around
looking just like that.

439
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,200
You again.
Oh.

440
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
Morning.
Hi.

441
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Sorry you had to do that.
Some of the girls are a little traumatized.

442
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
(Sydney)
Yeah. It's OK. I, uh...

443
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,200
I spend a lot of time in bathrooms.

444
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,900
No, no. I don't mean like that,
I just mean that, um...

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,700
I don't go to the bathroom a lot, I...

446
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,000
Well, sometimes I do.
Kind a depends on what I eat.

447
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,400
Just to be clear, I spend
a normal amount of time in the bathroom.

448
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,400
Sydney. It's time to get back to the house.
OK.

449
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Don't ask.
We had to take her.

450
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,400
I think she's cool.

451
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
And cute.

452
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Just admit they're cooler.
You don't know

453
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
what the hell you're talking about.

454
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,700
There is no way that a pirate
is cooler than a ninja.

455
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,900
Ninja's live like monks.
Pirates get booty. End of discussion.

456
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,900
Hi. I need to return these
and I have a couple of poli sci books on reserve.

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,200
I'm impressed.
I don't get a lot of pledges in here studying.

458
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,700
Well, they probably don't
have scholarships to maintain.

459
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,300
You and your drunken, whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society!

460
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,900
(chuckles) All right.

461
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,400
I think we can all agree that
a pirate-ninja would be the coolest thing ever.

462
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,400
Hi.

463
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Oh, hi.

464
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,300
Hello.

465
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,300
I wanted to apologize
for what I did to you in the bathroom.

466
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,400
What did she do to you in the bathroom?
What did she do?

467
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,200
It was a stupid pledge prank
and I'm really, really sorry.

468
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,400
Hey, it wasn't exactly
surprising behavior for a Kappa.

469
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,100
Come on, uh, let's go.

470
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,000
Excuse me.

471
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,500
If it makes you feel any better, they threw baloney
at us while we sang CÃ©line Dion songs!

472
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,100
<i>(laughter)</i>

473
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,900
Girls, it's been along journey,
but you're almost done.

474
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,700
Tomorrow night is our Presents Dance
where you will be introduced as official Kappa sisters.

475
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,200
It's tradition for the current sisters to pass down
their Presents gowns to the new pledges.

476
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,500
After all, we're all size two.
<i>(all giggle)</i>

477
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Except you, Amy.

478
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,600
As president, I will draw the first name.

479

Yay!

482
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Come, Sydney.

Hey, Christy, why don't you check your standing?
I'm sure you've cracked the top 20 by now.

486
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Uh, what's that?

487
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,900
Just the school's <i>"Hot or Not"</i> ranking
on MySpace.

488
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,300
It's just some dumb list.
Oh. That does sound dumb.

489
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>Really</i> dumb. I betlame people
justlog on all day and vote for themselves.

490
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,200
No, we don't.
We're only allowed to vote once a day.

491
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Right, Rachel?

492
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,800
Hey, Rach, you're still number one.

493
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Am I? How cute.

494
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
It's been that way for forever.
You know how people are.

495
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,700
They just stick with the status quo.
That's why new people never make it on.

496
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh, my God.
Sydney's on it - number 213.

497
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
I am?
Let me see that.

498
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,900
But I thought you said
new people never make it on the list.

499
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,900
Well, like you said,
it's just some dumb list.

500
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,100
But aren't we just so lucky
to have you as a pledge?

501
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,200

just gorgeous in...

502
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,500

fearlessly conquer fraternity bathrooms,

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,100
and clean up nice, to boot.

Well, I'm more of a Peyton Manning.
Leinart's alefty.

So, uh, they go all-out
for these shindigs, huh?

523
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,100
It's a weird word - "shindig."

524
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,300
You eat? Because there are some
hors d'oeuvres over there.

Kinda hurt. <i>(laughs)</i>

Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid we have a bit of a situation.

539
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,300
Every so often, it is the unfortunate duty
of the president to act as judge and jury.

540
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,600
Sydney White has exhibited
inappropriate Kappa behavior.

Is this a pledge prank?
It certainly is not.

543
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,800
You are guilty of the following infractions:

544
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,600
You brought an unsuitable date
to the date dash,

545
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,700
cheated during a pledge quiz,

546
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,100
revealed a secret pledge ritual
to the entire library,

547
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,100
and, finally, lied about your background.

548
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,300
We all know your dad
is actually a plumber.

549
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,500
As Kappa president,
according to statute 25A of the sorority charter,

550
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,900
I hereby dismiss Sydney White
from the Kappa pledge class.

551
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,700
I don't know what your mother got away with
when she was here,

552
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,300
but you will <i>never be</i> a Kappa.

553

You know what?
Thank you.

554
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,900
Because if this is what sisterhood's all about,
then I don't want any part of it.

This is what I wore to my college interview

No, it's terrible.
You look like Barbara Walters.

And you said this wasn't a date.
It is not a date.

It's a little joint project of ours

1106

was the vortex.

was a dump, but I didn't...

1112
