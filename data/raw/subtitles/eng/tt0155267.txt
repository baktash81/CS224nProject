1
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,634
<i>(woman)</i> I want you to talk about women.

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,157
Mr Crown?

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,235
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,315
Women.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,711
You've yet to talk about women.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,353
Oh, I enjoy women.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,919
- Enjoyment isn't intimacy.
- Intimacy isn't necessarily enjoyment.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,996
How would you know?

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,829
Has it occurred to you
that you have a problem with trust?

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,272
I trust myself implicitly.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,756
Yes, but... can other people trust <i>you? </i>

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,472
You mean society at large?

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,955
I mean women, Mr Crown.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,992
Yes, a woman could trust me.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,593
Could?

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,032
Under what extraordinary circumstances
would you allow that to happen?

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,873
A woman could trust me...

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,196
...as long as her interests
didn't run too contrary to my own.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,114
And society, at large?

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,596
If its interests were to run
counter to your own?

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,958
Jimmy, I think I'll walk for a while.
I'll meet you at the office.

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,275
- And your briefcase?
- I'll carry it.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,269
<i>(screeching brakes)</i>

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,235
Jesus Christ!

25
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,911
<i>(driver)</i> Look at this jerk.

26
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,636
Morning, Mr Crown.

27
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,193
Bobby.

28
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,799
Back for your haystacks?

29
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,630
Don't ever let it go on tour, Bobby.

30
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,194
Oh, I'll lay down the law.

31
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,915
<i>(chuckles)</i> You're an odd duck.

32
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,191
Everyone else goes right for the Monet.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,836
Well...

34
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,871
...it's very nice.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,675
Nice? Do you know what it's worth?

36
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,434
I just like my haystacks, Bobby.

37
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,679
Yo, you better move it.
Come on, buddy, go! Move it!

38
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,236
Jesus Christ.

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,796
Straight on.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,388
Something's screwed up.
My list says some kind of a sarcophagus.

41
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,593
What do you want me to do? It's a horse.
You want me to take it back and dump it?

42
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,917
Nah, just unload the damn thing.

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,511
Boy, it's going to be hot today.

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,428
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- Morning, Sam.

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,949
- You can't let him...
- <i>(Crown clears throat)</i>

46
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,709
- You own the building or something?
- Excuse us, sir.

47
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,354
- What the hell's going on?
- He <i>does</i> own it.

48
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,914
<i>(lift bell)</i>

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,909
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- Morning. Good morning, one and all.

50
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,270
- Good morning, Mr Crown.
- John, welcome back.

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,310
Good morning, Mr Crown.

52
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,590
Good morning.
Give me good numbers, Jimmy.

53
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,675
Morning, Daria.

54
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,553
Good morning.
You forgot your briefcase, right?

55
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,591
I must have left it here last night.

56
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,833
We have a disparity here.

57
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,712
Yeah, I saw that.

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,748
Well, we can't leave it here.

59
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,548
Let's find out what the problem is.

60
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,239
That... is not...

61
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,157
...a sarcophagus.

62
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,272
It's Friday.

63
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,958
What did he mean by that?

64
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,389
Come Monday, there'll be hell to pay.

65
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,839
Deuce!

66
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,155
<i>(laughter)</i>

67
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,795
I never thought I'd see that.

68
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,799
Thomas Crown forced to sell <i>something! </i>

69
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,672
So, what do you think, Crown?

70
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,950
Any regrets about how you played this?

71
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,876
Regret...

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,355
...is usually a waste of time.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

73
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,436
As is gloating.

74
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,712
What will you say to your board when
they learn you paid me $30 million...

75
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,990
...more than others were offering?
Morning, gentlemen.

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,956
<i>(sawing)</i>

77
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,399
<i>(cracking)</i>

78
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,511
All right. English only from now on.

79
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,790
<i>Except for Janni. </i>

80
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,195
<i>Janni doesn't speak English. </i>

81
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,878
<i>(sarcastic laughter)</i>

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,116
Gentlemen, upon closer inspection...

83
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,595
...your proposal is not
as generous as it seemed.

84
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,633
There's no mention
of executive compensation...

85
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,990
We understand your objection
to the merger.

86
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,269
It's not a merger!

87
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,437
I'm afraid your stockholders
have spoken.

88
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
- We anticipated your reluctance.
- We won't be a Crown subsidiary!

89
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,915
Our attorneys are prepared to go
head-to-head with you at the SEC.

90
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,068
I thought that kid would bust a gut
when you brought up the SEC!

91
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,397
How's it go? "Sad to see
another tired man lay down..."

92
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,034
"Sad to see another tired man
lay down his hand...

93
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,957
...and quit the holy game of poker."

94
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,559
He's right, you know.

95
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,151
Third-generation company.
You'd think they'd have shown more grit.

96
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,269
McCormick wants to know
our bid on the BPT deal.

97
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,913
Speak to Scully.

98
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,712
Miso soup, Daria.

99
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,713
Go! Go! Go!

100
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,438
This painting is considered to be
the first lmpressionist work in history.

101
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,358
It started that movement and influenced...

102
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,268
...dozens of major artists
who went on to found the first school...

103
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,233
...or style, of the 20th century.

104
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,315
<i>(sighs)</i>

105
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, try this.

106
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,554
It's worth a hundred million bucks.

107
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,113
<i>(all)</i> Oh!

108
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,797
The government guy we paid off
on that deal is back.

109
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,388
No, this is the second time they lied.
Screw 'em.

110
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,078
- Turkey.
- Mr Schmidt called.

111
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,158
<i>(Daria)</i> The Douglaston conference call
is in ten minutes.

112
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,399
<i>This painting's by another famous artist. </i>
<i>His name is Renoir. </i>

113
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,795
Young lady...

114
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,879
...do not touch.

115
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,077
<i>(whispers)</i> I'll let you go this time.
On your way.

<i>(beeping)</i>

120
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,237
Hey!

121
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,070
Aargh!

122
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,759
Jimmy, go check the compressor room.
There's something wonky with the AC.

123
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,872
Can't we just pass it on to engineering?

124
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,958
- The book says we check it first.
- All right.

125
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,435
It would be
one of the hottest days of the year!

126
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,596
Can you believe it's nearly October?

127
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,395
<i>(lift bell)</i>

128
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,999
<i>(lift bell)</i>

129
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,036
- Why don't you bring the kids?
- You know how she is.

130
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,549
She'd run to court,
saying I was endangering them.

131
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,391
<i>(lift bell)</i>

132
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,118
- You're not kidding, are you?
- You wouldn't believe the shit she pulls.

133
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,318
The whole air-conditioning plant's
crapped out.

134
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,954
Why didn't they call maintenance?

135
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,036
Hmph!

136
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,917
- See you in the morning, Daria.
- Found your briefcase, I see.

137
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,268
Evidently.

138
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,755
- Good night, sir.
- Night.

139
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,229
Hey, they want to talk to you upstairs.

140
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,273
Me? Or the regular proctor?
Because McKinley'll be back in a second.

141
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,073
I think you should talk to them.

142
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,631
Call them if you like.

143
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,552
Administration, hello.

144
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,591
<i>Yes, this is Jeff, in wing eight. </i>

145
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,712
I was told you wanted to speak to me?

146
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,956
Okay, I'll be right up.

147
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,394
I'll, er, just go up.

148
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
Sorry, this exhibit is closing.
Please leave.

149
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,753
The exhibit is closed.
Please use the nearest exit.

150
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,792
The exhibit is closed.
We are closed for the evening.

151
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,115
We're closing. Please exit to the rear.

152
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,399
Thank you. This way.

153
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,909
Good night. Thank you very much.

154
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,598
This exhibit is closed.

155
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,551
What have we got here?

156
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,114
Hmm. It's only quarter to five.

157
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,637
We are closed.

158
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,239
For cleaning.

159
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,717
Hey, Bobby... I've been evicted.

160
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,831
- What?
- The lmpressionist Gallery.

161
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,359
Closed for cleaning.

162
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,993
- Cleaning?
- Yeah.

163
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,951
They're doing it right now.

164
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,159
Ed...

165
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,113
...lend me a hand here for a minute?
- Certainly.

166
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,197
Excuse me!

167
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,392
What are you doing?

168
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,875
Yes.

169
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,550
What?

170
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,874
Upstairs sent us down...

171
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,675
...to clear this exhibit.
They have some VIPs coming through.

172
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,268
I didn't hear about it.
I oversee this section.

173
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,709
Call upstairs if you like.

174
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,996
No, you're right.

175
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,680
They've been having people
down here all week.

176
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,076
<i>(shouting)</i>

177
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,233
Stop him!

00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,077
- <i>(shouting)</i>
- Look out, Mr Crown.

179
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,519
One at a time.

180
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,760
Keep moving. Move in a calm manner,
please. No need to panic. Thank you.

181
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,595
Hold it right there!

182
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,790
<i>(helicopter)</i>

183
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,956
Freeze!

184
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,957
Get your hands up!

185
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,954
<i>(sirens)</i>

186
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,469
<i>(whistles)</i>

187
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,309
68th and Lexington.

188
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,191
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Paul.

189
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,197
You want to put this in the study?

190
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,880
- I set out a bottle of wine.
- Thank you.

191
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,639
Ha! I may have won a cruise.

192
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,879
Oh, yes.

193
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,393
Mikey!

194
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,034
- Hi. Find the chopper?
- Abandoned in Queens.

195
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,438
- We know where it was stolen?
- Probably some pad in the Hamptons.

196
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,232
Mr Lenox!

197
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,352
Mr Lenox is the Director of the Museum.

198
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,357
Detective Michael McCann.

199
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,439
I'm sorry to be here, sir.
Who are the actors?

200
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,155
Four. Foreign. Probably Eastern
European. No print records.

201
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,955
Illegals. Check with Interpol.
The Russian government might help.

202
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,914
In the works. Point of entry
was a statue delivered this morning.

203
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,917
Brought in with their own security.

204
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,349
Next you'll say it was a horse.

205
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,433
- A Trojan horse?
- Bingo.

206
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,518
- Someone has a sense of humour.
- We've three digits of the truck plate.

207
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,076
- This place been hit before?
- They just lost their cherry.

208
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,475
Mr Lenox, was it just the one painting?

209
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,195
But such an important one.
A seminal work. A historical watershed.

210
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,117
It's truly irreplaceable.

211
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,834
Great neighbourhood.
Some broads here are wearing my salary!

212
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,916
So the skylight was rigged to blow?

213
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,510
Yeah, and there were cargo nets
spread out, ready to use.

214
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,916
They wore rappelling harnesses
under their clothes.

215
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,996
Okay. Right.

216
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,513
Right, let's just track
this thing through. So...

217
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,918
...they kill the air, make the place
uncomfortable, drive out the tourists.

218
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,998
They lower these gates
so nobody can get in.

219
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,557
They lower the paintings
into the cargo nets, pull the paintings...

220
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,277
...ditch the frames, and figure
they'll fly out of here like Peter Pan.

221
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,597
But somebody makes them early.
Chopper takes off.

222
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,711
Some make it, some don't.

223
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,752
Basically, amateur night. Right?

224
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,549
What's that?

225
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,638
It was wedged under the gate.

226
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,159
And?

227
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,516
Not exactly Samsonite.

228
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,069
Titanium. The engineer said...

229
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,272
...it'd have to absorb 15 to 20 tons
to stop this gate.

230
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,390
<i>(footsteps)</i>

231
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,989
<i>(woman)</i> Seems there may be
a couple of holes in your theory.

232
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,709
They shut off the air to drive out the
tourists, then escort them out anyway?

233
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,193
Then they close the gates
to keep everybody out...

234
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,757
...but block one of them open while
they prepare to load, conservatively...

235
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,192
...1,000 pounds of paintings and 800
pounds of men that we know about...

236
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,790
...in a, um...
What was the chopper model?

237
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,276
- Sikorsky S-76.
- Right.

238
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,439
In a chopper
with a 600-pound useful load.

239
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,755
You, er... figure you'll wrap this
by morning, Lieutenant?

240
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,236
It's Detective.
And I'm a little fuzzy about who you are.

241
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,271
- Sorry. Catherine Banning.
- Of?

242
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,517
Zurich Underwriters requested...
Actually they...

243
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,959
You're insurance.

244
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,277
The Swiss rather wouldn't
write a $100 million cheque.

245
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,551
- So I'm stuck with you on my back.
- Ohh...

246
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,877
Come on, Lieutenant. Who knows...

247
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,197
...you might enjoy it.
- <i>(chuckles)</i>

248
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,349
Oh.

249
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,029
Whoa!

250
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,357
1,000 bucks says you can't do that again.

251
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,116
- Tony, put another ball there.
- Tommy...

252
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,998
...it was a figure of speech.

253
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,872
Let's make it interesting.

254
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,399
Ten to one?

255
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,670
Fine. I'll take your money.

256
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,390
- Let's go again. Still ten to one.
- Tommy...

257
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,069
...that's $100,000
on a goddamn golf swing.

258
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,678
It's a beautiful Saturday morning, John.

259
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,360
What the hell else have we got to do?

260
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,869
All right. She does <i>live</i> in Europe,
but she's from the Midwest.

261
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,116
- Born Catherine Olds.
- Who's Banning?

262
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,390
An Englishman she married
for six months.

263
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,399
- So she's not law enforcement.
- Worse. Bail bonds and bounties.

264
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,873
- Tough people.
- Yeah.

265
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,630
Her father is an Ohio hard case named
Clarence Milton Olds, called Bumper Olds.

266
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,955
Story goes he kept a chain
on his bumper.

267
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,550
A guy ran on him once, he brought him
back on the end of the chain.

268
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,513
- You don't want to cross him, huh?
- <i>(door)</i>

269
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,313
Good morning. How are you?

270
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,997
I said er... how are <i>you? </i>

271
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,156
Jet-lagged. Thank you.

272
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,553
We thought we'd start with the, um...
security tapes. What <i>is</i> that?

273
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,432
You don't wanna know.

274
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,870
These are yesterday's tapes
from the lmpressionist Wing.

275
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,436
<i>(Catherine)</i> Why are they different
from the corridor cameras?

276
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,030
We're upgrading to thermal imagery.
So far, it's just the high value areas.

277
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,312
- It senses body heat.
- Got it. So that's the Monet that morning.

278
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,113
- Right.
- Okay, skip forward to the robbery.

279
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,909
- Time of the robbery.
- Whoa. Zip.

280
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,788
Was the camera working,
or did they cut the feed?

281
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,478
Oh!

282
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,389
<i>(chuckles)</i> No.

283
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,711
That's why they cut the air.

284
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,231
That could be. These things need
a ten degree difference.

285
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,909
If the ambient temperature
gets within ten degrees of the bodies...

286
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,031
...the camera can't tell
between people and walls.

287
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,958
How hot did it get?
Check the other cameras.

288
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,988
So, why can you see
people in this room?

289
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,596
The ambient in that wing
only went up to the mid-80s.

290
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,073
Okay, wait a minute.

291
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,589
You're telling me
that for some reason...

292
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,269
...the area around that particular painting
went above 90?

293
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,273
<i>(McCann)</i> What?

294
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,510
I don't know. Something.

295
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,473
<i>(McCann)</i> What, are we...
channelling now?

296
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,836
How long have you been doing this?

297
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,076
A while.

298
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,077
Where? In Europe?

299
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,599
And other places.

300
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,190
You're a real self-promoter.
Give me a for instance.

301
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,475
- How many legs?
- What?

302
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,511
The bench.

303
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,273
Two.

304
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,436
- You still have that tape up?
- Yeah.

305
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,472
Great. Back it up
to the morning part of the tape.

306
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,916
Stop.

307
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,599
Hello!

308
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,554
Jesus.

309
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,029
<i>(McCann)</i> So, they bring this in
earlier in the day. What's in it?

310
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,390
I mean, it could be a heater.

311
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,275
What?

312
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,870
In the briefcase, on a timer.
Bring the temperature up...

313
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,194
...ten more degrees.

314
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,789
- Do you ever eat?
- Hmm?

315
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,956
Lunch, for instance?

316
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,156
Do you like pizza?
I know a great place we could stop.

317
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,955
I'm on London time.

318
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,435
And pizza's not your thing. Okay.

319
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,475
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
Did she leave you for a stockbroker? Hm?

320
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,672
It's Detective. First Grade.

321
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
And uh...

322
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,872
...he was a urologist.

323
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,675
Can I drop you someplace?
At your hotel?

324
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,791
One, I keep an apartment here.

325
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,718
And two, I'm going to your office.

326
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,471
She keeps an apartment.

327
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,236
I keep goldfish.

328
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,750
Hey! Hello there.
How are you doing?

329
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,676
Detective.

330
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,995
Look, they don't seem to be Russian.

331
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,759
Davros thinks maybe Romanian.

332
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,996
- The witness is here.
- Right.

333
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,395
- Come on in!
- Hm-mm.

334
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,270
- Number four.
- <i>(McCann)</i> You're sure?

335
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,356
I'm sure.

336
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,390
Okay.

337
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,273
- Do you mind indicating that here?
- Certainly.

338
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,072
- Just check it off.
- Sure.

339
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,156
Could you sign down here, please?

340
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,590

<i>(Crown)</i> Thank you.

- Would you be willing to testify?

346
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,633
- Sure, absolutely.
- Mr Crown, I have to tell you...

347
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,035
...people like this might have friends.

348
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,357
You realise they might
try to make it ugly for a witness?

349
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,190
I understand, gentlemen, and, er,
I guess I'll take my chances.

350
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,992
<i>(Paretti)</i> We'll nail them.

351
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,271
<i>(Crown)</i> I can't imagine somebody
thinking they'd get away with this.

352
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,598
<i>(Polish)</i>

353
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,391
They say anything yet?

354
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,638
Not in English. We're still trying
to find somebody to translate.

355
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,997
Let me try.

356
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,276
Do not tell me you speak Romanian.

357
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,870
<i>(Catherine)</i> God, who would
ever bother with Romanian?

358
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,275
Give me the quiet one.

359
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,715
Okay.

360
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,753
Vous aimez les Etats-Unis?

361
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,593
Sehen Sie gern Gangsterfilme?

362
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,716
Mit Edward G Robinson.

363
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,029
Seine Familie stammt aus Rumünien.

364
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,313
Ich will einen Rechtsanwalt.

365
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,955
Aber Sie sind doch
kein Staatsbürger. Hmm?

366
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,510
Da gibt es keinen Prozeß.

367
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,035
Sie werden ganz einfach deportiert.

368
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,509
Rumünier ohne Ausweise
machen uns nervös.

369
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,156
Nervös.

370
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,870
Die könnten...

371
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,798
<i>... (whispers)</i> Securitate sein.

372
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,557
Deine Regierung nimmt Geheimpolizei.

373
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,632
<i>(grunts)</i>

374
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,548
Was die... mit dir...

375
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,673
...machen. Hmm?

376
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,076
They <i>do</i> speak English.

377
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,148
It was a pre-packaged robbery.
He picked them up in Little Odessa.

378
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,918
They were given timetables...

379
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,871
Okay, who's "he"?

380
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,075
You don't think they know, do you?

381
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,272
They were intermediaries,
never saw or heard him.

382
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,391
One-time hires. That's why they failed.

383
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,438
What makes you think they failed?

384
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,550
Maybe it was a successful robbery.

385
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,272
Maybe they were set up.

386
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,396
- Why?
- Diversion!

387
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,670
Make a lot of noise over there...

388
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,032
...so over here you take $100 million
off the wall and waltz out the door.

389
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,150
- Oh, that's good.
- Doesn't matter.

390
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,589
As soon as he tries to sell it,
we nail him.

391
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,071
Oh!

392
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,951
He's not going to sell.

393
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,832
- He's not?
- Mm-mm.

394
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,474
This is an elegant crime done by
an elegant person. It's not about money.

395
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,751
Okay, so who's going to risk prison
to steal a Monet...

396
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,314
...just to not sell it?

397
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,396
A Monet-lover.

398
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,438
Uh, whose desk is that?

399
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,869
- Um...
- Could I use it?

400
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,150
Yeah, sure.

401
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,349
Okay.

402
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,836
Let's dig up every major auction
in the last five years...

403
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,713
...and see who's been bidding on Monets.

404
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,918
See anyone we know?

405
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,835
Him? A big day for this guy
is taking off his tie. He's a finance geek.

406
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,356
Is he?

407
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,956
- How's that?
- Yeah!

408
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,036
<i>(laughter)</i>

409
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,116
Go, go!

410
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,871
Whoo-hoo!

411
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,638
Ease up!

412
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,395
Whoa!

413
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,916
No, wait!

414
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,800
Come on, get it up! Yes, let's go!

415
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,556
Yeah! Whoa!

416
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,990
I saw him wreck a $100,000 boat
because he liked the splash.

417
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,112
Do you have any idea
what kind of flesh-eating lawyers...

418
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,754
...this guy will have? Hmm?
- Hm-mm.

419
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,438
Plus political connections.

420
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,473
<i>(giggles)</i>

421
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,599
Mr Thomas Crown has very generously
loaned us a Pissarro...

422
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,632
- <i>(applause)</i>
...until our own Monet is restored to us.

423
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,196
Not to mention apprehending
one of the suspects. Come on!

424
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,910
I'm afraid Jim embellishes horrendously.
I just did what he does at fund-raisers.

425
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,270
I waved my arms in the air and...

426
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,834
...shrieked for help.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

427
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,435
Hello, Gloria. Lovely to see you.

428
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,518
- <i>(woman)</i> I knew him, you know.
- Did you, madame?

429
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,837
His son, that is.
Lucien Pissarro, in the '30s in Paris.

430
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,190
It's <i>very</i> impressive.

431
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,550
It seemed the right size for the space.

432
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,750
Or maybe you were bored with it.

433
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,238
Do we know each other?

434
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,839
Not yet. I'm Catherine Banning.

435
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,231
Thomas Crown.

436
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,397
Vodka rocks, twist and um...

437
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,080
...Scotch, neat.

438
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,992
How did you know that?

439
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,317
- I've been reading about you.
- Oh! Where?

440
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,509
In a file.

441
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,196
- Who do you work for?
- I'm in the art world.

442
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,231
- Dealer?
- Hm-mm.

443
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,315
Gallery owner?

444
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,429
No, it's closer to insurance.

445
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,676
I'm covered.

446
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,236
Not for this.

447
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,952
The painting?

448
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,516
The Monet?

449
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,274
You don't think
they'd simply cut a cheque...

450
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,197
...for $100 million, do you?

451
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,479
So, you...?

452
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,636
Get them things.

453
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,196
When there's this much money involved,
it usually means I get them...

454
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,959
...someone's head.
- Whose head are you after?

455
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,913
Yours. Good evening, Mr Crown.

456
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,997
Are you trying to, er... <i>(chuckles)</i>

457
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,193
Are you trying to imply that I had
something to do with that painting?

458
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,673
Trying?

459
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,358
Thank you.

460
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,596
No, I wouldn't call it an attempt.

461
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,790
What's your take for this?

462
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,593
Five per cent of the value recovered.

463
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,756
- A bounty hunter.
- If you like.

464
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,996
- Always get your man?
- Hm-mm.

465
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,351
Think you'll get me?

466
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,436
Oh, I hope so.

467
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,392
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- I have a car here, thanks.

468
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,875
Ah! Then, er, tomorrow?

469
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,549
- <i>(engine starts)</i>
- Us, dinner?

470
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,392
You're on.

471
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,034
Make it early.
We have a stop to make first.

472
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,514
- What's happened?
- Happened?

473
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,077
When I talk, while you're tuning out what
I say, the corners of your mouth go up.

474
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,873
You're enjoying something.
It's not me. What is it?

475
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,871
- An entertainment.
- Very little entertains you...

476
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,037
...so I can easily guess.

477
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,836
A worthy adversary?

478
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,549
Hmm?

479
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,194
Did someone swindle you?

480
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,276
<i>(chuckles)</i>

481
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,514
You waltz in there
without even a heads up...

482
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,030
...without one word to me
or anyone else in the department.

483
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,879
I, er, had a little chat with him, yes.

484
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,389
A little chat?
You told him he was a suspect.

485
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,158
I cut through the crap, okay?

486
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,075
How long was it gonna take you, Mike?

487
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,156
Weeks of wiretaps...

488
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,670
...if you could get them.
Guys tailing him to the bathroom.

489
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,519
I found out in ten minutes.

490
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,313
He did it.
The smug son of a bitch did it.

491
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,671
- You compromised the investigation.
- I jump-started it.

492
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,236
Oh, really? What do you have
to show for it, besides a date?

493
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,236
He likes the high wire.
I'm going to play with him for a while.

494
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,113
I could ask the question
who's playing whom.

495
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,231
You saying I shouldn't go?

496
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,955
Don't piss on the department,
Catherine, okay? We're on this.

497
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,591
How do you do? This is a warrant.

498
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,395
We're here to conduct a legal search
on these premises. I'd let us.

499
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,036
Jack, give me two men up here
and two more men in this room. Move.

500
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,390
John, take the back room.

501

This gentleman happens

Oh, keep your knickers on.
I'll get into his house.

<i>Mikey, you won't believe this. </i>

512
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,111
Know where's he taking her?

513
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,071
To the museum.

514
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,160
He's taking her to the fucking museum?

515
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,919
It's kind of sweet, you know?
For a first date.

516
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,998
Hey, I didn't know your portrait was here.

517
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,591
The faceless businessman in a bowler
hat. Everything but the briefcase.

518
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,597
Did you sit long for the artist?

519
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,119
- Actually, er, I <i>do</i> own a copy of that.
- <i>(laughs)</i>

520
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,791
Oh, of course you do.

521
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,717
And where might you be taking me?

522
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,270
Come, come, come.

523
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,076
Good evening, sir.
The museum is closing in 15 minutes.

524
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,679
Thank you.

525
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,554
- Oh, your loaner.
- Uh-huh. The least I could do.

526
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,752
Hm. <i>(sniffs)</i>
Oh, I see they have the air back on.

527
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,550
I shouldn't have checked my coat.

528
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,918
- Oh, thank you.
- Hm-mm.

529
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,828
You know,
if I had <i>my</i> pick in this room...

530
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,996
...I wouldn't have taken the Monet.

531
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,714
- No?
- No.

532
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,195
What would you take?

533
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,436
- For my personal choice?
- Hmm.

534
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,679
Um...

535
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,029
<i>That</i> one.

536
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,911
- You?
- Hmm.

537
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,751
You'd like to have that?

538
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,953
Why?

539
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,156
Would you get it for me?

540
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,316
Anything's obtainable.

541
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,270
<i>(chuckles)</i> Okay, I'll bite.

542
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,035
What would you do to get it?

543
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,749
I'd buy a print.

544
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,438
They're going into Cipriani.

545
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,755
I thought they were going to Le Cirque.

546
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,916
<i>I'm watching them walk into Cipriani. </i>

547
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,759
And with no reservation.

548
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,998
Scotch neat for me and I guess
the lady would like a, um...

549
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,109
What?

550
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,869
That the lady actually likes champagne.

551
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,072
- We have Krug Grand Cuvée 1981.
- Sounds great, thank you.

552
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,998
- Wonderful. On the way.
- You've been busy.

553
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,633
I'm sure your files are thicker than mine.

554
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,911
Well, the thing that impressed me most...

555
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,350
...was getting from Glasgow to Oxford
on a boxing scholarship.

556
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,516
Not bad for a wee lad from Glasgee.

557
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,200
It was easy. Rich kids cannae box.

558
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,673
<i>(Catherine chuckles)</i>

559
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,679
The hard part was learning to talk.
But you now...

560
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,155
- The matador?
- Hmm.

561
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,998
The Italian industrialist.

562
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,348
The Ambassador's son?

563
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,789
- He was cute.
- He was 17!

564
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,512
Yes, he was.

565
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,916
You must admit, that's a fair litany
for a girl from Lima, Ohio.

566
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,669
But what I didn't get...
I mean, it's obvious you like men...

567
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,719
...but you never keep any of them
around very long either.

568
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,872
Oh, well... men make...
women messy.

569
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,836
Thank you.

570
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,278
Here's to the fear of being trapped.

571
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,278
- Here's the fish for the lady.
- Thank you.

572
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,516
The lamb chops for the gentleman.

573
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,358
We'd like to pre-order soufflés.

574
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,869
And a bottle of burgundy
to those two gentlemen.

575
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,389
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

576
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,308
At least they look uptown. The ones
yesterday looked like flashers.

577
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,749
- Well, we do our best.
- I'm under glass.

578
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,793
Soon you'll know everything about me.

579
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,990
There are things we don't know.

580
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,549
Like what?

581
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,394
Like why.

582
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,316
Were you bored?

583
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,278
Acquisitions and mergers
looking a little stodgy?

584
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,314
Is it more fun getting it than keeping it?

585
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,670
- Is this the fun for you?
- How do you mean?

586
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,234
It's not about the money.

587
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,989
You like the chase.
Not many women get to chase.

588
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,394
It's like poker.
We don't let you in the game.

589
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,478
Right. My brothers said
I didn't have the mind for it.

590
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,637
- And now they're plumbers.
- Oh! But you knew that.

591
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,115
- Can I ply you with anything else?
- Nothing.

592
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,152
- Cheese? Would you like a...
- Would you like a deal?

593
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,035
Make it easy on yourself.

594
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,830
We'll just get more warrants, searches.

595
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,269
Mess up your carpeting.

596
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,356
May I...

597
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,399
May I ask you a very personal question?

598
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,756
Why not?

599
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,028
Would you like another hit of espresso?

600
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,033
- Would you like...
- Another hit of espresso?

601
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,119
Hmm.

602
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,436
- That's the very personal question?
- As good as it gets.

603
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,269
Oh! Excuse me.
May I ask you a very personal question?

604
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,437
- Oh, sure! By all means.
- Do you really think...

605
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,791
...l'm going to sleep
with a man I'm investigating? Hmm?

606
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,350
- Is that the question?
- That's it.

607
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,554
Why should I answer that when you didn't
seriously commit to my espresso?

608
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,438
All right. I'll seriously commit
to your espresso.

609
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,271
I'd let you in...

610
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,914
But the world is watching.

611
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,951
Yes, they are.

612
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,149
And besides...

613
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,872
...you have no furniture.

614
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,595
Oh, that's good. That's very good.

615
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,315
Good night.

616
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,634
Good night.

617
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,196

618
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,994
Ready?

619
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,789
Okay.

Thirteen.

626
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,558
Fourteen.

627
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,796
Fifteen.

628
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,597
Sixteen.

629
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,039
Seventeen.

630
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,514
Eighteen.

Don't glare at me, Michael.

648
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,269
So, are the laws of the United States
completely unknown to you?

00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,916
- Or is it cos you've lived in Morocco...
- Monaco.

650
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,998
I don't care.
It's illegal entry, theft, trespassing.

651
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,192
- I'm not a cop.
- Exactly. Cops know this won't hold up.

Five? Maybe six?

Damn. I hate being a foregone conclusion.

695
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,472
You live very well.

696
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,559
Thank you.

697
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,191
It'd be a shame to lose it all.

698
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,196
That depends...

699
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,197
...on a very large presumption.

700
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,912
Yes, it does.

701
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,154
I won't back off, you know.

702
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,752
Not even for a minute.

703
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,874
I would be hugely disappointed if you did.

705
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,709
Old joke. Very carefully.

706
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,798
Carefully. Or... unsuccessfully.

707
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,195
Don't see many porcupines.

708
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,357
Creatures with highly evolved
defence systems.

709
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,232
Like porcupines?

710
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,715
Like 42-year-old, successful...

711
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,558
...self-involved loners.

712
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,877
If you've found a female mirror image...

713
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,912
...and think you'll form
a rewarding relationship...

714
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,109
Think again?

715
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,997
Good morning.

716
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,751
Nice dress.

717
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,354

You gonna be a cliché?

720
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,076
Did you even think twice?

721
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,510
- No.
- You knew what you were doing?

722
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,509
My job. He likes me. He'll keep liking me.

723
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,232
Keep him right next to me.

724
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,475
And you don't care...

725
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,556
...what that makes you.

726
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,352
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do you really?

727
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,869
This is just about money, Mike.

728
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,080
Oh, oh, oh, he's got a problem.

729
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,596
I could get used to this.

730
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,154
- Just hold on now.
- Hold on why?

731
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,759

That's it. That's good.

- That's good.
- Oh, my God!

737

Head for that hill over there. Don't lose it.

738
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,597
There you go.

739
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,676
This is ridge-running. We're doing it.

740
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,314
- Oh, this is great.
- I'm in your hands.

- I do.

- Oh!
- Left. To the left.

743
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,559
We'll pick up a thermal

Oh, that's okay. We're only about
four states from your car.

Whoo, it's beautiful!

- I'm sure.

No.

You sure?

You think I believe you'd leave
your hard-stolen painting...

What if I did?

777
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,912
And that you'd tell me?

01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,519
Well, what if I trust you?

You know how likely I think that is?

782
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,312
Excuse me.

783
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,069

Then what would you have?

Not the painting,
not the $5 million fee, not me.

...pretty big.

01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,795

...l'm just an amateur.

That's right.

And did you pick anything... up?

829
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,032
Well, he's got an ornament...

830
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,197
...worn by Barbarossa

No.

833
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,709
So that's it, after two days...

834
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,956
...and two nights?

835
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,314
That was it.

01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,239
Not really.

839
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,555
Okay. Suit yourself.

01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,236
Three dates in six days.

You okay?

849
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,279
Yeah.

850
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,872
You know, I was okay once.

851
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,474
My girlfriend, er, got drunk.

852
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,833
Stayed out all night,
came back in the morning... married.

853
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,159
Yeah.

854
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,836
I told people I didn't care... and then I...

855
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,556
...fucked five women in three days,
flipped my car on an on-ramp...

856
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,551
...beat a suspect unconscious,
got suspended.

857
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,956
But um... I was okay.

858
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,310
Is there a point to this story?

859
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,230
But he was with him.

860
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,189
What's this?

861
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,276
Photos of the Monet's borders.

862
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,311
The borders?

863
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,228
Insurers remove a painting from the frame
to photograph its borders.

864
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,070
Borders are never seen in galleries
or auctions, so if a picture's stolen and...

865
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,714
...someone makes a forgery,
the borders won't match.

866
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,717
And if they do happen to match?

867
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,912
Then the forger
was in the presence of the original.

868
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,113
- So, if Crown's prank Monet is too good...
- Then we find the forger...

869
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,708
...and nail the bastard.

870
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,990
- How long have you had these?
- Five days.

871
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,599
And you didn't open them?

872
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,915
Yeah, well, they're open now.

873
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,353
- It's beautiful.
- You're not going to say...

874
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,516
..."I couldn't possibly"?

875
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,993
No.

876
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,348
I, er...

877
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,754
...I wouldn't say anything that boring.

878
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,118
She's an old friend...

879
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,754
...but it'll be like
having dinner in a morgue.

880
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,590
But you know, it occurred to me, I might
be able to bear it if you came with me.

881
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,951
Tomorrow? That's so soon.

882
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,231
I sense hesitation.

883
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,159
No...

884
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,595
No.

885
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,157
- Do you find my company monotonous?
- <i>(laughs)</i> No.

886
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,077
Cos I'd hate to think you could.

887
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,151
What, be bored by you?

888
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,157
Require a little variety?

889
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,871
You're referring to Anna.

890
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,593
They photographed me with Anna.

891
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,792
- You know, that's your prerogative.
- I thought they were.

892
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,911
I let it happen.

893
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,518
- Want to know why?
- No.

894
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,198
- I'll tell you.
- Don't.

895
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,675
- I want to tell you.
- I don't want to know.

896
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,631
Jimmy, I'd like to get out.

897
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,193
- Keep driving.
- Stop!

898
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,598
- I don't want to know why!
- Let me tell you!

899
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,154
- No!
- Ah, shit.

900
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,319
- Now ask me why!
- I don't want to know!

901
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,989
- You're upset about it!
- Yeah, cos you wanted me to be upset!

902
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,318
- I needed you to be upset!
- Ho-ho, he's sadistic! Who knew?

903
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,716
- Did it occur to you I needed to know?
- Know what?!

904
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,432
Know whether all it was to you...

905
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,629
...was the painting?

906
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,234
How else could I know?

907
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,676
What about you?

908
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,394
I can leave here tomorrow.

909
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,392
So can you.

910
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,396
- We'd be fugitives.
- Fugitives with means.

911
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,988
All the difference in the world.

912
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,117
<i>(whispers)</i> I don't know.

913
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,719
I don't know.

914
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:42,117
Oh dear. Peter Pan decides to grow up,
and finds there's no place to land.

915
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,390
The only sad part is...

916
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,273
...if she's anything like you...

917
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,517
...she won't know what she's lost
until it's gone.

918
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,077
Hey! Let's go.

919
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,110
Where?

920
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,231
The borders matched perfectly.

921
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,315
Then again, I'm sure you knew that,
didn't you?

922
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,309
Come on. Let's go meet some forgers.

923
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,556
I was never an lmpressionist.
Anyway, I pay taxes now.

924
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,113
Doing what?

925
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:21,755
Portraits.
Inserting the rich into old masterpieces.

926
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,032
- The wife's face on the Mona Lisa.
- Hmm.

927
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,754
From Brooklyn to Greenwich
in one generation.

928
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,836
You've gotta have the paintings to match.

929
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,632
So, who did it?

930
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,558
The German.

931
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,112
Heinrich...

932
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,073
<i>(Catherine)</i> Knutzhorn.

933
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,196
Art's a small world, Michael.

934
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,390
So, who do you think did this?

935
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,636
Frederick Golchan.

936
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,957
He said you did.

937
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,390
So you think if I want paint,
it just comes Fed Ex?

938
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,677
And the guards just think it's therapy...

939
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,078
...while I madly copy a Monet
in my cell from the original?

940
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,230
What?

941
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,674
What?

942
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,233
Nothing.

943
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,395
What?!

944
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,518
I was just wondering
about what he wouldn't say.

945
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,396
Give.

946
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,677
There's nothing.

947
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,558
You know what?

948
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,399
Life is full of shitty conflicts, okay? Give.

949
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:51,837
I just wondered if there was
a connection between them, that's all.

950
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,753
Between Crown and that old man?

951
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,354
Yeah.

952
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,471
- You are spooky. You are really spooky.
- They owned a gallery together...

953
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,799
...Crown and Knutzhorn. In Berlin, 1990.
Another one in Hamburg.

954
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,876
And one in Paris in '94.

955
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,393
You notice the one-man show
in Paris in '95?

956
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,316
The artist is Knutzhorn.

957
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,953
So?

958
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,238
So look at the first name.

959
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,430
Tyrol Knutzhorn.

960
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,551
Yeah, we spoke to a Heinrich.

961
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,755
You know what it was?

962
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,599
The way he smiled at the painting?

963
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,992
Pride.

964
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,430
Paternal pride.

965
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,156
I bet you it's his son.

966
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,273
Son of a great forger,
who paints as well as Dad.

967
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,436
Just hasn't been caught yet.

968
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,518
Well, I assume if you look...

969
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,155
...you'll find Tyrol Knutzhorn
lives in New York.

970
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,037
You know what?
I... er, I owe you an apology.

971
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,911
I didn't think you had the chops
to see this through.

972
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,758
You don't know me.

973
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,759
Yeah, but I should have. Cos...
I bet you'd stand at the Pearly Gates...

974
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,759
...and kick St Peter in the teeth
before you'd let someone play you.

975
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,271
Harold, listen carefully
and please don't interrupt.

976
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,598
If I had to be gone, and I mean
seriously gone, in about eight hours...

977
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,359
...how much could I take with me?

978
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,914
- <i>Are you okay? </i>
- Harold...

979
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,112
<i>You'd take an enormous loss, </i>
<i>liquidating like this. </i>

980
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:46,950
I understand, and that can't be helped.
What could I leave with?

981
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,994
<i>Call me in an hour. </i>
<i>I'll have a number for you. </i>

982
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,076
Okay.

983
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,556
Leaving us?

984
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,119
No, you're not that lucky.

985
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,038
I'm organising.

986
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,435
No Knutzhorn has been
to see the old man.

987
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,310
No?

988
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,230
There was a Knudsen, though,
three times last month.

989
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,749
Think that's a coincidence, or...?

990
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,472
Could be.

991
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,508
Yeah.

992
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,839
Probably is.

993
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,515
Hmm.

994
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,238
Look, here's an extra hundred.

995
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,635
- Just go, go!
- <i>(hooting)</i>

996
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,710
- Paul, is he here?
- He's in a meeting now.

997
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,754
- It's very important.
- If you wait in the living room, I'll get him.

998
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,156
Ma'am, wait.

999
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,271
<i>(Crown)</i> I know we have plug adapters,
I saw them.

1000
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,552
I just can't find them. Would you go
downstairs, Anna, and ask Paul...

1001
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,552
Well... we seem to have backtracked.

1002
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,196
- No!
- No.

1003
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,437
Take your hands off me!

1004
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,030
Come on,
what do you have that's fresh?

1005
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,230
Who's that girl and why is she here?

1006
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,555
Anna works for me.

1007
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,550
You never thought I was a fool before.

1008
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,513
I owe her money
and I wanted to pay her before I go.

1009
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,834
- Oh, really?
- Hm-mm.

1010
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,916
And what is it she <i>does</i> for you?

1011
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,231
I would be compromising her to say.

1012
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,237
Oh, Tommy, you're going away together.

1013
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,396
No, I'm going with you.

1014
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,555
Of all the things in the world
to take with a leap of faith...

1015
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,275
...how can I possibly trust you?
- I'm not gonna ask that.

1016
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,756
I'm going to trust you.
Isn't that what you wanted...

1017
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,757
...my trust?

1018
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,996
Tomorrow afternoon...

1019
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,757
...l'll put the Monet back.

1020
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,233
Where? Hanging back
on the wall in the museum?

1021
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,793
Yes.

1022
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,798
You know, Tommy,
I'm all checkmated out.

1023
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,275
If the painting's back, we're free.
We're only for each other.

1024
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,875
Back on the wall, in the museum?

1025
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,151
Yes, and you'll meet me...

1026
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,835
...at four o'clock
at the Wall Street heliport...

1027
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,996
...and we'll leave together.

1028
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,436
Or...

1029
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,518
Or you can have them at the museum
waiting for me.

1030
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,151
I'm trusting you.

1031
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,911
I can't... do that!

1032
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,395
Damn you, you son of a bitch! Get away!

1033
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,475
Hey.

1034
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,316
<i>(sighs)</i> Hi.

1035
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,636
I need to talk to you.

1036
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,193
- <i>Paretti. </i>
- Yeah.

1037
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,276
<i>You're in the lobby, right? </i>

1038
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:02,194
Yeah, Mikey, I'm here.
Me and about 30 other guys.

1039
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,836
Let up on yourself.

1040
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,552
You did the right thing.

1041
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,674
Assuming the son of a bitch shows up.

1042
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,920
<i>(sirens)</i>

1043
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,915
Mark, stay with the car.
Get a uniformed man on the fire escape.

1044
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,950
Got it.

1045
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,150
Detective!

1046
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:47,829
Shh...

1047
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,275
Yeah.

1048
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,994
Goddamn it.
Did she leave anything behind?

1049
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,636
Stake out the whole place.

1050
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,955
Maybe she'll come back. I don't know.

1051
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,274
No, no, no.

1052
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,039
Is Jack there? Put him on the phone.

1053
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,071
Get Jack!

1054
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,232
- What?
- The forger.

1055
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,989
You didn't think we just dropped that,
did you? Jack ran it down.

1056
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,669
It was a daughter.
She was under our noses the whole time.

1057
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,633
Tyrol Anna Knudsen, Knutzhorn...

1058
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,991
...whatever.
Crown's known her since she was ten.

1059
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,636
When her father went to jail, he became
her guardian. Put her through college.

1060
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,911
Now she works for his company.
Jack, here's what I want you to do.

1061
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,709
He's in.

1062
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,155
Got him.

1063
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,271
<i>(McCann)</i> I'll call you back.

1064
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,715
That's him.

1065
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,673
Overcoat and briefcase.

1066
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,672
Yeah, Mikey. We got him.

1067
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,951
Centre entrance. Grey overcoat.

1068
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,072
Bring up the lobby on the big monitor.

1069
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,153
<i>(McCann)</i> Move in quietly.

1070
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,748
- We don't wanna make a scene.
- Tommy...

1071
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,796
What the hell's he doing?

1072
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,275
Almost like he wants
to make sure we see him.

1073
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,590
Let's play ball.

1074
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,318
There he goes. Bowler hat.
Move in and pick him up.

1075
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,159
Go. Move it.

1076
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,790
Quietly. Excuse me.

1077
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,273
Excuse me.

1078
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,590
Shit. He switched the painting.

1079
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,551
Stay with the painting.

1080
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,148
What? Look, I can't...

1081
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,950
Shit! There's another one.

1082
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:03,150
- There's guys with bowler hats...
- All over the goddamn place.

1083
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,350
- Did you warn him?
- What? No.

1084
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,754
- Did you warn him?
- No!

1085
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:14,515
- Then he knew you'd betray him.
- They're going for the staircases.

1086
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:18,110
Now we got four floors to keep track of.

1087
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,552
Stay with him. He disappears,
it'll be ten years before he resurfaces.

1088
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,955
- Is the lmpressionist Wing sealed off?
- Yes.

1089
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,548
- No way to get in?
- The gates are down.

1090
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,831
He can't return the painting to that room.

1091
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,948
- They're everywhere.
- What's the deal?

1092
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,990
He's going the other way!

1093
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,797
What? What? Look, I can't hear you.

1094
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,429
This is ridiculous.
He's got us running around in circles.

1095
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,677
Paretti's trying to reach you.

1096
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,631
- <i>I can't... </i>
- You're fucked. I'm coming.

1097
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,469
What do we do?

1098
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,672
- What do we do?
- Start arresting people. Come on.

1099
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,272
Excuse me, sir. One moment.

1100
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,791
Shit.

1101
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:34,791
<i>(alarm)</i>

1102
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,839
I knew it.

1103
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:37,870
Excuse me.

1104
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,150
Get the civilians outta here.

1105
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,318
How do we get this gate open?

1106
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,432
Kill the sprinklers
in the lmpressionist Wing now.

1107
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:06,473
<i>(coughs)</i>

1108
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,116
It's water paint.

1109
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,311
It's been here the whole time. From what?
One, two days after the robbery?

1110
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:39,637
Something's jammed in the track.

1111
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,953
He returned the thing
almost as soon as he stole it.

1112
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,158
Er, sir?

1113
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,351
Oh, Lord.

1114
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:58,156
Oh, dear, dear. This can't be.
This simply can't be.

1115
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,955
- <i>(Paretti)</i> How the hell did he do that?
- <i>(McCann grunts)</i>

1116
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,277
Where are you going?

1117
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,116
Er, office.

1118
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,558
Write up my report.

1119
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,353
- The job's done, right?
- Yeah!

1120
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,472
So, the other painting. Why do you think
he chose that particular one?

1121
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,876
I have no idea.

1122
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:48,758
But, um, it's not insured by my people,
so I'm out of it.

1123
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,434
Obviously you'll still have to pursue it.

1124
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,878
I don't really give a shit.

1125
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,396
You don't care if you catch him?

1126
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,159
Well, I'll do what they tell me to do.

1127
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,596
- Did you ever care?
- Yeah!

1128
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:10,188
He pissed me off.

1129
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,639
But, look...

1130
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,916
The week before I met you...

1131
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:19,034
...I nailed two real estate agents and
a guy who was beating his kids to death.

1132
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,879
So if some Houdini wants to...

1133
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,276
...snatch a few swirls of paint
that are only important...

1134
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,994
...to some very silly rich people...

1135
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,110
...I don't really give a damn.

1136
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,756
You're a good man.

1137
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,356
Okay. Get out of here. And tell him...

1138
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,754
...I said hello.

1139
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,354
I've no idea what you're talking about.

1140
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,789
Go on.

1141
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,309
And don't stiff us for your phone bills.

1142
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,351
No.

1143
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,315
Taxi!

1144
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,436
<i>(hooting)</i>

1145
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,789
You know, I'm just going to run. Thanks.

1146
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,313
Excuse me.

1147
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:46,316
Ma'am, you can't go out there!

1148
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,279
Tommy!

1149
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,952
You would be Catherine?

1150
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,433
Yes.

1151
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,320
He wanted you to have this.

1152
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,795
Good day, ma'am.

1153
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,436
Hi there.

1154
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,869
How can I help you?

1155
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,590
I have a reservation.

1156
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,632
Okay. Miss Banning.

1157
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,355
Will you be carrying any luggage today?

1158
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,869
No.

...gets to this man at police headquarters?
This should take care of it.

1162
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,516
It won't get there till morning.

1163
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,358
That's fine.

1164
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:21,311
Departures for international flights
are up the escalator to your left.
