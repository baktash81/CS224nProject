1
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,910
Hey. Hey, hey.

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,580
Come here. Take a look at this.

3
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,920
What?

4
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,420
What is it?
It's a data stream from PS12.

5
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,550
Where is she?
Right above sector 14.

6
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,680
There isn't anything in sector 14.

7
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,850
There is now.

8
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,010
Hello?
Miss Woods. Pleasure to speak to you.

9
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,630
Who is this?
My name's Maxwell Stafford.

10
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,180
I represent Weyland Industries.

11
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,770
Let me guess. He's suing us again?
You misunderstand.

12
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,860
Mr Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year, if you'll meet with him.

13
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,440
When?

14
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,030
Tomorrow.

15
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,700
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
Take me a week to get back to the world.

16
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,120
Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,830
He said he didn't have a week.

18
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,520
We must be right on top of it.

19
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,870
What is it, Sebastian?

20
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,600
The burial chamber is here.
I know it. We are gonna find it.

21
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,480
I know it too, but without a crew
and a permit we're out of business.

22
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,570
Hold the team together for two days.
I'll go to Mexico City and I'll talk to the bank.

23
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,820
I'll get us more money.

24
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,950
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

25
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,450
Do I know you?

26
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,250
In exchange for a little of your time.

27
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,570
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've switched the flash off.

28
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,360
There's your magazine. Excuse me.

29
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
That's ok.

30
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,780
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

31
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,330
Jacob and Scotty.

32
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,160
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

33
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,500
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

34
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,840
Smile.
Ok.

35
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,260
There you go.
Thank you.

36
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,220
I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.

37
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,600
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

38
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
Do you work for Weyland?
Oh, no.

39
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,940
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

40
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,320
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

41
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,860
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

42
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,450
Thanks, Jack.

43
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,070
Is he a friend of yours?
Of my dad's.

44
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,280
He trained most of the pilots here.

45
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,210
Just passed the PSR.
Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

46
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,210
Of what?
The PSR.

47
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,000
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

48
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,550
The PSR is the point of safe return.

49
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,800
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

50
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,930
Right, but if something went wrong,
we could land, presumably.

51
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,390
We could ditch.
Yeah. Ditch.

52
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,610
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

53
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,080
Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.

54
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,460
Some of you may be wondering
why this team has been assembled.

55
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,130
Your host will give you the answer now.

56
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,380
Mr Weyland.

57
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,190
Seven days ago, one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

58
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,580
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth, which outlined this.

59
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,330
The red lines indicate solid walls.

60
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,880
Through thermal mapping, we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

61
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,170
It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms,
all built around a central core.

62
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,760
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

63
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,850
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

64
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,190
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

65
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,940
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

66
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,530
What they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

67
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,910
I think your experts are right.
Which one?

68
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,660
All of them.
Meaning what, exactly?

69
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,910
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

70
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,170
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

71
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,880
But built by whom?
By the first civilisation.

72
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,300
Thank you.

73
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,560
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

74
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

75
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,810
It's likely the continent was once habitable.
I can't tell you who built it.

76
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,320
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

77
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,950
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

78
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,780
What caused the heat bloom?
I don't know.

79
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,370
Where exactly on the ice is this?
Bouvetøya Island.

80
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,330
But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000ft below it.

81
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,130
Mr Quinn?
Mr Stafford.

82
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,880
You're looking at the best drilling team in the
world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

83
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,010
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

84
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,140
We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.

85
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,060
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

86
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,650
Others will be here soon.

87
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,360
Maybe I wasn't clear.
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

88
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,860
That's why I asked you here.

89
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,740
Bouvetøya is one of the world's most isolated
places. The nearest land is 1000 miles away.

90
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,540
There's no help if we run into trouble.
You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

91
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,420
But the train has left the station.

92
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,670
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

93
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,630
This is worth the risk.

94
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,600
Find another guide.

95
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,950
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

96
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,370
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

97
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,000
Who'd you get?

98
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,380
Gerald Murdoch.

99
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,430
Come in.
Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.

100
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,310
He's not ready.

101
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,390
Don't worry about it.
What about Paul Woodman?

102
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,770
We called him.
He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

103
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,310
"Bullshit"?

104
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:53,070
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit. If you
rush this, people will get hurt. Maybe die.

105
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,910
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

106
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,950
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid, and back. That's it.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,210
What about inside the pyramid?
Don't worry about that.

108
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,800
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy.

109
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Is this new?
It's the latest.

110
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,760
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

111
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,060
I admire your passion.

112
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,230
I wish you were going with us.

113
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,560
You're making a mistake.

114
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,990
It's in the upper atmosphere.

115
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,580
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

116
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,330
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

117
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,250
Shackleton called Antarctica
"The last great journey left to man".

118
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,260
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

119
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,470
It's completely free.

120
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,140
Me, I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

121
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,770
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

122
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,020
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

123
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,240
Your kids aren't that cute.

124
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,490
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

125
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,370
Want my advice?

126
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,160
Stay on the boat.

127
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,670
Ok. Let me ask you something.

128
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,210
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

129
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,800
or with the number-two choice?

130
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,680
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

131
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,390
They're waiting for you.

132
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,120
Everybody, listen up!

133
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,500
Gather round.

134
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,210
Told you she'd stay.
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

135
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,630
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

136
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,300
Gentlemen?

137
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,810
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

138
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,220
and I need your help to do that.

139
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,690
Since I don't have time to properly train you,
I'm laying down three rules.

140
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,320
One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.

141
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,610
Two.

142
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,280
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

143
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,910
Three. Unexpected things are gonna happen.

144
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,290
When they do, no one tries to be a hero.

145
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,590
Understood?

146
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,260
Yes, ma'am.
Good.

147
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,020
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

148
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,850
I don't plan on using it.
Then why bring it?

149
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,100
Same principle as a condom.

150
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,730
I'd rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one.

151
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,150
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

152
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,530
Move the trucks out on the ice.

153
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,450
Move that. OK, let's move.

154
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,720
What's with the bottle cap?
What?

155
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,640
What's with the bottle cap?

156
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,560
This is a valuable archaeological find.

157
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,780
When I was a kid growing up in Italy,
you know what they call a moon that big?

158
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,580
La luna del cacciatore.

159
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,420
Brava.

160
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,630
What's that?
Hunter's moon.

161
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,460
Hunter's moon.

162
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,280
Hold it, guys.

163
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,280
Keep those engines running!
Set it down.

164
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,740
Move over a little further. Connors.

165
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,310
It's an abandoned whaling station.

166
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:58,350
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

167
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,120
All right, bring it up. Come on.

168
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,870
Spread out.

169
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,300
We'll use this place as a base camp. Mr Quinn,
begin drilling operations as soon as you can.

170
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,590
I'm on it. Ok, guys, let's move out.

171
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,050
What are these?
Whale bones.

172
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,060
This station was abandoned in 1904.
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

173
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,230
It was a big mystery back then.

174
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,240
One for National Geographic.

175
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,790
Lex.
No one goes anywhere alone.

176
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,920
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

177
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,840
Careful. They bite.

178
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,280
Over here. Over here.

179
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,110
What is it?

180
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,740
Can you believe that?

181
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,210
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

182
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,710
How far does it go down?
All the way to the pyramid.

183
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,720
There it is. Clear as day.
And the same time yesterday...

184
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,890
Nothing.
How was it done?

185
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,890
Thermal equipment of some kind.
Like yours?

186
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,730
More advanced. Incredibly powerful.

187
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,900
I've never seen anything like it.

188
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,370
There's no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

189
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,910
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out.

190
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,190
Look at that. Change it. Now!

191
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,490
OK, guys, what's taking so long?
There's a storm coming.

192
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,460
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

193
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,460
My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

194
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,470
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

195
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,390
When you get sick, you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

196
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,310
You know what will happen when I go?
Ten per cent fall in share prices.

197
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,890
Maybe 12. That's it.

198
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,650
I've heard this speech before.

199
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,150
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

200
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,570
He was like you.
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

201
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,660
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

202
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,670
I had my first drink with my dad at 14400ft.

203
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,760
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung.

204
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,510
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

205
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,060
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers? The pain?

206
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,480
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14000ft in the air?

207
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,030
I need this.

208
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,160
Come on, move.

209
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,540
Shit.

210
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,970
Mr Weyland!

211
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,340
Man down!

212
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,260
Get him! Somebody get him!

213
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,950
Move it!

214
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,790
Now!

215
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,550
I don't understand it.
No equipment. No sign of another team.

216
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,970
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

217
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,600
Move it. Connors, get those lights up.

218
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,020
We have power.

219
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,480
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

220
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,820
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

221
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,400
Thank you. Thank you.

222
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,780
Thank you all for this.

223
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,580
Let's make history.

224
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,790
Thomas.

225
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,880
What is it?

226
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,630
I recognise the Egyptian...
The second symbol is Aztec.

227
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,390
Pre-conquest era. The third is Cambodian.

228
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,220
Then you were right.
The pyramid contains all three cultures.

229
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:12,150
That's what it looks like.
"You may choose to enter."

230
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,940
"Those who choose may enter."

231
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,360
Who taught you to translate?

232
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,450
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

233
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,120
Well, it's not "choose".

234
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,950
It's "chosen".

235
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,120
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

236
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,810
Quinn, is that you out there?

237
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,030
Mikkel.

238
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,800
What is all this?

239
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,510
This is the sacrificial chamber.

240
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,850
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

241
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,940
Whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice.

242
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,530
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

243
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,120
Those that were chosen would lie here.

244
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,790
They weren't bound or tied in any way.

245
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,960
They went to die willingly.

246
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,170
Men and women.

247
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,510
It was considered an honour.

248
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,350
Lucky them.

249
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:29,400
"They gave their lives
so the hunt could begin."

250
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,040
What happened here?

251
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,710
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

252
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,090
That's nice.

253
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,220
But that's not where your heart is.

254
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,310
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

255
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,100
Something broke out of this body.

256
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:00,040
What have you found, Max?
It's a shaft to another level.

257
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,830
Looks like there's another room down there.

258
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,190
Let's move to that lower room.
We're moving on, everyone.

259
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,780
Ms Woods.

260
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,740
You, stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him.
Keep a team with you.

261
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,620
Catalogue everything.

262
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,950
Professor.

263
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,100
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

264
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,570
Sebastian.

265
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,710
It's a sarcophagus.

266
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,380
This is the Long Count.

267
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,260
This is the Aztec calendar.

268
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,380
And this, it's some kind of combination lock.

269
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,100
"Days."

270
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,810
"Months."

271
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,980
"Years."

272
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,100
The dials are set for...

273
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,400
1904.

274
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,110
Someone opened this 100 years ago?

275
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,740
What's today's date?
October 10.

276
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,580
10/10/2004.

277
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,500
Are you sure this is gonna work?
I don't know.

278
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,270
Back up!

279
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,630
Oh, my God. Take a look at this.

280
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,160
Any idea what these are?
No.

281
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,530
You?
No.

282
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,790
It's a good thing we brought the experts.
Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

283
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,420
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

284
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,960
Weyland?

285
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,220
A little too much excitement.

286
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,100
We've been out long enough for today.

287
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,690
We'll set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

288
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,980
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

289
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,740
No. You wanted to leave
without proper prep. We did.

290
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,370
You wanted to be the first here. We are.
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

291
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,540
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

292
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,870
You heard her.

293
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,420
What do you wanna do with these?
Take them.

294
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,670
We'll run further tests on the surface.

295
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,550
No. No! Don't touch them.

296
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,070
Watch out!
The doors!

297
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,440
The door!

298
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,720
You Ok?
Yeah.

299
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,550
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
We'll never move it.

300
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,640
What did you say this room was called?

301
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,020
Sacrificial chamber.

302
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,530
Rousseau.
Tommy, come in.

303
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,370
Come in, Rousseau.
Come in.

304
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,710
Is there anything you didn't tell me?
Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine.

305
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,040
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

306
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,590
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

307
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:35,010
What are you doing?
My job. Yours is over.

308
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,520
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

309
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,940
And that gun doesn't change anything.

310
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,460
This bearing should take us back to the
entrance. We'll regroup at the whaling station.

311
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,460
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

312
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,040
We'll find them on the way up.
Max?

313
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,670
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

314
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,220
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

315
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,180
What do you mean?

316
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,680
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

317
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,980
I think that's what your satellite detected.
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

318
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Preparing.
Preparing? For what?

319
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,280
Gentlemen?

320
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,140
Keep close.

321
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,370
Recognise what's on their shoulders?
Yeah.

322
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:06,160
We worshipped these things?
According to this, we did.

323
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:12,420
And the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.

324
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,510
Let's keep moving.
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

325
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,370
Take cover.

326
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,040
Where's Stone?

327
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,170
Stone!

328
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,650
The pyramid's shifting again.

329
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,950
The doors are closing. Get out.

330
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,330
Come on.

331
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,750
OK. Let's go.

332
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,830
Let's go. Let's go.

333
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,830
Hey! Verheiden!

334
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,130
Verheiden!

335
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,420
Somebody!

336
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,800
Run! Let's go!

337
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,470
No!

338
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,600
Quickly!

339
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,020
No! No!

340
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,300
Hey! Can you hear me?

341
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,010
It's Connors! Where are you?

342
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,250
We're never getting out of this place.

343
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,210
Have you got any children?

344
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,380
Got a son.
Yeah, I've got two.

345
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,010
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

346
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,850
We're gonna make it outta here.

347
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,810
We're surviving this
if I have to carry you the whole way.

348
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,280
There's no way out back there.

349
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,910
What's that?
Just a theory.

350
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:30,290
The Aztec calendar was metric.
Based on multiples of ten.

351
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,210
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

352
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,110
Let's stick together.

353
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,030
Weyland.

354
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:17,250
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.

355
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,340
Sorry.

356
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,630
Connors? Connors!

357
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,810
Verheiden? Verheiden?

358
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,190
Oh, God.
Dr Miller! Get me outta here!

359
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,110
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

360
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,910
Verheiden!

361
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,830
No!

362
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,930
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

363
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,320
Oh, God.

364
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,600
Weyland.

365
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,020
You OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.

366
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,900
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

367
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,980
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

368
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,200
Give it to me.

369
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,800
Max.

370
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,350
Hold on.

371
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,600
Look out!

372
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,030
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

373
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,960
Weyland, come on.

374
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,450
What were they?
You're the expert.

375
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,410
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

376
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,040
Take it easy. Weyland.

377
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,840
Look at me.

378
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,550
You have to slow your breathing down.

379
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,130
Slow, steady breaths.

380
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,060
Weyland, come on.
I can hardly stand.

381
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,440
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

382
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,980
You didn't.

383
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,150
There's another one. We have to go. Now!
Weyland.

384
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,070
Come with us.
Get her outta here.

385
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,740
Now!
Come on.

386
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,450
Run!

387
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,940
Don't turn your back on me.

388
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,260
Wait.

389
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,310
This way.

390
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,160
Go! Go!

391
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,860
Look over here.

392
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,930
He's marking himself.
What?

393
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,560
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

394
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,900
It's a rite of passage.

395
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:58,240
This is starting to make sense.

396
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,210
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

397
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,010
But the story is all here.

398
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,310
Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.

399
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:35,820
They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.

400
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:44,200
Every hundred years the gods would return.

401
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,460
And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.

402
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,710
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.

403
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:07,730
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

404
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:11,770
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

405
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,870
But if the hunters lost,

406
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,880
they made sure nothing survived.

407
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,340
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

408
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,350
So...

409
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:52,900
the humanoids, the hunters -
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

410
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,110
And they use us like cattle.

411
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,900
We're hosts for them to breed in.

412
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,530
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

413
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,410
This whole thing was a trap.

414
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,120
Without us, there could be no hunt.

415
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,780
Shit!

416
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,900
Verheiden!

417
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,950
Oh, shit.

418
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,120
When that door opens, we're dead.

419
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,250
Not if we set things right.
What do you mean?

420
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,500
This pyramid is like a prison.

421
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,340
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

422
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,930
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

423
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:53,480
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

424
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,440
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt, the
animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.

425
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,030
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

426
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:05,900
It's time to pick a side.
We are on our side.

427
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:12,700
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

428
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:18,420
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

429
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,420
Because if they do,

430
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,550
everything everywhere could die.

431
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,510
The enemy of my enemy...

432
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,720
is my friend.

433
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,250
Let's go find our friend.

434
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,890
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?

435
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:16,930
Non vedo l'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.

436
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,480
More or less.

437
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,960
Move!

438
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,740
Lex.

439
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,370
Hold on.

440
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,660
Come on, Lex.

441
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,170
Oh, no.

442
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:21,030
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

443
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:33,130
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

444
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:38,250
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

445
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,220
What are you doing?

446
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:49,450
Miller!

447
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,000
Sebastian.

448
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,750
Help me, Lex.
I'm gonna get you out of there.

449
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:48,550
It's too late. It's inside me.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

450
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,920
You can't...
No!

451
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:53,970
No. No. No! No!

452
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:56,140
I have to help him.

453
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,140
Lex!

454
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:06,980
They mustn't reach the surface.

455
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:09,820
I know.

456
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,740
Do it!

457
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

458
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,750
It's a bomb.

459
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:50,000
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

460
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,800
You are one ugly mother...
