relationship stuff, it's getting to me.

184
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,999
I mean, I be feeling like my nuts are gonna explode.

185
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,367
[laughing]

186
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,402
And then when she does come to town,

187
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,205
I gotta struggle just to get her to get a little freaky.

188
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,009
You know what I'm s--? I be trying to tie her up and stuff and all that.

189
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,844
And she'd be acting all scared.

190
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,214
But I'm like, "Look, hold up, if I'm gonna try and get

191
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,384
all into you, then you gotta come correct."

192
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,953
You know what I'm saying? I mean, you got to satisfy me on the real.

193
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,189
I mean, we have fun.

194
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,193
But the sex,

195
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,228
hmmm...

196
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:35,401
I mean, it's good, but I don't know, I just... I guess I just...

197
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:40,039
I wish that Jermaine would hold me more,

198
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,974
touch me more, take his time.

199
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,943
I mean, I know he really loves me.

200
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,079
But I don't think he knows what I really like.

201
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,450
I totally agree. I tried to tell my wife the same thing.

202
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,285
I mean, I love my wife, but I want to feel like

203
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,821
I could be free and uninhibited with her, you know?

204
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,325
You know how men are sometimes. They treat us just like a ride.

205
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:03,195
They get on, get the thrill, get off, the ride's over.

206
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,798
-[laughs] -Right.

207
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,932
Now I know the married life

208
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,467
has you getting it all the time.

209
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,337
I mean it's not like y'all have anything else to do.

210
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,839
Man... [scoffs]

211
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,076
Fuck it, you don't know her.

212
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,078
Sex is straight.

213
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,813
I mean, when I don't have to mow the lawn

214
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,282
or wash her fucking car to get some, you know?

215
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,417
[laughing]

216
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,486
Girl, I knew there was something I meant to tell you.

217
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,321
How about my man has been trying

218
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,357
to get me to do it in the booty?

219
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,026
I'm like, "Hold on, freak nasty,

220
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,162
could you save something for the honeymoon?"

221
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,297
Wait a minute, they must be reading the same book.

222
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,498
I mean Jermaine hasn't asked me

223
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,134
to do something like that but...

224
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,438
What I really want is a ménage à trois.

225
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,972
A ménage à trois?

226
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,441
Ménage à trois.

227
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,309
Ménage à trois.

228
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,914
Yeah, ménage à trois.

229
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,517
Damn, girl, I ain't know it was like that.

230
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,985
Yeah, I mean, he's been bugging me

231
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,254
about it for the past two months.

232
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,522
I mean, come on, Tammy, how do I look

233
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,524
letting him do something like that?

234
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,027
That's just me letting him, or giving him

235
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,029
permission to sex another woman.

236
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,998
Not necessarily, it really depends on

237
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,301
the understanding that you have with your man.

238
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,903
Girl, you talk like you've

239
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,171
done something like that before.

240
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,410
She be tripping. She thinks I'm out

241
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,879
trying to sex other women. That's not it.

242
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,848
I've been down that road before,

243
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,182
and I don't want to go there again.

244
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,819
I just want to get fine and freaky with my wife.

245
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,888
Girl, you didn't.

246
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,959
I did, once, a long time ago.

247
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,360
You a little freak.

248
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,863
Hey, hey, but if you really want to go that route,

249
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:49,034
I mean, if you really serious, oh, I know the perfect girl.

250
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,336
-[Jermaine] Yeah? -Mmm.

251
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,071
Well, what's her story?

252
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,273
Afterwards, did you think you were like...?

253
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,308
Gay? Hell, no.

254
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,312
A little bit on the wild side but not gay, okay?

255
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,548
I love my man, girl.

256
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,187
Hey, quiet is kept, it was kinda live.

257
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,956
Really?

258
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,592
She used to waitress at this strip club I used to go to.

259
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,494
We used to kick it when she was on break.

260
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,996
[Jermaine] Yeah.

261
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,534
Oh, my God, tight, pretty as she wants to be.

262
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,237
She's got a little shorty, but she probably be down.

263
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,375
But anyway, it's up to you. You know, if it were me,

264
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,977
I would do whatever it took to make my man happy.

265
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,046
Besides, he is your husband.

266
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,615
I know, Tammy, but I mean, that's out there.

267
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,584
Well, if you don't want to do that then do something else

268
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,486
to distract him something else kinky like

269
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,489
tie him up, table dance, strip, anything.

270
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:48,861
Yeah, yeah. Tell me something.

271
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,865
What was it really like?

272
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,604
Ooh, I saw you check out that girl.

273
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,139
Ahh...

274
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,107
Yeah, mmm.

275
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,375
-You like that? -Yeah.

276
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,578
-There's some drinks in the fridge. -Mm-hmm.

277
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,279
Make yourself comfortable.

278
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,514
I'll make myself at home.

279
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,316
Yeah, and I'm gonna check up on Derrick.

280
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,317
All right.

281
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,024
Hey, Derrick, I'm home.

282
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,667
Hey.

283
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,569
You been drinking.

284
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,010
Well, you know your mama loves you.

285
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,385
[man on radio] And the question of the day would be...

286
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,654
[woman on radio] How far would you go to please your mate?

287
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,122
[man on radio] Caller, you're on the line.

288
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,390
What's your name, and where you calling from?

289
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,625
[woman 2 on radio] Divine, Decatur.

290
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,294
This shorty right here, you best believe,

291
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,029
would do it all for her baby.

292
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,531
So all you uptight, sophisticated women,

293
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,400
you better watch out, 'cause you don't

294
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,069
take care of your man, someone like me will.

295
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,671
[woman on radio] Girl, I got your back.

296
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,973
I'm feeling you 'cause, if you don't take care of it,

297
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,409
you know another lady's gonna step right in.

298
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
-[Terrance] Hey, Jermaine. -Hey.

299
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,117
[Terrance] I got this fax from Williams, Russel, and Johnson.

300
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,518
They're your clients?

301
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,422
Yeah, I'm working on their contracts right now.

302
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,225
They're designing the building over on Spring Street.

303
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,494
I needed this, thank you.

304
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,496
Hey, Terrance, you want to come over

305
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,197
this weekend and watch the game, man?

306
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,532
At your house?

307
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,302
Yeah, I'll have the wife cook up some vittles.

308
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,038
We could just hang out. You can bring your girl.

309
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,141
Got plans this weekend, man,

310
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,743
but when my lady comes back in town, we'll see.

311
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,314
[knocking on door]

312
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,149
I'll talk to you later.

313
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,016
How are you?

314
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,418
Just fine, just fine.

315
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,220
Terrance, I've been hearing great things about you.

316
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,091
Keep up the good work, and you just might end up like Jermaine.

317
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
[laughing]

318
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,361
[Terrance] Thank you, sir.

319
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,163
Thomas, how you doing?

320
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,298
Oh, just fine.

321
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,800
[Jermaine] What can I do for you today?

322
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,403
The rumor going around is that you

323
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,407
are next in line for the big case.

324
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,110
Are you kidding me?

325
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,679
I'll fill you in later.

326
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,284
All right, all right.

327
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,420
[chuckling]

328
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,157
[crickets chirping]

329
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,160
[inhales deeply] No.

330
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,630
[loud whoosh]

331
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,268
-[mutters] -[loud whoosh]

332
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,482
[gasps]

333
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,320
What's wrong, baby?

334
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,194
Just hold me, baby.

335
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,068
You having one of your nightmares again?

336
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,342
I wish you'd talk to me about it. I want to help.

337
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,880
I just want to block it out, okay?

338
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,882
I just want to find out what's happening with my wife.

339
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,850
Can we just not fight tonight?

340
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,552
Who's fighting?

341
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,853
All you tell me is that you having

342
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,322
nightmares about some old boyfriend.

343
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,690
Please?

344
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,227
No, I work hard every day, baby,

345
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,131
to support us so you can go back to school.

346
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,635
And you won't even talk to me.

347
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,871
[sighs]

348
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,875
You know, it's real frustrating. I'm your husband.

349
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,777
-You know? -I'll do it.

350
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,880
And I don't think it's fair that, you know...?

351
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,483
What?

352
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,385
I said I'll do it.

353
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,490
Are you talking about what I think you are?

354
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,133
When did this happen?

355
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,904
Hmm? How long have you felt this way?

356
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,439
I don't know.

357
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,478
I've been thinking about it for a few weeks.

358
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,214
And you're right.

359
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:39,518
You have been wonderful, supportive.

360
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,820
I know I haven't been easy to deal with lately.

361
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,426
And if it's what it takes to make you happy, then okay.

362
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,733
All right.

363
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,579
Are you sure you wanna do this?

364
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,183
Yes, baby.

365
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,288
Promise me one thing.

366
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,724
That this is about us,

367
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,794
and not about you and some other woman.

368
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,199
I promise.

369
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,204
I love you, baby.

370
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,312
You're the most beautiful woman.

371
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,549
I love you.

372
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,296
[Thomas] Jermaine.

373
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,330
Good morning, Thomas, how are you today?

374
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,565
Oh, just fine, just fine.

375
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,466
Now you know your presentation

376
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,001
is in a couple of weeks, right?

377
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,937
Yes, so what do I have to do?

378
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,005
I left the information on your desk.

379
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,607
There's a lot of material to absorb,

380
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,509
but you have the whole weekend.

381
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,612
Great, I'll have the preliminaries for you on Monday.

382
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,013
That's what I wanted to hear.

383
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,114
All right.

384
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:23,355
Terrance, excuse me, can I talk to you for a minute?

385
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,623
[Terrance] Yeah.

386
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,657
Excuse me.

387
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,928
-What's going on? -Oof.

388
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,533
Yeah, she fine as hell and she don't have a man either.

389
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,867
Listen, remember what I was talking to you

390
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,571
about before, about the girl you know?

391
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,874
Yeah, why?

392
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,612
No, you don't mean...?

393
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,747
-Yeah, she's with it. -Ah, dog.

394
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,019
So, what's up with your girl, man?

395
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,522
I don't know. Um, I'll talk to her.

396
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,991
But you know, you sure you don't need

397
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,061
a brother like me to join in, and do another love love?

398
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,463
No, fool, just set it up with the girl.

399
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,931
All right, all right, I'm playing.

400
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:10,002
But for real, you know, you gonna let a brother join in?

401
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,771
I'm playing with you, I'm playing with you.

402
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,841
Let me call her, and we can set up a meeting for after work.

403
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,346
Are you sure she hasn't been here already?

404
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,848
Nah. Mm-mm.

405
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,583
She's not one of these girls stand around here?

406
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,085
No, she said she'd be here around 8:30.

407
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,553
She's just a little late. She got, you know...

408
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,788
[Jermaine] What's taking her so long, man?

409
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,989
We've been here forever.

410
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,324
She probably had babysitting problems.

411
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,761
Here she comes now.

412
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,566
[Jermaine] Oh, she is fine.

413
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,679
Hey, lady.

414
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,846
Hey, Terrance.

415
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,583
Mmm. [giggles]

416
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,854
Jermaine, this is Jade.

417
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,859
Jade... [chuckles] Jermaine.

418
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,494
Hmm.

419
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,497
[Jermaine] Nice to meet you.

420
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,027
So this is the guy that's gonna

421
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,695
pay me to fuck him and his wife.

422
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,530
Yeah, see what he's got--

423
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,065
Hey, hold up.

424
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,700
I didn't hear nothing about paying.

425
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,737
Look, nigga, if you gonna do this, it's gonna cost you.

426
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,772
Well, so what are you, a prostitute or something?

427
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,975
No, I just got to take care of some business.

428
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,910
See, Jade got some court issues with her baby's daddy.

429
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,812
Don't be putting my shit out there.

430
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,615
Relax, old boy's a lawyer.

431
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,518
Yeah?

432
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,987
Yeah, but back to the money issue.

433
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,555
How much are we talking here?

434
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,660
A thousand.

435
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,797
A thousand? You're smoking.

436
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,699
Why you wasting my time with this, Terrence?

437
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,068
Hey, you said you were in a bind. I was just looking out.

438
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,503
[Jade] Whatever, man.

439
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,106
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,989
My wife can't know that I paid you.

441
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,926
Whatever.

442
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,962
No, I'm serious, never.

443
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,798
No problem.

444
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,601
[laughs]

445
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,575
So when can we hook up?

446
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,513
Tomorrow.

447
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,148
-[Jermaine] Yeah? -Yeah.

448
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,989
I'm assuming that, since I'm paying, anything goes.

449
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,560
It's all good, as long as she's comfortable.

450
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,695
Hey, hey, hey, hey, now, you know I can always

451
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,131
join in and help y'all work things out.

452
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,165
No.

453
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,934
She'll be fine.

454
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,270
Just make sure I get my money's worth.

455
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,839
I wouldn't even have to participate.

456
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,075
I could just, you know, cheer y'all on.

457
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,643
No.

458
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,879
[Jade] Got you.

459
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,682
Y'all meet me at First Fridays tomorrow night.

460
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,717
I'll handle the rest.

461
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,153
Hey, hey, I know y'all want the memories.

462
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,254
I could film it.

463
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,922
-No! -No!

464
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,958
Damn, all right.

465
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,560
Y'all some selfish folks.

466
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,129
[laughs]

467
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,167
So how do we get in contact with you? Is there a number?

468
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,272
Terrance knows how to reach me.

469
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,881
[Terrance] So come on, give me some details.

470
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,950
[Jermaine] All right, it took a little time, you know.

471
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,320
Jasmine was at home. She was kind of nervous.

472
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,023
I didn't know you were trying to do it tomorrow, Jermaine.

473
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,826
We're not doing it tomorrow. We're just meeting her.

474
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,229
I mean, who is she? How do you even know this woman?

475
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:35,233
We don't know her. That's what we're gonna find out.

476
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,869
We gotta get to know each other.

477
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,341
It's gonna be cool, okay?

478
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,110
[Terrance] So she didn't want to do it right away?

479
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,279
[Jermaine] Not at all, man, not at all.

480
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,215
She was very apprehensive.

481
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,352
But after we got to the club, club is real nice.

482
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,820
Nice place!

483
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,355
She was still apprehensive but she

484
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,890
started to come around a little bit.

485
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:05,030
♪ You don't ever stray no more, no, no ♪

486
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,033
♪ Don't you ever take your love away ♪

487
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:14,272
♪ Oh, my baby, I need you here today ♪

488
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,077
[crowd cheering]

489
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,712
Thank you.

490
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,148
Thank you, thank you.

491
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,185
Let's give it up for Miss Keanna Henson and the Chronicle.

492
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,921
[Jermaine] And out of nowhere, Jade comes walking in.

493
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,790
Nice to see you again, Jermaine.

494
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,361
Jasmine, this is Jade. Jade, this Jasmine.

495
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,929
Nice to meet you.

496
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,698
You too.

497
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,133
[laughs] Why don't you go get us some drinks, hmm?

498
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,403
All right, I'll be right back, baby.

499
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,308
[Jade] I know you're nervous, but it's cool.

500
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,411
Does it show that much?

501
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,814
[Jade] Yeah, but it's understandable.

502
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,117
But look at it like this, niggas are simple to please.

503
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,719
They only need three things in life,

504
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,787
to eat, sleep, and to fuck.

505
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:05,890
How do you like Atlanta?

506
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,425
I know you haven't been here too long.

507
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,160
It's okay.

508
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,763
So what do you do here, you go to school?

509
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,199
I applied to grad school. I'm waiting to hear now.

510
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,867
[Jade] Oh, yeah?

511
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,102
I want to work with battered women.

512
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,937
Oh, that's cool, that's cool.

513
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,872
So where'd you go to school before?

514
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,174
I went to Tennessee for a couple of years,

515
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,043
and then I finished at home.

516
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,411
Where's home?

517
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,179
Birmingham.

518
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,781
Ahh.

519
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,449
So why did you drop out?

520
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,319
Did you get pregnant or something?

521
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:38,823
[laughs] Oh, you know, I mean, that's what happened to me.

522
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,060
See, I got mixed up with a immature guy

523
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,729
that was a baseball player, and he got drafted,

524
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,999
I got pregnant, so I had to drop out.

525
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,367
And you?

526
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:54,472
I was in a bad relationship I needed to get away from.

527
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,908
So you have a child?

528
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,780
Yeah, yeah, Derrick. He's four going on 44.

529
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,483
That's my little man. I love him to death.

530
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,252
-Ooh. -What's up Jade?

531
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,486
[Jade] Hey.

532
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,755
So you gonna get up with me later or what?

533
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,957
Ahh. We'll see.

534
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,059
Oh, it's like that?

535
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,226

714
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,962
I wish he was that into me, when it's just,

715
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,866
you know, me and him, without all this craziness.

716
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,636
I don't know, I think we just need to step back

717
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,843
from all this sex and get into each other emotionally.

718
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,478
Mentally.

719
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,980
Whoa, okay, you just said a lot.

720
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,649
Now first of all, I think that you and Jermaine

721
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,151
should sit down and have a talk,

722
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,521
and you tell him how you really feel about this whole thing.

723
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,490
And besides, you know how men get.

724
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,192
They go into withdrawal when you take the pussy away.

725
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,464
[sighs]

726
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,433
Hey, baby, how was work?

727
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,202
Let's talk about something else.

728
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,072
That good, huh?

729
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,741
How was your day?

730
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,477
It was fine, but you look tired.

731
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,112
I am tired.

732
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,116
Is there anything I can do to make it better?

733
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,588
Yeah, you know what will make it better.

734
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,124
No, Jermaine.

735
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,961
You just asked me if there's anything

736
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,630
you could do to make it better.

737
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,599
Yeah, but I didn't mean sex, okay?

738
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,203
Man comes home from a hard day at work

739
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,806
and gotta listen to this shit from his wife.

740
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,574
What's the problem, Jermaine?

741
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,943
Huh? It's not that serious.

742
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,945
Not for you, but it is for me.

743
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,048
It's like I gotta jump through fucking hoops to get some.

744
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,285
Or you just want a brother to hold you.

745
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,253
Next thing I hear is that I'll have to

746
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,123
bring a woman in her before you'll get freaky.

747
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,725
You know what? Whatever, Jermaine, okay?

748
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,594
Your perverted ass ain't about to have me

749
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,963
hanging from the ceiling every damn night.

750
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,131
Perverted ass?

751
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,332
[Jasmine] Yeah.

752
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,601
You act like I was the only one in here the other night.

753
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,969
Well, it was your idea.

754
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,139
You know what? I don't have to listen to this shit.

755
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,874
Jermaine, where you going?

756
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,976
Jermaine?

757
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,311
Jermaine, don't slam--

758
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,146
[door slams shut]

759
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,058
[Terrance] What's up, man?

760
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,727
Don't you have a home, man? I see you here all the time.

761
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,162
Talk to me. How was it?

762
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,296
Was what?

763
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,966
Ooh, what's eating Gilbert Grape?

764
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,267
How was your weekend?

765
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,568
I don't even wanna talk about my weekend.

766
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,637
I had the worst Monday ever, man.

767
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,038
I almost lost my case.

768
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,874
Thomas is up my ass.

769
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,042
I can't even think straight.

770
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,211
The weekend, man, come on.

771
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,212
Man.

772
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,681
How was it?

773
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:59,917
The weekend was...

774
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,585
-It was great. -Uh-huh. Yeah.

775
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,654
-It was a fantasy come true, yeah. -I know it was.

776
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,790
-Yeah. -So come on, give me some details.

777
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,194
-All right, well... -Mm-hmm.

778
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,829
Yeah.

779
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,898
I mean, the next morning we all felt

780
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,000
so close to each other, you know.

781
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,701
Mmm.

782
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,970
It was live.

783
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,140
So, what now?

784
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,809
What, what now?

785
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,077
Is she gay?

786
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:27,978
Is who gay?

787
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,613
Jasmine, your wife.

788
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,715
You said she got down with Jade, and they were all into it.

789
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,151
So is she gay?

790
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,222
Ahh!

791
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,924
Nah, she ain't gay, man.

792
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,792
It's just one of those things that happens.

793
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,196
[Terrance] Okay, I just know that women get into

794
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,899
each other, and they get close in ways that we can't.

795
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,734
So I just wasn't sure.

796
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,103
Well, I'm sure, all right?

797
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,371
All right, calm down.

798
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,273
No, I'm just looking out for you, that's all.

799
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,374
Oh, you're looking out for me?

800
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,143
Yeah.

801
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,382
So you think she might want to do it again?

802
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,087
I don't know, maybe.

803
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,024
I mean with another guy this time?

804
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,893
What?

805
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,928
You're fucking bugging.

806
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,130
Seriously, and I'm not talking about me.

807
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,333
I'm talking about you being fair.

808
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,235
If she wanted to do it again with you and another guy,

809
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,870
would you be down like she was down?

810
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,741
Hell, no, another nigga and my lady? Fuck that.

811
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,142
See, now how you sound?

812
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,410
You want her to please you,

813
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,347
but if she wanted it, you wouldn't be down?

814
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:46,724
You know what? I completely forgot the time. I gotta get.

815
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,058
Cool.

816
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,868
Mmm.

817
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,810
[cries out]

818
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,418
[crying]

819
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,423
Jermaine.

820
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,427
Jermaine!

821
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,240
Jasmine.

822
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,376
Jazz, I'm home.

823
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,479
I know you here, baby.

824
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,849
Jazz?

825
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,887
Baby?

826
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,759
Jasmine?

827
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,263
Jazz?

828
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,504
Come on, baby, I don't want to play tonight.

829
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,878
I'm sorry, baby.

830
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,749
I'm sorry.

831
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,120
[crickets chirping]

832
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:39,103
[piano music]

833
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,215
[women laughing]

834
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:09,566
What the hell?

835
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,341
Isn't this what you wanted?

836
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,013
No!

837
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,815
[gasps]

838
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,027
Jasmine.

839
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,397
Jasmine!

840
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,670
Hey.

841
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,874
Morning, Kelly, how you doing?

842
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,876
Oh, I'm fine.

843
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,346
Good, good.

844
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,648
Yeah, I mean, listen, I was wondering

845
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,285
if you had spoken with Jasmine.

846
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,690
Hey, Michelle, good morning.

847
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:42,025
Good morning, Dolly.

848
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,894
Camille?

849
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:46,530
This is Jermaine.

850
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:09,019
[phone ringing]

851
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,324
Hello?

852
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,961
Hi, this is Jermaine.

853
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,296
[laughs]

854
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,433
How are you doing? I haven't spoken to you in a hot minute.

855
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,435
I've been okay.

856
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:29,172
I don't know why you calling me at 599 in the morning.

857
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,208
I know, I'm sorry.

858
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,379
I shouldn't even be asking you. It's a stupid question.

859
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,614
But is Jasmine over there?

860
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,185
And what if she is?

861
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,655
Is my wife over there?

862
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,257
You should have never walked out on her.

863
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,960
Put my wife on the phone.

864
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,596
She'll call you when she's ready.

865
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,531
What?

866
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,733
Put my wife on the phone.

867
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,735
[phone beeps off]

868
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,039
Hello, hello?

869
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,087
[phone ringing]

870
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,755
[deep male voice] Please leave a message.

871
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,491
Hello, Jade, it's me.

872
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,694
Could you please put Jasmine on the phone?

873
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,597
Jasmine, if you can hear me, please pick up the phone.

874
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,168
Jasmine, please, come on, baby.

875
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,570
I don't want to play no games.

876
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,772
Would you please just pick up the phone?

877
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,543
Jade, you know this ain't right.

878
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,447
Hello?

879
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,050
Hello, could you pick up the fucking phone please?

880
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,719
Hello?

881
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,387
Ah, fuck!

882
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,330
You hungry, Jazzy? I made you breakfast.

883
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:07,170
It's okay. I... I think I should be getting home.

884
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,672
You go home when you're ready.

885
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,774
You don't have to take nothing from him.

886
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,343
He knows where you are, and you see,

887
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,479
he hasn't called you back.

888
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,197
[deep male voice] Leave a message.

889
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,811
[piano music]

890
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,782
So what do I do, Ms. Paul?

891
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,350
I don't want him to take my son.

892
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,152
I understand that.

893
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,590
But to be perfectly honest, it doesn't look good.

894
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,192
You're a single mother.
