1
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,565
GloboTech Industries, long recognized
as the worldwide leader...

2
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,069
...in high-tech weaponry,
is now reaching even higher.

3
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,613
Under the leadership of CEO, Gil Mars...

4
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,618
...GloboTech engineers are blazing the trail
into tomorrow"s most exciting sector.

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,412
Introducing advanced
battlefield technology...

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,248
...into consumerproducts
for the whole family.

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,252
For the first time, you and yours will enjoy
the same high quality standards...

8
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:30,632
...as demanded by the Defense Department,
atprivate sectorprices.

9
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:35,512
GloboTech, turning swords into plowshares
foryou and your family.

10
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,540
He's here. He's early.

11
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,584
He's not supposed to be here yet.
He said....

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,629
Slamfist optimal. Good. Check.

13
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,716
Chickens.

14
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,552
Let me help you with these.

15
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,846
Pretty exciting, huh?

16
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,349
l don't know. l think it's kind of sad.

17
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,728
Heartland Toys has a long tradition
of bringing joy to kids.

18
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,980
Gil Mars won't care about that.

19
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,024
He's just going to care about profits.

20
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,275
l think it sucks.

21
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,361
Welcome to Earth. You may not be
familiar with our customs...

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,364
...but things work like this down here,
in the real world.

23
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,241
Well, the real world sucks.

24
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,410
lt does have its perks.

25
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:46,207
Gentlemen, l'm Ms. Kegel,
executive assistant to Mr. Mars.

26
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,671
Let me be the first to welcome you
to the GloboTech family.

27
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:57,344
Just as he's done with his computer,
telecommunications and food divisions...

28
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:01,389
...Mr. Mars intends to bring his own
personal touch to Heartland Play Systems.

29
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,183
Well, that's good.

30
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,772
All right.

31
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,774
These are....

32
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,485
Where's everybody else?

33
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,612
There is no longer any ''everybody else''.

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,739
Mr. Mars, it's an honor--

35
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,950
Cut the kiss-ass.
After l leave, l won't remember your name.

36
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,285
This is lrwin Wayfair.

37
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,914
l'm told you two are responsible for this.

38
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,376
Yes, sir. That's Flatchoo,
he's part of the Belch Brigade.

39
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,003
Actually, the whole line was lrwin's idea.

40
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:40,470
Once l did the marketing, it was the most
successful product in company history.

41
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,057
That's why l bought the place
and why you two are still onboard.

42
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,810
So, let's talk about the future.

43
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,612
Okay, these are Gorgonites. They....
Hi. How are you today?

44
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,780
l'm late.

45
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,659
Okay. l drew up some pictures.

46
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,953
That's a picture you can have.

47
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,125
All right, these are Gorgonites.

48
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,334
And this one.

49
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,213
This is Archer.
He's the grand, noble leader of....

50
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,258
Okay, and Troglokhan...

51
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,177
...the navigator who navigates.

52
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,682
Okay, they're monsters
from the land of Gorgon.

53
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,893
They've come to our world and are lost.
To return to Gorgon...

54
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,813
...they have to learn all about our world.

55
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,816
This way, kids can learn and do research--

56
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,193
Excuse me. Did you say ''learn''?

57
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,154
Learn, yeah.

58
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:40,905
Next.

59
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,867
Mr. Mars...

60
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,704
...let me introduce you to...

61
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,416
...Major...

62
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,672
...Chip Hazard,
leader of the Commando Elite.

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,803
lt's called multimedia, lrwin. Look into it.

64
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,517
The future is here.

65
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,270
A new age has dawned...

66
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,607
...for action!

67
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,368
The world"s most awesome
high-tech fighting force...

68
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,954
...is ready to battle for
the next millennium.

69
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,165
Chip Hazard, reporting for duty!

70
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,917
Wait. Hold on.

71
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,921
Hold on, hold on. Can they really do that?

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,715
-Do what?
-Punch out of the box.

73
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,425
No.

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,469
l didn't think so.

75
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,889
There's a disclaimer.
Legal says we're completely covered.

76
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,016
You know what l'm sick of?

77
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,978
Commercials showing trucks
popping up on Mount Rushmore...

78
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,231
...and parking on Abraham Lincoln's head.

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,943
And shampoo commercials that say
women can look like Claudia Schiffer...

80
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,612
...after one cycle of rinse and repeat.

81
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,532
What if these toys actually could talk?

82
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,952
What if they could walk?
What if they could actually kick ass?

83
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,328
Nick Nitro.

84
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,040
Toys that are so smart
when kids play with them...

85
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,500
...they play back.

86
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,170
Toys that actually do what they do
in the commercials.

87
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,715
That's an interesting idea.

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,758
Forget the ''Batteries not included'' crap.

89
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,219
Put in a lifetime GloboTech lithium cell.

90
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,472
They'll run forever.
That'll piss off the guys at Eveready.

91
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,311
How's this slogan? ''The Commando Elite.
Anything else is just a toy.''

92
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,689
''Everything else is just a toy.''

93
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,899
That's good, too. Sure.

94
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
Sir?

95
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:46,072
You know, that kind of computing power
doesn't really seem feasible--

96
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,035
lrwin, we're part of GloboTech.
We can find the technology.

97
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:55,457
Our missiles can find a bastard 7,000 miles
away and stick a warhead up his ass.

98
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,377
This won't be a problem. They're soldiers.
What do soldiers need?

99
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,130
-Hats?
-Camouflage?

100
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,299
Ms. Kegel?

101
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,383
Enemies, sir.

102
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,554
Enemies. See, these hideous,
ugly freaks are the enemy...

103
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,307
...and our guys have to find them
and vaporize them.

104
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,477
No, they're not.... Sir?

105
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,855
Don't you think that's a bit violent?

106
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,858
Exactly. So call it action, not violence.

107
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,319
Kids love action. lt sells.

108
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,281
Besides, what are you worried about?
They're only toys.

109
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,663
l can't believe this. This is really wrong.

110
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,376
lt's a total perversion of everything
l designed these Gorgonites to be!

111
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,961
Can it, lrwin. This is a golden opportunity.

112
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,006
lf we pull this off,
Mars will be eating out of our hands.

113
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,549
By the way, gentlemen...

114
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,969
...Mr. Mars expects the product
ready for shipment in three months.

115
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,262
Three months?

116
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,808
No. lt takes at least six months.

117
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,018
There's product testing and focus--

118
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,230
Three months is fine.
Tell Mr. Mars they'll be ready then.

119
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,690
All right, then.

120
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,900
These are your security cards.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,821
They give you unlimited access
to all top-secret Globo technology.

122
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:12,992
And these are your individual,
secret passwords. Memorize them now.

123
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,580
Mine's ''Gizmo.''

124
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,791
l said ''secret.''

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,343
Password. Password.
What's my password?

126
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,850
Gizmo.

127
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,564
Let's find us some chips.

128
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,403
Some really good chips.

129
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,574
A lot of really good chips.

130
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,956
The X1000.

131
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,501
Hello, Mr. Chips.

132
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,798
This looks like a nice store.
Look at those toys.

133
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,218
Come on, Grandma.
This place never has anything good.

134
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,290
Hey, Alan.

135
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,336
How's the world treating you?

136
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,422
-You, Joe, are the highlight of my day.
-Jeez, tough break, kid.

137
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,009
-New truck?
-New owner. See?

138
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,099
Soon everything will be owned
by one giant corporation.

139
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,393
Then, it's good-bye microbreweries.

140
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,812
So, where's your dad? l got his order.

141
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,564
He's going out of town tonight
for a seminar.

142
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,109
Wait a second. He left you in charge?

143
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,070
l was as surprised as you.

144
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,074
l think he's starting to trust me again.
Or maybe he didn't have a choice.

145
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,868
What's the seminar?

146
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,122
''How to make a success
of your small business.''

147
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,332
l suggested torching the place.

148
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,670
Not a good idea. Arson forensics
nowadays are very sophisticated.

149
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,136
''Gorgonites and Commando Elite.''

150
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,680
What are those?

151
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,100
Let's find out.

152
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,819
Ten-hut!

153
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,656
Major Chip Hazard, reporting for duty, sir!

154
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,660
Wow. Voice activated. Not bad.

155
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,331
They move, they talk.
They got a built-in, two-way radio.

156
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,252
''Buy a second commando
and communicate with a friend.''

157
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,091
Halt! Who goes there?

158
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,346
Greetings. l am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

159
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,975
Awfully polite for a monster.

160
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,437
You never have to replace the battery.
That's a good thing.

161
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,776
Hey, Joe. Do you think you could
front me a set of these?

162
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:38,902
What?

163
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,113
Sort of lend them to me.
You got plenty in the truck.

164
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,326
That's Toy World's inventory
for the month.

165
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,286
This order's paid for.

166
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,163
l'll pay you back after l sell them.

167
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,457
What about your dad's policy, no war toys?

168
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,378
Don't worry about my dad.
By the time he gets back, they'll be sold.

169
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,505
And we'll have made some money for once.

170
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,133
l don't know.

171
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,220
You're saying that never in your career...

172
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,139
...has anything just fallen off
the back of the truck?

173
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,183
l don't like your tone.

174
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,059
Sorry.

175
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,727
lt's too loud.

176
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,773
Okay, one whole set.

177
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,609
l'll lose the paperwork someplace.

178
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,029
-l had better not regret this.
-You won't. l swear.

179
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,281
And you've got to get them off the truck.

180
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,035
-I could getin trouble for this.
-No one will know.

181
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,789
They better not. These toys don"t go
on sale officially until Monday.

182
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,167
I could loose myjob.
I could loose my house.

183
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,228
Thanks, Joe. l owe you one.

184
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,313
You owe me twelve.

185
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,151
Good luck, kid.

186
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,629
Freeze!

187
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,613
l wanted to go to Toy World.

188
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,574
Life is full of disappointments.
Go look around.

189
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,079
His birthday's next week.
Mom said l had to take him shopping.

190
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,748
Great. What kind of stuff is he into?

191
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,419
Dinosaurs, mutants.
Anything that maims, kills or destroys.

192
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,171
l just got in--

193
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,716
You're Alan Abernathy.
You moved into the house behind mine.

194
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,843
l've heard about you.

195
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,637
-You have?
-Yeah.

196
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,307
How come l never see you after school?

197
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,643
l'm kind of stuck here.

198
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,728
What kind of toy store is this?

199
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,023
lt's my dad. He thinks these toys are cool.

200
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,359
Too bad nobody else does.

201
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,697
The Commando Elite will rid the Earth
of the Gorgonites.

202
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,492
The Gorgonites are peaceful.
We mean no harm.

203
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,663
Gorgonite, you are a hideous freak.
You will be vaporized.

204
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,834
Civilian, declare your allegiance.

205
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,545
Cool.

206
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,172
l know what l want!

207
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:51,219
l want the soldier! They're walking
and fighting and they're so cool!

208
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,806
Where'd they go?

209
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,227
What about this one?

210
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,271
No, l want the other one.

211
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,107
Major Chip Hazard. He's the one.

212
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,026
-How much are these?
-A lot.

213
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,361
Mom and Dad won't buy you one of these.

214
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,823
Yes, they will.
They buy you those stupid Gwendy dolls.

215
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,908
All right, Timmy.

216
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,746
Save me one of the buff guys.

217
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,331
-And a monster, too.
-l don't think so, brat.

218
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,044
-l'll find it and hold it till tomorrow.
-How about the flame-thrower?

219
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,632
-When will l get that toy?
-Never, if you don't shut up.

220
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,637
Say ''hi'' once in a while.

221
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,955
-Meet death with honor, coward.
-There you are.

222
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,383
Congratulations. You're practically sold.

223
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,844
You, l'm not so sure about.

224
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,351
Troglokhan.

225
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,149
Punch-it.

226
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,321
Oh, man! Dad's ticket!

227
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,953
Okay, suitcase...

228
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,872
...briefcase, keys. Keys.
Where are my keys?

229
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,708
Right where you left them.

230
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,626
And where did l leave them?

231
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,340
What is wrong with me? What else?

232
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,342
Stuart, please, try to relax.

233
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:58,471
Remember why we moved here.
To get away from the stress.

234
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,890
To eliminate the stress.

235
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,726
To...

236
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,728
...exhale...

237
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,147
...the stress.

238
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,280
Mom! l know what l want for my birthday.
l want a Major Chip Hazard.

239
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,158
-Don't upset your father.
-Hi, Dad.

240
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,951
-Hi, sweetie.
-What's up?

241
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,245
-Al here was just telling me--
-Ed.

242
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,415
He was telling me the angle
of the Earth's tilt on its axis...

243
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,460
...relative to the orbit
of the transmission satellite...

244
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,963
...restricts the placement
for optimum reception.

245
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,215
Yeah.

246
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,427
ln other words, this tree is in the way.

247
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,471
Right. Exactly.

248
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,766
No problema.

249
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,900
Knock that off!

250
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,904
Stuart, dish guy says the tree has to go.
You don't mind, do you?

251
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,073
-Yes, l mind!
-What?

252
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,119
l said, ''yes, l mind!'' What the hell
are you doing, Phil? This is my tree!

253
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:08,750
Happy to do the work. What are neighbors
for? lsn't the dish a beauty?

254
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,003
No. This tree is beautiful.

255
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,298
That dish is just one more piece
of techno-crap...

256
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,510
...to go along with the rest
of your stockpile of techno-crap!

257
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:22,430
You're already pulling so much juice,
you got us living in a cancer node.

258
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,891
There's never been
any conclusive data linking--

259
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,518
Give me that saw, Phil.

260
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,938
Stuart, come on.
Airplane now, vendetta later.

261
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,150
l'll check the zoning laws,
but l think they'll prove me right.

262
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,160
Hasn't he heard of the dishes
that go on top of your house?

263
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,954
Maybe they don't get as many channels.

264
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,539
He probably got a deal.

265
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,206
Dad!

266
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,711
Alan, you're supposed to be in the shop.

267
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,088
You forgot your ticket.

268
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,340
My ticket.

269
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,218
Thank you, son. Way to stay heads up.

270
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,387
Occasionally l do something right.

271
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,763
l'm out of here.

272
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,933
-Hurry but drive carefully.
-l'll call you when l get there.

273
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,102
Give me a smooch.

274
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,397
-Bye-bye. Bye, son.
-See you later, Dad.

275
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,750
-The door was locked when you left?
-Yes.

276
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,626
Did you empty the cash register?

277
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,755
Both quarters and all six pennies.
And l shut off the lights.

278
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,881
Just asking.

279
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,551
lt's possible l make it through
the entire day without screwing up.

280
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,535
What the....

281
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,918
How the heck did you get in here?

282
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,766
What was it? Halt! Who goes there?

283
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:34,771
Greetings. l am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

284
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,107
Sure you are.

285
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,694
Beware. There will be no mercy.

286
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,362
ls that so?

287
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,156
Beware. There will be no mercy.

288
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,493
l'll be real careful. Thanks for the advice.

289
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,334
Greetings. l am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

290
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,420
What is your name?

291
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,173
l'm Alan. Now shut up.
l have to do my homework.

292
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,927
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.

293
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,680
What did you say?

294
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,184
You just said my name, didn't you?

295
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,815
Didn't you?

296
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,294
Commandos! Ten-hut!

297
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,049
Commando Elite, fall in!

298
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,440
Sound off, soldiers!

299
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,777
Butch Meathook, sniper.
Lethal from any distance, sir!

300
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,278
Good to have you aboard.

301
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,365
Nick Nitro. Demolition is my mission.

302
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,617
l served with your father.
He was a good man.

303
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:56,246
Brick Bazooka, artillery.
Ready to go full bore, sir!

304
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,580
Save it for the enemy.

305
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,543
Link Static, communications.
Awaiting orders, sir!

306
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,837
Double up on your rations, Sparky.

307
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:08,049
Kip Killagin, covert insurgent.
Sharp as a razor, sir!

308
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,218
Let me see that weapon.

309
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,347
Standard issue is insufficient.

310
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,933
All right, ladies, now listen good.

311
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,854
Our mission:
Destroy the Gorgonite enemy. Defeat him!

312
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,272
Yes, sir!

313
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,983
There will be no mercy.

314
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,946
Search the area and secure new arms.
Commandos, fall out!

315
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,066
Gorgon.

316
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,302
What the heck are you?

317
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,767
You're not like any toy l've ever seen.

318
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,396
Come on, speak up.

319
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:33,361
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.
l am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.

320
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,823
l think you're smarter
than you're letting on.

321
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:42,162
l bet you're smart enough to get my name
right. lt's Alan. Just Alan. Got it?

322
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,331
Greetings, Alan.

323
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,585
l knew it. Walk to the end of the table.

324
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,173
Don't play dumb with me.

325
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,008
You know what l'm saying.

326
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,066
Alan, friend of Archer.

327
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,861
Defender of all Gorgonites.
Keeper of Encarta.

328
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,280
Keeper of Encarta?

329
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,201
You were using my computer?

330
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:25,246
lf l find a virus in there,
you're headed for the microwave.

331
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,917
Beware. There will be no mercy.

332
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:32,003
Are you threatening me?

333
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:36,383
The Gorgonites must be free.
There will be no mercy.

334
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:48,478
Soldiers, no poor sap ever won a war
by dying for his country.

335
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,731
He won it by being all that he can be.

336
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,527
Damn the torpedoes or give me death!

337
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,863
Eternal vigilance is the price of duty.

338
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:02,951
And to the victors go the spoils.
So, remember...

339
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,788
...you are the best of the best
of the few and the proud!

340
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,332
So, ask not what your country
can do for you...

341
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:12,627
...only regret that you have
but one life to live.

342
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:16,297
The war against the Gorgonites
will be won!

343
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,720
Commando Elite, let the first shot be fired!

344
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,973
Search out the Gorgonites
and frag them all!

345
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,891
Attack!

346
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,644
Get him! Jump on him!

347
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,688
Plastic at twelve o"clock!

348
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:38,653
Archer, where are you, anyway?

349
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,577
l am in so much trouble.

350
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,621
There will be no mercy.

351
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,959
This is what you meant?

352
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,212
How could toys do this?

353
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,429
Alas, poor Troglokhan.

354
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:08,558
l'm sorry, Archer.
That's all the pieces l could find.

355
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:12,937
The Commando Elite
have destroyed Troglokhan.

356
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:16,941
What about the other Gorgonites?
And where are the Commandos?

357
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,578
Hi. We're closed. See the sign?

358
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,706
l'll be quick. l just came for Major Chip
and the monster.

359
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,667
l can't sell you them. Sorry.

360
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,378
But you're the only store that has them.

361
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,088
The toys are gone, all right?

362
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,382
Well, what about him?

363
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:45,720
Him. He's defective...

364
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,265
...and the rest were stolen.

365
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,059
That's too bad.

366
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,813
Alan...

367
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,564
...we must find the--

368
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,984
Oh, my God.

369
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,279
Who did this?

370
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,369
Are you pulling
some kind of insurance scam?

371
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:15,041
l swear, l did one thing wrong.
That's it! And l'm branded for life.

372
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,293
So, it is true.

373
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:22,757
l heard your parents moved here because
you got kicked out of ten different schools.

374
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,134
l did not.

375
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,885
No?

376
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,102
lt was two.

377
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,729
Only two.

378
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,986
So...

379
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,947
...you need some help?

380
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,577
-Alan, can l talk now?
-No.

381
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,874
l can't believe they broke my dad's radio.

382
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,837
Do you ever watch that show,
Family of Five?

383
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,088
Sure.

384
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,548
You like it?

385
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,133
lt's okay.

386
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:08,386
Thank God! Me, neither.
l hate it. lt's so lame.

387
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,221
l'm sick of hearing it's so great.

388
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:12,557
l can't stand the parents. They're so nice.

389
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:16,186
-The worst. Where do these go?
-Over there.

390
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,316
l'm more of an X-Files guy myself.

391
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,818
''The truth is out there,'' Alan.

392
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,280
You like Led Zeppelin?

393
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,491
Yeah, they're the greatest.

394
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,951
They're my favorite band.

395
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,206
You're not like other girls.

396
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,249
l know.

397
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,469
l can't believe we've finished.
lt took less time than l thought.

398
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:52,097
And the boat looks great.

399
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:55,266
lt wasn't that messed up.
The mast was the hardest part.

400
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,851
He'll never know.

401
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,939
So, what did you do?

402
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:06,403
Come on, Alan.
l've heard the story ten times already.

403
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,322
Don't deny it. They say
you're a real terror.

404
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:12,283
Yeah, that's me, a real terror.

405
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,538
l did some graffiti, flooded
the faculty bathroom. Stuff like that.

406
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,582
My shrink told my parents
l was ''acting out.''

407
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,836
l heard you called a bomb scare
on Parents' Day.

408
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,963
That's when l got caught.

409
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,381
Bummer.

410
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,675
l got put on probation for a while.

411
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,053
But that was a long time ago.
l'm a totally different person now.

412
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:33,847
Sure.

413
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,348
No, really.

414
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,100
Hey, Alan, how's it going?

415
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:39,978
Dad.

416
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,648
l was on my way home from the airport.
l thought l'd stop to say hello.

417
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,776
-And check up on me?
-And check up on you.

418
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,071
Of course. That's my job.
Me Dad, you son, right?

419
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,366
-This is Christy.
-Hi.

420
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,577
-From next door.
-Hello.

421
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:59,205
-Alan, what happened here?
-Nothing.

422
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,916
Nothing happened.

423
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,544
Really?

424
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,257
Then, how do you explain this?

425
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,926
l was dusting it and it fell over.

426
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,804
Dusting with what, a croquet mallet?

427
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,682
l should go.

428
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,976
l almost forgot my stuff.

429
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,607
Bye, Alan.

430
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,904
You go home, too. l'll close up.

431
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,991
-l can do it.
-Obviously you can't. Go home.

432
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,423
l'm really sorry about that.

433
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:54,427
l have parents, too.
lf that's all he sees, you got off lucky.

434
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,055
-Here are your toys.
-Thanks.

435
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,602
What happened? l thought
you were coming by practice today.

436
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:05,021
Sorry. Something else came up.

437
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:08,942
l know you. You're the kid
who set his old school on fire, right?

438
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,236
Yeah, just to watch it burn.

439
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,862
Whatever.

440
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:17,117
We got a scrimmage with the JV.
Come on, you can cheer me on.

441
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,952
Great.

442
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,960
See you later.

443
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,382
Let's see....

444
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,803
What do l need?

445
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,847
Coping saw.

446
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,440
l don't believe it!

447
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:00,076
-Alan, we must--
-Shut up!

448
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:03,079
-The Gorgonites--
-You're nothing but trouble.

449
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:18,094
Link Static to command post.

450
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:22,223
Have targeted single Gorgonite
with civilian escort.

451
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,976
Approaching your position. Over.

452
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,271
Roger, Private Static. Copy that.

453
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,316
Brick Bazooka, front and center.

454
00:36:31,983 --> 00:36:33,943
Prepare for assault, Sergeant.

455
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,699
Don't fire till you see
the whites of his eyes.

456
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,660
Prepare to fire the bazooka.

457
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:46,664
Fire!

458
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,890
Gorgonite K9 corps.

459
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:11,523
Watch it. l'll have your dog tags.

460
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,444
What are you doing here?

461
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,906
Go home.

462
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:28,915
Coming up.

463
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,918
Hand over hand.

464
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,840
l'm coming for you, Gorgonite.

465
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,617
Damn potholes.

466
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,121
Command post to Brick Bazooka. Report.

467
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,168
Repeat, this is command post. Report.

468
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,838
Brick Bazooka reporting.

469
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:21,968
Target escaped
en route to enemy stronghold.

470
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,596
l'm pretty messed up, sir.

471
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,016
Hold on, son. We"re on our way.

472
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,144
Wrong gauge.

473
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,396
lnsert tab A into slot B.

474
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:35,482
Turn until click.

475
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:38,151
Bite the bullet, pal. lt'll be okay.

476
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,652
Here's the tape.

477
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,574
Go ahead, kid. Let it out.

478
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,793
lt's a small world after all.

479
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,175
Hello, Heartland Play Systems.
How may l help you?

480
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,887
Yes, l'm having some trouble
with one of your--

481
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,890
What is the name of the toy
and the nature of the problem?

482
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,434
The toys are the Gorgonites.

483
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,728
There are no more Gorgonites.

484
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,772
And the Commando Elite.

485
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:18,400
They are the mortal enemies
of the Gorgonites.

486
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,901
And whatis the problem?

487
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:23,405
The Commandos wrecked my dad's store
and destroyed the Gorgonites!

488
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:26,408
The Commando Elite are designed
to fight the Gorgonites.

489
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:29,119
No, they destroyed them
and now they're gone!

490
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,747
I"m sorry, but Heartland Play Systems
does not replace lost toys.

491
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,542
l didn't lose them!
ls there a machine l can talk to?

492
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,335
Just transfer me to a machine!

493
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,130
Have a nice day, ma'am.

494
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:41,631
l'm not a ma'am!

495
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:46,886
Please state the name ofyour toy
and nature ofyourproblem.

496
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,681
Your damn Commando Elite
wrecked my dad's store...

497
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:53,685
...destroyed the super Gorgonites
and ran off! Got it? Lawsuit! Got that?

498
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,983
Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0125.

499
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,153
Destroy Gorgonites.

500
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,320
Shut up!

501
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:12,120
Alan.

502
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,621
Don't talk to me!

503
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,667
Not a word!

504
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,262
On Monday morning, at 0900 hours...

505
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:34,559
...250,000 Commandos and 250,000
Gorgonites will fightside by side...

506
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:37,979
...with children everywhere,
trying to separate mommy and daddy...

507
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,273
...from the money in their wallets.

508
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:44,235
Larry.

509
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:48,490
Now, listen to this.

510
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:52,702
They cover 100 merchandise licensees
for the next two months.

511
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,455
You won"t be able to turn on a TV,
board a bus...

512
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,083
...open a lunch box,
orput on your own underwear...

513
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,711
...withoutseeing the Gorgonites
raging war with the Commando Elite!

514
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:05,715
What do you think of that, Mr. Mars?

515
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:08,635
lt's a start.

516
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,596
Larry.

517
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:14,599
Larry, folks.

518
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,941
We have to talk.

519
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,235
We have a big problem. lt's urgent.

520
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,529
What are you doing here? Stop it.

521
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:33,910
Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0--

522
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:36,746
That's where voice mail cut him off.

523
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,790
-lt's not a problem.
-lt's not?

524
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:43,169
These things go on sale Monday.
How did this kid get hold of them?

525
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:47,298
lt's industrial espionage.
l got two words for you: Counter suit.

526
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,051
One word: Countersuit. Two words.

527
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,303
lt's two words, Larry!

528
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:54,889
What if this kid's telling the truth?

529
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,268
We can't have toys out on the market
that may be dangerous.

530
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:01,396
How can they be dangerous?
Everything on them is standard.

531
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,399
The design is standard,
the materials are standard...

532
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,776
...the mechanicals are standard.
Even the....

533
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,111
Oh.

534
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:09,821
What's, ''Oh''?

535
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:10,739
What?

536
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:13,241
-You just said, ''Oh.''
-No, l said, ''Oh.''

537
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:16,077
''Oh'' like, ''That's interesting''
or like, ''We're screwed''?

538
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,371
No. l mean, hey, whoa, oh.

539
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:22,625
Forget the ''Oh''. l'll go to legal
to start on the countersuit.

540
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,336
The chips!

541
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,588
That's the ''Oh.''

542
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,257
These microprocessing chips.

543
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:32,177
What do they do
and where did you get them from?

544
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,639
They microprocess. And they come from
the land of l Saved Your Job.

545
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:45,940
They were designed
for the Defense Department.

546
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:49,527
You put munitions chips in toys?

547
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,704
Archer...

548
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,959
...emissary of the Gorgonites.

549
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,213
Where are you?

550
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,718
Beware. There will be no mercy.

551
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:19,391
We"re lost. We need to find our homeland.

552
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,975
Yeah, our homeland.

553
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,773
We"re in trouble. Please find us.

554
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:29,651
You"ve got to help us find Goron.

555
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:30,652
Goron?

556
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,570
It"s ""Gorgon"", moron.

557
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:41,246
I hope he comes. We"re no match
for the awesome Commandos.

558
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:43,540
Yeah, everything else isjust a toy.

559
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,585
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

560
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:55,719
Grab him! Hold him down!

561
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:57,721
Get that leg!

562
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,350
String him up!

563
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,061
Tell us what we want to know.

564
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:11,276
I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.

565
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:12,569
Archer?

566
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:16,948
Where are the rest of the Gorgonite scum?

567
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:19,951
We have ways of making you talk.

568
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,082
Make it easy on yourself.
Ifyou tell us, we"ll letyou go.

569
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,543
It will go easier foryou ifyou cooperate.

570
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,921
I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.

571
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:35,008
All right. Let"s dispose of this garbage.

572
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,013
lt's the kid.

573
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:43,433
Commandos, pull back!
Retrograde movement!

574
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:02,869
-Give me that!
-That's mine, punk!

575
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,207
Surrender, Gorgonite ally.

576
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,543
You just met your match.

577
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,045
Oh, yeah?

578
00:45:12,128 --> 00:45:15,048
Surrender or die!

579
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,510
Medic! Medic!

580
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:24,015
Medic!

581
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,644
Come on out!

582
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:31,189
Alan, what the hell is going on here?

583
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:33,692
Medic!

584
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,860
Alan, your hand! What happened?

585
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,531
How did you cut your hand?
And what are you doing down here?

586
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,201
Mom, Dad, it's okay.

587
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,915
While you were gone,
l bought some soldier toys from Joe.

588
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,376
l figured l could sell them
before you got back.

589
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:54,379
And for once, l would have made
the store a little money.

590
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:57,298
l know it was the wrong thing to do.
l'm sorry.

591
00:45:58,299 --> 00:45:59,926
There, l said it.

592
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:04,472
Okay.

593
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:09,477
l think it's very honest of you
to tell the truth.

594
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:14,441
So, you pawned my woodworking tools
so you could pay Joe?

595
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:17,485
No! l'm pretty sure the toys took them.

596
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:18,737
What?

597
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:20,363
The toys.

598
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,200
Are you trying to upset me?

599
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,454
l mean, are you deliberately making--

600
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:30,749
-What was the word? Projected--
-Aggression.

601
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:33,043
-Projected aggression--
-lt's not aggression!

602
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:36,671
lt's these toys!
lt's like they're alive. Look.

603
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,967
Come on, Archer. Back me up here.

604
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:44,346
Say something.

605
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:47,557
Halt! Who goes there? Talk to me!

606
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:49,809
Alan, please.

607
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:53,938
l need to ask you this. Are you on crank?

608
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:54,981
No!

609
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,902
Then is it crystal meth, tar, smack?
We need to know!

610
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:01,905
No, l'm not on drugs! lt's these soldiers!

611
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,074
All right, that's it! Stop it.

612
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:06,368
l mean, Alan...

613
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:08,078
...l am...

614
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,914
...at a loss.

615
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:17,962
You! Why didn't you say anything?

616
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:21,716
Shut up! Don"t talk to me! Not a word!

617
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,552
Wise guy. l should shred the bunch of you.

618
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:28,598
My dad thinks l'm insane.
Christy thinks l'm an idiot...

619
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:32,519
...and when Joe finds out
l can't pay him back, he'll break my legs.

620
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,355
The Gorgonites are not destroyed.

621
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:37,023
What?

622
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:42,612
Major Hazard seeks the location of the
Gorgonite scum. They are not destroyed.

623
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:47,158
'Cause if the Commandos destroyed them
they wouldn't be looking for them.

624
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,371
All right, where are they?

625
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,333
My Gorgonite brothers are doing
what the Gorgonites do best:

626
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,210
They are hiding.

627
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:07,804
Commando Elite, fall in!

628
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:09,889
Sir! Yes, sir!

629
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:14,853
We have met the enemy.
He is big. He is fast.

630
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:17,856
He has allied himself
with the Gorgonite scum.

631
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:22,360
The rules of engagement have changed.
Private Static!

632
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:24,863
Damn!

633
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,994
This place is a gold mine.

634
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:34,372
Holy smokes. Look at all this hardware.

635
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:37,751
Technological superiority.

636
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,794
Dibs on the chain saw.

637
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,054
Falling in, sir.

638
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:54,976
Out of the way.

639
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:02,984
lt's only a flesh wound, sir.

640
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:06,196
Rest easy. You've done your job.

641
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:09,282
Did we win?

642
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,160
We will.

643
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,914
Nick Nitro's battery has run out.

644
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:20,168
But his memory will keep going
and going and going.

645
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:23,171
His death will be avenged.

646
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:31,096
Commandos, secure the perimeter!
Tap all communications!

647
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:34,349
Roll some armor! We got us a war to win.

648
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:37,477
lf it launches, lacerates or detonates...

649
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,146
...l want it mobile and l want it lethal!

650
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,731
Sir! Yes, sir!

651
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:50,907
They're not in the storeroom,
they're not here.

652
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:53,493
Monsters shouldn't be hiding
but fighting Commandos.

653
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:54,953
We would lose.

654
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,664
lt is what we were programmed to do.

655
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,292
Hide and lose?
Those are some great options.

656
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:06,172
lf l was a Gorgonite, where would l be?

657
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:11,428
l'm hiding because l'm a loser.
l've got zero self-esteem...

658
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:13,847
...and my brain's the size of a peanut.

659
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,558
Where would l be?

660
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,451
This is so gross.

661
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:36,703
Hello. ls anybody in there?

662
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,877
Ocula.

663
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:47,589
-What was that?
-lt's the Gorgonites.

664
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,092
Ocula.

665
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,013
Punch-it. Scratch-it.

666
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,391
Great to be back.
But seriously, what a dump.

667
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,934
lnsaniac.

668
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:02,312
Are you a kid or oil painting?

669
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:07,275
Don't worry, Archer. We was hiding.

670
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,110
Slamfist.

671
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,197
Troglokhan?

672
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:15,617
We fixed him.

673
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,994
We tried to fix him.

674
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,538
My dad's radio.

675
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,667
Some assembly required.

676
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:29,339
So am I nuts? What"s going on here?
Give me a call, 1-800, talk to me.

677
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:30,632
Freaky.

678
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,301
Like Frankenstein.

679
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:38,973
At least you're all here.
Maybe Joe won't break my legs after all.

680
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:41,267
Access approved.

681
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,186
Let me get this straight.

682
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:47,732
You used my password to order surplus
military chips that might be dangerous?

683
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,696
lt's okay.

684
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:55,990
That's supposed to happen.
See? Clean room.

685
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:59,160
Clean. Let's just go in.

686
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,329
You okay?

687
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,749
That's him. That's Ralph.

688
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,170
Who are you? You don't belong here.

689
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:12,590
l'm Larry Benson. You supplied
my division with some microchips.

690
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:15,385
Yes. Larry Benson.

691
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:21,141
The X1000. Worked out better
than you dreamed, didn't they?

692
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:24,269
Actually, there was a little problem.

693
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:27,439
Then it's with your software.

694
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:31,443
l don't think there's a problem
with the software, Ralph.

695
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,028
You don't?

696
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:37,282
The X1000 is a masterpiece.

697
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:40,660
lmagine a microchip...

698
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:44,956
...sophisticated enough to control
the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.

699
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,169
lmagine it can be used to instantly upgrade
any system it's plugged into.

700
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:54,507
Like a smart drug for machines.
Then, imagine it can learn.

701
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:58,219
What are you talking about?
Artificial intelligence?

702
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:00,347
No. Actual intelligence.

703
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:04,017
No wonder those philistines
at the Pentagon didn't appreciate it.

704
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:06,603
One flaw and they scrap the whole project.

705
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:09,814
So there is a flaw in the chips.

706
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:14,444
They're a little bit sensitive to EMP.

707
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,739
EMP? Electromagnetic pulse?

708
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:21,659
The kind generated
by the detonation of a nuclear device.

709
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:25,080
l doubt even the toy industry has become
quite that competitive.

710
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:29,793
They said, ''Adequate shielding
wasn't cost effective.''

711
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,380
Did the Medici ever tell Michelangelo:

712
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:37,967
''Sorry, Mike, marble's not cost-effective.
Here's a bag of cement''? l think not!

713
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:40,804
Gesundheit.

714
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:42,430
Thank you.

715
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:45,767
There shouldn't be any problem,
just because the chips can learn.

716
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:50,814
Am l not being clear? They learn within
the boundaries of their programming.

717
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:54,526
Whatever the core programming,
the X1000 enhances it.

718
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:58,738
So, if you have a problem,
it's in your software.

719
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,830
Quick impression, Jimmy Cagney.
''Top of the world, Ma.''

720
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,377
Talk about hampering your career.

721
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,295
Grab him!

722
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:17,632
lt looks so real, don't it?

723
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,301
Hit him.

724
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:23,972
Friend of yours?

725
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:33,023
What am l going to do with you guys?

726
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:37,110
Two hundred and twenty-one.
Two hundred and twenty-two.

727
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,946
There goes the record.

728
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:48,079
Not so close. You'll ruin your eye.

729
00:54:57,088 --> 00:54:58,173
What are you looking at?

730
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,342
l dunno.

731
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:06,973
-Hello?
-Alan?

732
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:08,058
Christy?

733
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,685
Are you grounded?

734
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,896
No, my dad cooled off.

735
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,314
So, we did it.

736
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:18,693
Yeah, and the best part is,
l found all those lost toys.

737
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,695
You were really a big help.

738
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,614
Cool.

739
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:26,284
So, Alan, boxers or briefs?

740
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:28,078
Get those off your head.

741
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,996
Hey, what"s going on?

742
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,207
Nothing.

743
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,795
Listen, l was thinking maybe
we should celebrate sometime.

744
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:39,005
Go to a movie or something.

745
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:43,760
Alan, l only date older guys.
lt's nothing personal.

746
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:50,058
What I mean is,
officially I"m going out with Brad.

747
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:53,812
What about unofficially? Or superficially?

748
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:59,442
There is one guy. But he"s kind of
a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.

749
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:04,197
I"m sure he"d be willing
to give it all up foryou.

750
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,366
I know I would.

751
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:08,410
Alan.

752
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,670
lt's party time!

753
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:28,638
One phat ride!

754
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:37,397
Transmission intercepted. The Gorgonites
are bivouacked at the enemy stronghold.

755
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:40,608
And the enemy has revealed
an age-old weakness.

756
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:44,487
I"m sure he"d be willing to give it all up
foryou. I know I would.

757
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:46,823
Put yourself in for a commendation.

758
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:50,535
Soldiers! We have
a window of opportunity.

759
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,247
We will exploit it, drown the enemy out
and crush the Gorgonites!

760
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:59,419
We must go behind enemy lines
to secure a hostage. Prepare to move out.

761
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:01,921
Hop it, jarheads!

762
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,137
l guess you guys are safe
as long as you stay here.

763
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:13,892
What are you looking for?

764
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:15,143
Gorgon.

765
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:18,313
This is a national park.

766
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:21,399
The lsle of Gorgon is our homeland.

767
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,777
Will you help us find it?

768
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,529
l don't think you will find it in there.

769
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:27,739
Alan...

770
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:31,826
...if Gorgon is not in that window,
is it in this one?

771
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,664
There's nothing in windows.

772
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:40,085
There's stuff outside them.

773
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:41,836
What stuff?

774
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,546
You know, outside.

775
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:45,965
Trees, power poles...

776
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:49,052
...Christy's house.

777
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:50,970
And beyond that?

778
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,723
The mall.

779
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:55,809
And beyond that?

780
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:57,352
The highway.

781
00:57:57,977 --> 00:57:59,312
And beyond that?

782
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:02,315
About a million acres of farm.

783
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:04,984
And what's beyond that?

784
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:08,530
l don't know.

785
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:13,034
Gorgon.

786
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:19,416
Live, via satellite, 257 channels.

787
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,835
Closed captioning
for the hearing impaired...

788
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:26,381
...and Dolby stereo where available,
which is right here, right now!

789
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:31,386
What a great picture. lt's perfect.

790
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,389
l don't know. lt looks kind of fuzzy.

791
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,435
Let me try something else.

792
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,814
Oh, for pete's sake! Phil!

793
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:48,528
Maybe if l tweak the brightness a little.

794
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:52,574
No, it's the chroma.
The flesh tone's way off.

795
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:55,910
Now it's green.

796
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,370
Stand down, men.

797
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:00,206
We must neutralize these civilians.

798
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,000
l paid a lot. l don't want any ghosts.

799
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,056
Follow me.

800
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:21,853
lt's a trap, sir.

801
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,397
Bring it here, soldier.

802
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,109
Chemical warfare.

803
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,237
Operation Sandman.

804
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:39,162
Fire when ready, Private.

805
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,961
Audie Murphy.
Our most decorated war hero.

806
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,719
l think World War ll was my favorite war.

807
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:03,061
No sign of the target, sir. Area is secured.

808
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:05,063
Don't worry. She'll be here.

809
01:00:15,198 --> 01:00:16,991
This is where we'll engage the target.

810
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,994
Set up concealed positions
and prepare for ambush.

811
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:21,663
Oh, man.

812
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,666
l can't believe they got me the whole set.

813
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,960
Hold your fire, men.

814
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:30,630
Cool, you can talk.
You must be the leader.

815
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,884
Except one day, you get shot.

816
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:41,558
And this guy gets promoted...

817
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:44,561
...and now he's the leader. Yes!

818
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:46,396
lt wasn't my idea, Major.

819
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,189
Commandos, attack!

820
01:00:48,606 --> 01:00:50,233
Pile on the kid!

821
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,079
Son, you can be a prisoner or a casualty.
lt's up to you.

822
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,831
Sir, over here.

823
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:06,833
Oh, man, l hate babysitting.

824
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:10,086
-What is it, soldier?
-Take a look, sir.

825
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,841
Bombshells, sir.

826
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:19,471
Fully posable.

827
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:24,476
Hello, dolly!

828
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,314
Sweet stuff!

829
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:31,107
Hubba-hubba.

830
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:33,902
R and R, sir?

831
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,154
Request a 3-day pass, sir.

832
01:01:36,279 --> 01:01:41,242
Denied. Gentlemen, this is the new army.
Those are reinforcements.

833
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:45,121
Bring me the head of Nick Nitro. Move.

834
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,049
Soldier, your memory will live on.

835
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:00,720
Damn!

836
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:02,180
Criminy!

837
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,224
l think l'm gonna hurl.

838
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:09,396
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

839
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,664
lt's alive! lt's alive!

840
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:17,213
Hi, there. Cannon Fodder Gwendy,
reporting for duty, sir.

841
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:19,841
Carry on, soldier.

842
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,765
l feel your pain.

843
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,038
Alan...

844
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:53,291
...the Commando Elite are in the trees.

845
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:56,503
They're not moving
because of the Commandos.

846
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:58,088
lt's the wind.

847
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,006
See?

848
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,133
l see your hand.

849
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:05,470
The wind is blowing. You can feel it.

850
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,305
Feel?

851
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,309
Right. Plastic. Sorry.

852
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:15,313
lt's kind of hard to describe.

853
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,358
Weather patterns, wind chill factor.

854
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:22,821
Just because you can't see it,
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

855
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,240
See?

856
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,453
Wind.

857
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,876
Mom? Dad? l'm home.

858
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:40,630
They're asleep.

859
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,217
-You know what that means?
-They could wake up any second.

860
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,470
You know, you are such a major hottie.

861
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:51,016
And you are such a major sweet talker.

862
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:52,726
Good night.

863
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:14,497
My bike won't start. l got nowhere to go.
Can l come in?

864
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,000
No, that's not it.

865
01:05:46,446 --> 01:05:49,115
Don't hate me because l'm beautiful.

866
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:57,999
Let's do something fun.

867
01:05:58,291 --> 01:05:59,918
We'll all get facials.

868
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:02,420
Did l overpluck my eyebrows?

869
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:32,951
Now it's our turn to play with you.

870
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:37,122
Let's see if her head comes off.

871
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,087
Christy?

872
01:06:54,514 --> 01:06:56,975
Look. A man. Alley-oop.

873
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:00,478
Such nice broad shoulders.
Do you work out?

874
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:02,939
What's your sign, big boy?

875
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:05,817
Makeovers are such a blast.

876
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,863
That haircut is so five minutes ago.

877
01:07:09,946 --> 01:07:11,573
Are you dumping me?

878
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:14,617
Get off!

879
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:17,620
You! Maggot!

880
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:21,041
An officer and a gentleman
does not strike a lady.

881
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:45,148
Are you scared?

882
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,359
We're all scared.

883
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,946
You'd have to be crazy not to be scared.

884
01:07:58,411 --> 01:07:59,579
What?

885
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,083
What do you see?

886
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:08,463
Ocula? Are you all right?

887
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:11,508
Settle down. You'll be okay.

888
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,435
''Surrender?''

889
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:25,689
Smile, girlie.

890
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:28,650
""Alan, I"m safe. I have not been harmed.""

891
01:08:29,442 --> 01:08:30,276
Christy?

892
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:34,239
""I am making this statement of my
own free will and under no duress.""

893
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:37,367
-Yeah, right.
-Stick to the script. Read it as we wrote it.

894
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:39,536
Make itsnappy.

895
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:42,288
""I will be released safely and unharmed...

896
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:45,125
""...only if the following conditions are met:

897
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:48,211
""One: Surrender the Gorgonite scum.""

898
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:50,880
That"s it.

899
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:52,465
Faster, or we stick you.

900
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:54,342
Alan, you have to help.

901
01:08:54,634 --> 01:08:56,594
Zoom in. Get those tears.

902
01:08:57,137 --> 01:08:58,471
What else is on?

903
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:08,481
lf Major Chip Hazard wants a war,
we'll give him a war.

904
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:11,735
Please, Alan, don"t do this.

905
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,987
-We"re afraid.
-We"re your friends.

906
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,448
-Have mercy.
-You are a traitor.

907
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:18,908
Hi. Welcome to the big cardboard box.

908
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,787
We"ll neversee Gorgon again.

909
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:25,957
-Alan seemed so nice.
-Why would he do this to us?

910
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:28,293
Three words, folks. Pu-ber-ty.

911
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:37,594
Enemy contact.
Advance with caution. Roll!

912
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:39,512
Sorry, sir.

913
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:43,683
How could you betray us? We"re free.

914
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:48,104
-Have mercy.
-The Commandos will kill us.

915
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:52,609
Gentlemen, it looks like they blinked.
Advance and envelop.

916
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,110
Sir! Yes, sir!

917
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,489
Alan, I"m feeling very insecure.

918
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,408
I"m allergic to cardboard. Pass it on.

919
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:11,920
Are you ready, Archer?

920
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:16,174
Alan, are you sure this is a good idea?

921
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:32,482
You traitor.

922
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:35,610
-We must be free.
-I don"t feel well.

923
01:10:35,735 --> 01:10:38,571
Alan, don"t do it. You"ll be guilt-ridden.

924
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,475
My aunt was buried alive.
I"m very claustrophobic.

925
01:11:07,642 --> 01:11:09,144
Rock and roll!

926
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,896
l love this job!

927
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,321
Are you all right?

928
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:27,746
All my make-up is cruelty-free.

929
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:31,458
You come here often?

930
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:34,294
Will you take me to the prom?

931
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:40,467
lf you can't accessorize, pulverize.

932
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:50,310
You've been a bad boy.

933
01:11:50,643 --> 01:11:53,646
Now you must be punished.

934
01:11:56,858 --> 01:11:58,818
Watch out, girls. Hissy fit.

935
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:02,655
You're to die for.

936
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,742
Run! She's got a baton!

937
01:12:06,993 --> 01:12:09,120
lt's a baton death march.

938
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,123
She's gone postal!

939
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,215
Oh, l broke a nail.

940
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,425
l've always hated these things!

941
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:24,135
The humanity!

942
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,138
This is it, men.

943
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:46,324
Commandos, the enemy has deployed
a decoy target.

944
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,952
Return to primary positions.

945
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:51,579
This is fun!

946
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:57,627
You're killing me!

947
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,467
You rescued me.

948
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:08,263
Anytime.

949
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:12,559
Let's go get those creeps.

950
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,939
We have to wake my parents.

951
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,150
Open fire!

952
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:29,492
We have the enemy on the run.
Exploit and pursue.

953
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:40,545
-You've done this before.
-Once or twice.

954
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:50,847
Watch it.

955
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:52,849
You watch it.

956
01:13:57,687 --> 01:13:59,147
We got to get help.

957
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:08,823
Anyone got a garage door opener?

958
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:23,421
Commandos, attack!

959
01:14:38,895 --> 01:14:40,480
Time to plant the corn.

960
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:47,362
Expect no mercy, Gorgonite ally!

961
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:55,245
l'll get the bike.

962
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:13,722
Get on! Hurry!

963
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:28,611
Hot pursuit!

964
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,146
lnterlock!

965
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,859
Right side, lock! Left side, lock!

966
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:12,364
Ramming speed!

967
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:29,964
Hold on!

968
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,740
They're toast.

969
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,207
You think l could drive home?

970
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:05,834
Good idea.

971
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:25,729
-Your kid kidnapped my daughter...
-Uh, oh.

972
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:29,983
...tied up my son and drugged me
and my wife. Marion is still tripping!

973
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,901
Time to hide again.

974
01:17:32,318 --> 01:17:34,612
Not to mention the damage to my house.

975
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:03,099
We have lost the battle.

976
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,977
We will not lose the war.

977
01:18:06,644 --> 01:18:07,812
That's the last of them.

978
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:16,738
l think that's all of Friday's delivery.
Why did they want it back?

979
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,032
You know the clowns
that make these decisions.

980
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:23,078
They don't care we're standing around
freezing, in the middle of the night...

981
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:25,372
...as long as everyone knows
who's in charge.

982
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:36,424
Corporations.

983
01:18:37,342 --> 01:18:40,428
Right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is screwing up.

984
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:44,599
Greetings. You've been drafted.

985
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:46,059
Move!

986
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:48,770
ls this entire household insane?

987
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,691
He says that toy is alive
just because it moves a little.

988
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:56,569
What's next? The Blue Fairy
drops by with a talking cricket?

989
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,446
He's telling the truth!

990
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,533
He's brainwashed you, hasn't he?

991
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:06,913
Don't worry, honey. We'll get you
the best deprogrammer money can buy.

992
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:09,958
You can't change programming.

993
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,211
Look. Another one.

994
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:17,465
l told you they were hiding.
lt's what they do.

995
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,885
That's it. Come on, Christy.

996
01:19:21,052 --> 01:19:23,096
Timmy, Marion, we're out of here.

997
01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:26,266
Don't be a stranger, Phil.

998
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:34,274
Yes, we're with Heartland Play Systems,
Consumer Satisfaction.

999
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,818
ls Alan Abernathy here?

1000
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:38,695
That's Alan, right there.

1001
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,782
How you doing? We understand
you acquired some of our fine products.

1002
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:45,994
There's a chance they might be...

1003
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:48,246
...defective.

1004
01:19:48,329 --> 01:19:50,957
But there's no reason to think
they could do any harm.

1005
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:54,544
-There's reasons.
-There is a problem with the Commandos.

1006
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:59,507
What problem? Bear in mind, you will be
called into court to support your claim.

1007
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:03,553
-Your toys nearly killed my son!
-Stuart--

1008
01:20:03,678 --> 01:20:06,514
Don't say calm down!
Calm was killing me.

1009
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,976
And you! You owe my son an apology!

1010
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:14,272
Hey, Larry. Look. lt's Archer.

1011
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,524
Greetings.

1012
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:19,944
l am Archer. Who are you?

1013
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:23,031
l'm lrwin. l designed you...

1014
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,783
...and all the Gorgonites.

1015
01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:26,284
He's the creator.

1016
01:20:31,122 --> 01:20:32,749
You're all here.

1017
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:34,959
Everyone has to be somewhere.

1018
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,504
That's true. My mom used to....

1019
01:20:39,297 --> 01:20:42,967
Making declarative statements?
Formulating inquiries?

1020
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:48,098
Lights out.

1021
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:53,269
Something's going on out there.

1022
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:01,403
That's weird.
There's a Heartland truck outside.

1023
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:16,876
-More Commandos?
-A lot more.

1024
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:21,214
Dad, come see this for yourself.

1025
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:23,008
Chip?

1026
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:26,344
Dead Chip? The Chip we killed?

1027
01:21:26,636 --> 01:21:28,847
Maybe we didn't kill him enough.

1028
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:31,558
Oh, my.

1029
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,730
Commandos, fall out!

1030
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:41,109
Secure the leftperimeter!
Secure the rightperimeter! Move out!

1031
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:42,944
Sir, yes, sir!

1032
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,155
Assault formation. Go!

1033
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,870
If waris hell, let"s give them hell.

1034
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:55,623
We didn"tstart this war,
but we"re damn sure going to end it.

1035
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:58,710
l'm scared.

1036
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,964
lt'll be all right. They're not after you.

1037
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:06,092
They just want to kill
the little monster people.

1038
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:10,013
That's right. We're just caught up
in some stupid game.

1039
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:12,807
Well, game over.

1040
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:15,352
Mr. Fimple, wait.

1041
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:16,686
No, Alan.

1042
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,646
Let him go.

1043
01:22:23,651 --> 01:22:24,986
Archer.

1044
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:27,989
The Gorgonites must lose.

1045
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:33,620
Hi!

1046
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:36,081
l'm Phil Fimple.

1047
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:40,794
l'm here to negotiate the surrender of the...

1048
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:42,504
...Gorgonzolas.

1049
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:45,173
Here's our proposal: Take them!

1050
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,093
He's selling us out.
He's an Arnold Benedict.

1051
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:52,347
Take them apart, steal their batteries,
whatever it is you...

1052
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,265
...people do.

1053
01:22:59,604 --> 01:23:01,731
ls that my JVC?

1054
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,402
There will be no surrender!

1055
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:09,447
There will be no mercy!
All Gorgonite scum must die!

1056
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,867
Bomb them all the way back to preschool.

1057
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:15,787
Recon estimates
Gorgonite scum strength at 16!

1058
01:23:16,454 --> 01:23:19,290
Sixteen? Where did they get sixteen from?

1059
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:22,460
Seven Gorgonites and nine people.

1060
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:26,464
Well, you heard our proposal.

1061
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:28,383
Phil, get in here! Hurry!

1062
01:23:28,883 --> 01:23:31,553
These negotiations are over!

1063
01:23:37,225 --> 01:23:39,894
We are the Commando Elite.
Everything else...

1064
01:23:40,228 --> 01:23:41,813
...isjust a toy.

1065
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:52,866
-What are they doing?
-Psychological warfare.

1066
01:23:53,324 --> 01:23:55,869
The Marines did this against Noriega.

1067
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:58,830
Phil.

1068
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,293
l love this song!

1069
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:09,382
Fimple, turn that off!

1070
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:15,138
Go, go!

1071
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:21,561
Lock and load.

1072
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:24,147
Nail them!

1073
01:24:24,647 --> 01:24:26,358
Open fire!

1074
01:24:27,192 --> 01:24:28,276
Get down!

1075
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,246
Fimple.

1076
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,210
Honey?

1077
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,090
Stuart, Phil, barricade that window!
Alan, get back.

1078
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,677
Get back!

1079
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,142
Fire!

1080
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:06,147
Wow.

1081
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:07,607
Fire!

1082
01:25:07,857 --> 01:25:09,484
How are they--

1083
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:14,406
Alan, put out the fires.
Nerds, side windows.

1084
01:25:22,038 --> 01:25:23,665
Marion, Timmy...

1085
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:27,585
...the closet. Come on, come on. Hurry!

1086
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:33,091
Just get in. Get down.

1087
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:36,720
l have that coat.

1088
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:37,846
Yes.

1089
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:40,932
Frag 'em all!

1090
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:45,979
l'll call the police!

1091
01:25:46,062 --> 01:25:48,732
Phil, Christy, push this back. Careful.

1092
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:52,110
Fire!

1093
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:56,489
Service.

1094
01:25:58,366 --> 01:26:00,076
Great balls of fire!

1095
01:26:01,786 --> 01:26:04,456
The phone's dead. Nice forehand, honey.

1096
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:07,042
lncoming!

1097
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:08,752
l'm hit!

1098
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,921
More shells!

1099
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:13,590
Take the house!

1100
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:16,926
We have to stop them
before my wife gets tennis elbow.

1101
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:20,722
An electromagnetic pulse would work.
That would fry the chips.

1102
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:27,145
All we need now is a nuclear warhead.

1103
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:29,773
l doubt l'll have one in the junk drawer.

1104
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:31,691
Nuclear warhead?

1105
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:36,071
The chips aren't shielded against an EMP.
A nuclear blast would wipe them out.

1106
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:38,406
That's why the military never used them.

1107
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:41,534
What kind of moron would put
military technology in toys?

1108
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:43,411
That would be Gizmo over here.

1109
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:51,628
Actually, any electrical device generates
a magnetic field, just not a big one.

1110
01:26:52,087 --> 01:26:53,880
We'll need a big one.

1111
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:58,176
Fire in the hole!

1112
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,437
Alan, the window.

1113
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:15,110
''l don't know but l've been told
Gorgonite blood runs mighty cold.''

1114
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:17,320
No, Alan.

1115
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,784
Way to stay heads up.

1116
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:27,914
Continue artillery barrage!

1117
01:27:27,997 --> 01:27:29,624
Take cover! Stay low!

1118
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:33,461
There's a power pole back there
with two huge transformers.

1119
01:27:33,586 --> 01:27:36,548
Could we use those to create
the electromagnetic whatever?

1120
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:38,675
We could get them to explode.

1121
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,760
That would fry their chips, for sure.

1122
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:44,389
You could connect the transformers.

1123
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:47,892
We just need to put something metal
between them.

1124
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:52,063
You get a nice power boost.
Right up until they overload and blow up.

1125
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:53,815
lt only happened once!

1126
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:00,238
That's it.

1127
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:08,747
This should work.

1128
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:17,255
Forget it. You're not going out there.

1129
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,507
-There's no time!
-lt's too dangerous.

1130
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:21,092
We've only got one chance!

1131
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:23,053
You are my responsibility and--

1132
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:26,431
Dad, there's no other way!

1133
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,567
You have to trust me.

1134
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:38,985
Wait.

1135
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:42,447
lt's dark in here.

1136
01:28:42,572 --> 01:28:44,074
lt's night, genius.

1137
01:28:44,157 --> 01:28:48,953
l mean, power has to be going through
the transformers for them to overload.

1138
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:55,168
The power's on at my house
and we've tons of crap to turn on.

1139
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:59,881
We have to wedge the breakers
open in your fuse box. Come on, Larry.

1140
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,716
l hate you, lrwin.

1141
01:29:05,929 --> 01:29:08,390
We have met the enemy and he is you!

1142
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:18,233
l love the smell of polyurethane
in the morning.

1143
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:25,198
Oh, my God. Phil, in here, in here.

1144
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:28,118
lt's locked.

1145
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,748
Up, up, up.

1146
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,127
Balcony's closed.

1147
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:38,837
Down, down, down.

1148
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:41,047
Descend and destroy.

1149
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:48,972
Let me in. Damn it! Fimple, you freak!
Let me in!

1150
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:54,185
All quiet on the Western front yard!

1151
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,857
Go and turn on every piece
of electronic equipment in your house.

1152
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,609
This one's for Nick Nitro!

1153
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,283
Mess around with my kid, huh?

1154
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,869
A broomstick. l'm scared.

1155
01:30:10,994 --> 01:30:12,162
Get him!

1156
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,621
First blood!

1157
01:30:14,831 --> 01:30:17,042
Stick this in your pipe and smoke it!

1158
01:30:23,256 --> 01:30:24,591
All right, Dad!

1159
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:27,844
We roasted them!

1160
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:30,972
There they are. Nail 'em!

1161
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:33,850
Not good.

1162
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:37,354
Hey, kid! Don't you like 9-inch nails?

1163
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:42,150
l got hit. l'm okay.

1164
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:48,031
Gorgonites, we must help Alan.

1165
01:30:48,698 --> 01:30:51,701
But if we fight, we will lose.

1166
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,746
Last time we fought,
l woke up with AMIFM.

1167
01:30:54,829 --> 01:30:56,790
War is nuts.
l know what l'm talking about.

1168
01:30:56,915 --> 01:30:59,376
We shouldn't fight. We should hide.

1169
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,837
lf we hide, we will still lose.

1170
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:05,465
No more hiding.

1171
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:08,259
Nail them to the wall!

1172
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,182
Gorgonites, fight!

1173
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:23,566
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

1174
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:32,450
Strike!

1175
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:34,327
Retreat!

1176
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:39,582
Meet my wife, the old ball and chain.

1177
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,543
l love working in the round.

1178
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:44,963
l'm knocking 'em dead.
You don't like stand-up? Then sit down!

1179
01:31:45,088 --> 01:31:47,716
Thank you and good night,
ladies and germs.

1180
01:31:51,845 --> 01:31:54,764
How do you work this? Wrong way.
That's better.

1181
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:56,016
Alan?

1182
01:32:00,895 --> 01:32:02,480
You should go now.

1183
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:04,858
Archer, listen.

1184
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:09,029
When that thing explodes,
you'll be fried, too.

1185
01:32:10,947 --> 01:32:12,282
Go.

1186
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:18,872
Take that!

1187
01:32:21,624 --> 01:32:23,001
Watch your back.

1188
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:24,586
Thanks, Dad.

1189
01:32:28,965 --> 01:32:31,092
l'm watching your back, Alan.

1190
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:46,316
What are you packing, Tiny?

1191
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:48,610
Packing? l'm packing you!

1192
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,328
lt's not a prank call. lt's not.

1193
01:32:58,411 --> 01:33:00,038
No, wait. lt is!

1194
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:04,751
So you'll send some cops
to come and arrest me? Don't hang up!

1195
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:09,714
Do you know what you're doing?

1196
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:11,966
Yeah.

1197
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:40,620
Die!

1198
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:47,961
Ain't war hell?

1199
01:33:56,594 --> 01:33:58,722
Thanks for the lift, Punch-it.

1200
01:34:05,603 --> 01:34:07,731
Mayday! Mayday! l'm hit!

1201
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:12,736
l'm going down! Ejecting!

1202
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:30,253
Expect no mercy.

1203
01:34:54,903 --> 01:34:56,488
Having fun yet?

1204
01:35:03,244 --> 01:35:06,664
Let's have a round and a round
of applause for Archer...

1205
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:09,751
...emissary of the Gorgonites. You're up!

1206
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,634
Major Chip Hazard.

1207
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,637
Gorgonite scum!

1208
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:23,848
Leave Alan alone. Your fight is with me.

1209
01:35:24,015 --> 01:35:25,975
You've got a lot of guts.

1210
01:35:26,351 --> 01:35:28,645
Let's see what they look like.

1211
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:33,942
They're wires and metal,
the same as yours.

1212
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:40,532
We're nothing alike.
You are programmed to lose.

1213
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:45,453
l'm also programmed to learn.

1214
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:50,041
Too bad you never learned to win.

1215
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:55,171
School's out, loser.

1216
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,472
Victory is ours!

1217
01:36:04,597 --> 01:36:06,474
Have l got a shock for you.

1218
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:09,519
You stupid toy!

1219
01:36:33,543 --> 01:36:35,503
Run for it! Watch out!

1220
01:36:50,393 --> 01:36:51,728
Get on!

1221
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:56,149
ls this going to be a pattern
for our relationship?

1222
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:57,984
Relationship?

1223
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:02,364
-This isn't dangerous, is it?
-Well--

1224
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:16,086
lt's dead!

1225
01:37:23,426 --> 01:37:24,678
Are you all right?

1226
01:37:36,272 --> 01:37:37,440
Medic!

1227
01:37:38,983 --> 01:37:41,277
There will be no mercy.

1228
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:57,961
Situation is stabilizing.
Local law enforcement is under control.

1229
01:37:58,044 --> 01:38:01,297
lt's just a matter of compensating
those involved.

1230
01:38:11,474 --> 01:38:14,144
The area is secure. Bring him in.

1231
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:20,442
Who is that?

1232
01:38:22,318 --> 01:38:25,155
Oh, no. lt's him.

1233
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:49,637
How you doing, Joe?

1234
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,390
-Would you do me a big favor?
-Anything, sir.

1235
01:38:52,515 --> 01:38:57,312
Move your truck with the giant GloboTech
logo before the news crews get here.

1236
01:38:58,521 --> 01:39:01,524
l don't know, Mr. Mars,
l may have trouble handling the gears.

1237
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:05,779
What with the critical head injury
and emotional distress l've suffered lately.

1238
01:39:07,864 --> 01:39:09,741
-Thank you.
-Right away, sir!

1239
01:39:09,949 --> 01:39:12,327
Excuse me. You're not off the hook yet.

1240
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:15,789
There's the matter of the massive damage
to my home, my garage...

1241
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,541
...my audio-visual system--

1242
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:20,585
-This is good.
-Bye-bye.

1243
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:25,632
Excuse me, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.
What about our house?

1244
01:39:27,926 --> 01:39:30,053
What about the pain and the anguish--

1245
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:32,180
-Humiliation.
-The humiliation.

1246
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:35,225
l don't think even you
have enough money to pay for that.

1247
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:37,936
Okay, maybe you do.

1248
01:39:38,812 --> 01:39:40,939
Hey, Alan. Keep your nose clean, kid.

1249
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:43,525
l'll try. Listen...

1250
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:46,861
...l just wanted to say l'm sorry.

1251
01:39:48,655 --> 01:39:49,989
Forget it.

1252
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:53,576
Toys is hell.

1253
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:59,207
Mr. Mars, l just wanted
to assure you that...

1254
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:02,669
...l take full responsibility for this.

1255
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:05,005
Yeah, right. Give me that.

1256
01:40:05,714 --> 01:40:07,674
What were we charging for these?

1257
01:40:07,799 --> 01:40:09,509
$79.95.

1258
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:12,345
Add a few zeros
to the end of that number...

1259
01:40:12,637 --> 01:40:14,514
...and contact our military division.

1260
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:18,977
l know some South American rebels
who will find these toys very entertaining.

1261
01:40:20,395 --> 01:40:22,522
Dad, you know my birthday?

1262
01:40:23,898 --> 01:40:26,192
l just want clothes.

1263
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:28,028
Come on, Christy.

1264
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,118
Any sign of the Gorgonites?

1265
01:40:35,243 --> 01:40:37,203
No, none of them.

1266
01:40:38,496 --> 01:40:39,998
Come on, Christy.

1267
01:40:40,248 --> 01:40:41,583
l better go.

1268
01:40:51,593 --> 01:40:55,096
Too bad. This would have made
a hell of a commercial.

1269
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:29,464
Archer?

1270
01:41:44,104 --> 01:41:47,941
Archer, are you all right?
Halt! Who goes there?

1271
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:52,445
Greetings. l am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

1272
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:55,824
Greetings. l am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

1273
01:41:57,075 --> 01:41:59,786
Your chip got fried,
just like the Commandos'.

1274
01:42:01,955 --> 01:42:03,748
The Commandos are dead?

1275
01:42:07,293 --> 01:42:10,213
Gorgonites, we won.

1276
01:42:10,463 --> 01:42:12,090
We did?

1277
01:42:12,298 --> 01:42:14,968
Well, that's a pleasant surprise.

1278
01:42:16,052 --> 01:42:19,472
The satellite dish must have shielded
you guys. Pretty smart.

1279
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:21,141
Smart? We were lucky.

1280
01:42:21,224 --> 01:42:23,018
l'm glad you made it, Archer.

1281
01:42:23,143 --> 01:42:25,812
l'm glad you made it, Alan.

1282
01:42:28,314 --> 01:42:30,358
Gorgonites, we are free!

1283
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:33,028
Thank you, Alan, destroyer of Commandos.

1284
01:42:33,153 --> 01:42:34,320
We're free.

1285
01:42:34,487 --> 01:42:36,197
Free? What about the cover charge?

1286
01:42:38,074 --> 01:42:40,368
Let me get in first. l'm big.

1287
01:42:40,535 --> 01:42:44,122
l'll sit in the crow's nest.
Hey, there's a dead crow up here.

1288
01:42:44,831 --> 01:42:46,332
l'm kidding.

1289
01:42:49,836 --> 01:42:51,713
Are you sure you want to do this?

1290
01:42:51,796 --> 01:42:54,090
Yes, Alan. lt is time.

1291
01:42:54,841 --> 01:42:57,510
Archer, l understand why, but...

1292
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:01,848
...you may not find Gorgon.
lt may not even--

1293
01:43:02,515 --> 01:43:07,145
Even if you can't see something,
it doesn't mean it isn't there.

1294
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:17,238
Look, we're out to launch!

1295
01:43:18,823 --> 01:43:20,950
l'm seasick already.

1296
01:43:21,534 --> 01:43:22,702
Bye-bye, Alan.

1297
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:26,206
Bye-bye, Alan. Nice knowing you.

1298
01:43:56,736 --> 01:44:00,323
Anybody from out of town here?
Where are you from, sir?

1299
01:44:00,448 --> 01:44:01,449
Gorgon.

1300
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:05,829
What exit? Hello? ls this thing on?
ls this a boat or an oil painting?

1301
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:09,416
l hope we don't hit an iceberg.

1302
01:49:26,566 --> 01:49:29,277
Nuclear warhead?
What are you talking about?

1303
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:31,863
Was that too much?

1304
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:38,995
I"ve never heard you say that before.
