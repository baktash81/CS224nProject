Because there are no TV
and film rights.

314
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,855
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

handed him his lunch.</i>

00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,421
No. Jesus.
We did not get "into it."

333
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:17,925
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

334
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,293
Harlan took you aside
at the party.

335
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,365
When you returned,
you were chastened.

336
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,170
What did Harlan say to you?

The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

338
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,808
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time,

339
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,575
and I just think
this is a window

340
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,344
that's not
gonna stay open.

341
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:38,445
We need to take
advantage of it

342
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,447
and then you just need
to look at the numbers!

343
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,482
- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!

344
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,352
You... You put me
in charge of our books.

345
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:48,254
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

346
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,624
They're not
our books, son.

347
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,760
They're my books.

348
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:55,896
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

349
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,431
But you're right,
you're right.

350
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:02,469
It's unfair of me
to keep you tethered

351
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,372
to something that
isn't yours to control.

352
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,439
What?

353
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:10,178
No, I've done you
a grave disservice.

354
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,813
All these years,

355
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,482
I've kept you
from building something

356
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:17,820
of your own
that was yours.

357
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:22,422
But you're not
going to be running

358
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:24,761
the publishing house
anymore.

359
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,628
You're free of it.

360
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:28,630
Whoa...

361
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:31,966
Dad, are you
firing me?

362
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,234
No... (CHUCKLES)

363
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:35,772
We'll talk
details tomorrow.

364
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,240
My mind's made up.

365
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:40,810
Good boy.

366
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:52,487
We talked. We had a business
discussion about e-books.

367
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,692
Jesus. It was nothing.

368
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,491
You want to talk
about an argument,

369
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,393
hell, Ransom had
an argument with him.

370
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,561
Ransom, that's, uh,

371
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,397
- Richard and Linda's son?
- WALT: Mmm.

372
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,369
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid. We love him.

373
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:10,570
But?

374
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,973
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

375
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,041
Ah.

376
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:15,676
(STUTTERS)
And I'm not trying to...

377
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:17,845
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

378
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,748
But with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

379
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,450
And Dad,
for some unknown reason,

380
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,919
always supported him.

381
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,290
They have this love-hate bond.
They fight.

382
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,828
But that night, God,
they had a blowout.

383
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:33,694
About what?

384
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:35,528
RANSOM:
Are you goddamn insane?

385
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,864
WALT: <i>We couldn't
make it out really,</i>

386
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:38,665
<i>but it was huge.</i>

387
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,769
<i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i>

388
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,004
<i>Usually they like
to stoke up drama</i>

389
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,306
<i>in front of the whole family.</i>

390
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,742
Speaking of getting into it...

391
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,143
(CHUCKLES)

392
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:53,613
You were at the house early,
to help the caterers set up. Did...

393
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,051
Did you converse with Harlan
at that time?

394
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,519
Well, he was there.
We must have spoke.

395
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,757
In his study?

396
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,925
I don't think so.

397
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,995
You see, I spoke
with the caterer this morning,

398
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,765
she didn't see you
helping her staff.

399
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,466
She did hear Harlan
in a screaming match

400
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,838
with somebody that afternoon
in his study.

401
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,005
Yeah, I don't...

402
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,809
- Screaming match?
- Mmm-hmm.

403
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,976
No.

404
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,409
Um... (CLICKS TONGUE)

405
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,812
But Joni was here, too.

406
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:27,413
Um, she was early,
so it might have been her.

407
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,548
You can maybe ask her.

408
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,718
These were two male voices.

409
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,652
<i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i>

410
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,857
HARLAN:
You tell her or I will!

411
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:36,826
"You tell her

412
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,327
"or I will!"

413
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,664
Bells ringing?

414
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:53,007
That's none
of your business.

415
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,008
You stay out
of my marriage.

416
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,144
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

417
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,880
I've put all of it
in this letter to her.

418
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,548
Tomorrow, she gets it.

419
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,416
Harlan, I'm warning you.

420
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,952
- No, she deserves to know.
- You stay out of my marriage.

421
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:07,054
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

422
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,892
- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!

423
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,730
Yes. I know.

424
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,597
Yes.

425
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,466
(CHUCKLES) Uh...

426
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:25,105
Harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home

427
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,507
and Linda had
always opposed that.

428
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,876
And I wanted to wait
until we got back

429
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:30,911
to Boston, uh, to tell Linda,

430
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:33,781
so, to avoid a whole scene,

431
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,618
and Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

432
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,753
That was it.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

433
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,057
Sorry. Forgot.

434
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,924
The house?

435
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:47,460
Uh, early.
Richard said you were there.

436
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,631
I was at the house early.

437
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,801
BENOIT: To see Harlan?

438
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,469
To see Harlan.

439
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,404
Yes.

440
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,907
What were you
seeing Harlan about?

441
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,542
It was just a mix-up
with the, uh,

442
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:04,611
the payment for Meg's tuition.

443
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm... I'm...

444
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:07,549
I'm sorry to press,

445
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,686
but what kind of mix-up?

446
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:13,954
Yeah, the school hasn't
got the check yet.

447
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't know why Alan
didn't mail it.

448
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:17,624
HARLAN: Well,
Alan didn't mail it

449
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,828
because he caught
a discrepancy.

450
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,899
Alan's office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school

451
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,599
as per your request.

452
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,937
But Phyllis's office that
handles your yearly allowance

453
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:33,743
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

454
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:37,678
You have been double-dipping
Meg's tuition

455
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,013
and stealing from me.

456
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:41,982
- (SCOFFS)
- $100,000 a year,

457
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,851
for the past four years.

458
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:45,920
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

459
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,553
but I swear to God...

460
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,489
HARLAN: So, now I am writing
this tuition check,

461
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,892
but you must know
that this is the last money

462
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:55,162
you or Meg will get from me.

463
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:56,830
Please,
you don't understand...

464
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:58,631
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

465
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,535
but it's all for the best.

466
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,605
My mind's made up.

467
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:09,076
It was, uh,
a money wiring issue

468
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:10,778
with the office at the school.

469
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,881
So I had to ask Harlan to cut
a check for the semester.

470
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,184
Mmm. No big deal.

471
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,184
Well...

472
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:18,886
Why don't we,
uh, just take

473
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,087
a little break
and we'll resu...

474
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,654
Oh, no...

475
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,758
She's gone.

476
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:30,596
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

477
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,801
LINDA: Richard!

478
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:34,634
Joni, have you
seen Richard?

479
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,170
No, I was, uh,
just done with the, um...

480
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:37,239
Okay, thanks.

481
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:40,009
No.

482
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,477
LINDA: Damn it. Richard!

483
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,647
Richard?

484
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,175
(CHUCKLES)

485
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,013
Son of a bitch.

486
00:22:27,323 --> 00:22:30,357
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

487
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,592
but when
the great Benoit Blanc

488
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,094
comes knocking
at my door,

489
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:36,130
I expect it's going
to be about something,

490
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:37,931
if not extraordinary,

491
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,267
then at least interesting.

492
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,235
But... I'm sorry,

493
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,670
this is an open-and-shut
case of suicide

494
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:46,206
and, uh, quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

495
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,941
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

496
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:48,944
BENOIT: The method?

497
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:51,914
Throat slit?

498
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,314
Typical for
a suicide?

499
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,250
Yes, I mean,
that's dramatic.

500
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,252
But look around.

501
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:00,956
I mean, the guy practically
lives in a Clue board.

502
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,097
ELLIOTT: <i>Come on, Benny,
talk to me, all right?</i>

503
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back</i>

504
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,335
<i>for questioning
all over again. I get it.</i>

505
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:16,770
WAGNER: <i>Listen,
I've had boots on the ground</i>

506
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:17,905
<i>in this county
for a while now.</i>

507
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,173
<i>People are generally
what they seem to be.</i>

508
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,208
<i>You're not gonna find
murderers in this family.</i>

509
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,642
ELLIOTT:
<i>This is a pleasant family</i>

510
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:23,877
<i>with the usual quarrels,</i>

511
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,913
<i>but no possible motives
for murder.</i>

512
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:26,982
<i>Where are you going?</i>

513
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:30,786
(GASPS)

514
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,988
Harlan Thrombey's nurse.
Marta...

515
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,723
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.

516
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,192
Miss Cabrera,
you can just wait inside

517
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:39,862
- and we'll be with you in...
- BENOIT: Miss Cabrera.

518
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,766
I've been doin'
a little pokin'.

519
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:47,667
You were hired
on a part-time basis

520
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:49,303
as a registered
nurse, yes?

521
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,972
Uh, yes. I don't work for a VNA.

522
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,740
Harlan hired

WALT: Dad, go back to bed.

ELLIOTT: <i>Which Walt tried
to discourage.</i>

702
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:25,900
<i>Based on this,</i>

703
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,702
<i>the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i>

704
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:30,705
<i>to be between
12:15 and 2.00 a.m.</i>

705
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,506
<i>As Walt was
finishing his cigar</i>

706
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:34,608
<i>at about 12:30, Meg came home.</i>

707
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,343
<i>She went straight to bed.</i>

708
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:39,246
<i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i>

710
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:43,083
<i>And sometime later that night,</i>

711
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,119
<i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,</i>

712

<i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i>

713

<i>She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.</i>

714
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:54,261
That's it. All right?

715
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:56,329
Now, everyone's
stories matched,

716
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,066
every moment
accounted for.

717
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:01,101
And there is
no other staircase

718
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:02,302
up to Harlan's room?

719
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:04,204
None. Just the creaky one.

720
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,205
Interesting.

721
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,308
WAGNER: So, uh, we know that
Ransom didn't do it

722
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,609
because he
wasn't there.

723
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,177
Marta couldn't have.

724
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,847
Harlan was still alive
when she left.

725
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,481
- Yeah.
- Meg...

726
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:16,216
Meg came home
during the window

727
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:17,284
- of the time of death, right?
- ELLIOTT: Now look, look, it was a...

728
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,319
Except it was a suicide,
all right?

729
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,421
Harlan slit right
through his carotid.

730
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,223
We saw from
the blood splat patterns

731
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,624
that they
were uninterrupted,

732
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:26,660
meaning, it's almost
impossible for anyone

733
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:29,496
to have been around him
at the time.

734
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:30,798
He's the one who cut his
own throat, all right?

735
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,365
I don't know why
we keep goin' over this.

736

What?

739
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,473

from this mornin',

746

We kept you waiting
all afternoon,

747
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:56,791
because I wanted to hear
from you last.

748
00:31:56,793 --> 00:32:01,494
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

749
00:32:01,496 --> 00:32:05,167
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

750
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,670
So, please
take your time.

751
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:14,877
You took Mr. Thrombey
upstairs at 11:30

752
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,845
and left at midnight.

753
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:19,646
Think very carefully

754
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:23,818
and with as much detail
as possible.

755
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,723
Tell us what happened
in that half hour?

- No second thoughts.

No. No, no,
no, no.

765
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,574
- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.

766
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,943
- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are...

767
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,745
- It's late. I had...
- You've only had one glass.

Exactly. A glass of champagne.

medicine and go to bed?

at this game?

Because I'm not playing
to beat you.

a beautiful pattern.

WALT: Hey, sis, people are
gonna start getting here

1050
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:50,497
- for the memorial pretty soon.

1051
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:51,500
Are you...

1052
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:56,203
- (SIGHS)
- Are you all right?

1053
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:58,507
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

1054
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:02,177
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
This all feels like one.

1055
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,647
Like something he'd write,
not do.

1056
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:09,518
I keep waiting for
the big reveal.

1057
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,653
(VOICE BREAKING)
Where it'll make sense.

1058
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:15,224
Wouldn't that be nice?

1059
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:17,493
Oh, Walt.

FRAN: <i>I don't think
he killed himself.</i>

1062
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:25,298
I don't. I really don't.

1063
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,967
There's this
Hallmark movie

1064
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,269
called <i>Deadly by Surprise</i>
with Danica McKellar.

1065
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,705
And in it, she plays
this wife

1066
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:33,140
who's getting poisoned
by her husband,

1067
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:34,742
but he's doing it
little by little,

1068
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:35,710
so she doesn't know it

1069
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:38,445
and she goes crazy,
and she kills herself.

1070
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,313
And my cousin,
who's a receptionist

1071
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:42,082
at the medical
examiner's office,

1072
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:44,117
she says that stuff
totally happens.

1073
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,652
It's not even 3% as crazy

1074
00:45:45,654 --> 00:45:47,320
as the stuff she's seen
come through there.

1075
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:48,424
So, I'm just like...

1076
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:51,591
JONI: Oh, God, yeah!

1077
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:53,761
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

1078
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:56,630
RICHARD: No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

1079
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,032
But maybe an asshole
is what we needed.

1080
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,600
Oh, my God, yeah,

1081
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:02,335
an asshole is what
Germany needed

1082
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:04,404
- in 1930-whatever.
- RICHARD: Here we go.

1083
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:06,373
Come on, Joni, those two
things don't even conflate.

1084
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,074
- JONI: There is the problem...
- Oh, Jesus.

1085
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:09,209
JONI: You do not care
about anybody's feelings...

1086
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:11,712
I'm gonna disappear until
the politics talk is done.

1087
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:14,114
- JONI: You, my friend...
- You want some champers?

1088
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,016
I can't.
I'm technically working.

1089
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:17,752
JONI: Why don't you take off
your red cap, Richard,

1090
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:18,786
and look around you?

1091
00:46:18,788 --> 00:46:21,254
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

1092
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,289
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1093
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:25,592
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

1094
00:46:25,594 --> 00:46:26,626
That's right.

1095
00:46:26,628 --> 00:46:28,328

of Mexicans coming.

1096

- Oh, God, really?
- Don't make this a race thing.

1097
00:46:29,732 --> 00:46:31,331
You always make this
a race thing.

1098
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,700
- Yeah, this is not about race.
- I would say the same thing

1099
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:34,134
if they were
European immigrants.

1100
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:36,102
Oh, yeah? So, if the
Swiss were, like,

1101
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:38,138
- clogging in the streets...
- No. No, no, we allow them in

1102
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,373
and they think
they own what's ours.

1103
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:42,576
They're putting children
in cages!

1104
00:46:42,578 --> 00:46:43,744
- I mean, these are camps!
- Yes.

1105
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:45,111
RICHARD: Come on, Joni,

1106
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:46,580
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

1107
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:48,515
but the parents have
some blame here.

1108
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:51,251
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

1109
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:53,821
- Isn't that what America is...
- For breaking the law!

1110
00:46:53,823 --> 00:46:54,755
(GROANS) My God.

1111
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:55,622
RICHARD: And you're gonna
hate hearing this,

1112
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:58,325
but it's true,
America is for Americans.

1113
00:46:58,327 --> 00:46:59,559
JONI: Don't point at me.

1114
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:00,728
Where's Marta?
Is she still here?

1115
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,262
- LINDA: Oh, God, don't.
- RICHARD: Marta!

1116
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:03,563
- Come on over.
- No, Richard.

1117
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:04,832
Come on over, Marta.
Please, come over.

1118
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,099
JONI: You're shitting me.

1119
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:07,467
Marta,

1120
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:11,438
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

1121
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,841
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

1122
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:15,210
She did it the right way.

1123
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,277
You work hard,

1124
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:20,080
and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

1125
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:22,482
Just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

1126
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:24,417
And I'll bet you
agree with me, right?

1127
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:26,687
Oh, just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

1128
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:29,289
It's okay! I just wanna
hear what she has to say!

1129
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,423
It's okay, Marta,
you can speak.

1130
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:31,759
JONI: Oh, sweetheart,
don't feel pressure to answer.

1131
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:33,393
- This is just a...
- RICHARD: Look...

1132
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:34,494
- JONI: Please don't.
- If you wanna

1133
00:47:34,496 --> 00:47:36,263
become an American,

1134
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,699
there are legal
ways to do it.

1135
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:40,233
But if you break the law,

1136
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,669
it doesn't matter
how good your heart is,

1137
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,505
you gotta face
the consequences!

1138

Are you goddamn insane?

1139

- RANSOM: Hey! I'm warning you.

FRAN: That's when I ask her,
I'm like,

1141
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:57,551
"Tonya, what is wrong
with people?"

1142
00:47:57,553 --> 00:47:59,252
Literally.

1143
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,621
Oh, my God!
Marta, what?

1144
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:03,123
- Marta?
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)

1145
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,257
What's the matter?

1146

Whoa, whoa.
Hey. Breathe.

- FRAN: Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?

1148
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,701
Hey, Fran, do you still
have your stash?

1149
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:18,672
Take 'em whenever
you need 'em.

1150
00:48:18,674 --> 00:48:21,308
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

1151
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:22,677
Thanks, Fran.

1152
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,578
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1153
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,680
- No, just... No, stop...
- I'm sorry.

1154
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:27,180
I'm just very, very sorry.

1155
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:28,783
Stop saying
you're sorry. Jesus!

1156
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:30,918
I hate this. Oh, God,
my heart won't stop...

1157
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,185
I can't...

(EXHALES)

1159
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:35,324
It's just everything...
No, thank you.

That's where Fran
keeps her stash?

open a clock?

(LOUDLY) Do you want
dinner, Nana?

1164
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:49,235
Dinner? To eat?

1165
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:51,237
- To eat?
- LINDA: Walt?

1166
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:52,707
- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.

1167
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:54,811
She ate the entire
salmon spread already.

1168
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,446
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

1169
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,348
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

1170
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,550
Yes. Yes, a very good
time, right now.

1171
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:04,885
WALT: Oh, okay.

1172
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:06,823
All right. Calm down.

1173
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:10,791
Marta,

1174
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,395
we've been
talking it over and, uh...

1175
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,631
- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.

1176
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:19,599
- Mmm-hmm.
- Come on.

1177
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:21,368
Marta, we've been
talking it over,

1178
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,804
and, uh,
the whole family,

1179
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,708
we'd like to take
care of you.

1180
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:28,510
What does that mean?

1181
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:31,746
We all think that
you deserve something.

1182
00:49:31,748 --> 00:49:34,347
Financially,
we'd like to help you out.

1183
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,318
You were never anything
but good to Dad

1184
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,154
and because of that we...

1185
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:41,390
You can count on us.

1186
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:43,693
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1187
00:49:45,862 --> 00:49:48,395
I thought you should've been
at the funeral,

1188
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:50,365
by the way, I was outvoted.

You're still here?

1193
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,482
BENOIT: Mmm.

1194
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,253
Did you know Harlan?

1195
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:14,521
BENOIT: He knew my father,

1196
00:50:14,523 --> 00:50:16,591
who was a police detective
years ago.

1197
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:18,726
Oh.

1198
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:20,662
My father
respected Harlan.

1199
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,329
That says quite a lot.

1200
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:24,666
Is that why
you're here?

1201
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:27,802
Here now, here?

1202
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:29,904
(CHUCKLES) No.

1203
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:32,240
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

1204
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:40,615
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

1205
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:43,616
I know it.

1206
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,654
I believe you know it, too.

1207
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:48,791
So you're gonna keep digging?

1208
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:53,493
Harlan's detectives,
they dig.

1209
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:55,696
They riffle and root.

1210
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:56,933
Truffle pigs.

<i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i>

1213
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,639
It's a novel.

1214
00:51:06,641 --> 00:51:08,475
Yeah, I know.

1215
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:10,845
- I haven't read it though.

01:06:36,638 --> 01:06:39,506
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1560
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:42,743
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1561
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:44,781
No, that would
not explain this.

1562
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:47,782
Analyze that mud.

1563
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:49,482
It will match
these traces.

1564
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:50,450
Take this to Jamie.

1565
01:06:50,452 --> 01:06:51,551
BENOIT: And you will find
similar samples

1566
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:54,423
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.

1567
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,523
On the night of the party,

1568
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,526
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps,

1569
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:01,261
went to a great deal of trouble

1570
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:02,965
to break into
Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1571
01:07:04,332 --> 01:07:06,803
The game is afoot,
eh, Watson?

1572
01:07:17,646 --> 01:07:20,781
ALAN: Well, thank you all for
getting together like this.

1573
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:23,017
It isn't legally necessary,

1574
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:24,517
but I thought because
you're all in town,

1575
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:26,319
and some of you
are leaving soon...

1576
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:27,387
Excuse me.

1577
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:29,690
Uh, I'm sorry.

1578
01:07:29,692 --> 01:07:32,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1579
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:34,294
that you all stay in town

1580
01:07:34,296 --> 01:07:36,731
until the investigation
is completed.

1581
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:38,631
ELLIOTT: Yeah, well,
he's gently requesting,

1582
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,366
but I'm gonna have
to make that an order.

1583
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:42,069
No one move until we
figure this all out.

1584
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,336
What?

1585
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:44,537
Can we ask why?

1586
01:07:44,539 --> 01:07:46,006
- Has something changed?
- No.

1587
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:48,075
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1588
01:07:48,077 --> 01:07:49,810
BENOIT: Mr. Stevens...

1589
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:51,544
You may continue.

1590
01:07:51,546 --> 01:07:52,815
ALAN: Right. Well...

1591
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:54,882
The other reason I thought

1592
01:07:54,884 --> 01:07:57,317
this gathering
would be, uh, beneficial

1593
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:00,855
is because
Harlan altered his will

1594
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:02,489
a week before he died.

1595
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:03,858
He sealed it.

1596
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,459
He asked me not to
submit it to the courts

1597
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,895
for probate
until after his death.

1598
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:10,831
So, if anyone is confused
about anything,

1599
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,399
we're all together,
we can talk.

1600
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:15,568
Although I don't imagine
any of it

1601
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:17,470
is going to be
that complicated.

1602
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:19,539
Uh, Harlan's
assets included...

1603
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:20,607
Um...

1604
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:21,976
- The house.
- The house,

1605
01:08:21,978 --> 01:08:23,643
which he owned outright.

1606
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:24,712
Um...

1607
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:25,913
$60 million.

1608
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:28,716
Yes. $60 million
in various cash accounts

1609
01:08:28,718 --> 01:08:30,084
and investments.

1610
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:31,687
And of course,

1611
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:33,721
the real asset,

1612
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:36,389
sole ownership
of Blood Like Wine,

1613
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:37,557
his publishing company.

1614
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:41,128
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1615
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,832
and he wanted
that read first.

1616
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,668
"Dearest Linda,
Walter, and Joni...

1617
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,571
"Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1618
01:08:51,573 --> 01:08:53,874
"No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion.

1619
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:55,676
"And its purpose
was not to sow

1620
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,377
"greater discord in the family,

1621
01:08:57,379 --> 01:08:59,046
"quite the opposite.

1622
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:01,682
"Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness,

1623
01:09:01,684 --> 01:09:03,083
"but do accept it,

1624
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:05,021
"it's for the best. Dad."

1625
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:18,699
Um...

1626
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:22,435
Wow. Well, yeah,
not too complex at all.

1627
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:23,503
This will be quick.

1628
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:24,872

- No.

please, Alan?

1644

- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.

1645

against this?

1654
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:25,465

Something...

1655
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,767
- RICHARD: You know...
- Alan, listen...

1656
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:27,968
- He was on medication.
- In his final days,

1657
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,602
he was on a great deal
of medication.

1658
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:30,905
RICHARD: Morphine?
All right, morphine.

1659

- I mean, I don't know.
- JONI: This is confusing.

1660

- She seems like family...
- Alan, you can take...

- ...but she's not our family.
- ...this piece of paper

1662
01:10:35,711 --> 01:10:38,779
and shove it right up your
ass, and get out!

1663

We're not going anywhere.

Were you boinking my father?

to cool their jets.

1731
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:12,835

1733
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,975
Mmm-hmm.

1734
01:13:21,043 --> 01:13:22,111
So why?

1735
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:25,848
- Why?
- Why?

1736
01:13:26,982 --> 01:13:31,085
Hey. This is everything.

1737
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:33,120
There's gotta be a bigger reason
why, and you know it.

1738
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:34,188
Well, how about
it had to do more

1739
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,691
with you guys
than with me?

1740
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,827
Yeah.

1741
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,831
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1742
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:48,702
Did he tell you anything?

1743
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,304
Only that I wasn't
getting a cent.

1744
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:51,371
That's because
he wanted you

1745
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,107
to build something from
the ground up like your mom.

1746
01:13:53,109 --> 01:13:54,208
"To build something
from the ground up."

1747
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,110
Yeah, my mother built her
business from the ground up

1748
01:13:56,112 --> 01:13:58,779
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1749
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,715
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1750
01:14:01,717 --> 01:14:03,050
He lives in fear.

1751
01:14:03,052 --> 01:14:05,185
And I know that's what
my grandfather was trying

1752
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:06,720
to protect me from
by doing this

1753
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:08,255
and I know I shouldn't say
this out loud,

1754
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,758
but when he told me, I...

1755

I was driving.

1761
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,679
I was gonna have to
fend for myself.

01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:32,214

1763
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:35,217

1768
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,029
I know he didn't
commit suicide.

1769
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:51,734
- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.

1770
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:53,467
I know it.

1771
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:55,002
Because I knew my granddad.

1772
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:57,237
Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,

1773
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,708
so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...

I don't know
how many times

1788
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:43,417
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1789
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,787
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1790
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,388
and we all
confirmed that he was...

1791
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,990
Would a sound mind do this?

1792
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:51,225
How... Sound, how?

1793
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:53,527
The very action
speaks to unsoundness.

Not legally. No.

1795

You not liking what he did

1796
01:15:57,299 --> 01:15:59,833
does not speak
to testamentary capacity.

1797
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:02,236
What about
undue influence?

1798
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:04,972
Yeah! Undue influence,
how about that? Huh?

1799
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:06,206
Did you just google that?

1800
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,508
Look, if Marta was
manipulating Dad somehow

1801
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:10,244
- and if we found out...
- If somehow, she had gotten...

1802
01:16:10,246 --> 01:16:11,445
- ...that somehow she was...
- ...her hooks into him...

01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:28,195
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1810
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:30,130
Well, what the hell
is the slayer rule?

1811
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:31,465
Well, it's if
someone is convicted

1812
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:32,866
of killing the person,

1813
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:34,268
they don't get
their inheritance.

1814
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,335
Not even convicted.

1815

held responsible

the investigation is ongoing.

You made a point of that.

1823
01:16:59,928 --> 01:17:01,228

but yes,

1827
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,106
I suspect foul play.

Thank you.

1834
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:29,222
There's only one
answer to this.

1835
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:30,657
She has to renounce
the inheritance.

1836
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,292
She knows it's
what she should do.

1837
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:33,360
- That's exactly what she...
- It's the right thing to do.

1838
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,594
- Right?
- No way...

- MEG: Mom.
- RICHARD: She'll do it.

If Granddad wanted to give
Marta everything,

1842
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:40,634
then that's what he wanted.

1843
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:42,035
No.

1844
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,271
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1845
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,639
He wanted us taken care of.

1846
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:47,876
He wanted you
to have an education.

that meant something.

that's what he
told me about you.

1867
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:39,094
That you beat him at Go more
than I do, and I thought...

1868
01:18:41,063 --> 01:18:43,098
What a strange
thing to tell me.

wanted for you.

I mean, think about what he
did to go through with this.

1878
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:11,726
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1879

turn me in right now

01:44:11,227 --> 01:44:14,194
it is an immovable fact

And what you and Harlan did

to fill that hole perfectly.

look a little closer.

And when we do,
we see the donut hole

2396
01:44:37,186 --> 01:44:39,585
has a hole in its center.

2397
01:44:39,587 --> 01:44:41,755
It is not a donut hole,

2398
01:44:41,757 --> 01:44:44,725
but a smaller donut
with its own hole

2399
01:44:44,727 --> 01:44:47,695
and our donut
is not whole at all!

2400
01:44:47,697 --> 01:44:49,863
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you...

2401
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:52,068
Why was I hired?

2402
01:44:52,868 --> 01:44:54,600
Why would someone hire me?

01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:56,003
ELLIOTT: Someone fishing
for a crime

2404
01:44:56,005 --> 01:44:57,304
to reverse the will, Blanc.
Come on.

2405
01:44:57,306 --> 01:44:59,807
But I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

2406
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:01,108
So, yes,

2407
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:04,244
the person must have known
the contents of the will.

2408
01:45:04,246 --> 01:45:05,346
But one step further,

2409
01:45:05,348 --> 01:45:08,749
that same person must have
known a crime was committed,

2410
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:10,684
and further...

2411
01:45:10,686 --> 01:45:15,723
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

2412
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:18,792
they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

of factors.

what Marta did

01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,675
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed.

2421
01:45:34,677 --> 01:45:36,210
What if someone
in the family had observed

2422
01:45:36,212 --> 01:45:37,311
Marta doing
something suspicious?

2423
01:45:37,313 --> 01:45:40,716

no reason not to speak up.

The answer
is not so simple.

Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

2427
01:45:50,926 --> 01:45:53,963
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

be easy for you to hear.

2430

one truly guilty party
behind it all,

2431
01:46:04,974 --> 01:46:08,142
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

2432
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:11,814
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

2437
01:46:24,026 --> 01:46:25,692
I figured it was up.
I'm sorry.

Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

2439
01:46:28,064 --> 01:46:30,663
Not exactly
everything though.

2440
01:46:30,665 --> 01:46:32,966
MARTA: Is this about
what Greatnana told you?

2441
01:46:32,968 --> 01:46:35,936
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

We'll get to that.

Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

2445
01:46:41,844 --> 01:46:45,647

why you hired me.

with Harlan ended with?

Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,521
That's right.

2768
02:00:14,456 --> 02:00:15,457
Fran's dead.

2769
02:00:19,762 --> 02:00:21,931
And you just confessed
to her murder.

2770
02:00:34,643 --> 02:00:35,644
Well...

2771
02:00:36,913 --> 02:00:37,947
In for a penny...

2772
02:00:43,019 --> 02:00:44,020
(INAUDIBLE)

2773
02:00:58,801 --> 02:01:00,870
(PANTING)

2774
02:01:13,883 --> 02:01:14,884
(SPRING SQUEAKING)

2775
02:01:22,725 --> 02:01:23,726
Shit.

2776
02:02:28,791 --> 02:02:29,892
(INAUDIBLE)

2777
02:02:57,019 --> 02:02:58,020
RICHARD: Linda!

2778
02:02:58,354 --> 02:02:59,453
Linda!

2779
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:02,024
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2780
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:03,793
We...

2781
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:11,098
MARTA: <i>Can I ask</i>

2782
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,100
<i>when did you know
I had something to do</i>

2783
02:03:13,102 --> 02:03:14,835
<i>with Harlan's death?</i>

2784
02:03:14,837 --> 02:03:16,837
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh, from the first moment

2785
02:03:16,839 --> 02:03:18,307
you set foot in front of me.

2786
02:03:23,645 --> 02:03:24,577
MARTA: Oh, shit.

2787
02:03:24,579 --> 02:03:26,680
BENOIT: I want you
to remember something

2788
02:03:26,682 --> 02:03:27,917
that's very important.

2789
02:03:29,085 --> 02:03:30,284
You won,

2790
02:03:30,286 --> 02:03:33,155
not by playing the game
Harlan's way,

2791
02:03:33,956 --> 02:03:35,024
but yours.

2792
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:38,761
You're a good person.

2793
02:03:40,963 --> 02:03:42,298
This family.

2794
02:03:48,771 --> 02:03:50,940
I should help them. Right?

2795
02:03:51,807 --> 02:03:54,176
Well, I have my opinion,

2796
02:03:55,811 --> 02:03:58,080
but I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.

2797
