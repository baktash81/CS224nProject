354
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:44,318
farm-raised stuff.

355
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,320
- Where do you stand
on red meat?

356
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:47,538
- As far away as I can.

357
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,327
- Nonfat half-caf latte.

358
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,982
Am I right?
- Yes.

359
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:59,246
- There you go.

360
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,378
- Can I ask you
a personal question?

361
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,989
- Yeah, of course.

362
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,947
- How are you still single?

363
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,341
- [Laughs] Have you been
talking to my mother?

364
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,517
Well...ah, it's just,
you know,

365
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,519
between med school
and my residency

366
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:14,348
and then jumping headfirst
into the pediatric surgery pool,

367
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,481
I haven't had much time
for relationships.

368
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,266
Mostly though, I think,

369
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,921
it's cause I haven't met
the right woman.

370
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,184
- There's no way I can
make this any easier,

371
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,055
so I won't even try.

372
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,492
We did our best, but I'm afraid
the surgery was a wash.

373
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,320
- What are you saying?

374
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,061
- I'm saying
you can expect a gradual onset

375
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:33,497
of more serious symptoms,
but as soon as you heal,

376
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,195
you can enjoy a relatively
normal life.

377
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,414
- Until...
- Yes, until.

378
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:41,244
Nothing to be done, old boy.
Sorry.

379
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,290
- Have you talked
to my family?

380
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,467
- No, not yet.
Per your instructions...

381
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:50,862
- So he's handsome,
great body, amazing cook.

382
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,386
Cries at steel magnolias.

383
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,388
No...owns steel magnolias.

384
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,912
Ha. You sure
this guy bats righty?

385
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,609
- You are such a cynic,
Chloe.

386
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,611
I told you, he just hasn't
met the right woman yet.

387
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,397
- I am just protecting
my younger sister, that's all.

388
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,181
It's part of
the job description.

389
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,530
- Ohh...
Good-bye, Chloe.

390
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,097
- [Laughs] Bye.

391
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:15,278
Fred: Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

392
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,977
- Hey! You ready
for my sumatran sling?

393
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,022
- No. I want a nonfat
half-caf latte.

394
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,328
I've been having it
every morning

395
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,199
for the last two years.

396
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,940
- That's why you need a change.
- I don't want a change.

397
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:26,986
Listen, I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

398
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,552
and then
I'm never coming back.

399
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,337
You going to give me
what I want...Or not?

400
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,643
- Absolutely...positively...

401
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,472
Definitely...not.

402
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,257
- I don't know how
you expect to keep your business

403
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,432
with nerve like that.

404
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,313
- Here we go.

405
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,924
One large
nonfat half-caf latte.

406
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,275
Enjoy it, dude.

407
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,407
You miss me?

408
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:00,019
- Why does he get to
have that and I don't?

409
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,803
- Well, because
that boring drink

410
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,632
suits his buttoned-down
civil servant butt...Not yours.

411
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,938
- What business is it of yours
what coffee I drink?

412
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,289
- Coffee is my business,

413
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,292
and I won't let my customers
settle for anything less

414
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,642
than the exact right
cup o' Joe.

415
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,252
- You've already ruined
my morning.

416
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,515
Just give me something...
Anything.

417
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,692
- Sit here.
You're gonna love it.

418
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:46,761
Presenting, from the volcanic
slopes of Indonesia,

419
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,372
the sumatran sling.

420
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:52,549
Surprisingly complex
but with a delicate balance

421
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,986
of sweetness and acidity...

422
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,032
Just like me.

423
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:58,773
So you're waiting for
that guy?

424
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,514
- What guy?

425
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,690
- Boungiorno supremo.
You know, Superman.

426
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:06,346
- If you're speaking of Erik,
no, I am not waiting for him.

427
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,176
Who are you again?
- Fred. Fred Jones.

428
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,655
- Sarah fischer.

429
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,657
- Drink up, Sarah fischer.

430
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,833
- With you standing here
watching me?

431
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,272
- So you really like this guy?
- Yes. I like him very much.

432
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,490
- You know,
the last place I worked,

433
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,318
the owners bought this, uh,

434
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,668
state-of-the-art
Espresso machine.

435
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,235
You know what?

436
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,237
Didn't really make
any better coffee

437
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,196
than the beat up
cheapo version they replaced.

438
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,675
- Your point?

439
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,634
- Just that nothing
is ever as perfect

440
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:37,116
as it seems.

441
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,471
Hey! What about your
sumatran sling?

442
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,516
- No. You've already
made me late for work.

443
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,605
I've gotta go.

444
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,391
Uh...no smoking.

445
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,393
One drink limit.

446
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,699
Good cook.
Owns own home.

447
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,702
Reads books.

448
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,270
Must cry at movies.

449
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:03,359
Hee hee hee.

450
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,319
Tabitha, I think
we hit the mother lode.

451
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:07,581
[Meow]

452
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,373
- Here you go, guys.

453
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,723
Well, if it isn't
Sarah smile.

454
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,508
- Hi, Fred.

455
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,249
- What's shakin'?

456
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,946
You ready for that
sumatran sling?

457
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,644
- I know what you were
trying to do the other day

458
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,342
when you were telling me
the story

459
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,604
about the Espresso machine.

460
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,345
- It was just a story.

461
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,260
- Well, I don't appreciate it.

462
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,870
You don't know anything
about me.

463
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,698
You don't know what's perfect
and what's not.

464
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,309
- You and Superman
have a hot weekend?

465
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,919
- As a matter of fact,
we did.

466
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,270
Flew up to San Francisco
in a private plane.

467
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,446
- Sweet.
You meet the parents yet?

468
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,275
- No...
Why?

469
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,277
- No reason.
Just askin'.

470
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:54,715
- I'm not avoiding it.
- Okay.

471
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,805
- What makes you think
you're so all-knowing anyway?

472
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:02,462
- Look...the reason I understand
the right coffee drink

473
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,290
is because
I understand people,

474
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,595
and vice versa.

475
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,467
- And whatever that means.

476
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,382
- It's now or never.

477
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,646
Are you ready to partake
of this nectar of the gods...

478
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,691
Or not?

479
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,612
- It's fine.

480
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,266
- Ha!

481
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,528
Ha ha ha!

482
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,487
[Sarcastically] Fine!

483
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,841
- So, Erik...

484
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,278
Pediatrics must be
a rewarding profession.

485
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,019
- Oh, absolutely.

486
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,455
No, getting to help kids
is incredibly gratifying.

487
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,457
'Cause kids are the best!

488
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,677
- Me too?
- Yeah. You too.

489
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,375
- You're nice.
I hope my aunt Sarah keeps you.

490
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,334
She doesn't keep anybody.
- Oh.

491
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,466
- Oh.
- I think what Allie

492
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,815
means to say is that
Sarah's very...Selective.

493
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,904
That's all.

494
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,733
- Nothing wrong with that.
Just depends on who you select.

495
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,345
- Don't burn the hamburgers,
honey!

496
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,347
They won't ask you
to grill again!

497
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,523
- Right.
- My husband would take over

498
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,525
the grill at any restaurant
if they'd let him.

499
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,267
- A grilling man
is a happy man, right, stu?

500
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,356
- So true.
I mean, come on...

501
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,401
- Oh, my...
Whoa! Whoa!

502
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,663
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my...

503
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,404
- Daddy!
- Kids, stay there.

504
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:16,536
- Kids, kids, stay back.

505
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,625
- Help! Aah! Aah!

506
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,366
- Honey!
- All right, stay calm.

507
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,368
Stay calm.
Take this off.

508
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,500
Stop flailing.
- Don't flail!

509
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,459
- All right, here we go.
- Let Erik handle it!

510
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,417
- Hit that apron, would ya?

511
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,419
- Oh...
- Sweetheart?

512
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,335
- [Panting]
- Are you all right?

513
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,728
- I am now.

514
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,556
Erik, you just about
saved my life.

515
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,647
- Well, you're lucky.
It's just a minor burn.

516
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,779
- No, we're lucky
we have a doctor around.

517
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,912
- They usually just have
an accountant around.

518
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,915
- Naw, you're great in a tax
emergency, stuey.

519
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,309
- Well, unfortunately,
the burgers are ruined.

520
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,399
So much for the dinner.
- Well, not so fast.

521
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,705
You have any pasta?

522
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,404
- You just...
You just whipped this up.

523
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,709
This would have
taken me hours.

524
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,189
- Ah, it's nothing.

525
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,930
Had everything I needed
in the fridge.

526
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,584
- This is the best pasta

01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,395
- I mean, y-you have to...
You have to...

1400
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:28,962
- No, it's, uh...

1401
01:02:29,136 --> 01:02:31,225
No, uh...Ah.
"Must love animals."

1402
01:02:31,399 --> 01:02:33,227
That's good, right,
buddy?

1403
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,664
"No slogan t-shirts.

1404
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,231
Must have nice feet."

1405
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:38,667
Boy, you are, uh, thorough.

1406
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,322
- Look, you're
the only one that ever

1407
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:44,021
even came close to being
a perfect score, you know?

1408
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:46,371
But that's not the reason
why I'm marrying you, of course.

1409
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:49,243
- Whatever. No, it's...
I'm deeply flattered.

1410
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:50,941
And it's darn lucky
I threw away

1411
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:53,987
that "surgeons do it
with heart" t-shirt.

1412
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:55,989
- So you're not offended?

1413
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:57,295
You...you...

1414
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,253
- Don't be silly.
- You sure?

1415
01:02:59,427 --> 01:03:01,865
- It's adorable.
It's totally you.

1416
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,868
It's totally why I love you.

1417
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:06,565
- Really?

1418
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,886
- There are so many
details to think about

1419
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,409
when it comes to your wedding.

1420
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,932
I can only suggest.

1421
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:28,369
The major choices
are between you two.

1422
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,371
- Well, actually,
Erik and I are...Are...

1423
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:33,200
Are really clear about,
you know, what we want,

1424
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,202
so um...

1425
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:36,943
Thanks.

1426
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,250
- [Singsong]
Leave it to Sarah.

1427
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:41,730
Can't go anywhere
without her list.

1428
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,428
- That's my daughter.

1429
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:45,299
The most organized gal
on two feet.

1430
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,040
- Well, organized is one thing,

1431
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:49,738
as long as the bride
and groom are on the same page.

1432
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,262
Otherwise, it's just chaos.

1433
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:52,872
- Well, you don't have
to worry about us.

1434
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,395
Sarah and I agree on just
about everything,

1435
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:56,180
don't we, sweetie?
- Uh-huh.

1436
01:03:56,354 --> 01:03:57,659
- Okay, shall we start
on the menu?

1437
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,444
- All right.
First of all, no red meat,

1438
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,446
and nothing endangered...
We're very adamant about that.

1439
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,491
- Okay. Then might I sugg...
- So we're thinking a choice

1440
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,276
of either wild salmon
or free-range chicken breast,

1441
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,365
right, honey?
- You know, I-I don't know.

1442
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,193
I was thinking that, um,
you know, a lot of people

1443
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:11,456
do like red meat, so...

1444
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,936
Maybe we can offer
filet mignon too.

1445
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,633
- Baby, that's...

1446
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:16,200
That's very different
than what we talked about.

1447
01:04:16,374 --> 01:04:19,290
- I know, but...
Different is okay, right?

1448
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:20,987
Make everyone happy.

1449
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:23,250
- Okay, yeah.
Filet mignon too.

1450
01:04:23,424 --> 01:04:25,296
But only grass-fed organic.

1451
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,950
Try hearst ranch
up in San simeon.

1452
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:28,386
- Well, we usually order

1453
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,040
from organic pastures
in riverside.

1454
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,345
- Do they guarantee
no subtherapeutic antibiotics

1455
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:33,304
in the meat?
- Pfft!

1456
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:35,306
Good point!

1457
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,655
We'll order from hearst.

1458
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:39,179
- Why don't we go on
to centerpieces?

1459
01:04:39,353 --> 01:04:41,573
Um, you know what,
I-I sketched out

1460
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:43,531
just a few concepts.

1461
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,055
- You didn't mention that.

1462
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:47,231
- Yeah, just some
simple drawings I did.

1463
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:50,451
- Oh, yeah!

1464
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,279
No, sweetie, you're right.

1465
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:55,195
These, uh...
They're...They're simple.

1466
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:56,588
I mean, I thought
we were gonna go for

1467
01:04:56,762 --> 01:04:58,155
something more elaborate
than this.

1468
01:04:58,329 --> 01:05:00,287
- You're right, of course.
Of course, yeah.

1469
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,855
- Erik, maybe these
are more to your liking.

1470
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:05,249
Personally,
I love this third one.

1471
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:09,470
- Oh...my.
- Huh?

1472
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:12,212
- [Chuckling]

1473
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:13,953
- Are those...Those
bird cages?

1474
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,303
- Yeah! It's so much better
than a plain old vase.

1475
01:05:16,477 --> 01:05:19,872
Plus, it can hold
three times the flowers.

1476
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:22,396
- Bird cages.
How unique.

1477
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,355
- Yeah. Actually, I thought...

1478
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:26,357
- Do these come silver-plated?
- Silver, gold.

1479
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:27,532
Whatever you like.

1480
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:29,273
And we can have them bursting

1481
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:31,014
with a melange
of Autumn flowers.

1482
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:33,538
- So like some calla lilies,
dahlias, and delphiniums?

1483
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:36,236
- Agapanthus,
blue irises.

1484
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,543
[Gasps]
I know...Grape hyacinths!

1485
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,633
- Yes! Oh, and one giant
cymbidium orchid

1486
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,548
smack in the middle,
just towering over all of them.

1487
01:05:43,722 --> 01:05:45,376
- Erik, that is genius!

1488
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,204
- That's my future
son-in-law.

1489
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:48,509
[Echoing]
- Erik, darling,

1490
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,076
is there anything
you don't know?

1491
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,210
- Sarah, you have
quite a catch here.

1492
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,255
You two
are gonna be so happy.

1493
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:56,735
[Voice distorting, echoing]
I just said

1494
01:05:56,909 --> 01:05:59,912
I think you two
are gonna be so happy.

1495
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:01,305
- Sarah...you all right?

1496
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:03,960
- I'm okay.
- Honey, what is it?

1497
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:05,483
- Oh...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1498
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:07,311
- Oh! Oh!

1499
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:08,442
- [Breathing heavily]

1500
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:11,184
I just...
I can't breathe.

1501
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:13,186
- I'm taking her
to the hospital.

1502
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,232
[Echoing]
- Oh...

1503
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:19,236
- How's my girl, Pete?

1504
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,715
- Well, her vital signs
are fine,

1505
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,326
and all her tests
came back negative.

1506
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,329
I'd say what you experienced
was...

1507
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:27,331
Simply a reaction to stress.

1508
01:06:27,505 --> 01:06:28,941
- Stress?
I-I couldn't breathe.

1509
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:29,942
- No, sweetie,
hyperventilation's

1510
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:32,510
often a result of stress.

1511
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:34,294
- Sarah, are you particularly
anxious about anything

1512
01:06:34,468 --> 01:06:36,122
right now?
- No, we were just sitting

1513
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,255
with our wedding planner,
talking about food and flowers.

1514
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,300
All of a sudden,
she couldn't breathe.

1515
01:06:40,474 --> 01:06:42,085
- Joanie had such
commitment anxiety,

1516
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:43,651
she'd throw up if she even
looked at a wedding dress.

1517
01:06:43,825 --> 01:06:46,350
- I don't have
commitment anxiety.

1518
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:48,656
Tell him I-I don't
have commitment anxiety.

1519
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:52,008
- Well, let's just be glad
if that's all it was.

1520
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:53,444
Right, Erik?
- Absolutely.

1521
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:55,098
Thanks for the second
opinion, pal.

1522
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:57,361
- Can't be too sure
about these things, right?

1523
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:08,720
- It's a big decision, Fred.

1524
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:12,158
It's not just, you know,
go get married.

1525
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:13,464
It's actually
a big decision.

1526
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:14,813
- You know what I think,
Sarah?

1527
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:16,510
I think
you're just like your drawings...

1528
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:18,643
All safe and neat and tidy

1529
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:23,387
and totally unwilling
to take even the slightest risk.

1530
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:58,509
- "Fred Jones, number ten."

01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:01,686
Oh...

Print.

1534
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:07,257
- [Playing harmonica]

1535
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,216
- Thanks for telling me

1536
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,305
you're in
the barista contest!

1537
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:13,698
- Ho ho ho.
Pardon "ez moi."

1538
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,569
I was too busy
"having a nice life,"

1539
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,443
which in my book means
you wanted me to get lost.

1540
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:22,272
- Well, in my book,
it doesn't mean that.

1541
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,230
I guess we go
by different books.

1542
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,753
- I guess so.

1543
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:29,670
- So I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

1544
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:33,892
So...good luck.

1545
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:41,291
Okay, I had a panic attack.

1546
01:08:41,465 --> 01:08:43,293
So maybe you were right.

1547
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,295
I, um...Was...

1548
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:47,688
I-I was...

1549
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:51,344
Maybe a little bit
commitment-phobic.

1550
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:54,826
So I just wanted
to tell you that.

1551
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,350
So...how's practice going?

1552
01:08:57,524 --> 01:08:58,786
- For what?
- The contest.

1553
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,571
- I'm not...I'm not doing
the contest.

1554
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:02,573
- Why not?

1555
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:06,229
Fred, it's...

1556
01:09:06,403 --> 01:09:08,231
Fred, this is silly.

1557
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:10,407
You're so good at this.
You make people happy.

1558
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,670
And that makes you happy,
so...

1559
01:09:12,844 --> 01:09:15,325
And it's $10,000, so...

1560
01:09:15,499 --> 01:09:17,762
You should do it.

1561
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:19,938
- I'll think about it.

Um...

01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,808
Sorry. Hi.

we have this first-place check

1765
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:01,444
- Wow!

1766
01:25:01,618 --> 01:25:04,664
- Fred, because of this,
you have qualified

1767
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:07,450
to compete in the world

1768
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:10,366
in Honolulu, Hawaii!

1769
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:16,328
- Well, um...
Thank you.

1770
01:25:16,502 --> 01:25:18,417
Thank you, uh...

1771
01:25:18,591 --> 01:25:21,333
Thank you to the west coast
regional invitational

1772
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:24,380
barista championship
for this incredible honor

1773
01:25:24,554 --> 01:25:26,730
and for this huge
wad of cash.

1774
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:28,688
I, uh, I promise
not to spend it wisely.

1775
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:31,213
[Laughter]

1776
01:25:31,387 --> 01:25:33,258
I also, uh, wanna thank

1777
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:37,262
someone who not only pushed me
to enter this competition

1778
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:39,569
but someone who is also
the inspiration

1779
01:25:39,743 --> 01:25:43,355
behind one of my winning
specialty drinks.

1780
01:25:43,529 --> 01:25:45,357
You see,
when we first met,

1781
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:48,404
I took one look at her
and I thought,

1782
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:50,797
I don't have a chance
in the world with this woman,

1783
01:25:50,971 --> 01:25:53,409
but I sure know
what kinda coffee she needs.

1784
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,498
And so the sumatran sling

1785
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:58,370
and a special friendship
was born...

1786
01:25:58,544 --> 01:26:00,459
And I just wanna say

1787
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:03,549
that I've really missed
that friendship.

1788
01:26:03,723 --> 01:26:07,510
So Sarah fischer,
take yourself a bow.

1789
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:20,653
- It's so exciting.
- Congratulations.

1790
01:26:20,827 --> 01:26:23,265
- See ya.

1791
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:25,615
- Wow!
- Ha ha ha ha.

1792
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:28,444
- Look at you.

1793
01:26:28,618 --> 01:26:30,272
Well...

1794
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:32,709
You should congratulate me.

1795
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:36,278
- Wait. Aren't you
supposed to congratulate me?

1796
01:26:36,452 --> 01:26:38,671
- I-I called off
my wedding.

1797
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:40,456
- No way.

1798
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,806
- Yes way.

1799
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,461
- Well, uh...
What happened?

1800
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,637
Dr. Perfect
wasn't so perfect after all?

1801
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:51,641
- No, actually, um...
He's pretty perfect.

1802
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:55,340
I just realized that, uh,
what I wanted was,

1803
01:26:55,514 --> 01:26:58,300
um...someone...

1804
01:26:58,474 --> 01:26:59,344
Imperfect.

1805
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:03,392
- Is that so?

1806
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:08,353
- So I was wondering
if, uh...

1807
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:10,355
You knew anyone imperfect

1808
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:12,836
that you could
introduce me to.

1809
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,665
- Mm. Well, what about
your list?

1810
01:27:15,839 --> 01:27:17,797
- It's on the list.
It's just...It's...

1811
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:20,583
A lot shorter.

1812
01:27:20,757 --> 01:27:22,585
You wanna hear it?
- I don't know, do I?

1813
01:27:22,759 --> 01:27:27,242
- It says...
Must love the guy more than...

1814
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:28,417
Anything in the world.

1815
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:32,377
- That's it?
- That's it.

1816
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:33,944
- What about the guy
loving you

1817
01:27:34,118 --> 01:27:37,556
more than anything else
in the world too?

1818
01:27:57,881 --> 01:28:00,884
