1
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,540
What is it?

2
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,140
- I want to see Mr. Barnier.
- Do you have an appointment?

3
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,210
No, but I have something 
very important to tell him.

4
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,740
At 8h in the morning,
Monsieur is not awake.

5
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,580
This is very urgent.

6
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,210
Alright, but I'll never 
finish my cleaning

7
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,740
Coming!

8
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,020
Mr. went to bed late and is not 
to be disturbed before 11 h.

9
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,490
I have great news he 
will like to hear.

10
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,100
- But...
- I take full responsibility.

11
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,490
Tell him Christian Martin 
is here to see him.

12
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,620
What is it?

13
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,140
- It's Mr. Martin.
- Who?

14
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,420
Mr. Christian Martin.

15
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,020
What does he want?

16
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,490
He has something very
important to tell you.

17
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,620
Alright, I'll tell him

18
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,050
Tell me

19
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,500
Does Mr. Barnier
have breakfast?

20
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,660
- Yes of course.
- Bring another cup.

21
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,130
No, no, no...

22
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,180
- Very well.
- Tell me.

23
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,490
Very well.

24
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,500
How will you let 
me know?

25
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,620
- Do you have a buzzer?
- No we don't.

26
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,740
With the tray I'll 
bring a bell.

27
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,780
But tell me...

28
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,660
That's Mr. Barnier.

29
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,820
What happened? 
Is it a catastrophe?

30
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,020
No, monsieur!

31
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,780
So why do you intrude at 8
in the morning in my home?

32
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,780
- A reason of major importance.
- That could not...

33
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,250
- ...wait until afternoon?
- No.

34
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,490
Come with me.

35
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,060
Alright,
I'm listening.

36
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,530
Mr. Barnier, I know you 
are a kind-hearted man.

37
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,900
You are like a father for
your employees, so...

38
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,220
Listen, hurry up and come 
to the point, please.

39
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,980
- ...what's wrong?
- Everything is fine.

40
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,860
Then, what are you 
doing here?

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,780
I came to ask for 
a raise.

42
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,940
Tell me, are you 
making fun of me?

43
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,620
I wouldn't dare.

44
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,460
So you have the nerve to 
wake me at 8 in the...

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,660
- ...morning for that?
- If you knew...

46
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
I don't want to know.

47
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,450
My life depends on it.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,200
If everyone came here to tell
the story of his life!

49
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,100
I should fire you!

50
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,100
I would like to explain 
the reasons...

51
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,250
You will explain at 
the office!

52
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,060
So your answer is...

53
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,980
...unfavourable?

54
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,130
Dear young man...

55
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,140
...something is not alright
with you this morning.

56
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,090
I advise you to leave right now 
and prepare your apology...

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,220
...for this afternoon.

58
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,570
- The breakfast!
- But that's not bad.

59
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,250
2 cups?

60
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,340
That young man said he'd 
have breakfast with you.

61
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
- What young man?
- That young man

62
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
I didn't expect our talk 
to be so brief...

63
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,300
Are you crazy?

64
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,020
I'm in love.

65
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,300
So what?

66
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,850
I'll ask for her hand 
this morning.

67
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
I'm not interested in 
your love-life.

68
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,380
Love-life is often 
linked to finances.

69
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,740
Oh, yes!

70
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,660
Could you please...

71
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,380
...return to the... Ouch!

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,740
And so?

73
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,340
I cannot propose to 
her, if I cannot...

74
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,060
...provide for her 
in the fashion...

75
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,610
...her parents provided 
for her in the past.

76
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,420
Let's finish this.
How much do you earn...

77
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,580
3000 F per month 
plus bonuses.

78
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,450
And how much would you like?

79
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,220
6000 F per month.

80
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,740
Arm up.

81
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,100
I can leave you some minutes
to think about it.

82
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,460
I have thought it over.

83
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,610
Try to understand me.

84
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,860
I understand your surprise.

85
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,340
Mr. Barnier, I started 
working for you...

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,210
... 2 years ago for a salary 
of 500 F per month.

87
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,420
This is the limit!

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,780
Some sugar, please.

89
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,980
Thanks.

90
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,340
2!

91
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,100
Thanks.

92
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,300
By asking 6000 you waste your
time and make me waste mine.

93
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,100
Your company is one of the most...

94
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,330
...profitable in europe.

95
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,620
Thanks to you?

96
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,420
Partially.

97
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,860
So you think you're
indispensable?

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
No one is indispensable,

99
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,660
but first I would like to 
talk to you about love.

100
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,970
- To me?
- Oh, monsieur!

101
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,140
As I said, I am going to ask for 
the permission to get married.

102
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,210
- So what?
- I am not addressing...

103
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,140
...a businessman, but a man 
with a great heart.

104
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,340
Let's not overdo it...

105
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,810
I know you.

106
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,580
My good heart will not give 
you 6000 F par month!

107
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,810
Life is tough for a 
young couple...

108
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,420
...I talked about that 
yesterday with...

109
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,780
- ...Mr. Muller.
- Mr. Muller?

110
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,380
You know him?

111
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,330
He was a bit worried
about having us...

112
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,540
- ...as competitors.
- So that's it!

113
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,060
He asked me how much I earned, 
very understanding...

114
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,900
I know his methods.

115
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,940
He doesn't scare me, 
tell him that!

116
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,490
Barnier, trembling
because of Muller!

117
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,810
- To the contrary!
- Of course!

118
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,180
One day I will squish him.

119
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,860
- Soon.
- Very soon!

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,620
Just imagine when he finds
out about my raise.

121
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,460
I'm laughing already.

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,970
I'll call him right now.

123
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,420
To do what?

124
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,220
To tell him about my raise...

125
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,980
Wait.

126
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,740
Let's think about it.

127
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,540
Let's not rush into anything.

128
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,420
Tell me about your fiancée.

129
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,650
She is lovely.

130
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,130
Her parents?

131
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,140
Oh! Charming people!

132
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,690
- Well situated?
- Very well.

133
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,140
That's why 3000 F per month
won't be enough for her.

134
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,340
Yes.

135
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,300
Well, listen, oh... 
let's say...

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,260
5500 and not another word.

137
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,780
That's more than...

138
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,220
- ...I would have thought.
- If I had known that.

139
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,610
So I will stay with you.

140
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,170
That's very nice of you.

141
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,330
Since you promised me 
5500 F per month.

142
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,220
- Now that I have said it.
- I'll talk to her father...

143
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,060
I keep my promises, 
so go on!

144
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,260
Thanks.

145
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,620
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

146
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,930
I ask you for the hand of 
your daughter.

147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,250
What!?

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,570
Yes, monsieur.

149
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,460
No?

150
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,180
Yes!

151
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,860
Oh!

152
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,700
Those flowers are 
for Mrs. Barnier.

153
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,380
Put that away...

154
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,980
...you! Come!

155
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,180
Go on!

156
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,460
Move, fast!

157
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,930
Sit down, there!

158
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,010
Bernadette, out.

159
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,930
Very well...

160
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,610
How...

161
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,260
...come...

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
Get out now!

163
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,900
How come you know 
my daughter?

164
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,610
We met 1 1/2 years ago quite 
by chance at the racing club.

165
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,180
I didn't know it was her...

166
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,520
...so when I found out,
I didn't tell her it was me.

167
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,410
- Come again?
- I didn't dare to tell her...

168
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,620
...that I earned only 1000 F
working for her father.

169
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,900
Now that's something!

170
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,050
You can say that again!

171
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,860
You're a charming young man...

172
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,540
...but I had hoped for a more 
advantageous marriage for my daughter.

173
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
So why don't you make me...

174
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,690
...sales manager?

175
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,700
Neither that title nor your 
salary of 5500 F per month...

176
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,330
...will give her the lifestyle
she is used to.

177
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,460
I have heard you were going to
give her a dowry...

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,330
...of 40 millions?

179
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,330
Who told you that?

180
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,730
She did.

181
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,300
1, that's absolutely false.

182
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,820
2, I find that a very 
peculiar mentality.

183
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,530
You want to marry my daughter 
just to make some money!

184
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,010
I want to marry her not because 
of money but because I love her.

185
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,300
If she got a large dowry,
that wouldn't be a...

186
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,180
...reason to break up.

187
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,260
I find your reasoning odd...

188
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,420
...and particularly obnoxious.

189
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,290
To prove the purity of my 
financial intentions...

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,140
...I will present her with my 
whole fortune.

191
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,130
- Your fortune!
- 64723000 F.

192
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,620
What?

193
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,420
I said: 64723000 F...

194
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,460
or 647230 F...

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,170
- ...if you prefer new Francs.
- You?

196
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,540
Me.

197
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,930
You inherited it?

198
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,140
No.

199
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,220
I stole it...

200
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,290
- ...from you.
- What?

201
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,930
I said:
I stole it from you!

202
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,780
- Me?
- You!

203
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,170
- That's not possible.
- Yes, I assure you.

204
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,290
That not possible!!!

205
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,690
I will explain.

206
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,490
You must be joking!

207
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,020
I wouldn't dare.

208
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,220
Monsieur?

209
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,420
Bring 2 aspirines for Monsieur.

210
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,180
- He doesn't feel well?
- Hurry!

211
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,460
Who would have believed it?

212
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,780
Noone, so I thaught 
it would surprise you.

213
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,220
So you are giving yourself up?

214
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,500
Why should I?

215
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,300
I'm calling the police.

216
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,860
But what for?

217
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,540
To have you thrown in prison!

218
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,420
If all you're saying is true... 
I can't believe it.

219
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,730
Your aspirine, Mr. Barnier.

220
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,020
- Leave me alone!
- I insist.

221
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,900
Are you going to make fun 
of me for much longer!

222
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,380
Be ready to bring it back 
in a moment.

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,100
I still have some news...

224
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,940
...to announce to Mr. Barnier.

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,130
64723000 F!

226
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,020
- What will you do?
- I'm going to call the police.

227
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,050
Think about it...

228
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,500
...I didn't try to run away.

229
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,420
A gentlemen's agreement might 
be preferable for you.

230
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,050
An arrangement with a thief!

231
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,370
Your company declared...

232
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,060
...a profit of 31228000 F.

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,220
And you know that I 
concealed 47 millions...

234
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,180
...which the tax authorities 
never heard of.

235
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,700
How do you explain that theft...

236
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,700
...when nothing is missing...

237
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,620
- ...in your accounting?
- What?

238
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,250
And that's so bad.

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,140
Your financial situation 
is fantastic.

240
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,580
They will check your accounting.

241
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,300
The police will ask...

242
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,930
...you all sorts of questions.
How will you answer?

243
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,060
How did you steal...

244
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,660
...64723000 F without putting 
your hand in the till?

245
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,620
With the doorknobs.

246
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,380
What do you want?

247
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,380
- The bell.
- Put it over there!

248
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,140
Where was I?
You said...

249
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,340
What did you say?

250
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,650
I don't remember.

251
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,940
That's great!

252
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,820
Oh yes! The doorknobs 
helped me.

253
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,340
Oh, That's it!

254
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,650
Do you know how many 
doorknobs we sold at our...

255
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,700
...last construction project?

256
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,010
64723000 doorknobs.

257
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,170
So what?

258
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,700
After a thorough survey of 
the manufacturing problems...

259
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,540
...I got a reduction of 
1 F per doorknob.

260
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,530
So what!

261
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,220
A typing error in the contract 
and the reduction was not 1 F but 2.

262
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,420
I wanted to tell you, but you 
had left already.

263
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,340
- I had to leave for the subway.
- What did you want there?

264
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,100
I met your daughter there.

265
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,900
- So?
- I realized that this error would...

266
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,900
...save our happiness if I could 
manage to keep it secret.

267
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,220
Even more business not 
recorded in the accounting!

268
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,010
Shh!

269
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,570
The telephone.

270
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,490
That explains the number 
of 64723000 F...

271
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,500
...I told you earlier.

272
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,820
- That you put in your pocket.
- That's too small.

273
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,940
You're not funny!

274
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,900
I acted out of love for 
your daughter...

275
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,940
...to whom I will return,
if she marries me...

276
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,140
...the entire sum.

277
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,780
With her dowry of 40 millions, 
you see...

278
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,540
...a couple that starts off
with a 100 millions.

279
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,060
And as parents worry about...

280
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,120
...the future of their children,
you will have nothing...

281
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,140
...to worry about.

282
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,330
That is all somehow logical, but 
you are still going pretty far!

283
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,890
Does my daughter know about 
all this?

284
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,370
Of course not!

285
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,900
I have to lie to her...
She thinks I'm a vice-president.

286
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,780
Did you know I'm rather shy?

287
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,060
No, I didn't notice.

288
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,100
Does she, uh...

289
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,420
Does she love you?

290
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,540
I think so.

291
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,980
I can even say I'm sure of it.

292
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,660
She has given me proof

293
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,620
What proof?

294
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,450
What are you still doing 
with that bell?

295
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,770
I'm calling for the aspirin.

296
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,330
You and your aspirin!

297
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,540
I hate to conceal things.

298
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,460
You have proven that.

299
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,340
Can we talk about it 
man to man?

300
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,460
Yes.

301
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,960
I am your daughter's lover.

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,580
What?

303
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,850
Monsieur?

304
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,980
Get out!

305
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,100
Very well.

306
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,980
Not you.

307
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,370
Me!

308
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,660
Or better not!

309
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,420
You stay! And you leave!

310
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,780
Sorry, I didn't understand.

311
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,980
Who leaves and who stays?

312
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,100
Think about it in the kitchen.

313
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,460
Very well.

314
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,370
So?

315
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,330
Well.

316
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,210
So my daughter has a lover.

317
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,500
For how long?

318
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,940
About 1 and 1/2 years.

319
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,900
You didn't lose any time!

320
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,050
What?

321
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,340
Since you have known her for 
1 1/2 years and have been...

322
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,780
...her lover for 1 1/2 years,
you didn't lose any time.

323
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,980
I have known her for 1 year,
6 months and 4 days.

324
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,210
I have been her lover for...

325
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,340
...1 year, 5 months and 22 days.

326
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,940
It was a rainy sunday.

327
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,220
That explains all.

328
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,820
But you haven't lost any time.

329
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,580
I hope you decided to get 
married immediately?

330
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,180
No, we immediately decided 
to get married.

331
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,380
Do you see the difference?

332
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,420
Oh!

333
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,810
Leave me in peace!

334
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,940
Why has she never told me?

335
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,540
- She was afraid of you.
- My daughter afraid of me?

336
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,700
That's something!

337
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,540
She will explain right away!

338
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,410
I promised your daughter 
to say nothing.

339
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,220
I have to clear up this
matter immediately!

340
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,260
Bring it up carefully.

341
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,330
That way she can confess to you.

342
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,540
Do it right away.

343
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,700
I will return in 1/4 h
to embrace Mrs Barnier.

344
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,770
Why do you want to 
embrace my wife?

345
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,300
It's normal to embrace my 
mother in law.

346
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,540
First I have to talk to 
my daughter.

347
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,740
Thank you, monsieur.

348
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,500
Mr. Barnier, let me call 
you Bertrand.

349
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,110
Oh no!
Oh no!

350
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,020
Another catastrophe?

351
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,060
This time, it's for me.

352
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,210
I've got a headache 
from all this.

353
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,100
Well, see you later.
Goodbye, Bertrand.

354
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,420
He calls you Bertrand?

355
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,050
Handle him with care.

356
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,060
Goodbye, Bertrand.

357
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,180
Colette!

358
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,900
Yes, daddy.

359
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,860
What is it, my duck?

360
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,730
Don't call me animal names!

361
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,740
But that's nice, a duck.

362
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,540
You don't call your father that!

363
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,660
You're old-fashioned, daddy.

364
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,180
And you, you are a bit too modern!

365
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,380
I've just heard everything 
about it.

366
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,980
What have you heard?

367
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,420
Everything!

368
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,460
About what?

369
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,060
Don't play innocent!

370
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,340
And I demand some explanations!

371
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,730
About what?

372
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,970
About your lover!

373
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,820
About your mother.

374
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,540
About your lover, now talk!

375
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,380
He came to ask for your hand.

376
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,970
He came to...
ask for my hand?

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,290
He left just now.

378
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,260
This time I mean it. 
I haven't heard from him...

379
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,540
...in 2 weeks. I thaught he 
had abandoned me.

380
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,380
That's all we would have needed!

381
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,850
Mum was just going to tell you.

382
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,140
- She knows what's going on?
- Yes.

383
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,380
So I'm the last one to be 
informed what's going on!

384
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,380
So you agree?

385
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,100
Agree to what?

386
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,180
- That we get married.
- We're not so far yet.

387
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,810
Until you prove the contrary, 
you are not married yet.

388
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,460
If you continue 
with that noise...

389
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,500
...I'll put you in boarding 
school in a convent!

390
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,730
Until you are of full age!

391
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,900
And where?
In the Auvergne!

392
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,650
Miss!

393
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,370
He doesn't want me 
to get married.

394
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,770
I'm fed up with it.

395
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,780
I want to live freely.
Here, I waste...

396
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,850
...my youth.

397
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,330
I heard a story of girl who 
made her parents believe... 

398
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,700
...she was pregnant in order
to get their consent.

399
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,540
My father would have 
a heart-attack!

400
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes, but once the attack is 
over he would have to accept.

401
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,140
It would be too late 
to change anything.

402
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,700
I'd never dare.

403
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,890
Still continuing that?

404
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,660
I have to talk to you.

405
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,580
Later.

406
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,050
I'm listening.

407
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,530
It will surprise you.

408
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,580
I've been surprised 
all morning long...

409
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,260
Dad.

410
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,920
We will call him Blaise.

411
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,900
Who?

412
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,180
His child.

413
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,940
Whose child?

414
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,090
- Ours
- Yours?

415
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,300
Our own child!

416
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,180
Don't you understand...

417
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,730
No.

418
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,780
That's not possible!

419
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,180
No! That's not possible!

420
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,250
I didn't understand!

421
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,300
That's all too much 
for the morning!

422
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,220
Tell me that's not true!

423
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,460
You won't call him Blaise!

424
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,210
Monsieur?

425
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,290
Bring me 3 aspirin right away.

426
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,260
- Already prepared.
- Thanks.

427
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,050
Blaise!

428
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,420
You permit the marriage?

429
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,420
I've got to.

430
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,700
Thank you Dad!

431
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,660
I'll tell Mum the good news.

432
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
- It's ringing.
- Hmm.

433
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,100
- It's ringing!

434
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,300
One second, I'll get it.

435
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,900
Oh, sorry!

436
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,020
Mr. Barnier, please.

437
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,780
A young lady to see you, Monsieur.

438
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,090
I don't have time!

439
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,300
I'll tell her.

440
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,370
- She's not there any more.
- She is here.

441
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,530
- She was there.
- Not now.

442
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,900
Miss?

443
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,100
- Mr. Barnier?
- Until further notice.

444
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,100
I am in a desperate situation.

445
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,540
Me too, if that cheers you up!

446
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,690
I'm in love with...

447
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,010
...a certain Christian Martin.

448
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,490
That is a problem.

449
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,020
Why?

450
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,090
Because he just asked me if 
he could marry my daughter.

451
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,410
That's terrible!

452
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,700
I understand, but you 
are still young...

453
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,700
I must confess something: 
I lied to Christian.

454
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,720
- I told him I was your daughter.
- But that's not so bad.

455
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,220
He believes you are my father!

456
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,930
Of course, if you 
told him that!

457
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,660
Don't you understand?

458
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,540
No.

459
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,380
Oh, now I understand!

460
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,060
- About marrying your daughter...
- I have understood!

461
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,940
- He meant me.
- What a morning!

462
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,860
And my daughter expecting
a child!

463
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,740
Please don't tell Christian
the truth yet. Let me...

464
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,020
- ...do that myself.
- I bet!

465
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,020
Stand right there.

466
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,700
Now, why did you choose me
as your father?

467
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I'm not rich. My mother works for 
her living and Christian has...

468
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,330
- ...a very good position.
- I know.

469
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,380
- My name is Bouillotte.
- Oh, go on!

470
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,010
When I saw an advertising
sign for "Barnier"...

471
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,380
...I told him:
my name is Jacqueline Barnier.

472
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,280
When he asked if I was 
the building contractor's...

473
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,690
...daughter, I said yes.

474
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,380
- What did he answer?
- "That's funny"

475
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,950
In fact, irresistible!

476
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,180
I would like to tell him 
the truth myself.

477
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,060
If he finds out you are not
my daughter...

478
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,610
...I lose my 60 million!

479
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,580
What are you saying?

480
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,940
I don't mind at all 
to tell him...

481
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,020
...nothing if you agree 
to stay here until I have...

482
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,490
...had the time to clear 
some matters with him.

483
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,810
Anything you want.

484
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,900
You better hide in there!

485
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,340
Stay there until I come 
back to get you.

486
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,540
- You won't tell him anything? 
- Promised if you don't move.

487
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,010
- Thank you! 
- I'll be right back.

488
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,820
And now, I would really 
like to know what pig...

489
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,340
...made my daughter pregnant!

490
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,180
Germaine!

491
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,530
Germaine!

492
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,940
Who is calling?

493
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,500
Me, your husband.

494
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,860
Ah, good.

495
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,620
I need to talk to you.

496
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,820
Yes?

497
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,260
- Your daughter has a lover.
- Me too.

498
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,220
- What?
- I have to talk to you as well.

499
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,610
I'm listening.

500
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,520
Your daughter has a lover.

501
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,700
- I just told you that.
- I already knew it.

502
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,370
And you also know that she is
going to have a child?

503
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,610
Of course.

504
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,260
Now that's great!

505
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,820
It's the destiny of all women!

506
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,780
Good, you're broad-minded!

507
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,140
Hey!

508
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,620
Don't hide!

509
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,090
I've seen you.

510
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,460
Come out of there!

511
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,850
Who is it?

512
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,620
Who is it?

513
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,300
You know him, he came to 
ask you for my hand.

514
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,900
I want you to pronounce 
his name.

515
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,580
To hear the music...
Who is it?

516
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,300
It's Oscar.

517
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,490
Oscar?

518
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,660
Who's that, Oscar?

519
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,130
Now you're losing your memory,
he's your driver!

520
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,340
You are expecting...

521
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,570
...a child from my driver!

522
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,420
Would you prefer her to have
several lovers.

523
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,210
Good god, what have I done 
to deserve a fate like this?

524
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,660
I don't see what is so bad.

525
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,740
Our daughter is going to 
marry a decent boy.

526
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,660
Invite him for lunch 
immediately.

527
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,700
How can I invite him? 
I fired him 2 weeks ago!

528
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,730
There, there my little girl...

529
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,290
...your daddy will fix
everything.

530
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,900
My daughter, dishonoured 
by my driver!

531
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,100
I rather see her seduced 
by an attractive driver...

532
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,220
than that Baron de la Butinière
you wanted her to marry.

533
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,780
That pimpleface.

534
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,660
My darling, go and cry 
in your room.

535
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,820
And close your window because 
of the neighbours.

536
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,210
Mrs. Barnier, allow me 
to call you Mum!

537
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,820
Why did he call me Mum?

538
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,660
What are you saying?

539
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,500
Why did he call me "Mum"?

540
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,020
Why Mum, huh?

541
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,650
- Doesn't she know?
- Know what?

542
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,250
The proposal.

543
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,100
What is all this about?

544
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,780
Didn't he tell you I just asked 
for your daughter's hand?

545
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
- Colette?
- No.

546
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,820
- The other one.
- Which other one?

547
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,380
- The younger one!
- What?

548
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,260
- The younger one!
- Are you going crazy?

549
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,540
Go to your room, I have to...

550
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,100
...talk to this young man.

551
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,170
Yes, I think you are both not...

552
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,180
...completely OK this morning.

553
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,980
I didn't know you had...

554
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,420
- ...2 daughters.
- Neither did I.

555
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,940
- What?
- My wife is excited.

556
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,540
She doesn't know what 
she is saying.

557
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,060
Let's talk about serious 
things again.

558
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,450
In my office.

559
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,380
I don't want to talk any more
about how you got that money.

560
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,060
But if you should change 
your mind, I would like...

561
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,690
...to have your guarantee
that you return...

562
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,540
...the money to my daughter.

563
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,170
- Are you doubting my word?
- Not at all!

564
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,260
If you could give me a cheque...

565
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,180
...it would be much 
easier for me...

566
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,820
...to convince my wife...

567
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,210
...who is not very happy 
about this marriage.

568
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,340
You can imagine I wouldn't 
put that money into a bank.

569
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,620
Where is it?

570
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,930
Converted to jewels.

571
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,250
Where are they?

572
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,020
In a suitcase in a 
safe place.

573
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,780
In a suitcase!

574
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,770
- I have an idea.
- That's not possible!

575
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,780
Yes! Sit down.

576
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,060
We will...

577
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,740
...surprise Colette.

578
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,820
No Jacqueline,
the younger one.

579
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,140
You will get those jewels and
give them to her...

580
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,980
...as an engagement present.

581
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,370
That way, her mother won't 
be able to refuse.

582
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,220
- You think so?
- I guarantee it!

583
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,060
I'm off!

584
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,420
No, no, wait, Christian!

585
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,580
Have you heard anything about Oscar?

586
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,420
- Your driver?
- Former driver.

587
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,940
- You don't know what happened?
- What?

588
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,740
A great disappointment in love!

589
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,580
That's not possible.

590
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,980
He wouldn't tell her name,

591
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,340
a charming girl, but her 
father was impossible.

592
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,620
You think so?

593
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,420
The poor boy.

594
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,060
Don't say he commited suicide!

595
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,850
Almost the same:
He left on a polar expedition.

596
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,660
That's terrible.

597
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,890
Gone for 6 years!

598
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,620
See you later.

599
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,900
I need to talk to you

600
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,740
- That's not the right moment.
- It's very urgent.

601
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,860
Come over here.

602
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,300
I'm listening.

603
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,980
I wanted to tell you I cannot 
stay in your service any longer.

604
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,180
Now that's just what I had 
been waiting for.

605
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,410
- Why are you leaving?
- I'm getting married.

606
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,490
You're lucky.

607
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,780
To whom?

608
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,780
- You know him well.
- I do?

609
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,060
- He came here very often.
- Who is it?

610
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,130
Honoré de la Butinière.

611
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,180
That's not possible!

612
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,220
Pimpleface?

613
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,580
He doesn't have 
pimples any more.

614
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,020
How do you explain that?

615
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,540
If you don't understand.

616
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,660
No, I don't get it.

617
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,900
Bernadette!

618
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,260
Please leave this 
house immediately!

619
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,680
I don't like that kind of joke.

620
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,580
Pack your bags immediately.

621
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,780
Get out of my sight!

622
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,930
Very well.

623
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,420
Germaine!

624
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,100
What is it?

625
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,100
- Do you know the news?
- No.

626
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,650
Honoré de la Butinière does 
not have pimples any more.

627
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,420
Why do you tell me that?

628
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,530
You know why?

629
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,820
No.
Ask the maid.

630
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,090
Bertrand.

631
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,810
Everytime I see you I wonder 
if you're still normal?

632
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,860
Anyway, I fired her.

633
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,410
- Now that's intelligent!
- Thanks.

634
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,940
- There's something worse.
- What?

635
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,060
- Oscar is gone.
- Where?

636
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,940
Some expedition to the 
Arctic or the Antarctic.

637
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,060
- Gone for 6 years!
- Look what you have done!

638
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,980
And that's my fault!

639
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,050
Of course. Find her 
another husband.

640
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,210
How, in my condition...

641
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,740
You told me...

642
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,370
...a young man
came to ask for...

643
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,820
...Colette's hand?

644
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,130
- Yes.
- Who is it?

645
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,500
- Martin.
- Your Martin?

646
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,650
Everything's arranged then.

647
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,460
No, he is already engaged.

648
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,780
Is he engaged or did he ask 
for your daughter's hand?

649
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,090
He didn't know it was her.

650
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,260
Explain to me in an clear and
intelligible fashion.

651
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,020
Some things can't be explained.

652
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,100
That young man who was 
here earlier...

653
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,860
...what was his name?

654
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,930
- Martin.
- Him too?

655
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,500
But that's the same one.

656
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,540
Now I see why he called me Mum.

657
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,540
- It's all clear to me now.
- Good luck.

658
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,540
Keep away from the suitcases!

659
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,540
- I'm happy to see you again. 
- Yes, yes.

660
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,170
- Are the jewels in there? 
- Yes, yes.

661
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,940
No!

662
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,940
Let's close it,
that's safer.

663
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,340
Dear Christian, we will 
call him Blaise.

664
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,380
Who?

665
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,530
Our little child.

666
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,980
What child?

667
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,180
Your child!
Don't you understand?

668
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,490
- No!
- Yes!

669
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,100
Why hasn't Jacqueline told 
me about it?

670
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,860
It's the latest news, she 
just told me this morning.

671
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,820
Mr. Barnier, allow me 
to embrace you.

672
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,300
There is one small thing 
that disturbs me.

673
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,180
What is it?

674
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't know how to explain it.

675
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,740
- Tell me.
- Oh well, alright.

676
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,420
Before you can get married...

677
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,500
...there will have to be a 
certain minimum delay.

678
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,700
Yes.

679
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,740
No one is safe from accidents.
When you leave here, you...

680
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,580
- ...could be run over.
- You, too.

681
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,620
Not me.

682
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,700
I lost a cousin like that,
it was terrible!

683
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,250
What would become of my daughter 
if that happened to you?

684
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,970
And what would become of 
my grand-son?

685
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,460
My little baby wouldn't even 
be able to call himself Martin.

686
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm asking myself 
what we could do.

687
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,900
I will see a notary.

688
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,290
Let's not disturb a notary 
for such a small thing!

689
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,420
You write me a little 
piece of paper...

690
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,260
...I'm sure that will be enough.

691
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,220
If ever something bad 
should happen to you.

692
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,450
I understand, I will write 
something for you.

693
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,980
Let's do it right away and 
not think about it any more.

694
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,970
Here...

695
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,180
...something to write.

696
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,820
Why that face?

697
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,100
You don't seem to 
fully trust me.

698
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,380
Who? Me?

699
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,300
Yes, those papers,
those jewels...

700
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,740
Will I get them back after 
I've married your daughter?

701
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,140
If you're worried about that,
I am willing to sign...

702
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,100
...an agreement myself.

703
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,250
You get the good chair.

704
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,980
- That, over here!
- No, over here.

705
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,580
It's better here.

706
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,500
Here, fine.

707
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,300
Now write!

708
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,460
We write at the same time.

709
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,820
Yes... Oh, ooooh!

710
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,500
Wait.

711
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,700
Let's see.

712
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,700
So, you write!

713
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,090
"I, the undersigned
Christian...

714
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,780
...Barnier...
...acknowledge...

715
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,380
...that I am the father...

716
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,340
...of 64 millions...

717
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,500
...awaited by
Miss Barnier."

718
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,810
Now sign it.

719
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,140
- You sign yours, too.
- Well, sign yours!

720
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,060
- Perfect.
- You give me yours.

721
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,500
- Who?
- Give me yours!

722
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,820
Now let's proceed to more...

723
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,060
- ...amusing matters.
- Oh yes?

724
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Let's surprise my daughter!

725
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,420
My dear Christian!

726
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,890
Wait for me here,
I will talk to my daughter.

727
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,420
- You haven't told her anything?
- Not yet.

728
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,780
You will see her face when 
she hears about the news!

729
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,460
That will be fun!

730
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,940
Miss.

731
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,170
Christian has just arrived.

732
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,300
Better tell him the 
truth yourself.

733
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,690
When everything is cleared up,
thank him on my behalf...

734
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,930
...for returning my suitcase.

735
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,010
- What suitcase?
- He will understand.

736
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,700
I will get him.

737
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,610
Christian!

738
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,700
I think you won't 
love me anymore.

739
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
That's impossible.

740
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,140
- I have to tell you the truth.
- I have a confession, too.

741
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,020
- Me first!
- No, me!

742
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,260
- Mine will surprise you much more.
- I don't think so.

743
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,860
Well here we go.

744
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,060
I have been working for...

745
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,780
...father for 2 years!

746
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,220
I am not his daughter.

747
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,890
Don't you understand?

748
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,820
Mr. Barnier is not my father.

749
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,900
That doesn't matter to me.
Does he know?

750
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,100
Of course!

751
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,980
That's just great.
What does he say about that?

752
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,450
He asked me to thank you for
returning his suitcase.

753
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,740
Wait, what exactly 
did he tell you?

754
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
When we met, you told me 
about your good position...

755
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,250
Yes.

756
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,260
I didn't dare to tell you 
I was just a typist...

757
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,260
when you asked about 
my family name...

758
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,860
You are not Barnier's daughter?

759
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,060
That's what I was trying 
to tell you!

760
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,900
- He wants to keep the suitcase?
- Yes.

761
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,180
That's abominable.
He has tricked me!

762
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,580
Is that all the love 
you have for me!

763
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,250
Jacqueline!

764
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,340
Jacqueline!

765
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,780
Don't look for them,
here they are!

766
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,420
You see what you have done.
Are you happy now?

767
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,540
I'm very happy, thank you.

768
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,690
You knew Jacqueline was 
not your daughter?

769
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,460
What a stupid question.

770
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,020
You are very clever.

771
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,730
- Not as clever as you.
- Of course not, but still.

772
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,740
You know I keep my word.

773
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,420
I promised you to give 
these to my daughter.

774
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,890
- If you keep your promise.
- Which is?

775
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,370
- To marry my daughter.
- The real one?

776
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,660
- Why should I marry her?
- You asked for her hand.

777
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,780
- I didn't know who she was!
- Your mistake.

778
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,980
So it's a package:
the girl and the suitcase.

779
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,370
With a small bonus
as encouragement.

780
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,780
No, thanks. Keep everything.

781
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,490
Son, you forget that 
you signed me a paper.

782
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,940
You are the father of my
daughter's child.

783
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,820
She awaits a child?

784
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,500
Those things happen.

785
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,890
So why doesn't she marry 
the real father?

786
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,850
- He has disappeared.
- So you chose me as father.

787
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,300
You are a scoundrel, Mr. Barnier!

788
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,450
Yes.

789
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,610
I thought we would 
understand each other.

790
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,140
I still have to introduce you.

791
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,370
Colette! Germaine!

792
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,250
You called me, daddy?

793
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,620
Look at her.

794
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,620
She is charming!

795
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,770
Colette, I'd like...

796
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,020
...you to meet 
Christian Martin...

797
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,380
...your future husband.

798
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,580
How happy they are!

799
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,210
Have you explained the 
situation to Mr. Martin?

800
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,700
Yes, everything, and he 
is very cooperative.

801
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,460
Not as handsome as Oscar, 
but better than nothing.

802
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,420
When you open your mouth, 
only nonsense comes out.

803
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,810
So Oscar is responsible?

804
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,210
I'd say it's my husband 
who is really responsible.

805
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,290
Germaine!

806
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,930
Let's leave the two alone.

807
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,570
So they have time to get 
to know each other.

808
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,860
Get some fresh air in 
the park. It's lovely.

809
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,460
See you later...

810
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,850
...my dear Christian.

811
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,100
Listen, Bertrand.

812
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,250
One more word, just one, 
and you can take care...

813
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,940
...of this all by yourself and
she marries the first best man.

814
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,500
Listen, Bertrand.

815
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,420
You are awaiting a 
child from Oscar.

816
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,850
And you want me to become...

817
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,090
...the father?

818
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,020
Alright, my situation forces 
me to give in...

819
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,410
...but I warn you...

820
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,570
...we won't see each 
other very often.

821
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,780
Great!

822
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,570
I'll marry so that I can do 
what I want, to be a free woman.

823
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,540
You just want to be married, 
no matter with who?

824
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,340
I prefer a handsome guy.

825
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,340
Good! I'm out of the running, then.

826
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,260
Why? You're not that bad.

827
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,100
I have understood,
I won't get away.

828
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,410
Miss, see you at the wedding.

829
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,620
Funny, I was going to ring
but the door opens before.

830
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,860
- Philippe Dubois.
- Sorry?

831
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,730
- I'm Mr. Barnier's masseur.
- Christian Martin.

832
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,180
Sorry, you wouldn't be a 
champion of some sort?

833
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,500
3 times Apollon, the most handsome 
athlete's body in France.

834
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,180
All the women must adore you.

835
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,650
You are not married, I suppose?

836
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,020
- Oh no.
- Good. Nice to meet you!

837
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,490
- Did you fall down?
- I hit on something very interesting.

838
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,660
- What do you think?
- That's dad's masseur.

839
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,970
Good, come.

840
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,940
If I was a woman and had to
chose between him and me...

841
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,740
- ...I wouldn't hesitate.
- He is not bad.

842
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,740
He looks so intelligent!

843
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,970
Oh yes!

844
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,860
Why don't you marry him 
instead of me?

845
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,780
- Nobody asked me what I want. 
- Go.

846
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,770
Ah! Miss Colette!

847
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,300
Don't mind us, we are not here.

848
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,500
But sure, you are here.

849
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,500
Don't mind us, we...

850
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,570
- ...are not here!
- OK.

851
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,780
Yes, they are still there.

852
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,410
That's your chance, use it.
Alright?

853
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,810
Oh... yes!

854
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,380
I'll tell your father.
Charles!

855
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,660
Sir?

856
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,260
Charles! Mr. Barnier?

857
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,870
So you agree?

858
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,220
I discovered how your daughter...

859
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,290
- ...feels deep in her heart.
- Bravo, congratulations!

860
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,530
Colette... You allow 
me to call her Colette?

861
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,460
Of course, my son.

862
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,260
- She is madly in love.
- Perfect!

863
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,650
- With your masseur.
- What?

864
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,890
- Philippe Dubois.
- That idiot?

865
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,180
Colette must get married.

866
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,570
She would prefer
Mr. Idiot ah...

867
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,970
Mr. Dubois!

868
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,810
The suitcase!

869
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,100
The suitcase!

870
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,900
Colette!

871
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,500
Is it true what he told me...

872
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,700
...about the masseur?

873
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,980
He is up there!

874
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,740
I don't care, he doesn't 
understand anything!

875
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,980
So is it true?

876
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,130
Yes, daddy.

877
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,580
She finds I am 
not at all her type.

878
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,620
No, not at all.

879
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,660
If she prefers Mr. Dubois
or someone else...

880
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,260
That changes all my plans!

881
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,860
No. You give me my paper and
I let you keep the suitcase.

882
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,740
Keep calm. If it doesn't...

883
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,050
...work out with him,
I need you as a spare.

884
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,740
Come back later. If everything...

885
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,020
...is arranged, you get 
your paper back...

886
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,060
...and we can settle accounts
before we separate.

887
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,860
Since you let me go, I should 
first tell you about...

888
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,660
...all the export problems.

889
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,260
Things are rather bad.

890
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,330
Oh yes?

891
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,810
- It's not going well.
- No!

892
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,740
It could even become 
catastrophic.

893
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,280
We must absolutely come up
with a solution.

894
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,330
I may have been a little hasty.

895
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,330
Consider yourself 
still my employee.

896
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,650
Take care of those...

897
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,020
...export issues.

898
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,620
- Please sign some papers for that.
- Whenever you wish.

899
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,900
- Right now, over there, on the table.
- Yes.

900
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,820
Everything will be fine.

901
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,970
To open the frozen account...

902
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,500
- ...with the EFAC.
- Yes.

903
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,210
Tax excemptions for...

904
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,100
- ...imports with the SCUF.
- Yes.

905
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,300
- Customs declaration SMOF.
- Mmm.

906
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,100
And here you put:

907
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,700
- "Read and approved"
- Where?

908
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,820
- Here. Read and approved.
- And approved.

909
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,820
Now sign it.

910
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,850
Miss.

911
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,460
That boy is great. It's a 
shame you don't want him.

912
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,180
I prefer the other one!

913
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,300
Shut it!

914
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,980
I'll try to convince him.

915
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,530
- Hey, I'm here!
- Oh!

916
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,260
Hello, Mr. Barnier.

917
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,650
- How do you feel?
- Not bad.

918
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,500
How are your stomach muscles?

919
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,580
A little whisky?

920
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,260
Never any alcohol.

921
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,330
- A coffee?
- Never any coffee.

922
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,900
Some lemon juice?

923
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,780
I'd prefer a glass of milk.

924
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,900
We'll see about that.

925
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,340
Philippe, imagine I have...

926
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,970
...a serious problem.

927
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,980
Still the pain in your shoulder?

928
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,060
I will massage you.

929
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,010
Careful!

930
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,570
Still so sensitive?

931
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,860
My suitcase!

932
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh, my suitcase.

933
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,570
Is that alright?

934
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,460
That's fine.

935
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,410
What's that?

936
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,650
Excuse me, Sir.

937
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,780
- Still here!
- I was packing my suitcase.

938
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,220
Get out. I have seen 
enough of you!

939
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,500
I would like you to pay me
for the last month.

940
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,700
My back pocket.

941
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,490
Pass me the purse from my
back pocket!

942
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,780
How much do I owe you?

943
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,700
Today's the 15th, so half a
month has passed.

944
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,060
That means 350 F.

945
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,100
Keep the rest and for the 
reference, see Madame.

946
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,250
No need, I'll have 4 servants.

947
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,540
Your problems are far from over!

948
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,900
Once we are settled in 
our summer residence...

949
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,370
...I hope you visit us and 
spend the weekend.

950
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,660
You will always...

951
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,100
...be welcome.

952
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,860
Goodbye, dear friend.

953
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,420
Goodbye Mrs. Baroness.

954
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,250
Give my best regards...

955
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,020
...to Mrs. Barnier.

956
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,980
There we are, we have 
seen everything!

957
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,740
I would like to...

958
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,180
...talk to you about 
my daughter.

959
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,620
Doesn't she feel well?

960
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,180
Yes, very good.

961
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,140
She would like to...
get married.

962
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,010
- Who with?
- With you.

963
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,860
- That can't be true!
- Yes.

964
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,730
- With me?
- Yes!

965
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,530
You wouldn't happen...

966
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,460
...to like children?

967
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,060
It gives you nightmares?

968
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,900
That's great start!

969
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,290
So you don't like them?

970
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,820
Yes? No?

971
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,700
Now what, yes or no?

972
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,330
You wouldn't like to have some?

973
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,780
Now what?

974
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,180
You can't?
How's that?

975
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,580
You had mumps when you were 18!

976
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,580
Now what?

977
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,620
Well, that's true.

978
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,060
Don't you regret you can't 
become a father?

979
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,140
Maybe we will be able 
to arrange that.

980
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,660
What's up? Colette 
broke up with Mr. Martin?

981
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,020
Germaine!

982
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,980
For heaven's sake, 
keep out of this!

983
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,100
Let me handle this myself!

984
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,540
Hello, Mrs. Barnier!

985
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,010
What virility!

986
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,220
Bertrand?

987
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,690
Here! Come over here!

988
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,900
Oh, yes!

989
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,730
No, no, there!

990
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,050
Is he the young man...

991
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,780
...Colette wants to marry?

992
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,300
- Yes.
- He's not bad.

993
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,740
You haven't seen everything yet!

994
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,500
- Get undressed!
- Me?

995
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,180
Certainly not my wife!

996
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,570
Completely?

997
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,300
No, only the shirt.

998
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,100
Of course, he's not bad.

999
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,420
Turn around a little.

1000
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,450
Set the works in motion...

1001
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,900
...so we can see.

1002
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,210
Set in motion.

1003
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,980
- You're a masseur?
- Physical therapist.

1004
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,690
Even better.
And you want to marry...

1005
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,010
...my daughter?

1006
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,780
I will get some champagne
to celebrate.

1007
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,340
Oh, Bertrand!

1008
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,980
Did you explain the whole 
situation to him?

1009
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,500
I was about to, when you 
interrupted me!

1010
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,700
Don't tell him wild stories!

1011
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,860
Ha, ha!
Saint Philip!

1012
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,820
Saint Philip!

1013
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,580
Philippe.

1014
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,780
How do you like my daughter?

1015
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,090
Well...

1016
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,100
She should work on her
dorsal muscles.

1017
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,380
Are you prepared...

1018
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,220
- ...to help her with that?
- I would be happy to.

1019
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,820
Yes, but...

1020
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,700
I mean in a legal way.

1021
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,540
- Don't you understand?
- Not too well, Mr. Barnier.

1022
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,820
- In marriage!
- Oh!

1023
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,530
She will get a nice dowry...

1024
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,780
...that will certainly 
improve your situation.

1025
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,980
Oh really?

1026
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,450
Don't you have some project
you would like to carry out?

1027
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,170
A little project.
You must have one!

1028
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,620
I would like to open my 
own little gymnasium.

1029
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,700
You will be able to 
have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!

1030
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,620
You could even own...

1031
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,820
...a small stadium!
- No!

1032
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,820
A stadium! Enormous!

1033
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,450
Come, you see that over there?

1034
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,620
Look, look, look.

1035
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,260
In there is all...

1036
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,340
...you need for happiness!

1037
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,500
You don't believe me?
Open it, you will see.

1038
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,860
Open it.

1039
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,420
A stadium!

1040
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,180
A stadium. Open it.

1041
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,690
Open it!

1042
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,220
What's that?

1043
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,060
- That's a bra.
- The maid has taken...

1044
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,180
...my suitcase with her 
to the baron!

1045
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,220
- What baron?
- My daughter's former fiancé.

1046
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,060
- She is engaged to a baron?
- No, she preferred Oscar.

1047
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,780
Oscar, my former driver.

1048
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,940
>From whom she expects a baby,
and who left to the north pole.

1049
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,280
Another employee has stolen 
60 millions from me...

1050
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,020
...to marry my daughter,
who is not my daughter.

1051
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,530
And now the maid has left
with the jewels!

1052
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,640
So you see, why I wanted 
you to marry her!

1053
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,850
What's wrong with him?

1054
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,250
Bernadette!

1055
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,730
Oscar!

1056
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,420
Oscar!

1057
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,810
No, it's nothing!

1058
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,210
Go on!

1059
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,340
It's nothing, it's nothing.

1060
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,620
Oscar!

1061
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,060
Mr. Barnier!

1062
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,060
I'm so happy to see you again!

1063
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,610
- How are you?
- Fine, Mr. Barnier.

1064
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,460
Call me Bertrand.

1065
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,460
Tell us, what happend to you?

1066
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,010
- When Mr. fired me...
- But it was just a joke.

1067
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,220
Of course, just a joke!

1068
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,900
So you left to go to the...

1069
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,700
- ...north pole?
- Yes.

1070
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,170
When it was time to get 
on the ship, I couldn't.

1071
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,450
My Oscar!

1072
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,570
Aaah! Brute!

1073
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,460
How beautiful love is!

1074
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,700
You are not Oscar!

1075
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,330
- Where is Oscar?
- He has taken...

1076
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,940
...the maid's diamonds...

1077
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,980
...who has gone to the north pole...

1078
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,580
...because she is expecting a 
child in a suitcase.

1079
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,570
What are you saying?

1080
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,380
And here are your 60 millions!

1081
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,210
That physical therapist 
is a paranoid.

1082
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,380
Oh, Bernadette!

1083
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,690
Sorry. Mrs. Baroness.

1084
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,500
Miss!

1085
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,580
- What's wrong?
- Oscar has returned.

1086
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,450
- Then everything is fine!
- But he left again!

1087
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,780
- He will return!
- But then he will leave again.

1088
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,620
But he will come back.

1089
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,380
- Never give up hope.
- Look at me for example.

1090
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,010
Yes of course.
Thank you, Bernadette.

1091
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,260
I just came to return 
your father's suitcase.

1092
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,980
Yours is here.

1093
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,370
I couldn't open it, so 
I knew it wasn't mine.

1094
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,660
You're lucky.

1095
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,740
One day, you will leave 
from here, too.

1096
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,660
Dear baron...

1097
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,340
...when she left, Bernadette...

1098
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,860
...took the wrong suitcase.

1099
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,500
She has left...

1100
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,380
...hers and taken mine.

1101
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,300
Could you have your 
driver return it to me?

1102
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,260
He could then take back 
the suitcase of Bern...

1103
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,180
...of Mrs. Baroness.

1104
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,060
You'll send your driver?

1105
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,900
Thank you, dear baron.

1106
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,260
That's it.

1107
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,130
Well, those export things?
All sorted out?

1108
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,690
Impossible to take care of that.

1109
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,500
I'm desperate and you are 
responsible for that.

1110
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,260
Me?

1111
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,220
- Why?
- Jacqueline has disappered.

1112
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,900
You will find her.

1113
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,130
How?

1114
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,610
I thaught she was your daughter.

1115
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,410
- I know neither name nor address.
- That's true, but don't worry!

1116
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,300
- Could you do me a favour?
- What?

1117
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,180
Could you give me the suitcase?

1118
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,410
- With the jewels?
- Yes please.

1119
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,810
- I had so much trouble.
- Find something else for comfort.

1120
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,290
One other thing...

1121
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,300
What?

1122
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,100
I stole 60 millions from you.

1123
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,810
I know, you told me already.

1124
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,660
I stole 60 more millions.

1125
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,980
That can't be true!

1126
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,820
When I say stolen, 
I mean really stolen.

1127
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,340
Cash, from the register,
at the bank.

1128
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,850
What are you doing?

1129
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,890
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait, I'll explain first.

1130
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,610
How did you manage to do that?

1131
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,380
- I let you sign some papers earlier.
- Yes.

1132
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,060
Among those I put a blank 
sheet where you wrote:

1133
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,900
- "Read and accepted."
- Yes!

1134
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,850
I completed that paper to 
give me full powers.

1135
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,340
What are you doing?

1136
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,700
I'm calling the police.

1137
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,930
I have a transaction...

1138
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,820
...to propose.

1139
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,420
Yes?

1140
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,900
You give me back those jewels 
that really belong to me.

1141
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,850
And I give back the millions
that don't belong to me.

1142
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,890
I accept your offer.

1143
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,700
Bring me the money.

1144
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:09,380
Then I will give you the jewels.

1145
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,420
- What about Jacqueline?
- I'll tell you her address.

1146
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,540
- You know it!
- She told me.

1147
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,980
It's a deal!

1148
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,470
- Can I have my little paper back?
- Since you're asking so nicely.

1149
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,500
In my car, I have a suitcase...

1150
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,500
...with 60 millions in cash.

1151
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,860
I'll fetch it and then 
we can exchange.

1152
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,180
He's good, but I'm better!

1153
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,180
I will give him 
Bernadette's suitcase.

1154
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,890
In a moment the driver will 
bring the one with the jewels.

1155
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,420
I don't know Jacqueline's 
address...

1156
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,020
...so I just make up one.

1157
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,140
Here you are, Mr. Barnier.

1158
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,500
- The address?
- Right.

1159
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,050
- Here you are.
- 35, rue des Filles du Calvaire.

1160
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,130
And my little paper?

1161
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:57,140
- All that's left are the jewels.
- The jewels!

1162
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,580
What's that?

1163
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,770
Thanks, you are an honest man.

1164
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,380
And you will find Jacqueline.

1165
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,530
Hurry up, you must be 
dying to meet her.

1166
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,900
What a pity you won't be 
my father-in-law.

1167
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,340
Oh! Hurry up!

1168
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,780
My regards to Mrs. Barnier.
See you soon.

1169
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,140
How glad I am I could show
that swindler one more time!

1170
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,370
Bertrand!

1171
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,740
I called the job center 
for a new maid and they...

1172
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,450
...sent one right away. I have
to take care of everything here.

1173
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,450
What's the matter now!

1174
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,740
It's because of Oscar.
We have to find him.

1175
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,900
- Impossible!
- You fired the maid, so...

1176
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,040
...Oscar went to the north pole.

1177
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,130
- What's that?
- Anyway it's your fault!

1178
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,370
I give up. See you later.

1179
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,380
I'll see you later!

1180
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,260
We will find your Oscar, 
my dear...

1181
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,570
...we will find him.

1182
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,860
I don't want to see him again.

1183
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,660
Oh you don't? Why?

1184
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,700
To run away just because dad's...

1185
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,460
...masseur showed some muscles!

1186
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,740
I bring Mr. Barnier's suitcase...

1187
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,940
...Baron de la Butinière sent me.

1188
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,590
Thank you. Very kind.

1189
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,700
The baron asked me to return 
Miss Bernadette's suitcase.

1190
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,500
Yes, certainly.

1191
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,690
Thank the baron on behalf 
of my husband.

1192
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,340
Certainly.

1193
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,980
Goodbye.

1194
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,820
Your father will be happy.

1195
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,530
All that seems very strange.

1196
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,810
Since we don't have a 
maid anymore...

1197
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,980
...there are more people 
here than ever!

1198
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,820
My dear Philippe!

1199
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,740
How happy I am to see you again.

1200
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,700
I came to say I'm sorry 
for what happened.

1201
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,850
That's no problem.

1202
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,940
It was all a misunderstanding.
Nothing serious.

1203
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,650
This is my daughter.
Oh, how stupid of me!

1204
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,260
Colette, tell your father.

1205
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,770
I had a bit too much to drink.

1206
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,280
When I saw Miss in the arms
of that man, I snapped.

1207
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,700
That's just natural. 
Don't worry about that.

1208
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,220
That was just a cousin 
returning from the north pole.

1209
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,660
Oh really?
I imagined...

1210
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,340
...something else.

1211
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,340
I am very impulsive.

1212
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,050
Dear Philippe,
thanks for coming.

1213
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,900
I came to say I'm sorry.

1214
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,580
That's no problem.

1215
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,660
It was all a misunderstanding.
Nothing serious.

1216
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,580
I told him all that already.
Find something else.

1217
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,180
I warned you, I shouldn't drink.

1218
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,330
You did?

1219
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,620
It's bad for my nerves.
It turns me crazy.

1220
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,900
Crazy?

1221
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,900
Crazy!

1222
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,370
- Oh! Crazy!
- Not you?

1223
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,690
Let's talk about something else...

1224
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,740
...about your marriage to my...

1225
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,290
- ...daughter, if you like her.
- Oh well!

1226
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,770
I told your wife, when I 
saw your daughter...

1227
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,090
...in the arms of your cousin...

1228
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,250
But I have no cousin!

1229
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,220
The one from the north pole.

1230
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,900
Oh! My driver!

1231
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,450
Don't worry, I have fired him.

1232
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,580
- I don't understand.
- There's nothing to understand!

1233
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,780
Your proposals all seem to me...

1234
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,220
...a little incoherent.

1235
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,380
Don't tell me about incoherent!

1236
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,770
Well, OK, I won't say another word.

1237
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,490
That's it,
don't say another word!

1238
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,770
Sit down over there.

1239
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,000
Let's continue the conversation 
we started earlier.

1240
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,050
I told you about a nice dowry 
for my daughter...

1241
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,340
...which would allow you
to buy a very nice gym.

1242
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,620
That dowry consisted of jewels...

1243
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,380
...which I put in a suitcase.

1244
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,770
Then I fired my maid, 
who accidentally...

1245
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,580
...left with the wrong suitcase.

1246
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,260
She took the one with the jewels...

1247
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,410
...and left hers.

1248
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,620
Do you understand?

1249
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,220
Yes, I see.

1250
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,140
If you don't understand 
something, tell me at once.

1251
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,020
No, Mr. Barnier,
it's OK so far.

1252
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,300
OK?

1253
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,610
- OK.
- Good.

1254
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,140
And that explains why 
when you opened it...

1255
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,770
...you found...?

1256
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,020
Bernadette's bra!

1257
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,820
- That's the maid?
- Who I fired.

1258
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,210
Who left with the suitcase?

1259
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,820
Which contained the jewels!

1260
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,620
- That's it.
- Is that all clear?

1261
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,930
Absolutely.

1262
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,620
I'll continue.

1263
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,890
One of my employees stole 
60 millions from me.

1264
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,700
No!

1265
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,940
Why do you say no?

1266
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,570
Shut up!

1267
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,890
I simplify it, because...

1268
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,780
He returned the money.

1269
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,570
Even better.

1270
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,460
Stop interrupting me!

1271
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,420
In short. The money is 
in that suitcase.

1272
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,220
The maid's suitcase?

1273
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,010
No. The money is in that suitcase.

1274
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,050
The maid's suitcase.

1275
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,820
No! 
Try to understand!

1276
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,820
You are like this!

1277
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,370
I asked the baron to have 
the suitcase brought back.

1278
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,410
What baron?

1279
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,100
Listen, one more time:
My maid has married a baron!

1280
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,020
Don't you understand anything?

1281
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,780
Yes, but it's all a 
bit complicated.

1282
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,930
It looks complicated!

1283
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,060
But it's all very simple.

1284
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,060
In front of you there is a 
suitcase that contains...

1285
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,690
...60 millions in banknotes.

1286
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,220
But you told me about jewels?

1287
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,100
You have already enough 
to worry about!

1288
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,170
Don't make it even more complicated!

1289
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,620
60 millions in that suitcase.
Marry my daughter...

1290
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,330
...and that belongs to you.

1291
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,570
Go on!

1292
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,100
Go! Clac!

1293
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,060
You don't believe me.

1294
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,820
Open it, and you'll see
I'm not crazy.

1295
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,860
Open!

1296
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,740
Go!

1297
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,530
I'm crazy!
Crazy!

1298
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,580
Crazy!

1299
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,890
I'm crazy!

1300
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,780
What's going on?

1301
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,850
He's crazy!

1302
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,660
What's going on?

1303
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,210
I think Mr. Barnier is 
out of order.

1304
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,900
Call the repair service.

1305
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,700
He made strange proposals 
about a suitcase...

1306
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,460
...full of jewels, a suitcase
full of cash.

1307
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,180
...about an employee 
who stole 60 millions.

1308
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,380
...and a maid who 
married a baron.

1309
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,090
The maid marrying a baron, 
that's true. It's ours.

1310
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,060
Maybe you misunderstood 
about the rest.

1311
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,060
The most important is that you 
get along with my daughter.

1312
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,260
I'll leave you two alone.
Be good.

1313
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,060
Did dad tell you 
I was expecting a child?

1314
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,660
You are expecting a child?

1315
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,050
Not really.

1316
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,820
So why would he tell me that?

1317
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,580
I let him believe it, so 
that I could marry Oscar.

1318
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,180
- You want to marry Oscar?
- Not any more. He leaves all the time.

1319
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,740
What would you do in my place?

1320
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,130
Me, Miss?

1321
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,660
I'm tired of living with my parents.
I want to get married!

1322
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,260
- Do you understand?
- Yes, very well.

1323
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,620
You know that I get a large dowry?

1324
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,340
In a suitcase!

1325
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,300
In a suitcase?
Are you crazy?

1326
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:57,170
- Germaine!
- I'm here.

1327
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,570
There is a mystery I have to solve.

1328
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:04,650
Here I had a suitcase 
which was very important.

1329
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,410
That contained 60 millions 
in jewels?

1330
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,930
My husband is not joking!

1331
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,210
Silence!

1332
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,770
- Dad!
- Shut up!

1333
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,160
Bernadette returned your suitcase.

1334
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,560
When?

1335
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,210
A while ago.

1336
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:20,450
You were in your office.
She picked up her suitcase.

1337
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,970
What's the matter? 
Everything is all right!

1338
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,490
Not at all!

1339
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,930
That's the suitcase I gave
to Mr. Martin!

1340
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,770
If you want to keep it, why 
did you give it to him?

1341
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,370
You could have told me, 
you idiot!

1342
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,370
Good, now you have all 
the explanations.

1343
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,760
We're not finished yet!

1344
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,240
Mr. Martin brought 
another suitcase.

1345
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,130
Which contained 
60 millions in cash?

1346
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:45,410
- Stop please!
- Silence!

1347
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,880
Where is it?

1348
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,280
Didn't you ask the baron 
to have it picked up...

1349
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,920
- ...by his driver?
- Has he come?

1350
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:52,770
Ten minutes ago.

1351
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,250
Call Dr. Poussin at once!

1352
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,250
60 millions in jewels and...

1353
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,370
...60 millions in cash 
disappeared!

1354
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,840
That's all your fault!

1355
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,560
Look at her stupid face!

1356
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,040
You're going crazy!

1357
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,410
Yes, I'm going crazy!

1358
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,800
That's true!

1359
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,370
No dowry! Nothing!

1360
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,730
Look.
I'm going crazy.

1361
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,850
You won't get anything,
nothing at all!

1362
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,160
Like this!

1363
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,450
Hello doctor? Ah, baron?

1364
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:36,370
Is Bernadette there?

1365
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,170
This is Barnier calling.
She left again?

1366
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:40,610
Why that?

1367
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,450
Yes, it is my business.

1368
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,920
What suitcase did she have?

1369
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,480
I don't care!

1370
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,450
You are another one!

1371
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:52,530
Cretin! Idiot!

1372
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:53,890
Pimpleface!

1373
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,250
Like this!

1374
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,560
Pimpleface!

1375
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,370
Why are you looking 
at me like that?

1376
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:52,920
Come on, let's go.

1377
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:55,240
Your father has to be...

1378
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,330
...alone for a little while.

1379
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,570
- I'd better leave.
- No, stay for lunch.

1380
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,850
Colette, keep your 
fiance company.

1381
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,690
Bertrand, your conduct
leaves much to be desired.

1382
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,120
What will your masseur...

1383
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:14,930
...think of you?

1384
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:18,730
Dear God, let that 
be my suitcase!

1385
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,000
Monsieur!

1386
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,610
It's that young girl again...
She's gone.

1387
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,170
- She is here.
- Oh yes.

1388
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,010
She didn't move.

1389
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,610
Off you go!

1390
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,770
- What?
- I am desperate.

1391
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,850
We all are,
like this!

1392
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,570
I can't find Christian.

1393
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,490
I think he will return here...

1394
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:42,010
- ...in just a moment.
- It that right?

1395
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,290
It's a story about a suitcase.

1396
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,530
I don't tell it anymore, because 
everyone thinks I'm crazy.

1397
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:48,920
- Crazy?
- Crazy!

1398
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,530
I know, nothing I say 
makes sense.

1399
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,970
Listen, I will once again 
use you as a hostage.

1400
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:02,030
You will hide here.

1401
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,250
My suitcase!

1402
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,330
Charles!

1403
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,530
Let that be my suitcase!

1404
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,240
Something terrible 
happened to me!

1405
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,410
- What?
- Nothing at all!

1406
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,090
Over here. It's nothing!

1407
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,970
- Mr. Barnier.
- Yes.

1408
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:21,570
- Jacqueline.
- I know. You didn't find her.

1409
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,770
- Yes I did.
- Where?

1410
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:26,050
The address you gave me is 
a house with girls.

1411
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,810
I'll be damned!

1412
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,090
- Yes.
- What a coincidence!

1413
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,640
- You wouldn't have supected it?
- No.

1414
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,810
I asked the boss, 
an awful woman...

1415
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,010
...about Jacqueline. She 
immediately started talking...

1416
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,640
- ...about the price.
- Oh! Was it reasonable?

1417
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,610
Now I understand why she 
didn't tell her real name.

1418
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,530
Now my life is meaningless.

1419
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:47,530
I bring back the jewels, I'm 
no longer interested in them.

1420
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,970
My dear Christian.

1421
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,050
I will turn around.

1422
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,440
You open the suitcase.

1423
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,050
If there are jewels inside...

1424
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,760
...clap your hands twice,
like this.

1425
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:06,850
If it's still Bernadette's
you say nothing.

1426
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,090
I don't understand.

1427
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:13,960
Neither do I.
I turn around, you open it.

1428
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:17,770
Go ahead!

1429
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,120
At last! I won't let go 
of it anymore!

1430
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:28,690
Oh, thank you!

1431
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,970
To thank you for that, 
I will tell you the truth.

1432
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,570
Earlier, I have invented 
that address.

1433
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,830
Jacqueline never was there,

1434
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,930
she is a highly 
respectable girl.

1435
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:40,810
- Really?
- She is waiting for you...

1436
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:43,090
- ...in my office.
- Is that true?

1437
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:44,480
I'll never forget!

1438
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,650
Coming!

1439
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,960
The job center sent me.

1440
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,170
What is it?

1441
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,090
She's from the job center.

1442
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,480
Oh yes!

1443
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:58,170
- The job center!
- That's not so bad.

1444
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,200
Have you been told 
something about the job?

1445
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,410
Yes.

1446
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,880
- Do you have references?
- Of course.

1447
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,170
- The first one is 24 years old.
- 24 years?

1448
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:23,120
I felt strange when they 
gave me this address.

1449
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,840
How's that?

1450
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,330
- First I didn't want to come.
- Why?

1451
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:30,610
Read this.

1452
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:33,410
"I, the undersigned...

1453
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,210
"...Mrs. Eugène Barnier"

1454
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,490
- That's my mother!
- Yes.

1455
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:40,770
Charlotte!

1456
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,810
Yes. I served your parents.

1457
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:46,170
- What do you know!
- Time passes.

1458
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,250
- You were a young man.
- I was...

1459
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,900
22 years. You were still 
living with your parents.

1460
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,930
How glad I am to see you again!

1461
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,320
Me too.

1462
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,960
- Now I remember!
- I was young.

1463
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:58,440
What have you been 
doing since then?

1464
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,450
I worked in different households.

1465
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:03,000
- Married?
- No, but I have a daughter.

1466
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,890
Great. How old is she?

1467
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,450
She's about to get married.

1468
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,440
That's marvellous!

1469
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:13,400
I'm a bit embarrassed because
I can't give her a dowry.

1470
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,120
Now that we met again, 
please allow me...

1471
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:19,130
...to give her a small 
wedding present.

1472
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,520
You are a very kind man.

1473
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:23,920
How is the fiance?

1474
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,370
A nice boy, and he has 
a fine position.

1475
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,690
You must be happy!

1476
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,930
Just imagine: he earns 
6000 F a month.

1477
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,450
He's the sales manager of a 
very large company.

1478
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,400
Christian Martin,
by any chance?

1479
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,610
- Do you know him?
- I know nobody else.

1480
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,610
All day long.
But then you are...

1481
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:49,730
- ...Jacqueline's mother.
- You know her, too?

1482
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,970
She's my daughter!

1483
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:54,370
You know?

1484
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:55,410
What?

1485
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,290
You knew that Jacqueline
is your daughter?

1486
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,450
- You look surprised.
- I have good reason!

1487
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,810
Why do you tell me only today?

1488
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,530
I never dared.

1489
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:03,050
- Charlotte!
- Mr. Bertrand!

1490
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,050
Who is that lady?

1491
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,410
That's our new maid.

1492
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,530
Is she sad?

1493
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:18,290
No, madam. I'm crying from joy.

1494
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,520
Me too.

1495
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:22,610
Are you so happy 
to work for us?

1496
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:24,330
Oh yes, madam.

1497
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,930
- Are you so happy about it?
- Yes.

1498
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:30,290
Then we will have a happy 
time in this house!

1499
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,530
- She is here.
- Who?

1500
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,090
Our child.

1501
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,330
- Jacqueline?
- Yes!

1502
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,930
Jacqueline!

1503
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,810
She's so cute!

1504
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,650
Mum!

1505
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,290
What are you doing here?

1506
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:52,850
Jacqueline!

1507
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:56,080
- I introduce your father.
- My father?

1508
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:59,370
I always told you 
you were an orphan.

1509
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:01,730
You must know the truth.

1510
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,970
Mr. Barnier is your father.

1511
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,970
- The real one?
- The one and only!

1512
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,200
Mum!

1513
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:12,930
Let me embrace you!

1514
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:18,410
- Mr. Christian Martin?
- Yes.

1515
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,450
- Come into my arms!
- Oh, dad!

1516
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,650
So everyone is happy here.

1517
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,690
Madam, allow me to 
introduce myself.

1518
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,210
No! Later!

1519
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,200
Oscar!

1520
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,930
I couldn't leave.

1521
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,320
My Oscar!

1522
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:11,080
May I become you son-in-law?

1523
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:12,250
Agreed!

1524
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,160
Oh no!

1525
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,570
Agreed!

1526
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:17,250
- Come on, Bertrand!
- Agreed!

1527
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:19,490
Maybe I am going crazy.

1528
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,690
Give me my suitcase.

1529
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,240
It's yours my son.

1530
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,720
My suitcase!

1531
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:28,200
What's in there
is all you need...

1532
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,530
...for happiness.

1533
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:41,690
Bernadette!
