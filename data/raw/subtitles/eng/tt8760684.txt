1
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,789
Okay, are there any changes
to the schedule?

2
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Arnie?

3
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,669
Line item 7,
which is shown for all day,

4
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,883
all of first shift Tuesday.

5
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:26,019
The tank pressurization test
will not start until 13:00.

6
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,271
When do you want to run
the leak check?

7
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,272
First shift Tuesday.

8
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,276
Arnie, you gonna extend
that time out for five hours

9
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,063
by cutting it off in
the front end of that...

10
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,858
LH2 storage tank pressurization?

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,910
Negative.

12
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,441
It's 3 hours and 32 minutes

13
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,156
until man begins the greatest
adventure in his history.

14
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,992
If all goes well,
Apollo 11 astronauts

15
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,373
Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins

16
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,536
are to lift off
from Pad 39A out there

17
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,830
on the voyage
man always has dreamed about.

18
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,965
So it is now, before they go,

19
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,845
as their gleaming vehicle sits
poised and peaceful out there,

20
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,803
that there is time... if only
briefly in this busy morning...

21
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,514
to think of those three men,

22
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,145
and the burdens and the hopes
that they carry

23
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,023
on behalf of all mankind.

24
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,411
And boring through the vastness,

25
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,119
the blackness,
and the cold of space,

26
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,705
they'll carry the pledge
made eight years ago

27
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,665
by President Kennedy.

28
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,797
To put a man on the moon
and bring him back safely

29
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,048
in this decade.

30
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,921
Each segment of the mission,
every individual piece,

31
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,306
has to be completed perfectly

32
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,093
in order for the next step
to be possible.

33
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,013
And of course the nation itself
is backing us

34
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,274
so we just sincerely hope
that we measure up to that.

35
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,356
The whole Apollo program
was designed

36
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,646
to get two Americans
to the lunar surface

37
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,156
and back again to Earth safely.

38
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,693
The enormity of this event

39
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,954
is something that only history
will be able to judge.

40
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:54,038
Apollo 11 has very simply
been given the mission

41
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,045
of carrying men to the moon,
landing them there,

42
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,253
and bringing them safely back.

43
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,963
For in addition to the mission

44
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,547
the three astronauts
will perform,

45
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,337
and the experiments
they'll undertake,

46
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,927
these men will carry with them
many other things,

47
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,139
many things that are not nearly
so easy to describe.

48
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,751
During the planned
Apollo 11 journey,

49
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,583
we'll be concerned
with such things

50
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,419
as mid-course corrections
and dockings.

51
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,130
The astronauts of course will be
concerned with very much more.

52
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,196
The flight of Apollo 11
is to be the culmination

53
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,739
of a national effort

54
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,909
and the most difficult, most
dangerous mission ever attempted

55
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,328
since this country,
and the Russians,

56
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,463
started sending men into space.

57
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,028
38-year-old civilian
Neil Alden Armstrong

58
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,615
is to become the first
human being to touch the moon.

59
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,201
Aldrin will follow
just 20 minutes later,

60
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,413
but Armstrong
will take that first step.

61
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,918
The mission of Apollo 11,

62
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,295
a journey certainly
for the history books,

63
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,924
a beginning of
man's greatest adventure,

64
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,086
leaving this planet
to set foot on the moon.

65
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,762
- CBTS Apollo.
- Go ahead.

66
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,477
Verify Go/No Go for start
automatic launch sequence.

67
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,686
Verify Go.

68
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,977
- CBTS copy.
- 561 verify.

69
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,362
CS18,
spacecraft ready switch on.

70
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,192
Switch is on.

71
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,481
Verify light.

72
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,651
Roger, 562 verify.

73
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,616
All stations standby to give
a crew departure status

74
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,078
at this time.

75
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,832
CBTS to CTSS 111.

76
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,790
Go CTSS.

77
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,295
- CBTS.
- Go.

78
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,626
- DNS.
- Go.

79
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,007
- STS.
- Go.

80
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,212
- FTS.
- Go.

81
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,717
- RTS.
- Go.

82
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,424
- 8.
- 8 Go.

83
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,759
- OK, BSC.
- Go.

84
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,642
Verify elevator number one
at A level,

85
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,350
elevator number two
at 320 level.

86
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,310
Level as two and then 320 level.

87
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,350
Verify.

88
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,188
Okay.

89
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,236
All right.

90
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,150
214. Roger, you're go
for crew departure.

91
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,568
Start ETP to 14.

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,452
Roger, you're go
for crew departure.

93
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,954
Affirmative (indistinct) go.

94
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,915
The dawn of this day heralded
the dawning of a new age.

95
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:29,674
It's a time of exhilaration,
reflection, hope, fulfillment,

96
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,961
as a centuries old dream
starts toward reality.

97
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,888
This is Apollo Saturn
Launch Control.

98
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,478
T minus three hours,
four minutes, 32 seconds

99
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,562
and counting.

100
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,771
Right on time as far as

101
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,561
the astronaut countdown
is concerned,

102
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,526
the prime crew now departing
from their crew quarters

103
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,111
here at
the Kennedy Space Center.

104
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,912
Astronauts Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin,

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,451
and then finally Mike Collins,

106
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,335
plus their suit technicians

107
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,123
and director of flight crew
operations Deke Slayton

108
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,010
now boarding the transfer van
for the trip to the launch pad.

109
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,853
The trip in the transfer van

110
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,187
should take some 15 minutes
or so to reach the pad,

111
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,772
at which time the astronauts
will board

112
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,277
the first of two elevators

113
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:36,908
for the trip to the 320 foot
level at the launch pad,

114
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,160
where they will then proceed
to ingress the spacecraft.

115
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,747
We logged the departure from
the building at about 6:27 a.m.

116
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,290
Eastern Daylight Time.

117
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,174
The transfer van now departing

118
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,256
from the Manned Spacecraft
Operations Building

119
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,886
at the Kennedy Space Center

120
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,265
on the start of its eight mile
trip to Launch Pad A

121
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,428
here at complex 39 where
the Saturn V launch vehicle,

122
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,312
now fully loaded
with propellants,

123
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,519
going through
preliminary checkouts.

124
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,728
This is launch control.

125
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,327
Pat, 10,000 odd cars,

126
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,169
we estimated, were parked
around the gate 1 area

127
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,333
at 4 a.m. when we got here.

128
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,172
Cars every space here.

129
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,758
Little kids staring wide-eyed
at the Saturn v

130
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,390
glowing in the huge neon
spotlight 15 miles away.

131
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,642
And we saw teenagers
with telescopes.

132
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,771
It was the very same road we
came over eight long years ago,

133
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,102
21 manned space flights ago.

134
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,938
We came out
at just about the same hour

135
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,148
to cover Alan Shepard's 15...

136
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,925
This is Apollo Saturn
Launch Control.

137
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:10,720
T minus 2 hours, 45 minutes,
55 seconds and counting.

138
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,684
As the prime crew for Apollo 11,

139
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,815
astronauts Neil Armstrong,
Michael Collins,

140
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,068
and Edwin Aldrin are on the
terminal part of their trip

141
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,525
to the launch pad,
in the transfer van,

142
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,112
it's now making the curve
toward the pad.

143
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,278
We have discovered a problem
at the launch pad itself

144
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,822
as the crew is about to arrive.

145
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,790
We have a leak in a valve
located in a system

146
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,706
associated with
replenishing liquid hydrogen

147
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,967
for the third stage of
the Saturn V launch vehicle.

148
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,220
We have sent a team of three
technicians and a safety man

149
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,131
to the pad
and these technicians

150
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,301
are now tightening bolts
around the valve.

151
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,936
- CLTC, this is CLTS.
- Go ahead.

152
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,270
We have a leak on
the S-IVB N valve.

153
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,900
We have it in
the override closed position

154
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,277
to see if it'll get better.

155
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,313
It seems to be getting worse.

156
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,072
Roger, which camera is that
available on?

157
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,450
It's on camera 18.

158
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,238
Camera 18, you can see the men
working on the hydrogen leak.

159
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,826
Once the technicians depart

160
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,413
we will send hydrogen again
through this system

161
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,250
to assure that the leak
has been corrected.

162
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,134
The astronauts now coming up
toward the pad itself

163
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,295
as the crew of
several technicians

164
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,009
at the 200 foot level

165
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,425
proceed to tighten some bolts
around a leaking valve.

166
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,811
The astronaut team which has
just arrived at the pad,

167
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,941
the transfer van now backing up
toward the elevator.

168
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,398
In a matter of 5 minutes or so,
we'll be ready

169
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,189
for the spacecraft commander
Neil Armstrong

170
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,779
to come across the sill
at the 320 foot level.

171
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,319
That is our status at 2 hours,
43 minutes,

172
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,158
47 seconds and counting.

173
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,322
This is Launch Control.

174
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,828
- MSTC, CBTS 111.
- Go ahead.

175
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,542
Astros proceeding to 320.

176
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,707
Understand,
we'll get the camera.

177
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,921
Okay, Günter, you can hit
the switch on the camera.

178
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,632
LOAM, this is A2. IAS.

179
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,592
Roger,
camera has been activated.

180
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,600
CBTS MSTC,
the swing arm camera is on.

181
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,762
CBTS copies.

182
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,648
MSTC, the crew is approaching
the (indistinct).

183
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,227
Okay, babe.

184
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,767
This is Apollo Saturn
Launch Control,

185
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,154
we've just passed the two hour
21 minute mark in our countdown

186
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,906
and we are proceeding
at this time.

187
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,943
At the 320 foot level,

188
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,702
all three astronauts
now aboard the spacecraft.

189
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,161
Just a few minutes ago,
astronaut Buzz Aldrin came in

190
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,044
and took the center seat to join
Neil Armstrong on the left

191
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,875
and Mike Collins on the right.

192
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,257
These are the positions
they will fly at liftoff.

193
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,465
120 feet down, the work
continues on a leaky valve

194
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,597
at the 200 foot level, the
technicians still hard at work

195
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,600
tightening bolts around
that valve at this time.

196
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,556
CDR, STC.
How do you read?

197
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,345
STC, loud and clear.

198
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,889
Good morning, Neil.

199
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,977
Good morning.

200
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,311
Welcome aboard.

201
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,896
CMP, STC.
How do you read?

202
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,356
STC, CMP.
Loud and clear.

203
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,737
Good morning, Buzz.

204
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,272
Good morning.
How are you gentlemen?

205
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,735
Just fine, thank you.

206
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,571
Let me make a last check here.

207
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,532
CDR, LMP and CMP,
are you ready for hatch close?

208
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,493
Any adjustment on your straps?

209
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,907
LMP's happy.

210
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,793
Roger. Okay, good luck.

211
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,953
Thank you, Günter.

212
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,463
See you around, Günter.

213
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,901
All right, pad leader,
let's proceed.

214
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,588
Roger, we're proceeding
with closing the hatch.

215
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,423
- Roger.
- Sequence 441,

216
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,179
the CM hatch is closed.

217
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,179
Roger.

218
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,340
The hatch is closed

219
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,304
and we're beginning
to purge the cabin

220
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:22,346
to bring it to the proper
atmosphere for launch,

221
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:26,108
which is a combination
of oxygen and nitrogen,

222
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,896
60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen
atmosphere.

223
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,563
Of course
the astronauts themselves

224
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,484
are breathing pure oxygen
through their space suits.

225
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,832
Coming up shortly
will be another key test

226
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,540
in which both the launch crew
for the launch vehicle crew

227
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,375
and the spacecraft team

228
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,007
combine together with
commander Neil Armstrong

229
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,840
to make a thorough check of
the emergency detection system.

230
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,551
This is the system that
will signal the astronauts

231
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,467
in the cabin if anything
goes wrong below them.

232
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,637
We used a ground based computer
to accomplish this test.

233
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,850
It will take some 30 minutes.

234
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,450
Neil Armstrong will be doing
most of the work

235
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,914
in the spacecraft,

236
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,547
responding as different
cue lights signify

237
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,130
different difficulties
presented to him.

238
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,387
Our countdown continuing,
this is Kennedy Launch Control.

239
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,767
NASA officials.

240
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,899
5,000 guests in all,

241
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,981
including 400 congressmen and
members of the Supreme Court,

242
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,146
the Presidential Cabinet.

243
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,487
The NASA official who escorted
us over to this site today

244
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,276
has called it a Roman circus.

245
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,241
We all know that NASA
has an agreement

246
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,747
with over 60 countries...

247
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,036
T minus 61 minutes
on the Apollo 11 countdown

248
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,081
and all elements are go
at this time.

249
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,466
Here in the firing room,
the launch vehicle test team

250
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,628
still keeping a close eye
on the status of the propellants

251
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,672
aboard
the Saturn V launch vehicle.

252
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,511
This problem with
the leaking valve

253
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,551
is no problem at this time.

254
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,435
We've actually bypassed
the valve,

255
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,813
but we are maintaining
our hydrogen supply

256
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,269
aboard the vehicle.

257
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,527
That big swing arm that has been
attached to the spacecraft

258
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,563
up to now
will be moved back now.

259
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,358
In 5 seconds, the swing arm
will come back.

260
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,235
Mark.

261
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,756
CBTS, this is CSA 9,
arm 9 is retracted.

262
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,591
CBTS copy.

263
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,445
Countdown still proceeding
satisfactorily at this time.

264
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,575
T minus 30 minutes,
52 seconds and counting;

265
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,929
aiming toward our
planned liftoff time

266
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,240
of 32 minutes past the hour,

267
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,781
the start of
our launch window,

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,621
some final checks of
the destruct system

269
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,663
of the three stages of
the Saturn V launch vehicle.

270
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,876
In the event,
during powered flight

271
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,089
that the vehicle strayed
rather violently off course,

272
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,343
the range safety officer

273
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,301
could take action to destroy
the vehicle,

274
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,217
which obviously would occur
after the astronauts

275
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:51,514
were separated by their escape
tower from the faulty vehicle.

276
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,558
We've just got by an important
test with the launch vehicle,

277
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,353
checking out the various
batteries in the three stages

278
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,364
and Instrument Unit
of the Saturn V.

279
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,650
We remain on external power
through most of the count

280
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,534
to preserve those batteries

281
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,241
which must be used during
the powered flight.

282
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,747
We've just taken a look at them
by going internal

283
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,250
and then switching back
to external again.

284
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,626
The batteries all look good.

285
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,630
The next time we go internal
will be at the 50 second mark

286
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,132
with those batteries and they
will remain, of course,

287
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,759
on internal power
during the flight.

288
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,387
14 minutes, 30 seconds
and counting.

289
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,596
All still going well with
the countdown at this time.

290
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,600
For status report,
we'll now switch

291
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,433
to Mission Control Houston.

292
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,848
This is Apollo Mission Control.

293
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,187
Flight Director Cliff
Charlesworth's team

294
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,352
is on station here

295
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,145
in the Mission Operations
Control Room,

296
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,157
ready to assume the control of
this flight at tower clearance.

297
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,443
All flight controllers,
coming up on auto sequence.

298
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,111
- BOOSTER, how you?
- We're go, Flight.

299
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,575
- EECOM?
- Go, Flight.

300
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,955
- GNC?
- Go, Flight.

301
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,366
- TELCOM?
- Go, Flight.

302
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,499
- CONTROL.
- Go.

303
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,830
NETWORK, got it there?

304
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,745
That's affirmative, Flight.

305
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,459
Mission director, CBTS 111,

306
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,499
- verify go for launch.
- Go for launch.

307
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,885
We passed the 6 minute mark
in our countdown for Apollo 11.

308
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,343
Now 5 minutes,
52 seconds and counting.

309
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,178
CTSF, verify go for launch.

310
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,013
CTSF verify go for launch.

311
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,927
CTSC, verify go for launch.

312
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,346
CTSC verify go for launch.

313
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,980
SRO, verify go for launch.

314
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,391
SRO verify go for launch.

315
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,059
LM, verify go for launch.

316
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,522
LM go for launch.

317
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,798
(indistinct),
everybody go for launch?

318
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,063
Flight, go for launch.

319
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,607
CBTS copies.

320
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,402
We have some
7.6 million pounds of thrust

321
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,241
pushing the vehicle upward.

322
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,705
A vehicle that weighs close to
six and a half million pounds.

323
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,494
This is Apollo Saturn
Launch Control,

324
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,665
T minus one minute, 35 seconds
on the Apollo mission,

325
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,380
the flight to land
the first men on the moon.

326
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,761
Apollo 11, this is
Launch Operations Manager,

327
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,890
the launch team wishes you
good luck and god speed.

328
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,142
It sure has been
a nice, smooth countdown.

329
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:52,972
Thank you, babe.

330
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,059
LMP, VHF...

331
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,221
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

332
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,515
We passed T minus 60...

333
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,856
55 seconds and counting.

334
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,486
Neil Armstrong
just reported back

335
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,022
it's been
a real smooth countdown.

336
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,986
We passed
the 50 second mark.

337
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,276
Power transfer is complete.

338
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,368
On internal power with
the launch vehicle at this time.

339
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,750
40 seconds away from
the Apollo 11 liftoff.

340
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,787
All the second stage tanks
now pressurized.

341
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,705
35 seconds and counting...

342
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,749
We are still go with Apollo 11.

343
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,135
- 30 seconds.
- 30 seconds and counting.

344
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,841
Astronauts report it feels good.

345
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,881
T minus 25 seconds.

346
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,269
20 seconds and counting.

347
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,650
T minus 15 seconds,
guidance is internal.

348
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,484
12, 11, 10, 9.

349
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,524
Ignition sequence starts.

350
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,537
Liftoff!
We have a liftoff.

351
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,872
32 minutes past the hour,

352
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,959
liftoff of Apollo 11.

353
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,214
Clear the tower.

354
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,258
Tower clear!

355
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,759
Roger, we got a roll program.

356
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,011
Neil Armstrong reporting
their roll and pitch program

357
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,015
which puts Apollo 11
on a proper heading.

358
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,894
One bravo.

359
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,850
One bravo is
a abort control mode...

360
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,403
Altitude's two miles.

361
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,952
Apollo 11, you're good
at one minute.

362
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:17,677
We're through the region of
maximum dynamic pressure now.

363
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,468
Yeah, everything
looks good here.

364
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,635
11, Houston.

365
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,804
Your guidance is converged,
you're looking good.

366
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,849
We're 1350 at the start, Bob.

367
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,609
8 miles downrange,
12 miles high.

381
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,855
Cutoff, ignition.

382
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,641
- Thrust is go all engines.
- Looks good.

383
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,774
11, Houston,

384
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,186
thrust is go all engines,
you're looking good.

385
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,774
We've got skirt sep.

386
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,990
- Roger, we confirm skirt sep.
- Roger.

387
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,038
Tower's gone.

388
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,242

00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,735
Houston, be advised,
the visual is go today.

397
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,146
This is Houston, roger that.

398
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,862
Altitude is 100 miles,
downrange 883 miles.

399
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,822
Outboard engine cutoff.

400
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,203
And ignition.

401
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,918
Ignition confirmed,
thrust is go, 11.

402
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,089
And we have
a good third stage now.

403
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:26,513
Velocity 23,128
feet per second.

404

00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,898
And Roger 11.

407
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,451
FLIGHT, FIDO, we are go.

408
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,211
- Confirmed go.
- Apollo 11, this is Houston,

409
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:58,216
you are confirmed go

410
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,546
Copy.

411
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,514
We have a report
on the launch heart rates now

412
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,891
from the flight surgeon.

413
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,803

Lunar Module Pilot
Buzz Aldrin, 88.

416
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,364
FLIGHT, FIDO, we'll have
some radar in shortly.

417
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,365
Flight dynamics officer
Dave Reed

418
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,199
will report a refined orbit
after more radar tracking.

419
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,658
Apollo 11,
this is Houston,

420
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,791
the booster has been configured
for orbital coast,

421
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,919
both spacecrafts
are looking good, over.

422
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,079
Roger.

423
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,887
You want some of these lights
down further, Mark?

424
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,544
Mike?

425
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,823
Don't worry about it
for the time being,

426
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,214
I'm potting around with
handholds right now, Neil.

427
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,180
Apollo 11, this is Houston,
through Tananarive, over.

428
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,720
Hello, Houston, Apollo 11.

429
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,809
- Go ahead.
- For your information,

430
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,019
Canary radar shows you

431
00:28:56,068 --> 00:29:01,188
in a 103.0 by 103.0 orbit.

432
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,152
Over.

433
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,237
Beautiful.

434
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:12,829
You'll be AOS
at Goldstone at 1:29:02,

435
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:19,214
LOS at Goldstone,
1:33:55, over.

436
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,419
Roger.

437
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,710
This is Apollo Control
at 1 hour 51 minutes.

438
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,880
Moving across the Atlantic now
towards Africa.

439
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,639
And on the next revolution,

440
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,222
the spacecraft
will be accelerating

441
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,058
to the required speed
to get it into an orbit

442
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,517
that'll intercept the moon

443
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,558
during the trans-lunar
injection maneuver,

444
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,226
the burn with
the Saturn third stage

445
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,611
that will place
the spacecraft

446
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,443
on its trajectory
toward the moon.

447
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,401
Go/No Go for TLI.

448
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,193
- GUIDANCE.
- Go, Flight.

449
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,453
- GNC.
- We're go, Flight.

450
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,738
- EECOM.
- We're go, Flight.

451
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,951
- FIDO.
- We're go, Flight.

452
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,161
- RETRO.
- Go, Flight.

453
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,075
- Ok, CAPCOM.
- Apollo 11,

454
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,711
this is Houston,
you are go for TLI.

455
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,871
Over.

456
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,755
Apollo 11, thank you.

457
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,712
We just got telemetry
back on here, BOOSTER,

458
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,673
and everything is go.

459
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,338
Roger, everything
looks good here.

460
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,926
We're showing
present altitude

461
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,262
about 108 nautical miles.

462
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:17,056
We expect to be at an altitude
of 177 nautical miles at cutoff.

463
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,941
We're just coming in
to the terminator here.

464
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,575
Ignition.

465
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,985
We have ignition, Flight.

466
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:31,824
Roger.

467
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:32,872
We're go.

468
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,914
Thrust is go.

469
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,745
We confirm ignition
and the thrust is go.

470
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,704
GUIDANCE initiate (indistinct).

471
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:38,753
Roger.

472
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,582
FIDO, radar confirms ignition.

473
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,041
Trajectory
and guidance look good

474
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,252
and the stage is good, over.

475
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,338
Roger, Apollo 11 is go.

476
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,018
Telemetry and radar
tracking are both solid.

477
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,121
- Cut-off.
- Roger.

478
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,830
We show cut-off and we copy
the numbers on noun 62.

479
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,583
Houston, Apollo 11,

480
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,251
that Saturn gave us
a magnificent ride.

481
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,089
Roger, 11,
it certainly looks like

482
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,003
you're well on your way now.

483
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:36,097
That was Neil Armstrong
praising the launch vehicle.

484
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,510
- FLIGHT FIDO.
- GO.

485
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,831
We finally got
some radar data back.

486
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,720
Looks good.

487
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,105
We had a good burn...

488
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,752
we've got a good flight
to the moon coming up.

489
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,358
Roger.

490
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,895
FLIGHT CAPCOM, you want me
to pass up those times?

491
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,688
- That's affirm.
- Okay.

492
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,608
Apollo 11, this is Houston.

493
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,573
For your information,
we expect the maneuver

494
00:31:54,621 --> 00:32:00,583
to separation attitude
to begin at 3 plus 05 plus 03.

495
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,209
The crew at this time
pressing ahead

496
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,588
with their transposition
and docking maneuver.

497
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,625
The spacecraft,
after having separated

498
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,841
the Saturn third stage,
turning around,

499
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,880
docking with
the lunar module,

500
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,924
extracting the lunar module

501
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,968
from the Saturn third stage,

502
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,602
and pushing ahead
en route to the moon.

503
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,682
A little bit to our right.

504
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,941
Okay, I see him.

505
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,899
We need about 5-degree right,
we need to stop our...

506
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,859
He's pretty far away.

507
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,738
How long do we want
to run this film?

508
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,870
How does he look, Mike?

509
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,161
Okay, you got a 100.4.

510
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,795
It's a very weak signal.

511
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,206
We believe
that Mike Collins

512
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,124
is now maneuvering
the spacecraft.

513
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:52,840
The antenna patterns
aren't too good at the moment.

514
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,648
Apollo 11, this is Houston
broadcasting in the blind,

515
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,980
request Omni Bravo
if you read us.

516
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,361
Out.

517
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,528
The whole LM quivers
every so often.

518
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,414
The whole surface of it,
you know, shakes like that.

519
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,915
- Really?
- Just in one spot;

520
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,120
it's not being hit...

521
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,161
Standby, we're close.

522
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,523
Houston, Apollo 11,

523
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,309
all 12 latches are locked.

524
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,775
Buzz Aldrin reporting
that all 12 of the latches

525
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,109
in the docking mechanism
have locked.

526
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,320
Houston, we're ready
for LM ejection.

527
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,038
We are sep'd,
we have a cryo press light.

528
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,704
Houston, Apollo 11,
we've completed our maneuver.

529
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,872
Houston, roger out.

530
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,587
This is Apollo Control
at 6 hours, 16 minutes

531
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,500
into the mission.

532
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:20,140
Velocity now
11,479 feet per second.

533
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,300
Apollo 11's distance
from Earth,

534
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,471
27,938 nautical miles.

535
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,857
CAPCOM is now Charlie Duke
and Gene Kranz

536
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,688
and his white team
of flight controllers

537
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,274
is preparing to take over
the responsibility

538
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,938
from Cliff Charlesworth's
team.

539
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,449
The PTC has started now,
it looks good to us,

540
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,293
and we'll be ready to copy
in a minute or two.

541
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,990
Roger, Mike,
we see it increasing now.

542
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,620
The spacecraft
will be placed

543
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,406
in the passive
thermal control mode,

544
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,871
will be rotated
about its X-axis

545
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,956
at a rate of about
3 revolutions per hour

546
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,338
to maintain
proper temperature balance

547
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,623
within the spacecraft.

548
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,166
Houston,
you might be interested

549
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,631
that out my left hand window
right now,

550
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,844
I can observe the entire
continent of North America,

551
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,928
down to the Yucatan Peninsula,

552
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,890
Cuba, and then
I run out of window.

553
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,082
I didn't know
what I was looking at,

554
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,517
but I sure did like it.

555
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,683
Okay.

556
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,852
I didn't have much
outside my window.

557
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,734
Apollo 11, Houston.

558
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,270
We'd like
a crew status report.

559
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,064
We're about
to tell you goodnight, over.

560
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,818
Status report is as follows:

561
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,615
Radiation-CDR 1102,

562
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,125
CMP 10002,

563
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,754
LMP 09003,

564
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,881
Negative medications,

565
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,713
fit as a fiddle, over.

566
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,378
Copy 11, thank you much.

567
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,264
You're cleared
for some Zs, over.

568
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,846
Okay, maybe we'll
get around to lunch.

569
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,680
Morning, Houston, Apollo 11.

570
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,975
Roger, Apollo 11, good morning.

571
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,485
Goldstone reports
they're receiving TV

572
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,610
from the spacecraft.

573
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,399
Calling in from
about 130,000 miles out.

574
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,303
Hello there, sports fans,
you got a little bit of me,

575
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,818
plus Neil's
on the center couch

576
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,202
and Buzz is doing
the camera work.

577
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,782
And Neil's standing
on his head again,

578
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,618
he's trying
to make me nervous.

579
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,251
Roger, copy, and we see
the DSKY flashing with a 651.

580
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,911
We do have a happy home,

581
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,524
there's plenty of room
for the three of us.

582
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:20,168
Apollo 11 is presently 131,000
nautical miles from Earth.

583
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,429
The spacecraft slowly rotates
to maintain thermal balance.

584
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,556
It looks like we got
a good PTC going.

585
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,592
It's good night
from the white team, over.

586
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,931
Okay, see you tomorrow,
thank you for everything.

587
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,641
Good morning, Apollo 11.

588
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,056
Good morning, Houston.
Apollo 11.

589
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:36,272
Yeah, I've got the world
in my window for a change.

590
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,732
Sounds like one of these
rotating restaurants.

591
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,549
Okay, all flight controllers,
let's get handed over

592
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,280
pretty quickly
to the white team here.

593
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,191
We're going to be crawling
into the LM shortly,

594
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,860
we're terminating PTC.

595
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,245
FLIGHT NETWORK,
we're receiving live TV.

596
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,871
Interior view
of the command module

597
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,908
looking up into
the LM hatch area.

598
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,326
Okay, it's moved now,
coming down.

599
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,586
Yeah, we're about
to open the hatch now.

600
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,747
Buzz Aldrin has apparently
carried the camera

601
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,799
into the LM with him.

602
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,210
The vehicle
is surprisingly very clean.

603
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,198
Just a moment ago,
we had a good shot of your PLSS,

604
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,179
Buzz, and the two helmet
stowage bags,

605
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,683
and now behind
we have the DSKY and the ACA.

606
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,766
That's about the position
we'll be putting the camera in

607
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,931
after the initial descent
down the ladder.

608
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,895
It will be taking
one frame a second.

609
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,684
Hello there, earthlings.

610
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,818
Hello there.

611
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,900
Probably
the most unusual position

612
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,405
a cameraman's ever had,

613
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,316
hanging by his toes
from a tunnel

614
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,234
and taking a picture
upside down.

615
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,620
We're going to go ahead
and take all the loose data

616
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,077
on back into the
command module, Charlie.

617
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,491
Roger.

618
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:37,457
And we're going to turn
our TV monitor off now

619
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,623
while we have some other work
to do, Apollo 11,

620
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,712
signing off.

621
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,127
Apollo 11, Houston.

622
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,886
As the sun sinks
slowly in the west,

623
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,967
the white team
bids you good night.

624
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,882
You earned your pay
today, Charlie.

625
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,425
Roger.

626
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,094
All right, goodnight all.

627
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,288
...the government
has succeeded

628
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,249
in harnessing the resources
of the government,

629
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,540
the scientific community,
the universities...

630
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,069
Now let's take a few minutes
to review

631
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,255
what else has been going on
around the world

632
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,967
while Apollo 11
has held our attention.

633
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,007
The lull in the ground fighting
in Vietnam

634
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,392
is now in its fifth week
with only one incident

635
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,974
reported from the battle field
so far today,

636
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,854
and that one described as minor.

637
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,356
Police Chief Dominick Arena,

638
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,857
who filed a formal complaint

639
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,438
charging
Senator Edward Kennedy

640
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,069
with leaving the scene
of the accident

641
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,230
that took the life
of Mary Jo Kopechne,

642
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,569
a passenger
in the senator's car.

643
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,325
Kennedy, who suffered
a slight concussion

644
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,202
in the accident
remains in seclusion

645
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,614
near the family compound
at Hyannis Port.

646
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,248
FD1 FAO.

647
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,453
Go ahead.

648
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,021
You hear about that story
about Ted Kennedy?

649
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,377
Did y'all hear about that?

650
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,816
That was the biggest story
on the news.

651
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,832
Yeah, yeah, they'd
forgotten about Apollo

652
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,883
for Ted Kennedy.

653
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,883
GNC, this is CAPCOM on MOCR 1.

654
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:07,543
Go ahead.

655
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,178
Have your people
plotted pressure

656
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,714
in that bottle versus time,

657
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,052
so we could take
a look at it?

658
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,683
I don't think
they've got it yet,

659
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,559
they're testing work, CAPCOM.

660
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,415
Okay, how about giving me a call
when that comes up,

661
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,959
we'd like to take a look at it
on one of the screens.

662
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,064
Rog.

663
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,896
Morning again, Houston.
Apollo 11.

664
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,027
Roger, 11, good morning.

665
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,313
Your systems are looking good
from down here.

666
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,857
Yeah, looks good
up here too, Bruce.

667
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,617
Deke Slayton, director
of flight crew operations

668
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,403
and two members
of the backup crew,

669
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,619
Bill Anders, Jim Lovell
have joined Bruce McCandless

670
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,455
at the CAPCOM console.

671
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,462
Apollo 11,
this is Houston, over.

672
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,622
Roger, go ahead, Houston.

673
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:45,674
Apollo 11.

674
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,003
11, this is Houston.

675
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,292
If Mike has a mask,

676
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,131
he's lost respiration rates

677
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,091
on the biomed telemetry.

678
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,450
Well, he was shaving
a little bit ago.

679
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,215
He might have...

680
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,976
Okay, Mike, we had
a request that you check

681
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,887
the two electrodes
that are placed

682
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,398
one on each side of your
lower rib cage, over.

683
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,277
All those wires and things
look normal up here.

684
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,064
Roger, Mike, we can see
variations on our trace

685
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,572
as you connected
and disconnected,

686
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,110
but the medics
still don't have a signal.

687
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,405
I promise to let you know
if I stop breathing.

688
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,836
Coming up in less
than 10 seconds now,

689
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,715
we'll be crossing into
the sphere of influence

690
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,591
of the moon
at this point

691
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,219
as the moon's
gravitational force

692
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,301
becomes the dominant effect

693
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,558
on the spacecraft trajectory

694
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,343
and our displays
will shift

695
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,684
from Earth reference
to moon reference.

696
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,314
The spacecraft
was at a distance

697
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:50,105
of 186,437 nautical miles
from Earth

698
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:55,493
and 33,822 nautical miles
from the moon.

699
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,700
All spacecraft systems
are functioning normally,

700
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,831
the mission
going very smoothly.

701
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,082
View of the moon that we've been
having's really spectacular.

702
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,545
The sun right behind
the edge of the moon now.

703
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,051
The solar corona.

704
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,133
The sky is lit all the way
around the moon,

705
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,264
quite an eerie sight.

706
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,678
There's a very marked
three dimensional aspect

707
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,437
of having the sun's corona
coming from behind the moon

708
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,893
the way it is.

709
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,650
It's a view worth
the price of the trip.

710
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:38,073
Mother Earth is 206,059
nautical miles behind.

711
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,205
Coming up on the lunar orbit
insertion burn,

712
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,491
in which the spacecraft
will start

713
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,957
its initial orbit
around the moon.

714
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,339
The maneuver will slow the
spacecraft down considerably

715
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,840
from its present velocity.

716
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,420
And it should
come from behind

717
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,052
the east face of the moon
33 minutes later.

718
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,802
Yeah, the moon is there, boy,

719
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,565
in all its splendor.

720
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,396
Hello, moon,
how's your old backside?

721
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,772
All your systems
are looking good,

722
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:15,610
going around the corner.

723
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,320
We'll see you
on the other side, over.

724
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:23,281
Loss of signal as Apollo 11
goes behind the moon.

725
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,949
Servo power 1 to AC1.

726
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,743
- 2 to AC 2.
- 2 to AC 2.

727
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,252
Translational control power on.

728
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,664
Translational
control power is on.

729
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,860
Hand controller
number 2 armed.

730
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,046
Signal hand controller
number 2 is armed.

731
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,514
99.

732
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,470
Proceed.

733
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,350
Got B mode.

734
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,306
Burning, we're looking good.

735
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,346
- A.
- Here comes B... B,

736
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,764
I mean, thrust A mark.

737
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,852
Got them both?

738
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,018
Okay, now what's
your chamber pressure?

739
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,527
It's good.

740
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,812
It's 95.

741
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,901
PLUGS is oscillating around.

742
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,761
Okay, ball valves closed,

743
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,593
(indistinct) barber poles.

744
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:22,802
That was a beautiful burn.

745
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,432
God damn, I guess.

746
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:25,843
170 by 60.

747
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,102
Like gangbusters!

748
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,182
Whoo!

749
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:37,405
30 seconds from
acquisition time.

750
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,110
Well, I have to vote
with the 10 crew,

751
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,275
that thing is brown.

752
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,192
Sure is.

753
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,076
Looks tan to me.

754
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,282
But when I first saw it

755
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,992
at that other sun angle,

756
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,576
it really looked gray.

757
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,742
The more sun angle you get...

758
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,457
More brown with
increasing sun angle.

759
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,791
God, that's a big beauty.

760
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,799
Gigantic crater, look at
the mountain going around it.

761
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,254
My gosh, they're monsters.

762
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,043
That is a big mother
over here, too.

763
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:00,882
- Whoo!
- Get another picture

764
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,673
- of that big fella.
- Yeah.

765
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,636
Look at those craters in a row.

766
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,052
You see them right...
going right out there?

767
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,811
There it is,
it's coming up!

768
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,222
- What?
- The Earth.

769
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,355
- See it?
- Yeah.

770
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,356
Beautiful!

771
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,859
Right over the LM.

772
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,566
Boy, does that ever look
beautiful in the sextant.

773
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,320
Apollo 11, Apollo 11,

774
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,108
this is Houston,
do you read?

775
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,322
Yeah, we sure do, Houston.

776
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,487
LOI 1 burn
just nominal as all get out

777
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,952
and everything
looking good!

778
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,366
It was like perfect.

779
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,627
Delta-Tig zero,
burn time 5:57...

780
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,711
60.9 by 169.9.

781
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,966
That burn report
was by Neil Armstrong.

782
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,172
Roger, we copy you.

783
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,553
The spacecraft is looking good
to us on telemetry.

784
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,966
Apollo 11
on its first lunar revolution.

785
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,287
You got a good view there, Neil?

786
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,427
Yeah, I sure do.

787
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,434
Boy, it's beautiful out there,
isn't it?

788
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,344
...TPI approach.

789
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,604
Man, this is really something,

790
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,855
you ought to look at this,

791
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,752
you want to watch our approach
into the landing site,

792
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,234
you got to watch it
right through this window.

793
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,612
We're coming over...
we just passed Mount Marilyn,

794
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,899
we're coming up
on the Maskelyne series here,

795
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,067
straight out ahead.

796
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,985
80 hours, 48 minutes now

797
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:09,576
into the flight
of Apollo 11.

798
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,492
Astronaut Charles Duke
has arrived on the scene.

799
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,579
- Hey, Dave?
- Yeah?

800
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,665
What put us
four minutes ahead?

801
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,921
We arrived at the moon
four minutes early.

802
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,127
Speaks well for the booster.

803
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,712
Well, no sh...

804
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,546
Ah, 11,
that really winds things up

805
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,806
as far as we're concerned
on the ground for the evening.

806
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,184
We're ready to go to bed
and get a little sleep, over.

807
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,686
Yeah, we're about to join you.

808
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,846
Rog.

809
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,317
This is of course
the great day for mankind

810
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,698
when we leave
our Planet Earth

811
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,859
and set foot
on the moon.

812
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,404
So on this historic day,
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin

813
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,494
are in their lunar module,
in their spacesuits.

814
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,035
On this next pass,
they are preparing to undock.

815
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,047
Both spacecraft looking
very good at this time.

816
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,550
The following revolution,
revolution 13,

817
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,337
Armstrong and Aldrin,
they will undock

818
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,972
from the Command
and Service Module,

819
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,410
from which point
the powered descent

820
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,427
to the lunar surface
will be initiated.

821
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:18,144
APOLLO 11, Houston,
we are go for undocking, over.

822
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,979
Roger, understand.

823
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,064
We're all set
when you are, Mike.

824
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,858
Okay, here you go.

825
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,401
See ya.

826
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,827
Looks like a good sep.

827
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,709
The Eagle's undocked.

828
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,840
The Eagle has wings.

829
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,625
Looking good.

830
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,794
Testing.

831
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,050
There you go,
one minute till Tig.

832
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,182
You guys take care.

833
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,387
See you later.

834
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,187
Okay, all flight controllers.

835
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,523
Go/No Go for powered descent.

836
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,528
- RETRO.
- Go.

837
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,404

00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,700
- EECOM.
- Go.

843
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,031
- Surgeon.
- Go.

844
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,867
CAPCOM, we're go
for powered descent.

845
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,281
Eagle, Houston, if you read,

846
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,791
you're go for powered descent.

847
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,916
Over.

848
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,295
Descent armed.

849
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,171
Altitude light's on.

850
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,302
(indistinct) proceed.

851
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,384
Proceed.

852
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,049
One. Zero.

853
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,842
Ignition. Ten percent.

854
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,014
Eagle, we got you now.

855
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,273
It's looking good, over.

856
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,731
Okay, rate of descent
is looking good.

857
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,443
Eagle, Houston, everything's
looking good here, over.

858
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,982
Roger, copy.

859
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,991
Houston, we're getting
a little fluctuation

860
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,200
in the AC voltage now.

861
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,533
Roger.

862
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,809
- It's okay, Flight.
- Stand by.

863
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,540
- It's okay.
- Looking good to us.

864
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,919
You're still looking good
at coming up on three minutes.

865
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:07,458
Okay, we went by
the three-minute point early.

866
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,251
We're long.

867
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,046
Our position checks downrange
show us to be a little long.

868
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,589
Roger, copy.

869
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,202
He thinks you're
a little bit long downrange.

870
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,620
That's right.
I think we confirmed that.

871
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,387
- We confirmed that.
- Rog.

872
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,852
Altitude rate looks
right down the groove.

873
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,938
Roger, about three seconds long.

874
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,477
Rolling over.

875
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,969
Okay, all flight controllers,
I'm going around the horn.

876
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,575
Okay, now watch
that signal strength.

877
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,723
Make your Go/No Gos based on the
data you had prior to LOS.

878
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,725
I see we got it back.
Give you another few seconds.

879
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,956
We're yawing, Flight.

880
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000

CAPCOM, we're go
to continue PDI.

889
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,838
Eagle, Houston, you are go.

890
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,720
The ED Batts are go
at four minutes.

891
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,630
Did you get that, TELCOM?
ED Batts are go.

892
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,265
You are go to continue
powered descent,

893
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,552
you are go to continue
powered descent.

894
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,345
And Eagle, Houston.
We had data dropout.

895
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,438
You're still looking good.

896
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,098
Looks good, Flight, looks good.

897
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,689
Houston, you're looking
at our Delta H.

898
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,147
Program alert.

899
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,898
It's a 1202.

900
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,317
1202.

901
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,986
1202 alarm.

902
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,870
- 1202.
- What's that?

903
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,531
1202 alarm.

904
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,167
It's executive overflow,
if it does not occur again,

905
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,292
we're fine.

906
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,748
It has not occurred again.

907
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,665
Okay, we're go, continue.

908
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,334
Give us a reading
on the 1202 program alarm.

909
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,127
We're go.

910
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,888
Roger, we got you,
we're go on that alarm.

911
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,428
Roger.

912
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,939
Same alarm and it appears to
come up when we have a 16/68 up.

913
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,647
6 plus 25. Throttle down.
6 plus 25. Throttle down.

914
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,943
Throttle down on time.

915
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,636
You can feel it in here
when it throttles down.

916
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,388
Okay all flight controllers,
Go/No Go for landing.

917
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,152

Houston, you're go for landing,
over.

927
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,123
Roger, understand,
go for landing, 3,000 feet.

928
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,666
Program alarm.

929
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,378
- 1201.
- 1201.

930
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,468
- 1201 alarm.
- Same type, we're go, Flight.

931
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,517
We're go.

932
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,016
Pretty rocky area.

933
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,017
Attitude hold.

934
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,598
Okay, att hold.

935
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,183
100 feet,
three and a half down.

936
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,501
Think we better be quiet,
Flight.

937
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,107
Rog.

938
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,485
Okay, the only call-outs
from now on will be fuel.

939
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,113
Stand by for 60.

940
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,648
- 60.
- 60 seconds.

941
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,817
60 seconds.

942
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,360
Lights on.

943
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,498
60 feet down, two and a half.

944
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,284
Okay, 55 feet.

945
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,124
Okay, looks like
a good area here.

946
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,459
It's looking good,
down a half.

947
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,384
Two forward, forward.

948
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,759
Looks good.

949
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,594
Forty feet down,
two and a half.

950
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,725
Picking up some dust.

951
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,135
30 feet, two and a half down.

952
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,474
- 30.
- 30 seconds.

953
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,640
Four forward,
drifting to the right a little.

954
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,900
20 feet, down a half.

955
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,527
Drifting forward
just a little bit.

956
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,688
Light.

957
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,949
Contact light.

958
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,490
- Shutdown.
- Okay, engine stop.

959
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,746
ACA out of descent.

960
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,951
Out of descent. Auto.

961
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,116
Mode control both to auto.

962
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,284
Descent Engine Command Override,
off.

963
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,123
Engine Arm, off.

964
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,787
413 is in.

965
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,956
The arm is off.

966
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,302
We copy you down, Eagle.

967
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,847
Houston, ah.

968
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,390
Tranquility base here.

969
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,230
The Eagle has landed.

970
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,650
Roger, Tranquility.

971
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,064
We copy you on the ground.

972
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,073
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.

973
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,326
We're breathing again.
Thanks a lot.

974
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,996
Thank you.

975
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,782
Very smooth touchdown.

976
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:04,888
Houston, that may have seemed
like a very long final phase.

977
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,844
The auto targeting
was taking us

978
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,475
right into a football field
sized crater,

979
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,139
and it required us flying
manually over the rock field

980
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,523
to find
a reasonably good area.

981
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,184
Roger, we copy.
It was beautiful from here.

982
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,025
Be advised there are lots
of smiling faces in this room

983
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,564
and all over the world. Over.

984
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,787
We have some heart rates
for Neil Armstrong

985
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,323
during that powered descent
to the lunar surface.

986
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,241
At the time the burn
was initiated,

987
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,626
Armstrong's heart rate was 110.

988
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,833
At touchdown
on the lunar surface

989
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,873
he had a heart rate of 156,

990
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,508
and the heart rate
is now in the 90s.

991
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,921
We do not have biomedical data
on Buzz Aldrin.

992
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,095
The hatch is coming open.

993
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:55,356
Hatch reported coming open at
109 hours, 8 minutes, 5 seconds.

994
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,891
Okay, Houston, I'm on the porch.

995
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,227
Roger, Neil.

996
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,606
Okay, everything's nice
and straight in here.

997
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,025
Okay, can you pull the door open
a little more?

998
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,119
Houston, this is Neil,
radio check.

999
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,581
Neil, this is Houston,
loud and clear.

1000
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,540
Break, break.
Buzz, this is Houston.

1001
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:23,129
Radio check and verify
TV circuit breaker in.

1002
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,920
Roger, TV circuit breaker's in.

1003
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,133
And read you loud and clear.

1004
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,218
Roger.

1005
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,144
And we're getting
a picture on the TV.

1006
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,279
You got a good picture, huh?

1007
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,406
There's a great deal
of contrast in it

1008
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,318
and currently it's upside down
in our monitor

1009
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,611
but we can make out
a fair amount of detail.

1010
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,666
Okay.

1011
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,203
I'm at the foot of the ladder.

1012
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:05,091
The LM footpads
are only depressed

1013
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,220
in the surface
about one or two inches,

1014
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:15,727
although the surface appears
to be very, very fine grained

1015
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,515
as you get close to it,
it's almost like a powder.

1016
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,808
Ground mass is very fine.

1017
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,989
Okay, I'm going to step off
the LM now.

1018
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:49,837
That's one small step for man.

1019
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,427
One giant leap for mankind.

1020
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:03,479
I only go in
a small fraction of an inch,

1021
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,567
maybe an eighth of an inch,
but I can see the footprints

1022
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,527
of my boots and the treads

1023
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:14,616
in the fine, sandy particles.

1024
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,538
Neil, this is Houston,
we're copying.

1025
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:24,045
There seems to be no difficulty
in moving around

1026
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,923
as we suspected.

1027
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:31,086
It's even perhaps easier
than the simulations of 1/6th G

1028
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,596
that we performed

1029
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,805
in various simulations
on the ground.

1030
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,267
Descent engine did not leave
a crater of any size,

1031
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,309
it has about one foot clearance
on the ground.

1032
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,317
I can see some evidence

1033
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,979
of rays emanating
from the descent engine,

1034
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,866
but a very
insignificant amount.

1035
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,996
Roger, Neil, we're reading you
loud and clear.

1036
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,997
We see you're getting
some pictures

1037
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,456
and the contingency sample.

1038
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,540
It's interesting.
It's a very soft surface

1039
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,330
but here and there
where I plug

1040
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,999
with the contingency sample
collector,

1041
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,419
I run into very hard surface

1042
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,885
but it appears to be
a very cohesive material

1043
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,347
of the same sort.

1044
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,556
I'll try to get a rock in here.

1045
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,599
That looks beautiful
from here, Neil.

1046
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,984
It has a stark beauty
all its own.

1047
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,395
It's like much
of the high desert

1048
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,313
of the United States.

1049
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,450
It's different,
but it's very pretty out here.

1050
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,073
That in the pocket?

1051
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,829
Ah, yeah, push down.

1052
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,082
Got it?

1053
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,709
No, it's not all the way in.
Push it.

1054
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,839
There you go.

1055
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:57,051
Contingency sample
is in the pocket.

1056
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:01,264
My oxygen is 81%.

1057
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,895
I have no flags
and I'm in minimum flow.

1058
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,933
Okay, I got the camera going
at one frame a second.

1059
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,317
Ready for me to come out?

1060
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,568
Yeah, just stand by a second,

1061
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,104
I'll move this
over the handrail.

1062
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,613
How far are my feet from the...

1063
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,741
Okay, you're right
at the edge of the porch.

1064
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:21,280
Okay, now I want to back up
and partially close the hatch...

1065
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,166
making sure not to lock it
on my way out.

1066
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,452
Particularly good thought.

1067
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,370
That's our home
for the next couple hours.

1068
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:31,335
We want to take good care of it.

1069
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,501
You've got three more steps,
and then a long one.

1070
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,183
Beautiful view.

1071
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,389
Isn't that something?

1072
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,680
Magnificent sight out here.

1073
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:49,600
Magnificent desolation.

1074
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:53,736
Okay, Houston, I'm going
to change lenses on you.

1075
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,487
Roger, Neil.

1076
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,023
We're getting a new picture,

1077
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,488
you can tell it's
a longer focal length lens.

1078
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,199
For those who haven't read
the plaque,

1079
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,160
we'll read the plaque
that's on the front landing gear

1080
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,619
of this LM:

1081
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,785
Here men from the planet Earth

1082
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,874
first set foot upon the moon.

1083
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:14,165
July 1969 A.D.

1084
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,085
We came in peace
for all mankind.

1085
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:20,596
Neil Armstrong getting ready
to move the TV camera now

1086
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,973
out to its panorama position.

1087
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,930
I got plenty of cable.

1088
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,096
You got plenty, plenty more.

1089
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,150
Okay, that looks
good there, Neil.

1090
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,407
Okay.

1091
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,319
One hour, seven minutes
time expended.

1092
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,613
Buzz is erecting
the solar wind experiment now.

1093
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,998
Some of these small
depressions...

1094
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,035
through the upper surface
of the soil

1095
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,420
and about five or six inches
of bay

1096
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,332
breaks loose and moves

1097
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,841
as if it were caked
on the surface

1098
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,128
when in fact it really isn't.

1099
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,797
Houston, Columbia
on high gain, over.

1100
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,306
Columbia, this is Houston,

1101
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,094
reading you loud and clear,
over.

1102
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,228
Yeah, reading you loud
and clear. How's it going?

1103
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,605
Roger, the EVA
is progressing beautifully.

1104
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,767
They're setting up the flag now.

1105
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,230
Great.

1106
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,985
I guess you're about
the only person around

1107
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,773
that doesn't have
TV coverage of the scene.

1108
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,942
How is the quality of the TV?

1109
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,700
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike,
it really is.

1110
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,532
They've got the flag up now
and you can see

1111
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:30,700
the stars and stripes
from the lunar surface.

1112
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,789
Beautiful, just beautiful.

1113
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,415
Ah, Neil and Buzz.

1114
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,710
The President of the United
States is in his Office now

1115
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,756
and would like to say
a few words to you, over.

1116
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,390
That would be an honor.

1117
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,800
Go ahead, Mr. President.

1118
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,766
This is Houston out.

1119
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,305
Hello, Neil and Buzz.

1120
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,394
I'm talking to you by telephone

1121
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,729
from the Oval Room
at the White House.

1122
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,442
And this certainly has to be
the most historic telephone call

1123
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,402
ever made from the White House.

1124
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,158
I just can't tell you
how proud we all are

1125
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,444
of what you have done.

1126
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,283
For every American,
this has to be

1127
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,118
the proudest day
of our lives.

1128
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,954
And for people
all over the world,

1129
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,039
because of what you have done,

1130
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,252
the heavens have become
a part of man's world.

1131
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,214
And as you talk to us
from the Sea of Tranquility,

1132
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,629
it inspires us
to redouble our efforts

1133
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,550
to bring peace
and tranquility to Earth.

1134
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:32,516
For one priceless moment,
in the whole history of man,

1135
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:35,932
all the people on this Earth
are truly one.

1136
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,271
One in their pride
in what you have done;

1137
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,403
and one in our prayers

1138
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,440
that you will return safely
to Earth.

1139
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,902
Thank you, Mr. President.

1140
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,444
It's a great honor and privilege
for us to be here,

1141
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,034
representing not only
the United States

1142
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,496
but men of peace
of all nations,

1143
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,752
men with interests
and a curiosity

1144
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,753
and with the vision
for the future.

1145
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,917
It's an honor for us to be able
to participate here today.

1146
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,640
Neil's been on the surface
an hour now,

1147
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,893
Buzz not quite,
20 minutes less than that.

1148
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:17,148
Heart rates on both crewmen
averaging between 90 and 100.

1149
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:20,856
I don't note any abnormalities
in the LM.

1150
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,611
Quads seem to be in good shape,

1151
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,945
the primary and secondary struts
are in good shape,

1152
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,826
antennas are all in place,

1153
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,908
there's no evidence
of a problem underneath.

1154
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:35,371
The SEQ bay contains
the scientific experiments

1155
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,125
to be left
on the surface of the moon.

1156
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,082
Have you got us
a good area picked out?

1157
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,042
Buzz Aldrin carrying
the two experiments.

1158
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,707
Straight out on that rise
out there

1159
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,466
is probably as good as any.

1160
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,128
I'm going to have to get on the
other side of this rock here.

1161
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,423
The laser reflector
is installed,

1162
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,216
and the bubble's level

1163
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,853
and the alignment
appears to be good.

1164
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,559
They've been on
their life support systems

1165
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,973
2 hours and 25 minutes.

1166
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,893
Houston, I have
the seismic experiment

1167
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,279
flipped over now
and I'm aligning it with the sun

1168
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:10,068
and all parts of the solar array
are clear of the ground now.

1169
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,079
Buzz Aldrin is collecting
a core tube sample.

1170
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:14,864
It almost looks wet.

1171
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,124
Got it! Sampled.

1172
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,329
Neil, this is Houston.

1173
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,495
After you've got the core tubes

1174
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,539
and the solar wind,

1175
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,333
anything else
that you can throw into the box

1176
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,967
would be acceptable.

1177
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,550
Houston, we've got about
I'd say 20 pounds

1178
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,841
of carefully selected,
if not documented, samples.

1179
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,101
Houston, roger, well done, out.

1180
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,648
Anything more
before I head on up, Bruce?

1181
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,404
Negative,
head on up the ladder, Buzz.

1182
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,782
Adios, amigos.

1183
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,488
Transferring
the sample containers

1184
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,993
into the LM cabin now.

1185
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:57,499
Unofficial time off the surface
at 111:37:32.

1186
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:02,287
Okay, the hatch is closed
and latched and verified secure.

1187
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,080
Okay.

1188
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,124
And we'd like to say

1189
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:10,011
from all of us
down here in Houston

1190
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,923
and really from all of us
in all the countries

1191
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,717
in the entire world,
we think that you've done

1192
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,556
a magnificent job
up there today.

1193
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:18,604
Over.

1194
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,559
Thank you very much.

1195
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,941
It's been a long day.

1196
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,601
Yes indeed,
get some rest there,

1197
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,485
and have at it tomorrow.

1198
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,493
Not since Adam has any human
known such solitude

1199
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,706
as Mike Collins is experiencing

1200
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,463
during the 47 minutes
of each lunar revolution

1201
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,797
when he's behind the moon,
while he waits for his comrades

1202
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,882
to soar with Eagle
from Tranquility Base,

1203
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,843
and rejoin him
for the trip back to earth.

1204
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,099
Collins, with the help
of flight controllers here

1205
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,509
in Mission Control Center,

1206
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,223
has kept
the Command Module systems

1207
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,435
going pocketa pocketa pocketa.

1208
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:07,727
Columbia, Columbia,
good morning from Houston.

1209
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,363
How's the black team today?
All primed and rarin' to go?

1210
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,491
Ah, you betcha there, Mike.

1211
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,367
Going to keep you
a little busy here...

1212
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,449
soon as we get
the state vector in,

1213
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:22,037
we'd like you to go ahead
and do a P52, option 3.

1214
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,702
And then when you come on around
the other side there,

1215
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:30,295
we'll give you some landmark
tracking information on 130.

1216
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,051
All right, fine, understand.
Thank you.

1217
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,678
Tranquility Base, Houston.

1218
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,304
How was the resting
standing up there?

1219
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,342
Did you get a chance to curl up
on the engine can?

1220
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,394
Ah, roger.

1221
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,678
Neil has rigged himself

1222
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:42,936
a really good hammock

1223
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,472
with a waist tether

1224
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:47,107
and he's been lying
on the ascent engine cover

1225
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,064
and I curled up
on the floor. Over.

1226
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,819
Ah, roger. Copy, Buzz.

1227
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,447
Our science support room
here in Mission Control Center

1228
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,528
reports receiving
continuous data

1229
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,660
from the passive
seismic experiment

1230
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:01,163
placed on the lunar surface last
night by the Apollo 11 crew...

1231
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,995
recorded the astronauts'
footsteps on the moon

1232
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,330
and will probably receive
its strongest signal

1233
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,498
when the ascent engine ignites
and starts Eagle on its way

1234
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,384
into lunar orbit
and rendezvous with Columbia.

1235
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,919
Tranquility Base, Houston.

1236
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,178
Go ahead.

1237
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,009
Ah, roger.
Just a reminder here,

1238
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,514
we want to make sure you leave

1239
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:23,348
the rendezvous radar
circuit breakers pulled.

1240
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,887
Okay.

1241
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,602
Eagle and Columbia,
this is the backup crew.

1242
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,108
Congratulations
on yesterday's performance

1243
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,941
and our prayers are with you
for the rendezvous, over.

1244
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,276
- Thank you, Jim.
- Thank you, Jim.

1245
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,246
Almost 5,000 pounds
of propellant

1246
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,657
will be run through
the ascent engine

1247
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,166
on the ascent burn

1248
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,578
which will place Eagle
back into lunar orbit

1249
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,087
and following that,

1250
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,874
the rendezvous sequence
consummate,

1251
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:57,591
completed with the docking
at 128 hours approximately.

1252
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,552
Flight Operations Director,
Chris Kraft,

1253
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,434
commented that some 500 million
people around the world

1254
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,097
were helping push Eagle off
the moon and back into orbit.

1255
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,856
Flight director Glynn Lunney
is polling the various positions

1256
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,644
here in the control room
on their readiness.

1257
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,687
- FIDO, status.
- Got it all, Flight, good to go.

1258
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,526
- GUIDANCE.
- Waiting for GUIDANCE steering

1259
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,735
at two minutes.

1260
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,195
- CONTROL.
- We're go, Flight.

1261
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,405
- TELCOM.
- Go, Flight.

1262
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,989
- Surgeon.
- Go, Flight.

1263
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,030
We see it, Flight. Looks good.

1264
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,950
Tranquility Base, Houston.

1265
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,287
Roger, go ahead.

1266
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,453
Roger, Eagle's looking

1267
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,212
real fine to us down here.

1268
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:34,465
And you're clear for takeoff.

1269
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:35,590
Roger, understand.

1270
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,501
We're number one on the runway.

1271
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,847
GUIDANCE reports
both navigation systems on Eagle

1272
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,102
are looking good.

1273
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,443
Nine, eight, seven,

1274
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,319
six, five,

1275
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,607
abort stage, engine arm,
ascent, proceed.

1276
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,920
- The Eagle has wings.
- Stand by for pitchover.

1277
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:09,700
Pitching over.

1278
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,243
Very smooth.

1279
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,882
We're going right down U.S. 1.

1280
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,347
Roger.

1281
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,304
Not very much thruster activity.

1282
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,560
FLIGHT, FIDO, PNGS MSFIN,
we're looking good.

1283
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:31,939
- Okay, mighty fine.
- Go, both systems.

1284
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:35,192
30 seconds, Flight.

1285
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,818
700, 150 up. Beautiful.

1286
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,320
- TELCOM.
- Go.

1287
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,192
Eagle, Houston, you're still
looking mighty fine.

1288
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:47,864
Roger, good agreement in Delta-V
to go in both AGS and PNGS.

1289
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,076
Roger.

1290
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:53,916
All three data sources
are agreeing quite closely here.

1291
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,376
Eagle, Houston.
Aft Omni, low-bit rate,

1292
01:08:56,424 --> 01:09:00,293
and we'll see you
at 127 plus 51.

1293
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:23,358
127 hours, 39 minutes,
39.2 seconds.

1294
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,991
This is the start time

1295
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,574
for a series
of velocity match maneuvers

1296
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,330
to bring Eagle in with Columbia.

1297
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:50,601
Uh, Houston, the AGS has
a Delta-H of 15.5

1298
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,309
and a maneuver of 51.3.

1299
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,849
Roger, we copy.

1300
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:01,737
As the two vehicles come around
on the 26th lunar revolution,

1301
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,694
Mike Collins aboard Columbia
is spring loaded

1302
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,486
to do what is called
a mirror image maneuver.

1303
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,724
Okay, we're about
seven feet a second

1304
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,101
coming in at you.

1305
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:51,616
Eagle, Columbia.

1306
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,997
I've got 470 now for R-dot,

1307
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,282
and I just broke lock.

1308
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,701
Could you hold silence
for a few seconds here

1309
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,495
while I re-acquire?

1310
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,855
Columbia has reacquired you.

1311
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,189
Okay, Mike, I'll try
to get in position here

1312
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,325
and then you got it.

1313
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,905
Eagle, Columbia's
starting to maneuver

1314
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,661
to TPI attitude.

1315
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,822
Okay.

1316
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,718
Okay, I got it from here.

1317
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,769
Looks good, Mike.

1318
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,657
(indistinct), okay.

1319
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,410
Okay, we're all yours,
Columbia.

1320
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,745
Communications are
somewhat scratchy.

1321
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,537
Columbia and Eagle
now reunited

1322
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:26,127
to become Apollo 11 again.

1323
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:29,259
Apollo 11, Houston, about
a minute and a half to LOS,

1324
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,419
you're looking great.

1325
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,383
It's been a mighty fine day.

1326
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,388
Boy, you're not kidding.

1327
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,049
Armstrong and Aldrin
transferring back

1328
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,389
to the Command Module
with Mike Collins.

1329
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,770
Houston, this is Columbia
reading you loud and clear.

1330
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,182
We're all three back inside,
the hatch is installed,

1331
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,941
we're running a pressure
check-leak check.

1332
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,818
Everything's going well.

1333
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,446
Roger. How's it feel up there
to have some company?

1334
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,026
Damn good, I'll tell ya.

1335
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,532
I bet.

1336
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,012
I bet you'd almost be
talking to yourself up there

1337
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,494
after 10 revs or so.

1338
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,280
Ah, no.
It's a happy home up here,

1339
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,496
it'd be nice to have
100 million Americans up here.

1340
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:03,080
Rog.

1341
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,315
They were with you in spirit
anyway, at least that many.

1342
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,955
Thank you, sir.

1343
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,000
And Apollo 11, Houston.

1344
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,543
All your systems
look real good to us.

1345
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,680
We would like you
to jettison Eagle.

1346
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,888
You're go for power arm
and you're go for jettison.

1347
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,177
Okay.

1348
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,810
There she goes.
She was a good one.

1349
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,020
Roger dodger.

1350
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,651
We got Eagle looking good.

1351
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,562
It's holding cabin pressure
and it picked up

1352
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:33,824
about two feet per second
from that jettison.

1353
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:36,906
The crew jettisoned the LM
at 130 hours 30 minutes.

1354
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,743
We're now 10 seconds away
from Trans-Earth Injection.

1355
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,408
They will burn their service
propulsion system engine

1356
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,202
for 2 minutes, 28 seconds,

1357
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,497
to start them
on their way back to earth.

1358
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:51,132
Apollo 11, Houston.
one minute to LOS.

1359
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,793
The trans-earth
injection maneuver

1360
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,757
will be performed
on backside of the moon

1361
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,343
at the beginning
of the 31st revolution.

1362
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,555
We'll reacquire the spacecraft
on the other side of the moon.

1363
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,595
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston.

1364
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,041
You're looking good
going over the hill.

1365
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,977
Go sic 'em!

1366
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,891
Thank you, sir.
We'll do it.

1367
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,404
Standby for ullage.

1368
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,189
Ullage.

1369
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,113
Copy.

1370
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:29,997
Burn!

1371
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,585
- A good one.
- Nice.

1372
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,487
- I got two balls.
- Okay, here come the other two.

1373
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:37,300
...barber pole, gray,
the other two are on good.

1374
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,590
Man, that feels like g,
doesn't it?

1375
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,523
One minute.

1376
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,984
Chamber pressure's
holding right on 100.

1377
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,898
(indistinct) pressure.

1378
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,617
Gimbals look good.

1379
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,033
Total attitude looks good.

1380
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:09,749
Rates are damped out
a little bit.

1381
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,800
Standing by for engine off.

1382
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,637
It should be shut down now.

1383
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,766
Okay.

1384
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,803
Shutdown.

1385
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,687
Beautiful.

1386
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,973
Beautiful burn.

1387
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,106
SPS, I love you!

1388
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:32,985
You are a jewel!

1389
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,691
AOS.

1390
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,152
And there's the cue,
we have acquisition of signal.

1391
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,277
Halleluiah!

1392
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:42,114
Thank you, Charlie boy.

1393
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:43,279
Looking good here.

1394
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,370
That was a beautiful burn.

1395
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,702
- They don't come any finer.
- Rog.

1396
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,834
Tell 'em to open up
the LRL doors, Charlie.

1397
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,837
Roger, we got you coming home.

1398
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,096
Let's get some music...
how about these tapes?

1399
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,262
Hey, this should be
getting larger.

1400
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:14,681
And if it is, it's the place
we're coming home to.

1401
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,146
No matter where you travel,
it's always nice to get home.

1402
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:22,029
We concur, 11... we'll be
happy to have you back.

1403
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:35,709
Apollo 11 now 94,961
nautical miles from Earth.

1404
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,289
Re-entry is scheduled to begin

1405
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,922
18 hours, 18 minutes
and 12 seconds.

1406
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,083
How's old Flight, Bruce?

1407
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,092
Did he ever let you go
get a cup of coffee

1408
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,800
while we were over
on the backside?

1409
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,743
Things have been going
pretty smoothly down here.

1410
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:53,181
He's really not that hard
to get along with.

1411
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,687
Ah, he must be mellowing.

1412
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,144
Well, we've only got two
of them back here right now.

1413
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:00,605
The next item scheduled
on the flight plan

1414
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,316
is a television transmission.

1415
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:06,573
You may be interested in knowing
that Jan and the children,

1416
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,325
and Pat and the youngsters
and Andy Aldrin

1417
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:13,740
are down here in the viewing
room watching this evening.

1418
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:14,911
Oh, we're glad to hear that.

1419
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,707
You have good S-band
signal strength now, Houston?

1420
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,872
Okay, you're coming through
loud and clear now, 11,

1421
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,507
with your patch.

1422
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:28,090
This has been far more
than three men

1423
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,347
on a voyage to the moon.

1424
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:34,510
We feel that
this stands as a symbol

1425
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:38,225
of the insatiable curiosity
of all mankind

1426
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,641
to explore the unknown.

1427
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:45,188
This operation is somewhat like
the periscope of a submarine.

1428
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,447
All you see is the three of us.

1429
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,278
But beneath the surface

1430
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,568
are thousands and thousands
of others.

1431
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,613
We'd like to give
a special thanks

1432
01:19:54,665 --> 01:20:00,332
to all those Americans
who built this spacecraft,

1433
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:02,416
who did the construction,

1434
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,922
design, the tests,

1435
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:10,964
and put their hearts
and all their abilities

1436
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:14,554
into those crafts.

1437
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:19,062
To those people, tonight
we give a special thank you.

1438
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:22,770
And to all the other people
that are listening

1439
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,060
and watching tonight,

1440
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,398
God bless you.

1441
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,530
Goodnight from Apollo 11.

1442
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,621
Weather in the recovery area:

1443
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,959
Skies will be partly cloudy,
six-foot sea,

1444
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:47,715
temperature near 80 degrees.

1445
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,051
This landing area is
215 miles to the northeast

1446
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,306
from the original landing area,

1447
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,388
it moved because
of thundershowers

1448
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,429
in the original area.

1449
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,940
Apollo 11's distance now
is 3,000 nautical miles,

1450
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:08,399
velocity 26,685 feet per second.

1451
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,860
In the next 20 minutes,
Apollo 11 will add

1452
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:13,742
almost 10,000 feet per second
to that figure.

1453
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:17,746
Entry at 75 statute miles.

1454
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,249
Beginning blackout
at 62 statute miles.

1455
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:25,037
And main shoot deployment
10,500 feet.

1456
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:44,973
And 11, Houston.

1457
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,517
Weather's still holding
real fine in the recovery area,

1458
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,482
looks like it's about 1500
scattered, high scattered,

1459
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,490
and still
three to six foot waves

1460
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:55,196
The air part of it sounds good.

1461
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,405
Roger.

1462
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,365
The Earth is really
getting bigger up here

1463
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,623
and of course
we see a crescent.

1464
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,186
Apollo 11 lined up
right down the middle

1465
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,293
of the entry corridor.

1466
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,250
We're a minute and 45
seconds from entry.

1467
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:12,212
Blackout will begin
18 seconds after entry.

1468
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,752
Apollo 11, Houston.

1469
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:15,073
You're still looking
mighty fine here,

1470
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:18,135
you're cleared for landing.

1471
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,924
Ah, we appreciate that Ron.
Thank you.

1472
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:22,640
Rog. Gear's down and locked.

1473
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,145
Roger.

1474
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,897
Guidance officer reports
the Command Module computer

1475
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,231
looks good and the guidance
and navigation system is go.

1476
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,645
And 11, Houston.

1477
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:32,924
You're going over the hill
there shortly,

1478
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,782
you're looking
mighty fine to us.

1479
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,283
See you later.

1480
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:44,912
There's the horizon.

1481
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,792
Got the horizon now.

1482
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,720
And beginning of blackout
approximately 17 seconds

1483
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,973
after entry interface
into the atmosphere.

1484
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:47,103
400,000 feet or approximately
85 miles above the Earth.

1485
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,776
At blackout,
we were showing velocity

1486
01:23:56,823 --> 01:24:00,942
36,237 feet per second.

1487
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:06,831
Range to go to splash,
1510 nautical miles.

1488
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,242
(indistinct) LOS.

1489
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,412
Redstone LOS blackout.

1490
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,080
Roger, you have arrived...

1491
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:17,296
Apollo 11,
Houston through ARIA.

1492
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:24,182
We're looking
for your (indistinct).

1493
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,219
Apollo 11,
Houston through ARIA.

1494
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,446
Apollo 11,
Houston through ARIA 4.

1495
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,925
Okay, CAPCOM, one last call here
and we'll have to give up

1496
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:10,971
and let the recovery people
have it.

1497
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:14,391
Apollo 11, Houston through ARIA.

1498
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,938
Apollo 11, Apollo 11,
this is Hornet, Hornet, over.

1499
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,028
This is Apollo 11,
we read you loud and clear.

1500
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:28,117
Our position, 133016915.

1501
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,906
There they are!

1502
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,257
The condition of crew, over.

1503
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,009
The condition of crew...

1504
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,842
4,000-3500 feet
on the way down.

1505
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:50,852
Latitude, longitude,
13,30; 169,15... over.

1506
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,013
Hornet roger, copy out.

1507
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,682
Hornet reports spacecraft
right on target point.

1508
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:56,850
Splashdown!

1509
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,985
Hornet, splashdown.

1510
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:02,193
Hornet copies.

1511
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:07,326
This is SWIM 1, the
Command Module is at stable 1.

1512
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,112
Hornet roger.

1513
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,202
Stable 1 now, stable 1.

1514
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,440
Our condition is
all three excellent.

1515
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:20,207
We're just fine,
take your time.

1516
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:23,126
That was Mike Collins reporting
the crew is excellent.

1517
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,510
Doing all right,

1518
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,920
third astronaut
is in the net

1519
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,840
and on his way up.

1520
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:31,179
Clear the Command Module.

1521
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:39,480
Everybody's in the hatch
and finally in the helicopter.

1522
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,276
This is Recovery 1.

1523
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,032
I have three astronauts
aboard,

1524
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:52,118
switching power and frequency,
power and frequency.

1525
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,031
Recovery 1, Hornet.
Understand Big Swimmer

1526
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,620
has completed his
decontamination

1527
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,456
of the Command Module.

1528
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,382
The elevator will
take Recovery 1

1529
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:09,423
down to the hangar deck
where the crew will enter

1530
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,012
the Mobile Quarantine facility.

1531
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,098
This control center becoming
jammed with people.

1532
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,638
We've never seen
this many people

1533
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,273
in the control center
at one time before.

1534
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,483
The Apollo 11 plaque
has been hung

1535
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,114
in the Mission Control Center,

1536
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,196
a replica of the crew patch.

1537
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,521
And the flags are waving
and the cigars are being lit up,

1538
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:04,231
and clear across
the big board in front

1539
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:10,446
is President John F. Kennedy's
message to Congress

1540
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:12,952
from May 1961.

1541
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:18,666
Even though I realize
that this is in some measure

1542
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,418
an act of faith and vision,

1543
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,580
for we do not now know

1544
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,589
what benefits await us.

1545
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:28,968
But if I were to say,
my fellow citizens,

1546
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,595
that we shall send to the moon,

1547
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:37,432
240,000 miles away from
the control station in Houston,

1548
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:41,814
a giant rocket
more than 300 feet tall,

1549
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,850
fitted together with
a precision better

1550
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:46,110
than the finest watch,

1551
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,067
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion,

1552
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,401
guidance, control,

1553
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:53,909
communications,
food, and survival,

1554
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:56,162
on an untried mission,

1555
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,823
to an unknown celestial body,

1556
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:01,583
and then return it
safely to Earth,

1557
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,836
reentering the atmosphere
at speeds of over

1558
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,873
25,000 miles per hour,

1559
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:10,384
causing heat about half that
of the temperature of the sun,

1560
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,761
almost as hot
as it is here today,

1561
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:16,891
and do all this,
and do all this and do it right,

1562
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:20,428
and do it first,
before this decade is out,

1563
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,392
then we must be bold.

1564
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,646
Man's first trip to the moon,

1565
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,226
a magnificent
eight-day voyage

1566
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,517
spanning time and space
and history,

1567
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,312
ended today when
three American explorers

1568
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,948
brought their small ship
down safely in the Pacific.

1569
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:57,904
Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong,

1570
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,740
Edwin Aldrin,
and Michael Collins

1571
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:02,496
landed their spacecraft
southwest of Hawaii

1572
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,873
at ten minutes of one,
Eastern time,

1573
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:06,784
nine miles from
the recovery ship

1574
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,668
and two miles off target.

1575
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,670
After donning
protective clothing,

1576
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:12,377
the three astronauts
were airlifted

1577
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,041
to the carrier Hornet,

1578
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,962
and transferred to
a special isolation chamber.

1579
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:19,005
They'll be quarantined
18 days

1580
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:21,720
while scientists determine
if they've brought back

1581
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:24,101
any dangerous lunar organisms.

1582
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,888
Their flight climaxed
centuries of dreaming

1583
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,853
and months and years
of planning and training.

1584
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,039
I'd like to take this
opportunity particularly

1585
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:51,295
to thank all those of you
I see out there

1586
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,376
who are my gracious hosts

1587
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,087
here in the lunar
receiving laboratory.

1588
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:58,674
And I can't say that
I would choose to spend

1589
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,384
a couple of weeks like that,

1590
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,925
but I'm very glad
that we got the opportunity

1591
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,388
to complete the mission.
