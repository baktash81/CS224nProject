1
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,930
<i>Hello.</i>

2
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,130
Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to talk to you today.

3
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,447
My name is Mark Schultz.

4
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,843
I wanna talk about America,

5
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,091
and I wanna tell you why I wrestle.

6
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,485
This is an Olympic gold medal.

7
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,650
I won this three years ago

8
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,646
at the 23rd Olympic Games
in Los Angeles, California.

9
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,921
This is more than just
some piece of metal.

10
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,330
It's about what the metal represents.

11
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,728
The virtues it requires to attain it.

12
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,971
Twenty dollars and zero cents.

13
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,202
Is it Dave or David?

14
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,243
No, it's Mark.

15
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,204
Mark Schultz.

16
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,924
Um...

17
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,642
Yeah. Dave's my brother.

18
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,128
Oh.
He was originally scheduled.

19
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,845
Okay.

20
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,008
We both won golds.

21
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,486
Make it the
works, and coffee.

22
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,401
- For here?
- Yes.

23
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,046
Number two, number three, here.

24
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,446
<i>Please come, coach.</i>

25
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,251
We don't want to put any pressure
on you right now.

26
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,525
- You gotta think it through and all that.
- No, I get it. I appreciate it.

27
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,648
That's why I didn't wrestle him.

28
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,644
But didn't you miss that match?
I missed that match.

29
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,246
Hey, Mark.

30
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,802
You know the guys
from U.S.A. Wrestling.

31
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,281
Mark, how's it going?
Fred, Bruce, Greg.

32
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,930
Hey, Mark.

33
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,482
Well, all right.
All right.

34
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,484
- Just give us a call.
- Appreciate it, Bruce.

35
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,325
Thanks for coming all this way. Okay.
All right.

36
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,404
- Hey, have a good workout.
- Thank you.

37
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,689
Hey, buddy.

38
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,246
You all right?

39
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,611
Hey, you been calling my machine
and hanging up?

40
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,081
What? Come on.

41
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,642
What do you mean?
Somebody's leaving hang-ups

42
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,962
on my machine.
Come on.

43
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,285
Come on.

44
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,684
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

45
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,809
Okay.

46
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,161
Mark. Come on.

47
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,491
Keep your hips in.

48
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,208
Keep your hips in, Mark.

49
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,364
Heh.

50
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,289
Same time tomorrow?
Yeah.

51
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,211
What'd the U.S.A.
Wrestling guys want?

52
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,204
We're talking about me
doing some coaching.

53
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,604
In Colorado.

54
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,529
Hey. Give me a hug.

55
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,165
Hello?

56
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,766
<i>Hello. May I speak with Mark Schultz?</i>

57
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,404
Speaking.

58
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,121
<i>Mark Schultz, the Olympic wrestler?</i>

59
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,570
Yeah. Who is this?

60
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,326
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. John E. du Pont.</i>

61
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,006
<i>He has been anxious
to get in touch with you.</i>

62
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,688
<i>Who?
John E. du Pont of the du Pont family.</i>

63
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,564
<i>Mr. du Pont asked that you consider
taking</i> a <i>day off</i>

64
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,882
<i>to come out to Foxcatcher Farms,</i>

65
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,725
<i>so you men can meet face-to-face.</i>

66
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,644
About what?

67
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,402
<i>He'd like to discuss it in person
in Pennsylvania.</i>

68
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,087
<i>If I may, I'd like to make travel
arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz.</i>

69
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,169
<i>First class, of course.</i>

70
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,082
Who'd you say again?

71
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,609
<i>John E. du Pont,
of the du Pont family.</i>

72
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,561
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia
International Airport.</i>

73
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,850
Mark, Mr. du Pont wanted
to fly you himself today.

74
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,005
But last minute, he got called in by
the Newtown Square Police Department.

75
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,328
For tactical support.

76
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,164
He should be back at the estate
by the time we get there.

77
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,530
By the way,
that's Valley Forge below you.

78
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,603
This is the library.

79
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,046
Mr. du Pont should be here
in a few minutes.

80
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,326
Okay.

81
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,044
Mark.

82
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,763
John du Pont.

83
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,808
Thrilled.
Thrilled that you're here.

84
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,121
Let's go downstairs.

85
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,168
We call this the trophy room,
for obvious reasons.

86
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,930
Have a seat.

87
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,365
How was your flight?

88
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,806
It was good.
Good.

89
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,445
Thank you.

90
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,887
Can I get you something
to eat or drink?

91
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,849
Oh, no. No, I'm good. Thank you.

92
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,321
I could have them
whip you up something.

93
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,051
No, sir, I'm fine.

94
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,690
Good.

95
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,610
Well, I know how busy
you must be.

96
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,491
I assume you're training for the Worlds?
Yes, sir.

97
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,244
Good.

98
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,249
It's a big one.

99
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,884
How is training?

100
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,805
It's good. Um...

101
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,450
It's intense.

102
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,929
We're in two-a-days.

103
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,211
Conditioning and weights
in the morning

104
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,362
and technique...

105
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,329
We wrestle in the evenings.

106
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,723
That's good. Get yourself prepared.

107
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,689
Work hard.

108
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,086
You look good. You look strong.

109
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,131
Fit.
Thank you, sir.

110
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,203
Feeling confident?

111
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,811
That's one of the most important
elements of entering a match

112
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,249
is feeling the confidence,
knowing that you're going to win.

113
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,448
Feeling it inside.

114
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,720
If you go to a match knowing
that you're going to win that match,

115
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,168
odds are
you're going to win that match.

116
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,607
You're training
with your brother Dave?

117
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,001
Yes, sir.
Great Dave Schultz?

118
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,527
Yeah.
I'm talking to the great Mark Schultz.

119
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,051
Do you have any idea
why I asked you to come here?

120
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,690
No.
No.

121
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,923
Well, Mark, do you...?

122
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,481
Do you have any idea who I am?

123
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,764
No. No.

124
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,766
Some rich guy calls you
on the phone.

125
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,647
"I want Mark Schultz to come visit me."

126
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,923
Well, I'm a... I'm a wrestling coach.

127
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,526
And I have a deep love
of the sport of wrestling.

128
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,847
And I wanted to speak with you
about your future.

129
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,731
About what you hope to achieve.

130
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,566
What do you hope to achieve, Mark?

131
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,321
Well, I wanna be the best
in the world.

132
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,127
I wanna go to Worlds and win gold.

133
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,807
I wanna go to the '88 Olympics
in Seoul and win gold.

134
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,565
Good.

135
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,643
I'm proud of you.

136
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,086
Are you getting the support
that you need?

137
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,724
What do you mean, sir?

138
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,804
Well, you know how the Soviets
support their wrestlers.

139
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,721
I do.

140
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,283
Mark, we as a nation
have failed to honor you.

141
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,563
And that's a problem.

142
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,251
Not just for you, but for our society.

143
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,490
When we fail to honor that
which should be honored,

144
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,928
it's a problem.

145
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,206
It's a canary in a coal mine.

146
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,369
Do you bird-watch?

147
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,847
Uh, no.
You can learn a lot from birds.

148
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,445
I'm an ornithologist.

149
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,570
But more importantly, I am a patriot.

150
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,841
And I want to see
this country soar again.

151
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,088
I want that too.

152
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,569
I can see that.

153
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,404
I'd like us to go to Seoul,
stun the world.

154
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,283
What do you think?

155
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,764
Three thousand men died here.

156
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,730
These patriots were willing
to give up everything...

157
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,441
including their lives...

158
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,129
for freedom.

159
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,169
I like to come here
to remind myself what really matters.

160
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,206
We're going to do great things, Mark.

161
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,723
Great things.

162
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes, sir.

163
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,847
<i>♪ Can you answer?
Yes I can ♪</i>

164
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,571
<i>♪ But what would be the answer
To the answer man? ♪♪</i>

165
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,529
Hey, Mark.
Hey.

166
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,286
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Mark. Yeah.

167
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,526
Can I talk to him?
Go on.

168
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,081
Here! Do something.

169
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,527
The country has lost their morals
and values, and the kids are lost

170
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,684
and they don't have role models,
and I agreed with him.

171
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,370
Hm.
Everything he was saying.

172
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,889
I couldn't believe
he was saying stuff that I...
It was in my head all the time.

173
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,927
Did you guys talk...?
Did you talk money?

174
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,809
Yeah, yeah.
What's he talking?

175
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,122
You ready?
Yeah.

176
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,807
Twenty-five thousand a year.

177
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,850
He said, "Name your price"

178
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,571
and I just said the highest price
in my head.

179
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,883
And we get to handpick our team.

180
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,369
Who are you gonna train with?

181
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,363
No. No, we're...

182
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,003
I meant "we" as in me and you,
together, picking a team.

183
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,968
Mr. du Pont and I
would love to have you.

184
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,683
Mark, what's, uh...?

185
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,842
What's he get out of all this?

186
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,048
Mr. du Pont?
Yeah.

187
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,567
America winning.

188
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,043
You winning.
We talked about you.

189
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,929
Me winning.

190
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,162
Okay.
What are you thinking about, Dave?

191
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,805
This is it.

192
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,724
This is everything that we've...
That we've ever wanted.

193
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,161
Mark, I can't leave.

194
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,162
I'm settled here.

195
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,527
Nancy's happy.

196
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,206
Xander's doing well at school.

197
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,241
They can come.

198
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,606
Mark,

199
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,929
I got a contract,
I got commitments.

200
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,924
That's great for you.

201
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,802
I should just pass this up
to be your training partner?

202
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,611
Mark. Mark.

203
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,240
This could be
a real good thing for you.

204
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,568
I'm proud of you.

205
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,847
I think you can make something
real good for yourself here.

206
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,570
Yeah?
Yeah.

207
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,922
I love you, Mark.

208
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,126
Hi. ls, uh, Mr. du Pont home?

209
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,851
Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?

210
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,445
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,484
Not at this exact moment,
but, you know, this week sometime.

212
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,721
I'm Mark Schultz.

213
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,041
Have a seat here,
for a moment.

214
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,811
I need to...

215
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,960
Do you have a commode?

216
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,731
Or, like, a washroom
or something I could use?

217
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,611
Just in there to the left.
Thank you.

218
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,563
Mr. Beck will see you now.

219
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,485
I'm... I'm sorry. Who?

220
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,882
All right. How old are you, Mark?

221
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,241
Twenty-seven.

222
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,526
Education?

223
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
University of Oklahoma.

224
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,843
Undergraduate?

225
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,446
And you graduated?
Yes, sir.

226
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,849
Do you own any property, Mark?

227
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,445
No.

228
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,603
Are your parents still together?

229
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,125
No.

230
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,806
How old were you
when they separated?

231
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,091
Two.

232
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,489
Who raised you?

233
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,806
Well, we moved around a lot.

234
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,611
But my brother, mainly.

235
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,610
Okay.

236
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,481
Mark, have you ever been accused
of a crime?

237
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,290
No, sir.

238
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,771
I...

239
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,167
Mr. du Pont.
Oh, you're here.

240
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,084
Yes, I drove straight down.

241
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,242
Tonight's speech.

242
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,202
Okay.

243
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,606
So they're putting him
in the chalet?

244
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,366
Yes, sir.
Hm.

245
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,761
Excellent bed.

246
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,322
Good mattress. Firm.

247
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,528
- That's great. Thank you.
- All right.

248
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,966
Good.

249
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,690
Utilities are paid for,
gas, electric, water.

250
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,605
Kitchen, dining room.
Refrigerator is fully stocked.

251
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,569
Office.

252
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,568
Here's a key for you.

253
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,370
Thank you.

254
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,562
The gym is close.
You can almost see it.

255
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,121
Couple hundred yards up
is the big house,

256
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,487
in case you ever get invited
to dinner.

257
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,405
Otherwise, it is off-limits.
Okay.

258
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,043
Also, the horses that you saw
on the way in,

259
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,247
they all belong
to Mr. du Pont's mother.

260
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,848
They're all world-class animals.

261
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,002
They're also off-limits.

262
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,368
Your history of the du Pont dynasty.

263
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,930
One more thing:

264
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,242
Just between you and me,

265
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,608
if you happen to see Mrs. du Pont,
just give her her privacy.

266
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,762
Yeah, of course.

267
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,370
Anything else I can get you?

268
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,046
No. No, no, I'm fine.

269
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,763
Well, I think that's it.

270
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,604
Have a good night.

271
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,010
You too.

272
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,008
<i>Du Pont, a dynasty of wealth
and power.</i>

273
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,002
<i>America's need for ammunition</i>

274
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,925
<i>enabled the family
to amass a fortune</i>

275
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,606
<i>and grow their company
into what is today</i>

276
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,884
<i>the largest chemical corporation
in the world.</i>

277
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,765
Mr. du Pont?
Shh-shh-shh.

278
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,281
Do you hear that?

279
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,643
That's a barred owl.

280
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,005
I hope it's not too late.
No, no, no.

281
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,925
I wanted to make sure
that everything was all right.

282
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,089
That everything was fine.
Drop a few things off
that I thought you might enjoy.

283
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,447
Here are some field glasses.

284
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,527
There are many varieties of birds
right here on the property.

285
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,004
That'll give you a better vantage point.
Okay.

286
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,245
And this is from 10 years ago,
but I thought you might
find it interesting.

287
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,244
Wait, you wrote this?
I did, yeah.

288
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,085
Thank you.

289
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,126
How long do we have till the Worlds?

290
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,441
Two months.
Well, a little less, actually.

291
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,684
Well, we'll get it done.

292
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,926
I promise you,
I'll give you everything I have.

293
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,961
I have great faith in you, Mark.

294
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,486
Thank you, sir.

295
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,324
You're welcome.

296
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,200
Night.

297
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,170
Certainly Abraham Lincoln,
Teddy Roosevelt,

298
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,971
they gave me something to aspire to.

299
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,527
My father was a role model.

300
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,603
Guys, introduce yourself.

301
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,131
See you guys at 6? All right.

302
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,080
Very good, I'll see
you in three months.

303
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,446
Good.

304
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,210
Mark.

305
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,367
Come in.

306
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,169
Have a seat.

307
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,929
May I get you a drink?

308
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,208
No. No, sir. I'm good.

309
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,570
Good. Good man. In training.

310
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,564
How is it looking
with your brother Dave?

311
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,685
Dave?

312
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,926
How do you mean?

313
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,885
You said you were going
to talk to him again.

314
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,366
I did.

315
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,522
When is he coming?

316
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,924
He's not.

317
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,004
He... He's just not...

318
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,401
He's just not willing
to uproot his family.

319
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,810
Does he understand
what we're doing here, Mark?

320
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,530
I told him.

321
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,761
He just really doesn't wanna move.

322
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,048
How much does he want?

323
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,045
No, it's...

324
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,282
It's not about that.

325
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,604
About what?

326
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,010
Well, you can't buy Dave.

327
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,206
So the World Championships
are coming up soon?

328
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,050
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,328
I want you to win.

330
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,249
That's why you're here.

331
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,881
Everything okay, Mark?

332
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,565
Yeah.

333
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,684
What is it?

334
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,569
What's wrong?

335
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,610
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

336
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,763
No, you're not.

337
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,685
I just...

338
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,681
I just don't wanna let you down.

339
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,842
Do it! Go!

340
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,086
That's it.

341
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,043
- Attack! Attack!
- Control his rolling. Control his rolling.

342
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,402
Keep your elbows in!

343
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,170
Mark Schultz.

344
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,290
Good job, Mark.

345
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,204
Dave Schultz.

346
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,846
Hello.
Hey, Xander.

347
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,206
Hi.
Where's your dad?

348
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,004
Over there. Hello.

349
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,243
<i>- Hey, Mark. Come on in, buddy.
- Yah!</i>

350
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,925
Oh, God, he's got me.

351
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,642
Dave, I wanted to...
I want you to meet Mr. du Pont.

352
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,483
Hold on a sec.
We got a guest. I gotta get up.

353
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,086
- How you doing? I have to say hi.
- Keep him...

354
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,527
No. We're not letting you up.

355
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,887
I wanna say hi to Mr. du Pont. Hold on.

356
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,611
- How you doing?
- Dad, come on.

357
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,009
It's nice to meet you. Dave Schultz.
John du Pont.

358
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,845
That's my wife, Nancy.
Hey.

359
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,931
- Hello.
- My beautiful, relaxed children.

360
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,809
- This is Xander and Dani.
- Hello.

361
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,564
- Hi.
- They're eating me.

362
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,406
Hey, Dani?
Dani, come here.

363
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,121
Can I get you a drink?
No. No, I should go.

364
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,049
Good luck tomorrow.

365
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,242
Mark, thank you.

366
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,206
You sure you don't want to...?
No, no.

367
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,249
- No, Mark, stay.
- I'm gonna get you.

368
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,243
Come here. Get your brother.

369
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,211
- Hey. Okay. It's bedtime now.
- I can make an A.

370
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,566
- No.
- Let's go.

371
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
- Here it comes.
- Get ready for bed.

372
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,567
Dave, I got that tape on Nanev.
Yeah, pop it in, buddy.

373
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,401
- We need to check out his arm spin.
- We'll watch some wrestling.

374
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,080
Get your arm up.
Get your arms out of there.

375
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,564
There we go.

376
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,085
- Hurry up. Let me go!
- I'll have to keep you here.

377
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,288
- No.
- Let me get these tights off.

378
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,324
- Good princess.
- Okay, get...

379
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,689
Was it too much for you to come over
and just say hi to him?

380
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,249
Aren't they fun?
Excuse me?

381
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,767
You know who that is?
It's John du Pont.

382
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,130
- I said hi, Mark.
- It's John du Pont.

383
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,046
The most generous man in America.
You can't treat him like he's anyone.

384
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,851
Mark, she said hi.
Mark, I said hi, okay?

385
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,367
She said hi.
You said hi from over there.

386
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,726
Buddy. Mark.

387
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,565
- She said hi, pal.
- Mark.

388
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,764
- You're in our room.
- I'm in your room? Okay. All right.

389
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,161
Great. You know what?
You don't even know.

390
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,210
You don't even know
what you don't know. You know that?

391
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,486
Dave?
Dad.

392
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,007
Mark.
Why? Dad.

393
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,730
- No.
- Yes.

394
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,406
- Dad.
- Buddy.

395
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,925
Mark.

396
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,490
Buddy. Come here.

397
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,410
Come here.

398
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,011
Give me the tape. Okay.

399
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,041
Nanev can't set up his arm spin
without setting up himself.

400
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,046
You just hit yours first.
When you feel him drive, hit it.

401
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,921
All right?

402
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,765
He's gonna drive and turn you and...

403
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,010
There it is.

404
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,685
That's it.
Drive him out. Drive him out.

405
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,251
Drive him.

406
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,522
Drive, drive!

407
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,803
- Elbows deep, Mark.
- Drive! Drive!

408
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,806
Five seconds, Mark!

409
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,209
Drive him. That's it.

410
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,085
Drive him, drive him, drive him!
Pop him up!

411
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,162
Yeah!

412
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,924
That's it, buddy!

413
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,646
Yeah! Yeah!

414
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,001
<i>U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!</i>

415
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,491
Oh, there we go.

416
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,643
Who needs a refill?

417
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,480
Let's all get very drunk.

418
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,364
Can I take a look at your medal?
Yeah. Yeah.

419
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,521
What a fantastic evening.

420
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,764
<i>♪ Fame, makes a man
Take things over ♪</i>

421
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,770
<i>♪ Fame, lets him loose
Hard to swallow ♪</i>

422
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,009
<i>♪ Fame, puts you there

423
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,524
<i>♪ Fame ♪</i>

424
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,689
<i>♪ Fame, it's not your brain ♪♪</i>

425
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,605
All right. All right.

426
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,361
Enough. Enough!

427
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,045
Turn that off.

428
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,481
Take that down.

429
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,360
- Where do you want me to put it?
- I don't care.

430
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,000
Throw it away.

431
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,009
All of it, whole shelf.

432
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,201
Horses are stupid.

433
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,521
Horses eat and shit.

434
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,123
That's all they do.

435
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,602
It's very silly.

436
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,127
It's all very silly.

437
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,408
<i>Hove my mother very much,
but she...</i>

438
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,851
She... It's...

439
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,009
It's ridiculous.

440
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,245
Sitting on an animal was more dignified.

441
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,363
But I wanted to do what you're doing.

442
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,443
Let's have those medals.

443
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,164
Give me those.

444
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,247
Give me those medals.

445
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,201
I do not share my mother's affection
for horseflesh,

446
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,929
I'll have you know.

447
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,046
"Did your horse jump over the thing?"

448
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,846
"Did you catch the fox, Mother?"

449
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,810
Anyway,

450
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,281
the proof is in the pudding.

451
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,605
We caught the fox, didn't we?

452
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,046
Yeah.
This is the fox.

453
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,770
Yes, sir.

454
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,886
I am going to put these in there.

455
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,644
Gentlemen, I give you Mark Schultz,

456
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,771
Foxcatcher world champion.
Yes. Good.

457
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,605
Oh!

458
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,125
Whoa, whoa, coach.

459
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,282
- You all right?
- Get him up.

460
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,523
- Coach, you all right?
- I think he had too much to drink.

461
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,767
Oh!

462
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,128
- Drive! Drive!
- Drive, drive!

463
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,284
- Get on his other side.
- Get on him.

464
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,881
- Push him.
- Come on. You got him.

465
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,610
- What?
- The jig's up.

466
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,446
Climb up on him. Come on. Come on.
Work him, work him, work him!

467
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,765
Yes!

468
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,529
Whoa!

469
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,250
Don't let him drive you, Dan.
Don't let him drive you.

470
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,563
Turn him. Come on, turn him. That's it.

471
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,566
- You gotta turn him. Yes!
- Turn him. Turn him.

472
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,720
Yes!

473
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,802
- John!
- Johnny D!

474
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,169
<i>John! John!</i> John!

475
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,767
<i>John! John! John!</i>
Yeah!

476
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,723
- Yo, Johnny D!
- Yeah, Johnny D!

477
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,925
Yeah! Whoo!

478
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,610
Mark.

479
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,201
After practice, I want you to shower
and come talk to me, all right?

480
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,124
Yeah. All right.

481
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,483
Three hundred eighty-seven
days to Seoul, gentlemen.

482
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,247
Let's have a good practice,
shall we?

483
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,561
You don't have to do this.
You earned it.

484
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,166
You've given me enough.
This is not necessary.

485
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,085
Mark, Mark, you earned that.

486
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,082
Thank you.
You're welcome, Mark.

487
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,722
You're more than Dave Schultz's
little brother, Mark.

488
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,325
Okay.

489
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,762
Dave Schultz is a wonderful wrestler.

490
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,447
He, I'm sure,
has been an inspiration to you.

491
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,126
A mentor to you.

492
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,320
But he will always be
your older brother.

493
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,881
He will never let you

494
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,131
be everything that you can be.

495
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,361
Mark, you have been living
in your brother's shadow your entire life.

496
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,561
It's time. It's your time now.

497
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,928
I know what you mean.

498
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,404
Do you?

499
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,006
Because everything that I've done,

500
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,009
I feel like...

501
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,249
has somehow been credited to Dave.

502
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,847
And, you know, I feel that...

503
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,848
it's time for me to...

504
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,366
distance myself from him.

505
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,487
You know, become my own person.

506
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,162
Without your brother...

507
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,964
you can do anything
that you choose to set your mind to.

508
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,645
Mr. du Pont,
I need you to know that I'm...

509
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,725
I'm so grateful
for what you've done for me.

510
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,042
Well, first of all,

511
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,370
I don't want you to call me
"Mr. du Pont" or "sir" anymore.

512
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,727
I consider us friends.

513
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,444
And most of my friends
will call me "Eagle" or "Golden Eagle."

514
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,209
So either of those will work.

515
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,044
Okay.

516
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,845
Or "John" or "Coach."

517
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,323
All right. That's not a problem.

518
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,970
Good.

519
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,122
Good afternoon,
sir.

520
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,007
M113, sir. APC.
I know what it is.

521
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,123
Where's the gun?

522
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,123
What gun, sir?

523
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,163
Fifty-caliber machine gun.
Sir, there wasn't a machine gun ordered.

524
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,244
It's supposed to be mounted
right there.

525
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,887
There's no gun
on the order, sir.

526
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,923
Sir, I just need a signature
to complete the order.

527
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,963
Get my gun.

528
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,164
Reed, McClaren,
let's off-load.

529
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,529
It's supposed to come
with a .50-caliber machine gun.

530
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,250
We'll get it.

531
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,122
You hungry?
Yeah.

532
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,647
Let's get something to eat.

533
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,851
You snap him down.

534
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,002
He'll posture up, that's your window.

535
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,447
Shoot in and pull him over the top.

536
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,971
Excellent.

537
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,610
One more.

538
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,770
Great.

539
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,288
The oil looks really good
on you, Mark.

540
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,649
Bow your arms a little bit.
Here we go.

541
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,810
Excellent.

542
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,530
Very good, and all right.
Very good, Mark.

543
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,806
Your speeches, your kit.

544
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,531
Do we know if my mother
has already arrived?

545
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,489
She is en route, sir.

546
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,405
The blazer looks good.

547
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,081
Thank you, sir.

548
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,731
I wrote down a few things for you to say.

549
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,451
Don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

550
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,768
Read it. Read it out loud.

551
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,449
Okay. Right now?

552
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,486
Get some practice.
Yes, sir.

553
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,570
"Highly respected ornithologist,

556
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,205
Philatelist.
Philatelist.

557

Stamps.
Sta... Can we say "stamps"?

558
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,527
No, philatelist.
Philatelist.

559
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,160
Don't be intimidated by these people.

560
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,043
How many people are gonna be there?

561
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,123
About 400.

562
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,647
Go ahead.

563
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,210
What is it?
It's cocaine.

564
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,330
Uh...
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

565
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,323
Mark, it's just cocaine.

566
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,847
It's not going to kill you.

567
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,282
What am I...?
You're supposed to just...?

568
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,248
Take the vial,

569
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,761
tap some on the mirror,

570
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,970
take the straw,
just inhale it through your nose.

571
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,888
"Highly respected ornithologist,

01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,046
All of that?
All of it. Straight down.

576
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,250
Did you hear how I was doing it?
It's just all one thought, Mark.

577
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,011
You got it.

578
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,009
Give that to me.

579
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,890
Okay.

580
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,122
"Highly respected ornithologist, author,

Philatelist.

Philanthrop... Which one...?

584
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,284
Ornithologist.
Which one do you want to come first?

585
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,805
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

586
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,727
Okay, ornilo... Ornithologist,
philatelist, philanthropist.

587
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,321
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

588
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,929
Ornilo... Ornithologist, philatelist...
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

589
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,445
Ornilo... "Ornithogolist"...

590
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,888
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
Ornithologist...

591
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,442
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
Look at me.

592
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,291
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

593
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,527
Again.

594
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,001
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

595
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,207
Again.

596
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,641
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

597
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,847
Good.

598
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,761
Do I know you?

599
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,203
- Yes, John. How are you?
- Good to see you again.

600
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,089
This is Mark Schultz.
Hi.

601
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,164
Have you ever met an
Olympic gold medalist before?

602
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,449
Mark won the Olympic gold medal
for wrestling in 1984.

603
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,768
Ever seen an Olympic medalist before?

604
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,684
No, I don't think I have.

605
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,531
Mark. Mark.

606
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,763
This is Congressman Daniel.
Nice to meet you.

607
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,207
Bob.
Congressman Daniel... Bob or Daniel?

608
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,164
Bob, yes.
Bob, nice to meet you.

609
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,566
This is Mark Schultz.

610
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,929
Mark won an Olympic gold medal
in the 1984 Olympics.

611
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,963
Impressive.
Isn't that impressive?

612
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,764
Congratulations.
Thank you.

613
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,604
Quite a young man.

614
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,728
Very proud of him.
Nice meeting you.

615
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,611
I'm so proud to introduce my mentor.

616
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,526
He has the ability to look at me
and see where I am in life.

617
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,208
I feel his love for me as an athlete
and as a human being.

618
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,125
My mother and father were divorced
when I was <i>2</i>

619
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,931
And I spent a lifetime
looking for a father,

620
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,846
and I found one in the Golden Eagle
of America, John du Pont.

621
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,924
Mark Schultz. Thank you, son.

622
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,964
Hello, Mother.

623
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to read something.

624
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,091
"The liberties of our country,

625
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,528
the freedom of our civil constitution,

626
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,122
are worth defending at all hazards.

627
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,682
And it is our duty to defend them
against all attacks..."

628
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,805
<i>Oh, hey. Hey, what's up?</i>
I miss you.

629
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,204
Yeah.
What you up to?

630
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,966
<i>Huh?
What you up to?</i>

631
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,405
<i>Nothing. Nothing.</i>

632
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,121
Are you working out? Getting ready?

633
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,723
<i>Yeah... No. I mean, well, I'm taking
a little bit of a break right now.</i>

634
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,089
<i>Just resting up the body.
I'm gonna ramp it up, you know,</i>

635
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,084
<i>when it gets closer to World... Trials.</i>

636
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,322
All right. How close?

637
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,245
<i>Hey, hold on. Hold on one second.
What?</i>

638
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,606
<i>What's happening?</i>

639
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,610
Hey!

640
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,125
Mark!

641
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,090

Huh?

659
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,329
You are a good friend, Mark.

660
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,089
Thank you, John.

661
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,967
I only had one real friend growing up.

662
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,441
Hugh Cherry. Hughby.

663
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,449
He was the son
of my mother's chauffeur.

664
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,206
Uh-huh.

665
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,289
When I was 16, I found out
that my mother had been paying him

666
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,562
to be my friend.

667
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,368
Dave was my only friend growing up.

668
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,530
Yeah.

669
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,329
I thought we could put it
in the Rosemont case.

670
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,608
It says John "Eagle" du Pont.
That's right.

671
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,531
First place?
Yes.

672
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,808
You funded this.

673
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,404
Presumably.

674
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,088
You can put it in the trophy room.

675
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,049
Thank you, Mother.

676
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,722
What are we going to do
about your train set?

677
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,684
My train set?

678
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:24,929
Well, Mr. Beck spoke to you
about this.

679
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,366
No.

680
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,010
Oh, I know he did.

681
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,844
I know he did.

682
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,087
You've never wanted
to give it away, but...

683
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,483
I don't care about my train set,
Mother. I don't care.

684
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,047
Well, I think we'll...

685
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,764
We'll give it to the children's museum,
if they have room.

686
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,170
Do you agree?

687
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,166
I don't care what you do
with the train set.

688
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,642
I don't care about trains.

689
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,721
Mother, I am leading men.

690
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,969
I am training them.
I am teaching them.

691
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,288
I am giving them...

692
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,280
a dream.

693
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,091
And I am giving America...

694
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,890
hope.

695
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,210
Hope?

696
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,048
It doesn't matter.

697
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,362
I'm glad you have your trophy.

698
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,488
It can go in the trophy room.

699
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,086
Not in the Rosemont case.

700
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,766
I don't like the sport of wrestling,
as you know.

701
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,762
It's a low sport.

702
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:48,646
And I don't like to see you being low.

703
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,640
<i>And quickly Herrera shoots the leg.</i>

704
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,803
<i>And Herrera 's</i> a
<i>very good grappler here.</i>

705
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,686
<i>Oh, my. Elbows in
number, by Goodridge,</i>

706
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,490
<i>and that is it.</i>

707
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,166
Albert wrestled with this guy at Pitt.

708
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,402
I think it's sad.

709
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,800
He was legit.

710
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,048
He's probably getting paid a lot.

711
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,009
Look at his face.

712
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,640
<i>- That was short and sweet.
- It's destroyed.</i>

713
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,051
- It's John.
- It's John.

714
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,611
Hey, coach.
ls Mark in?

715
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,603
Yeah.
Right here, coach.

716
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,125
What's up?

717
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,367
Why is there nobody in the gym?

718
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,606
What do you mean?
It's noon. Nobody in there.

719
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:57,929
Yeah, no,
I gave the boys the morning off.
We're gonna do a double tonight.

720
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,361
Who's making these decisions?

721
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,125
I am.

722
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,766
I want your brother Dave here.

723
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,130
What are you talking about?

724
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,328
I want your brother Dave to come.

725
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,886
Um, that's not gonna happen.

726
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,202
We've talked about that.

727
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,284
Are you okay?

728
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,247
You ungrateful ape.

729
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,685
I made such a mistake
bringing you here.

730
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,202
I'm getting Dave.

731
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,011
I don't care how much it costs.

732
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,484
Shit.

733
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,249
Hey.
Hi, guys.

734
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,890
Yeah.

735
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,443
There he is.
He's coming. He's coming.

736
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,691
- John du Pont.
- Yeah.

737
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,448
Thanks.
Yeah.

738
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,688
Hey.

739
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,249
How you doing?

740
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,801
Good. I'm good.

741
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,330
What's up?

742
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,087
I just... Just came in.
All the wrestlers were there
to meet me

743
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,449
and you weren't there,
and I just thought I'd come up,

744
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,489
make sure everything's okay.

745
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,847
No, I'm good.

746
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,448
Just concentrating.

747
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,682
We got trials coming up.

748
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,923
You okay, Mark?

749
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,565
Yeah. I'm good.

750
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,290
What's up?

751
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,722
You got my messages?

752
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,371
Mm-hm.

753
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,250
Nancy and the kids are here.

754
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,767
Yeah? How are they?
They're good.

755
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,966
Why don't you come down and say hi.
Okay. I will. I'll see you.

756
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,644
Boom, down low.

757
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,849
This hand comes here,
this hand catches the ankle.

758
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,921
Lay your back into the guy,
scoop with this leg, catch both knees,

759
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,482
put your arm through.
There's your cross ankle,
all right?

760
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,130
Nice and tight.

761
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,800
Do it again, all right?

762
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,008
So you're here, you're wrestling.

763
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,406
If you get here
and you're loose like this,

764
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,528
to make it nice and tight, what you
wanna do is drive the knees together

765
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:01,685
with your hip and your elbow, and drop
your arm down or drop your chest.

766
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,691
That'll make it nice and snug for you.

767
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,281
You wanna keep
your outside leg away from him.

768
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,364
Keep your leg away from him,
come up to your knee,

769
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:14,047
turn your toe to the ceiling,
step him up.

770
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,284
Let's say he does reel over
with that outside ankle,

771
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,289
that's pretty much game over.

772
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,484
I have a chance to make him
keep those feet...

773
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,406
So from here, you pull this up
and you drive that.

774
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,201
Outside shoulders from that,
and he pulls...

775
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,888
Use your stomach.

776
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,723
Use your stomach.

777
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,165
Good.

778
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,245
Good set.

779
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,726
All right, pair up.

780
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,885
Let's go, guys.

781
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,327
What's going on, Mark?

782
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:56,887
There's that knee pick he likes to hit
from a fake shot or cross...

783
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:00,971
Dave, I don't need your help.
I'm doing this on my own, okay?

784
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,883
You don't want my help?
Dave, what did I just say?!

785
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,163
Wanna tell me what's going on
with you and du Pont?

786
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,451
Okay.

787
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,769
Handstands.

788
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,446
Tuck and roll forward, boys.

789
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,207
Army crawl on this side.

790
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,284
Good.

791
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,449
Bring it in.

792
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,211
Move.

793
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,328
Right there. Make some room.

794
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,764
All the way over.

795
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,689
In three days,

796
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,209
several of you will be
traveling with me to Pensacola

797
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,250
to participate in the Olympic trials.

798
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:20,404
When you leave the hallowed grounds
of this training facility...

799
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,368
you will be in competition.

800
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,366
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

801
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,610
You will be representing
the United States.

802
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,403
As a coach,

803
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,960
I want you to be champions in sport...

804
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,648
and winners in life.

805
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,969
And also...

806
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,566
to be good citizens...

807
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,045
for America.

808
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,964
Garcia.

809
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,968
A couple basics.

810
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,167
This is one that generally
works for me quite well.

811
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,649
Arm drag.

812
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,481
Right to left, left to right.

813
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,563
Rip it across.

814
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,129
And as I do that,
you see this portion.

815
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,962
And I can move right in.

816
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,284
Again.

817
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,727
Right to left, left to right.

818
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,207
Rip it across.

819
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,203
And then in.

820
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,848
Got it?
Yeah.

821
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,571
- Do we have that?
- Yes.

822
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,883
All right, par terre.

823
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,605
Down. Actually, I'll go down.

824
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,010
- You do it.
- Okay.

825
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,446
Do it on me.

826
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,921
So get underneath my rib.

827
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:06,205
All right.

828
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,322
The basic physics is to keep yourself
wide at the bottom.

829
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,921
All right.

830
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,845
He puts his knee under my hip,

831
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,241
and you see an opening here.

832
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,731
So you shoot...

833
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,725
Let's pair up.

834
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,765
- Basics.
- All right.

835
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,326
All right, let's pair
up and work on arm drags.

836
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,323
Arm drags and gut wrenches.

837
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,323
All right, let's do it, guys.

838
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,920
Three days, three days.

839
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,522
- Step forward.
- All right, name, weight.

840
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,761
He's good.

841
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,242
All right, you got about a...
Looks like about a half a kilo to go.

842
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,970
- Step forward.
- Name, weight?

843
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,360
- Thirty.
- He's good.

844
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,329
- Next.
- Step forward.

845
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,369
- Name? Weight?
- Let's see.

846
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,040
That's about a half kilo to go.

847
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,565
- You're good.
- Next.

848
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,881
He's good.

849
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,769
Step forward. Name, weight?

850
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,002
Good. Next bastard's good.

851
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,286
Next.

852
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,521
Two kilos over.

853
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,489
- That looks good.
- You're good.

854
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,926
- Next.
- Step forward.

855
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,251
Next match:
Mark Schultz versus Rico Chiapparelli.

856
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,120
One, blue.

857
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,725
Best of three, Mark.
You'll get it back.

858
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,805
Mark.

859
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:30,131
You're not in this alone, man.

860
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,361
I'm your brother and I love you.

861
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,522
I am not gonna let you go down
like this.

862
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,410
That's it.

863
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,568
There's more in there.

864
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,201
That's it, keep going, Mark.

865
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,731
Twelve pounds over.
How much time we got?

866
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,247
Ninety minutes.
Ninety minutes, okay.

867
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,323
Come on,
there you go.

868
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,568
That's it, drive it.

869
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,050
Harder, Mark.

870
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,565
That's it. Time.

871
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,642
Okay. All right.

872
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:30,887
Five, four, three, two, one.

873
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,246
Time.

874
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,322
Three, two, one.

875
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,564
All right, buddy.

876
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,405
Go.

877
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,644
Circle.

878
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,328
Hold your position, Mark.

879
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,928
Ten seconds.

880
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,485
Hold your position.

881
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,805
All right. All right, Mark.

882
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,645
Sheets can't be on the team.

883
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,565
Mark Schultz
is on the Olympic team.

884
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,444
Get in there, Mark, you hear me?

885
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,610
Okay, center red, center blue.

886
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,770
Yeah!

887
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,805
Two-thirty, Mark.

888
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,771
Hey, Henry.
Dave. What can I do for you?

889
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,285
Henry, John and I kind of had
an uncomfortable moment earlier

890
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,081
and, you know,
I didn't see him at the finals.

891
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,726
Was he even there?
No.

892
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,850
Mr. du Pont flew home earlier today.

893
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,124
Okay.

894
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,167
Mr. du Pont's mother died.

895
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,724
Oh, man.
That's really bad news.

896
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,891
Excuse me, Dave.
All right. Thank you.

897
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,328
Would you like us
to mount the weapon?

898
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,686
Yes.
Gentlemen.

899
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,448
You and me, buddy.

900
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,731
How you doing? You sore?

901
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,046
There you go.

902
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,483
Open that stretch for me.

903
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,209
It's John.

904
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,049
Hey, John.

905
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:33,325
I'm really sorry about your mother.
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

906
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,050
You okay? You sure?
Yes.

907
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,762
David, we have a lot of work to do
in the next couple of months.

908
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,200
And you're an integral part of that.
You understand?

909
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:47,011
I understand.
I'm going to need you.

910
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,881
And I will be relying on you

911
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,125
All right.
to a great extent. I want,

912
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,762
More than anything,
to win a gold medal.

913
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,764
And we have someone
who could do that for us.

914
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,843
We're gonna win
a gold medal, John.

915
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,527
How are you feeling about that?
I feel very good about it.

916
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,569
I am a little concerned

917
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:14,123
that there are
some psychological issues

918
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,569
that we need to take care of.

919
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,008
He's gonna be in real good shape.
You're doing a great job.

920
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,083
- Thank you, John.
- And I...

921
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,363
I think that with you and I,
working in tandem,

922
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,964
if we can't get him there,
no one can.

923
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,484
All right. Get back.

924
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,130
Okay.

925
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,090
Mark?

926
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,330
Mark?

927
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,404
- You okay?
- Mark.

928
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:50,241
He's okay.

929
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,046
Come on, Mark.

930
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,690
Good.

931
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,043
<i>Coach du Pont has</i> a <i>vision.</i>

932
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,402
He would like Foxcatcher

933
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,961
to be designated and recognized

934
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,049
as the official training site

935
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,567
for U.S.A. Wrestling
and the Olympic team.

936
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:43,681
Now, this means that the national team
would live here and train here.

937
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,531
On top of funding this program,

938
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:51,647
Coach du Pont would be willing
to make a donation to U.S.A. Wrestling

939
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,724
of $500,000 per year.

940
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,201
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, that's really nice.

941
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:59,801
Mr. du Pont,
thank you very much for...

942
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,564
<i>The spirit of Foxcatcher.</i>

943
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:07,405
<i>It is a philosophy
which began generations ago.</i>

944
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:12,763
- Thank you.
<i>- It is more than just sport.</i>

945
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,043
And coaching these young athletes,

946
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:27,048
I am able to instill in them
the lessons that I have learned in life.

947
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,650
Athletes need role models.

948
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:38,009
Like anyone,
they need people to look up to.

949
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,689
A coach is a father.

950
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,166
A coach is a mentor.

951
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,524
A coach has great power...

952
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,243
great import on an athlete's life.

953
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,009
We'll put you in a house
with another wrestler.

954
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,731
Gym's a hundred yards from it.

955
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,566
There's plenty of places
for the kids to run around.

956
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,450
Hey, Mark, I'll just be...

957
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,120
All right. I'll tell her you said hey.

958
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,610
I'm waiting
to hear from you. Bye.

959
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,564
Hey, buddy.

960
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,008
Hey.
Warm up. I'll be out there in a minute.

961
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,925
Yeah, I just...
I gotta make one more call.

962
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,650
Look.

963
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,642
I don't wanna be here.

964
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,090
I called Coach Beacham at BYU.

965
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:47,127
He said he'd take both of us.

966
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,971
We don't got time
to make a big change like that.

967
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,282
Okay, what about after Seoul?

968
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,525
Mark...

969
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,242
Look, I don't know
what's gonna happen in the future,

970
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,967
but Nancy and I would like to try

971
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,806
and make it work here.

972
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,609
You and I both know
that I can't stay here.

973
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,643
I know, Mark.

974
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,411
Hey, do you remember
when we were kids?

975
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,007
You remember how we lived?

976
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,280
Moving all over the place?

977
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:46,122
Never had any idea
where or how long
we were gonna be anywhere.

978
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,681
Remember how that was
for us?

979
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,081
Was it easy for us?

980
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,525
No.

981
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,401
That's my responsibility
to my family, Mark.

982
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,120
I know you understand that.

983
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,051
Keep your head
in the game, Mark.

984
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,884
Go on down.

985
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,523
Hi, Dave, I'm Doc.

986
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,001
Doc, Dave Schultz.
Nice to meet you.

987
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,885
Have a seat in the chair here,
if you would.

988
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,086
We're rolling.

989
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,811
Let's talk a bit
about his philosophy as a coach.

990
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,291
What is his philosophy
as the individual that's gonna
lead this team and you?

991
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:01,571
Well, John's philosophy as a coach
is to let the wrestlers...

992
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,365
Um...

993
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,446
Sorry.

994
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:12,366
Is to, um, create an environment

995
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,970
where, uh, the athlete
doesn't have many obstacles

996
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:22,245
to get past to be great.

997
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:26,447
Let's get pointed here. I...
I'm not doing what you want me to.

998
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,080
Let's get pointed.
What are you looking for?

999
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,402
You know what we're trying
to accomplish.

1000
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,964
We're making a documentary that shows
John is gonna be able to lead this team,

1001
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,250
lead you to levels of greatness
in wrestling we haven't seen before.

1002
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,281
And talk about that, but use
some of those terms that he likes,

1003
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,001
like "excellent" and "intensity"
and "domination."

1004
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:53,404
All right.

1005
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,002
Well, John du Pont...

1006
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,562
Say that again? I'm sorry.
Can you ask me that question again?

1007
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:07,847
John sees you as important to this.
You're the closing chapter to this thing.

1008
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,805
You're the end of it,
and you're his assistant coach.

1009
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,162
He sees himself as your mentor.

1010
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,529
I would like you
to just look at the camera

1011
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:21,322
and speak about John...

1012
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,846
as a mentor.

1013
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,445
And say what exactly?

1014
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,850
That he's your mentor.

1015
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,409
Can you do that?

1016
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,409
John du Pont...

1017
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,600
is kind of a mentor to me.

1018
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,730
Just look over here at the camera
and say it again.

1019
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,365
John du Pont is a mentor to me.

1020
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:22,286
I thought maybe it'd be a good idea
if we talked, kind of clear the air.

1021
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,122
I wanna make sure you guys
are clear that we expect

1022
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:31,241
that Mr. du Pont is gonna be
in Mark's corner throughout
the Olympic Games.

1023
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:38,410
Well, we can ask him
if that's okay, but first,

1024
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,962
I'd like to raise a few things
that are important to me.

1025
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,363
One, if I'm gonna...

1026
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,927
commit to staying on here
at Foxcatcher,

1027
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:55,287
I need to know
that Mark's gonna be taken care of.

1028
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,086
Well, taken care of how?

1029
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:02,882
So long as I'm at Foxcatcher,
Mark's gonna get paid.

1030
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,010
You want him to be paid
even if he's not here?

1031
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,726
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1032
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,688
Dave, you may be overestimating
your importance to Foxcatcher.

1033
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,447
Well, that may be so.

1034
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:24,561
We could test that,
but I'm here to say, John,

1035
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:28,924
I wanna continue
what we've started here at Foxcatcher.

1036
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,410
And it's important to me

1037
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,928
that I know that my brother
is gonna be supported.

1038
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,964
Thanks, John.

1039
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:54,370
Okay, you'll get your
deal, you'll get your demands,

1040
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:58,241
but this means that Mr. du Pont

1041
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,371
is gonna be seated in Mark's corner
throughout the Olympic Games.

1042
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,730
I wanna hear Mark agree
to that himself.

1043
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,371
Remember what
we went over today, Mark.

1044
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,611
You can't do this to yourself, buddy.
You can't do this to yourself.

1045
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,930
You can beat this guy, Mark.
You can beat him.

1046
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,400
Can I help you?

1047
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,011
- Everything okay?
- Can I help you?

1048
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,001
- Uh, yeah, we live here.
- Okay.

1049
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,801
There's a new security plan in place.
I'm gonna need to see some IDs.

1050
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,844
Sure.

1051
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:31,091
Hey, John, it's Sunday.
It's family time.

1052
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,088
Morning, John.
Say hi to John.

1053
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,404
Hi, John.

1054
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,609
It's Sunday.

1055
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,849
<i>Every athlete, no matter what sport,
needs structure,</i>

1056
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,363
<i>needs direction,</i>

1057
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,251
<i>and this is something
that a coach can offer.</i>

1058
