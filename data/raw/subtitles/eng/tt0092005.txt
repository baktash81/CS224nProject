1
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,981
<i>I was 12 going on 13
the first time I saw a dead human being.</i>

2
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,688
<i>It happened in the summer of 1959...</i>

3
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:42,902
<i>... a long time ago...</i>

4
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,286
<i>... but only if you measure it
in terms of years.</i>

5
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,500
<i>I was living in a small town in Oregon
called Castle Rock.</i>

6
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:59,464
<i>There were only 1,281 people,
but to me it was the whole world.</i>

7
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:03,631
<i>It's the Bossman Bob Cormier.
It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.</i>

8
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,047
<i>It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.</i>

9
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:09,589
<i>Up the ladder with another platter.
It's Bobby Day with Rockin' Robin...</i>

10
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:10,928
<i>... it's boss.</i>

11
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,700
How do you know a Frenchman's been
in your backyard?

12
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:33,239
I'm French, okay.

13
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,365
Your garbage cans are empty
and your dog's pregnant.

14
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,330
Didn't I just say I was French?

15
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,540
- I knock.
- Shit.

16
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,243
Twenty-nine.

17
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:44,618
Twenty-two.

18
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:46,416
Piss up a rope.

19
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:52,376
Gordie's out, OI' Gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door.

20
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,014
Come on, man, deal.

21
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:59,059
<i>Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy
we hung around with.</i>

22
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:01,219
<i>He didn't have much of a chance in life.</i>

23
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:03,470
<i>His dad was given to fits of rage.</i>

24
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove
and almost burned it off.</i>

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,640
I knock.

26
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,278
You four-eyed pile of shit.

27
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,936
<i>The "pile of shit" has 1,000 eyes.</i>

28
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,191
What?

29
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,906
What's so funny?
I got thirty, what have you got?

30
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:22,194
Sixteen.

31
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,866
Go ahead, keep laughing.

32
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:25,949
You're down to your ride, pal.

33
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,292
<i>Chris Chambers was the leader of our gang
and my best friend.</i>

34
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:33,210
<i>He came from a bad family
and everyone just knew he'd turn out bad.</i>

35
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,007
<i>Including Chris.</i>

36
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,126
That's not the secret knock.

37
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,676
I forgot the secret knock. Let me in.

38
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:41,926
Vern.

39
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,805
Come on, you guys, open up.

40
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,016
Man, you guys are not going
to believe this. This is so boss.

41
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,515
Wait till you hear this.

42
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,140
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

43
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,520
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way
from my house.

44
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,896
<i>"I ran all the way home"</i>

45
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,940
Come on. Listen to me, this is boss.

46
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,358
<i>"Just to say I'm sorry"</i>

47
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,698
<i>Okay, forget it.
I don't have to tell you nothin'.</i>

48
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:11,113
Hold on, you guys. Hold on.
What is it, man?

49
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,449
Great, you won't believe this, sincerely.

50
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,451
<i>"I ran all the way home"</i>

51
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:17,958
Screw you guys. Forget it.

52
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,457
What is it?

53
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,090
Can you camp out tonight?

54
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:24,590
I mean, if you tell your folks
we're gonna tent out in my backfield?

55
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:25,756
I think so.

56
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:29,677
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak.
He's been drinking a lot lately.

57
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:33,050
You got to. Sincerely,
you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

58
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,423
Yeah, probably.

59
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,390
So what are you pissing and moaning
about Vern-O?

60
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:38,802
- I knock.
- What?

61
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,432
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

62
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:43,648
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

63
00:04:43,736 --> 00:04:45,812
Make your draw, shitheap.

64
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:49,564
You guys want to go see a dead body?

65
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,988
I was under the porch digging, you know?

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,571
<i>We all understood
what Vern meant right away.</i>

67
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,707
<i>At the beginning of the school year
he had buried a jar of pennies...</i>

68
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,372
<i>... underneath his house.</i>

69
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:07,132
<i>He drew a treasure map
so he could find them again.</i>

70
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:11,378
<i>A week later his mom cleaned out
his room and threw away the map.</i>

71
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:15,172
<i>Vern had been trying to find those pennies
for nine months...</i>

72
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,758
<i>... nine months, man.</i>

73
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:19,257
<i>You didn't know whether laugh or cry.</i>

74
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,602
Jesus, Billy, we gotta do something.

75
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,644
Why? Who cares?

76
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,606
- We saw him.
- So?

77
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,976
It's nothin' to us. The kid's dead
so it's nothin' to him, neither.

78
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,069
And who gives a shit if they ever find him?
I don't.

79
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:36,611
It's that kid they're talking about
on the radio.

80
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:40,033
Brocker or Brower or Flowers,
whatever his name is.

81
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,695
The train must have hit him.

82
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,699
Big fucking deal.

83
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:48,073
<i>We had all followed
the Ray Brower story closely...</i>

84
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,828
<i>... since he was a kid our age.</i>

85
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,869
<i>Three days before, he left to pick
blueberries and nobody'd seen him since.</i>

86
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,756
I think we should tell the cops.

87
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,044
You don't go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car.

88
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:02,137
They'll want to know how we got way out
on Back Harlow Road.

89
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,882
They know we don't got no car.

90
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:06,678
It's best we just keep quiet,
then they can't touch us.

91
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:09,009
But we could make an anonymous call.

92
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:13,773
<i>They trace those calls stupid. I seen it
on Highway Patrol and on Dragnet.</i>

93
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:15,556
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,516
I wish we never boosted
that goddamned Dodge.

95
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,396
I wish Ace had been with us.

96
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,979
- We could've said he was in his car.
- He wasn't!

97
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,909
- Are we gonna tell him?
- We're not going to tell nobody.

98
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,820
Nobody, never. You dig me?

99
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:29,823
I know the Back Harlow Road.

100
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:34,206
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.
The train tracks are right there.

101
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,035
Me and my dad fished out there.

102
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:39,330
If they had known you were under there,
they would've killed you.

103
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:43,419
Could he have gotten all the way from
Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

104
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,004
Sure. He probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way.

105
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,254
Yeah, right.

106
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:54,428
<i>And then after dark, a train must have
come along and "el smako."</i>

107
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:03,940
I bet you, if we find him,
we'll get our pictures in the paper.

108
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,770
We could even be on TV.

109
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,234
- Sure.
- We'll be heroes.

110
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,937
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

111
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,159
He's not going to care.
'Cause it's gonna be us that find him.

112
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,913
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan,
and the boosted the car.

113
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:19,238
They'll probably pin a medal on you.

114
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,076
You think so?

115
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,247
Sure.

116
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,578
What'll we tell our folks?

117
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,294
Exactly what you said.

118
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,375
We'll tell our folks
that we're tenting in your backfield.

119
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,708
You tell your folks
your sleeping at Teddy's.

120
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:34,594
Then we say we're going
to the drag races the next day.

121
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,755
We're rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night.

122
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,887
Man that's a plan and a half.

123
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:43,221
But, if we find the body in South Harlow,
they'll know we didn't go to the races.

124
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:44,426
We'll get hided.

125
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,063
Nobody will care...

126
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,899
...because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery...

127
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,691
...it won't make a difference.

128
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:53,274
My dad will hide me anyway,
but it's worth it.

129
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,438
- Shit, yeah.
- Let's do it. What do you say?

130
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,859
- All right.
- Gordie?

131
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,980
Sure.

132
00:07:58,158 --> 00:07:59,189
Vern?

133
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:00,946
I don't know.

134
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,656
Come on, Vern-O.

135
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,784
- Okay.
- All right.

136
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,835
Too cool. Very cool.

137
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:17,125
<i>I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm,
but I couldn't.</i>

138
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:22,051
<i>That summer at home,
I had become The Invisible Boy.</i>

139
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:27,177
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

140
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,426
Mom?

141
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,809
It's in Denny's room.

142
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:43,025
<i>In April, my older brother, Dennis,
had been killed in a jeep accident.</i>

143
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,818
<i>Four months had passed...</i>

144
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:49,320
<i>... but my parents still hadn't been able
to put the pieces back together again.</i>

145
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:29,355
<i>Gordie, I got something for you.</i>

146
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,651
This, my friend, is for you.

147
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,576
- This is your Yankee cap.
- No.

148
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,073
This is your Yankee cap.

149
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,869
It's a good luck cap.
Know how many fish we'll catch?

150
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,369
- How much?
- A bazillion.

151
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,959
A bazillion fish.
It looks good on you, too. Just like that.

152
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:51,590
- No. I'm going blind.
- Don't start with me. Give me a hug.

153
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,089
You found it.

154
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,633
You found it.

155
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,013
Why can't you have friends like Denny's?

156
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:11,852
Dad, they're okay.

157
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,440
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

158
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:16,530
Chris isn't a thief.

159
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,814
He stole the milk money at school.

160
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:20,990
He's a thief in my book.

161
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,126
<i>It was almost noon as we set out to find
the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.</i>

162
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,181
Right here's cool.

163
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:52,059
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure thing.

164
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,223
- You want to see something?
- What?

165
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,150
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

166
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:00,767
What is it?

167
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:04,061
- You've got to see this.
- What is it?

168
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,696
What is it?

169
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,868
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

170
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,827
Walking, talking Jesus!

171
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:23,956
- Where'd you get this?
- Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

172
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:25,626
It's a.45.

173
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,997
I can see that.

174
00:11:31,597 --> 00:11:33,506
You got shells for it?

175
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,432
I took what was left in the box.

176
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:39,894
My dad'll think he used them himself
shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

177
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,975
- Is it loaded?
- Hello, no. What do you think I am?

178
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:46,772
Jesus!

179
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,942
Let's get out of here. Come on.

180
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,984
Gordie did it. Gordon Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock.

181
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,071
Shut up.

182
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,493
Hey, who did that?
Who's letting cherry bombs off out here?

183
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:04,206
You should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

184
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:07,377
- That was really fine.
- You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

185
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:09,834
I'm in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

186
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:14,134
- Shit, she thought it was firecrackers.
- I don't care. It was a mean trick.

187
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,004
I didn't know it was loaded.

188
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,845
- Honest.
- You swear?

189
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,172
I swear.

190
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,851
On your mother's name?

191
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,096
Even if she goes to hell for your lie?

192
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,731
I swear.

193
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,650
Pinky swear?

194
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,986
Pinky swear.

195
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,903
Girls, where you going?

196
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:47,487
- Come on, my brother gave me that!
- And now you're giving it to me.

197
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:48,826
Give it to me!

198
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,365
That's mine.

199
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,827
You're a real asshole, you know that?

200
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,254
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

201
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:01,717
Now, Christopher.

202
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:04,750
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

203
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:07,511
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

204
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:11,674
That's why I'll give him the opportunity
to take it back.

205
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,479
- Shit.
- Take it back, kid.

206
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:19,768
- Stop it, you're hurting him.
- You bastard! Let go, man.

207
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,434
- Stop it! Cut it out!
- Take it back, kid.

208
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,691
<i>You big... Okay, I take it back.</i>

209
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,610
There.

210
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,611
Now I feel a whole lot better about this.

211
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,125
How about you?

212
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,499
Good.

213
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,131
See you later girls.

214
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,350
Let's just forget them.

215
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,190
What do we need a pistol for anyway?

216
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:18,901
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

217
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,703
Or a garbage can.

218
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,827
I brought a comb.

219
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:27,585
What do we need a comb for?

220
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,207
If we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

221
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,373
- That's a lot of thinking, Vern.
- Thanks.

222
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:34,008
Two for flinching.

223
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,845
How far do you think it's gonna be?

224
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,180
If we follow the tracks all the way
into Harlow, it should be about 20 miles.

225
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,014
Sound about right to you?

226
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,099
It might even be 30.

227
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:53,767
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

228
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,983
- No way, that sucks.
- Why not?

229
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,686
We could go out to Route 7
to the Shiloh church...

230
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,280
...then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

231
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,447
That's pussy.

232
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:06,452
It's a long way.

233
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,534
Did your mother ever have any kids
that lived?

234
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,284
What do you mean?

235
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:41,978
We have to fill up at the junkyard.
My dad said it was a safe well.

236
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:45,606
- Not if Chopper's there.
- If he's there we'll send you in.

237
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:46,895
Very funny.

238
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,568
I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?

239
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,366
Did anybody bring anything?

240
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,289
Not me.

241
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,747
This is great. What are we supposed
to do? Eat our feet?

242
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,081
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

243
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,625
This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's.
Why didn't you bring something?

244
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,292
I have to think of everything?
I brought the comb.

245
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:16,093
What do you need a comb for?
You don't have any hair.

246
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,017
I brought it for you guys,
so you'd have a comb.

247
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,641
Let's see how much money we've got?

248
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,480
I got $1.02.

249
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,852
And 68 cents from Chris.

250
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,654
60 cents from Teddy.

251
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,196
7 cents, Vern?

252
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,078
I haven't found my pennies yet.

253
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,498
$2.37 cents, not bad.

254
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:50,329
Quidaciolu's is at the end of the road
by the junkyard.

255
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,497
I think we can get some stuff there.

256
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,704
Train coming.

257
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:58,922
Geronimo!

258
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:04,057
Come on, Teddy.

259
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,435
I'm gonna dodge it.

260
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,312
Get off the tracks. You're crazy.

261
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,640
Train dodge. Dig it?

262
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:23,441
Get the hell off the tracks.
You want to get yourself killed?

263
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:25,775
Just like the beach at Normandy.

264
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:45,633
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

265
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:49,262
I'm trying to save your life.

266
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,842
You want to kill yourself?

267
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,676
Is that what you want, goddamn it?

268
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:54,926
You tried to kill yourself.

269
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,102
I don't need no babysitter.

270
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,903
You do, too.

271
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:12,195
Skin it.

272
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:15,239
I could have dodged it.

273
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:19,416
Listen, you can dodge it on the way back.

274
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:21,788
Peace.

275
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,116
Skin it.

276
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:54,394
<i>About this time, Charlie and Billy
were playing mailbox baseball...</i>

277
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,482
<i>... with Ace and Eyeball.</i>

278
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,608
Shit on that. Goddamn it!

279
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:02,073
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

280
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,363
Why don't you tell me something
I don't know, asshole?

281
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,077
Billy, you're up.

282
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,456
You guys win.
I don't want to play no more.

283
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:12,004
You can't quit.

284
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:16,170
We only played three innings.
That'd be a non-official game.

285
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,383
<i>Ace, me and...</i>

286
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,720
What's with you homos?
You've been acting psycho all day.

287
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,257
What is it?

288
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,640
It's nothing, right?

289
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:32,850
Then if you don't mind,
I'd like to finish this game...

290
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,609
...before I start collecting
my social security, okay?

291
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:38,107
You're up, Billy. Move it.

292
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,401
All right, give me this fucking stick.

293
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,148
Let's play ball.

294
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,409
Foul ball.

295
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,924
Vern, it looks like
your mom's been out driving again.

296
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,257
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

297
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:08,804
Stand back, men!

298
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,340
Paratroopers, over the side!

299
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:16,889
<i>"No Trespassing" was enforced
by Milo Pressman, the junkman...</i>

300
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,390
<i>... and his dog, Chopper.</i>

301
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,312
<i>The most feared and least seen dog
in Castle Rock.</i>

302
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:26,108
<i>Legend had it that Milo had
trained Chopper not just to sic...</i>

303
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,646
<i>... but to sic specific parts
of the human anatomy.</i>

304
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:33,400
<i>Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled
the junkyard fence...</i>

305
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:37,407
<i>... might hear the dread cry:
"Chopper, sic balls!"</i>

306
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:40,452
<i>But right now neither the dread Chopper
nor Milo...</i>

307
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,285
<i>... was anywhere in sight.</i>

308
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:46,040
Teddy's crazy.

309
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,834
Come on, men, move it out!

310
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:51,631
He won't live to be 20, I bet.

311
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,631
Remember the time you saved him
in the tree?

312
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,297
I dream about that sometimes.

313
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:03,803
Except in the dream I miss him.
I just get a few hairs and down he goes.

314
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,100
It's weird.

315
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,808
That is weird.

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,769
But you didn't miss him.

317
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,147
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

318
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:14,155
Not even when
the ladies leave the seat down.

319
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,152
Race you.

320
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,909
- No, I don't think so.
- Over to the pump.

321
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:22,527
- I'm kind of tired. Go.
- You're a dead man, Lachance!

322
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,236
It looks like Lachance
has got him this time.

323
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,825
He's got Chambers beat.

324
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,407
But what's this?
Chambers is making his move.

325
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,957
Lachance is fading
and it's Chambers at the tape.

326
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,872
The crowd goes wild.

327
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,894
<i>You guys been watching
The Mickey Mouse Club lately?</i>

328
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,976
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

329
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,481
- You think so?
- I think so.

330
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,816
I think he's right.

331
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:07,900
I've been noticing that the A and the E
are starting to bend around the sides.

332
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,661
Annette's tits are great.

333
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,616
This is a really good time.

334
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,747
The most.

335
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,114
A blast.

336
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,662
<i>Vern didn't just mean being off limits
inside the junkyard...</i>

337
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,546
<i>... or fudging on our folks...</i>

338
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,499
<i>... or going on a hike up the tracks
to Harlow. He meant those things, but...</i>

339
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:30,211
<i>... it seems to me now it was more
and that we all knew it.</i>

340
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,463
<i>Everything was there and around us.</i>

341
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:36,424
<i>We knew exactly who we were
and exactly where we were going.</i>

342
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:38,311
<i>It was grand.</i>

343
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:45,358
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

344
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,438
What time is it?

345
00:22:48,738 --> 00:22:50,232
It's a quarter after one.

346
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:53,324
You'd better go get the food.
Junkyard opens at 3:00.

347
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,903
Chopper'll be here.

348
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:56,452
Sic balls.

349
00:22:57,413 --> 00:22:59,903
You go. You can pick us up
on the way back.

350
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:01,991
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

351
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,084
- I'm staying right here.
- I'm not going.

352
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:08,380
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

353
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:09,793
Okay.

354
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,539
Odd man goes.

355
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,425
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

356
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,218
Flip or eat lead.

357
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,511
Four tails.

358
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,844
Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

359
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,021
- That doesn't mean anything.
- No, let's go again.

360
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,351
That's really bad.

361
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,902
Remember Clint Bracken and those guys
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

362
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:38,237
He said they flipped for beers
and they came up with a goocher...

363
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:40,233
...just before they got in the car.

364
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,816
And, bang! They all got totalled.

365
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,574
I don't like this. Sincerely.

366
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:49,536
Nobody believes that crap
about moons and goochers.

367
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,579
It's baby stuff.
Now come on, flip again.

368
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,917
Are you going to flip or not?

369
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,917
We don't have all day.

370
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,387
You lose, Gordie.

371
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:07,922
Gordie loses.

372
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:10,554
Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

373
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:14,062
<i>Does the word "retarded"
mean anything to you?</i>

374
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:16,973
Go get the provisions, you morphadite.

375
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:19,640
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

376
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:21,776
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

377
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:22,984
Shut up.

378
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:26,606
I don't shut up, I grow up.
And when I look at you, I throw up.

379
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,536
Then your mother goes around the corner
and she licks it up.

380
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:38,031
<i>Finding new and disgusting ways
to degrade a friend's mother...</i>

381
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,368
<i>... was always held as high regard.</i>

382
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,513
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

383
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:57,846
Yes, sir.

384
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,226
Shame what happened to him.

385
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:05,350
<i>The Bible says,
"In the midst of life we are in death."</i>

386
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,353
Did you know that?

387
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,022
I lost a brother in Korea.

388
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:15,114
You look like your brother Denny.

389
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,944
People ever tell you that?

390
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,870
Sometimes.

391
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:24,620
I remember the year
he was All-Conference.

392
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:26,536
Quarterback, he played.

393
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,128
Boy, could he throw.

394
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:32,002
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

395
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,594
Could be some scouts
at the game tomorrow.

396
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,386
- I don't know, Pop.
- Dad, could I have the potatoes?

397
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:46,176
- That's what I hear, Son.
- Are you going to see Jane after the game?

398
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,848
I think she's a lovely girl.

399
00:25:47,939 --> 00:25:51,888
- Dad, may I please have the potatoes?
- Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

400
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:56,230
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his life.

401
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,902
- Dennis, when you're there tomorrow...
- Did you read the story Gordie wrote?

402
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,272
Gordie wrote a story.

403
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,823
- It was really good.
- What did you write, sweetheart?

404
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,826
That's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

405
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,366
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

406
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:14,044
I really liked it.

407
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:16,295
I thought it was great.

408
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,253
You play football?

409
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:26,887
Do you play football?

410
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:30,137
No.

411
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,179
What do you do?

412
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,932
I don't know.

413
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,315
Your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

414
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,570
There you go, kid. $1.50 of hamburger.

415
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:18,637
You, kid! What are you doing there!
Come over here!

416
00:27:18,727 --> 00:27:22,938
You, come back here, goddamn it!
I'll sic my dog on you.

417
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:24,517
Run!

418
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,975
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

419
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:30,234
<i>Now he said: "Sic him, boy."</i>

420
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:33,405
<i>But what I heard was: "Chopper, sic balls."</i>

421
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:50,838
That's Chopper?

422
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:55,293
<i>Chopper was my first lesson in the vast
difference between myth and reality.</i>

423
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:58,339
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.

424
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,471
Come on, bite shit.

425
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,799
Sic balls, Choppie.

426
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:09,761
You kids stop teasing that dog!
You hear me? Stop teasing him!

427
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,858
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass,
teasing my dog like that!

428
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,646
Let's see you climb over this fence
and get me, fat ass!

429
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,314
Don't you call me that!

430
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,405
You little tin weasel
peckerwood loony's son!

431
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,695
What did you call me?

432
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,904
I know who you are,
you're Teddy Duchamp.

433
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,538
Your dad's a loony.

434
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,864
A loony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,534
He took your ear and he put it
to a stove and he burnt it off.

436
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,458
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

437
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:42,007
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are...

438
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:44,085
...with a loony for a father.

439
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:47,297
You call my dad a loony again
and I'll kill you.

440
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,175
Loony, loony.

441
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:53,011
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

442
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,469
No, I'm gonna kill him!

443
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:57,805
You come on and try it,
you little bastard.

444
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,475
He wants you to go over so he can beat
you up then take you to the cops.

445
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,403
You watch your mouth.
Let him do his own fighting.

446
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:07,903
Sure, you only outweigh him
by 500 pounds, fat ass.

447
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,366
I know your name.

448
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,778
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

449
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,949
And your fathers will get a call from me.

450
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,864
Except for the loony up in Togus.

451
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,872
I'm going to kill you. I'll show you.

452
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,667
- Get him away from...
- You foulmouthed whoremaster.

453
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,167
You son of a bitch!

454
00:29:27,383 --> 00:29:28,628
You come back here.

455
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:29,915
Do you hear me?

456
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,133
Nobody ranks out my old man.

457
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:35,263
<i>- My father stormed the beach...
- I said, "Come back here!"</i>

458
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:38,598
- He stormed the beach, you faggot!
- Come back here.

459
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:50,192
We showed him.
Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

460
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:53,027
He ranked my old man.

461
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:56,904
<i>I wondered how he could care so much
for his dad who'd almost killed him...</i>

462
00:29:56,992 --> 00:30:01,321
<i>... and I didn't care about my own
who hadn't touched me since I was three.</i>

463
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,405
<i>That was for eating bleach under the sink.</i>

464
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:05,491
He ranked my old man.

465
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:09,706
What do you care what a fat old pile
of shit like him says about your dad?

466
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:12,666
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

467
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:16,248
Do you think that pile of shit
was at Normandy?

468
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:17,457
Forget it, okay?

469
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:20,125
He knows nothin' about your old man.
He's shit.

470
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,305
Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

471
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:25,264
Forget it, all right?

472
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,918
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling
everybody's good time.

473
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,423
It's okay.

474
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,126
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

475
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,420
- You saying you want to go back?
- No.

476
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:13,893
But going to see a dead kid,
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

477
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:21,184
If he's really bad, like all cut up
with blood and shit all over him...

478
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,935
...I might have nightmares.

479
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:26,529
All guts and eyeballs
ready to jump and grab...

480
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:28,653
Shut up, goddamn it!

481
00:31:28,782 --> 00:31:30,062
I can't help it.

482
00:31:31,284 --> 00:31:32,565
Sorry.

483
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:37,533
<i>It was only a quarter to three,
but it felt much later.</i>

484
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,370
<i>It was too hot and too much had happened.</i>

485
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:43,034
<i>We weren't even close to the Royal River.</i>

486
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:47,958
<i>We needed to get moving if we were
going to make some real miles before dark.</i>

487
00:31:55,556 --> 00:31:57,382
Hold still, will you?

488
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:07,350
So what's with you
and this Connie Palermo chick?

489
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:11,944
I've been seeing her for over a month,
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

490
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:15,113
She's a Catholic. They're all like that.

491
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:18,110
You want to get laid
you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

492
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,071
A Jew's good.

493
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:23,157
<i>A KLAM newsbreak.</i>

494
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:26,082
<i>We interrupt to bring you an update
on the search for...</i>

495
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,791
<i>... 12 year-old Ray Brower.</i>

496
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,367
<i>The police have expanded their search
to Mutton...</i>

497
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:32,288
<i>... Durham and the outlying areas.</i>

498
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,040
When are they going to give up?

499
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,207
The kid's gone. They'll never find him.

500
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,257
Not where they're looking.

501
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:40,799
I was right,
they ain't never gonna find him.

502
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:44,054
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

503
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:46,555
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

504
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:50,343
Ten years from now a hunter's going to go
into the woods to take a leak...

505
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:52,644
...wind up pissing on his bones.

506
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,056
I bet you a $1,000
they find him before that.

507
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,190
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

508
00:32:57,277 --> 00:33:00,064
- Well, asshole...
- What's the big deal?

509
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:03,073
- Who cares?
- Would you two just shut the fuck up.

510
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:06,985
If either one of you assholes
had $2,000, I'd kill you both.

511
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,744
<i>We're back here with The Bossman.</i>

512
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,237
<i>From the racks and stacks,
it's the best on wax.</i>

513
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:14,870
<i>It's the Cordettes, with Lollipop.</i>

514
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:42,316
I got some Winstons.

515
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,476
Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

516
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,561
One apiece, for after supper.

517
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:47,942
That's cool.

518
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:52,116
That's when a cigarette tastes best,
after supper.

519
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:53,149
Right.

520
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,119
Do you think I'm weird?

521
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,202
- Definitely.
- No, seriously.

522
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,416
Am I weird?

523
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,914
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

524
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,510
You ready for school?

525
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,514
Junior high.

526
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,932
You know what that means.

527
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,931
By next June we'll all be split up.

528
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,515
What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

529
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,776
'Cause it's not going to be like
grammar school, that's why.

530
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,278
You'll be taking college courses,
and me, Teddy, Vern we'll all be...

531
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,532
...in the shop courses
making ashtrays and birdhouses.

532
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:47,288
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.
Smart guys.

533
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,532
- Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
- No, man.

534
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:52,750
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

535
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,253
- I'm not going in with a lot of pussies.
- Then you're an asshole.

536
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,832
What's asshole with wanting
to be with your friends?

537
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,049
It's asshole if your
friends drag you down.

538
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:04,920
You hang with us, you'll just be
another wise guy with shit for brains.

539
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,632
You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

540
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:10,014
- What are you, cracked?
- Why not?

541
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:13,396
The other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

542
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,390
<i>You don't know nothin'.</i>

543
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,351
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

544
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:21,523
Superman is a real guy.
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

545
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,649
Yeah, maybe you're right.

546
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:27,901
Would be a good fight, though.

547
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:33,368
You could be a real writer someday.

548
00:35:33,624 --> 00:35:35,912
Fuck writing! I don't to be a writer.

549
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,500
- It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
- That's your dad talking.

550
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:41,247
- Bullshit!
- Bulltrue!

551
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,423
I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't care about you.

552
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:48,422
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

553
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,058
You're just a kid, Gordie.

554
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:57,804
Gee thanks, Dad.

555
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,972
I wish to hell I was your dad.

556
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:05,983
You wouldn't be talking about taking
these stupid shop courses if I was.

557
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:11,274
It's like God gave you something, man,
all those stories that you can make up...

558
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:14,781
<i>...and He said, "This is what we got
for you. Try not to lose it."</i>

559
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:18,403
Kids lose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

560
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:22,115
If your parents are too fucked-up to do it,
then maybe I should.

561
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,293
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

562
00:36:25,378 --> 00:36:28,829
By the time we get there
the kid won't even be dead anymore.

563
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:17,256
Any of you guys know
when the next train is due?

564
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:20,208
We could go down to the Route 136 Bridge.

565
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:23,386
What? Are you crazy?
That's five miles down the river.

566
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:26,804
You walk five miles down the river,
you gotta walk five miles back.

567
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,349
That could take till dark.

568
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:31,968
We go across here, we can get
to the same place in 10 minutes.

569
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:35,058
But if a train comes,
there's nowhere to go.

570
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:37,187
No, there isn't. You just jump.

571
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,725
- Teddy, it's a 100 feet.
- Yeah, Teddy.

572
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,188
You guys can go around if you want.

573
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,609
I'm crossing here.

574
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:47,154
And while you guys
are dragging your candyasses...

575
00:37:47,242 --> 00:37:51,702
...half-way across the state and back,
I'll be waiting for you on the other side...

576
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,697
...relaxing with my thoughts.

577
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:57,708
You use your left hand
or your right hand for that?

578
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,538
You wish.

579
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:07,763
I lost the comb.

580
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:09,939
Forget it, Vern.

581
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,263
Train!

582
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,302
Shit!

583
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,937
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

584
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:58,897
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

585
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:01,891
Get up! Move it!

586
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:03,977
Shit, Vern!

587
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,323
- Get up, man!
- I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

588
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,403
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

589
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:13,241
Go.

590
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,207
- You've got to go faster!
- I can't, Gordie!

591
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,131
Run!

592
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,512
Run, Vern, run! Move your ass!

593
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:45,975
Run, goddamn it, run!

594
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:13,882
At least now we know
when the next train was due.

595
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:26,476
That was the all-time train dodge.
Too cool.

596
00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:32,390
You were so scared you looked like
Abbott Costello when he saw the mummy.

597
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:34,226
I wasn't that scared.

598
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:37,401
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

599
00:41:37,488 --> 00:41:40,856
Then you won't mind if we check
your underpants for Hershey squirts.

600
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:42,408
Go screw.

601
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,444
You'd better turn yours over.

602
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,528
This is the way I like to do it.

603
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,069
Man!

604
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:50,665
You got any more, Gordie?

605
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:51,829
Sorry, Vern.

606
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,159
It's not funny.
What am I supposed to eat?

607
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:57,337
- Why don't you cook your dick?
- It'd be a small meal.

608
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,425
Screw you guys, I got it.

609
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:20,605
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

610
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,859
I cherish these moments.

611
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:29,824
What? What did I say?

612
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,578
Gordie, why don't you tell us a story?

613
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,911
I don't know.

614
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,242
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Gordie.

615
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,078
None of your horror stories, okay?

616
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:47,547
I don't want to hear no horror stories.
I'm not up for that.

617
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:51,257
Tell us one about Sergeant Steel
and his battling leathernecks.

618
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:54,596
The one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

619
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:56,638
It's about this pie-eating contest.

620
00:42:56,725 --> 00:43:01,137
The main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody likes, named Davie Hogan.

621
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,057
Like Charlie Hogan's
brother, if he had one.

622
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:05,435
Good, Vern.

623
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:07,932
Go on.

624
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:12,560
Well, this kid, he's our age,
but he's fat. Real fat.

625
00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:17,491
He weighs close to 180,
but it's not his fault. It's his glands.

626
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,109
My cousin's like that. Sincerely.

627
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:24,617
<i>She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed
to be a "hyboid" gland or somethin'.</i>

628
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,036
<i>I don't know about any "hyboid" gland,
but what a blimp!</i>

629
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,962
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

630
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:33,716
- And, you know, this one time...
- Shut up, Vern.

631
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:36,795
Right. Go on. It's a swell story.

632
00:43:37,552 --> 00:43:42,842
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie,
they called him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

633
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:46,100
Even his little brother
and sister called him Lardass.

634
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:49,969
<i>At school they put this sticker on his back
that says, "Wide Load."</i>

635
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,895
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

636
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,357
But one day he gets an idea.

637
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:02,278
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.

638
00:44:04,284 --> 00:44:06,656
<i>Is this thing on? Can you hear me?</i>

639
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:11,831
<i>The next contestant
in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat...</i>

640
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,540
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

641
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:26,794
<i>And our celebrity contestant,
from KLAM in Portland...</i>

642
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:30,715
<i>... The Boss-man himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

643
00:44:35,062 --> 00:44:37,469
<i>From the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax...</i>

644
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:41,608
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,
sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

645
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,103
<i>...it's...
- Boss!</i>

646
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:51,325
<i>Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat,
but one we expect...</i>

647
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:55,537
<i>... great things from in the future,
young Master David Hogan.</i>

648
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:04,453
- Are you all right, young man?
- Lardass how was your trip?

649
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,669
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

650
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:11,834
Don't even think about winning this.

651
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,630
Boy are you fat.

652
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:20,220
Don't pay attention to those fools,
Lardass. Davie.

653
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:36,529
<i>And now,
the one you've all been waiting for.</i>

654
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:41,195
<i>The four-time champion,
our own Bill Travis.</i>

655
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:50,079
Listen I got $10 riding
on you myself, Billy Boy.

656
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,796
<i>All right. Are you ready?</i>

657
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:57,332
<i>Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.</i>

658
00:45:57,927 --> 00:45:59,125
<i>Drum roll.</i>

659
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:03,295
Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.

660
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,723
<i>Go.</i>

661
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:15,640
Done!

662
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:33,448
Done!

663
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:36,915
Done!

664
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,796
You better pace yourself,
if you want to hold out.

665
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,164
Come on, Lardass!

666
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,165
Lardass, Lardass!

667
00:46:55,728 --> 00:47:00,140
What the audience didn't know, was
that Lardass wasn't interested in winning.

668
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,893
What he wanted was revenge.

669
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,646
And right before he was introduced,
he'd gotten ready for it.

670
00:47:09,031 --> 00:47:11,024
<i>... Principal John Wiggins.</i>

671
00:47:18,832 --> 00:47:23,410
<i>And our celebrity contestant
from KLAM in Portland...</i>

672
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:27,747
<i>... The Bossman himself, Bob Cormier!</i>

673
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:34,250
<i>From the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax...</i>

674
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:38,425
<i>... how about another double, golden oldie,
sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...</i>

675
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:39,429
<i>... it's...</i>

676
00:47:39,683 --> 00:47:40,632
Done.

677
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:48,021
<i>Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began
to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.</i>

678
00:47:48,191 --> 00:47:50,563
<i>He pretended he was eating cowflops...</i>

679
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,852
<i>... and rat guts in blueberry sauce.</i>

680
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:54,651
Done.

681
00:47:57,866 --> 00:48:02,113
<i>Slowly, a sound started to build
in Lardass's stomach.</i>

682
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,826
<i>A strange and scary sound...</i>

683
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:09,622
<i>... like a log truck coming
at you at 100 miles an hour.</i>

684
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:26,218
<i>Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...</i>

685
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,425
<i>... and before Bill Travis knew it...</i>

686
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:33,392
<i>... he was covered with five pies worth
of used blueberries.</i>

687
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:36,438
<i>The women in the audience screamed.</i>

688
00:48:36,901 --> 00:48:41,230
<i>Bossman Bob Cormier took one look
at Bill Travis and barfed on Wiggins.</i>

689
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:45,730
<i>Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack
that was sitting next to him.</i>

690
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:48,316
<i>Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits!</i>

691
00:48:48,953 --> 00:48:51,159
But when the smell hit the crowd...

692
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:54,873
...that's when Lardass's plan
really started to work.

693
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:56,875
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

694
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,703
<i>Kids barfed on their parents.</i>

695
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:00,503
<i>A fat lady barfed in her purse.</i>

696
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,581
<i>The Donelley twins barfed on each other.</i>

697
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:07,668
<i>The Women's Auxiliary barfed all over
the Benevolent Order of Antelopes.</i>

698
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,511
And Lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he'd created.

699
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,969
A complete and total barfarama.

700
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:27,769
- Too cool!
- That was the best, just the best.

701
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,024
Then what happened?

702
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,438
What do you mean?

703
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:33,276
I mean, what happened?

704
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,615
<i>What do you mean, "What happened?"
That's the end.</i>

705
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:42,456
How can that be the end? What kind of an
ending is that? What happens to Lardass?

706
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:43,870
I don't know.

707
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,377
Maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers.

708
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:50,293
Jesus, that ending sucks.

709
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,420
Why don't you make it
so that Lardass goes home...

710
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:56,005
...and he shoots his father.

711
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:58,587
Then he runs away
and he joins the Texas Rangers.

712
00:49:58,681 --> 00:49:59,926
How about that?

713
00:50:00,016 --> 00:50:01,391
I don't know.

714
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:03,511
Something good like that.

715
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,604
I like the ending. The barfing was good.

716
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:10,137
But there's one thing
I didn't understand.

717
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,522
Did Lardass have to pay
to get into the contest?

718
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,902
No, Vern, they just let him in.

719
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:21,650
Great, great story.

720
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:24,496
It's a great story.
I just didn't like the ending.

721
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:27,580
Where's the radio?
Let's see if we can get some sounds.

722
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:28,579
Here.

723
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,875
<i>We talked into the night.</i>

724
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:42,752
<i>The kind of talk that seemed important
until you discover girls.</i>

725
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,050
All right.

726
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,343
Mickey's a Mouse. Donald's a duck.
Pluto's a dog.

727
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:50,638
What's Goofy?

728
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:54,098
If I could only have one food
for the rest of my life?

729
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:56,228
That's easy. Pez.

730
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,692
Cherry flavored Pez.
No question about it.

731
00:51:00,862 --> 00:51:03,613
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

732
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,324
I knew the $64,000 Question was fixed.

733
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,529
There's no way anybody can know
that much about opera.

734
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:16,115
He can't be a dog.
He wears a hat and drives a car.

735
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,576
<i>Wagon Train is a really cool show...</i>

736
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:23,040
...but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere?

737
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,374
They just keep wagon training.

738
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:28,377
God, that's weird.

739
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,678
What the hell is Goofy?

740
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,351
<i>Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower,
but we were all thinking about him.</i>

741
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,019
Oh, my God.

742
00:51:45,234 --> 00:51:46,728
It's the Brower kid.

743
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:49,144
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

744
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,898
I promise I won't hock
no more dirty books.

745
00:51:53,992 --> 00:51:58,203
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.
I promise I'll eat my lima beans.

746
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:00,532
Two for flinching.

747
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:06,585
What is it, Chris?

748
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,332
Maybe it's coyotes.

749
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:11,671
Sounds like a woman screaming.

750
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:13,999
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

751
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,540
Don't say that.

752
00:52:15,845 --> 00:52:17,255
Teddy, sit down.

753
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,962
I'm gonna go look for it.
I want to see the ghost.

754
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:21,219
Don't say that.

755
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:24,427
I just want to see it!
I just want to see what he looks like.

756
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,310
Jesus H. Bald-headed Christ!

757
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:34,602
Maybe we should stand guard.

758
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,278
That's a good idea.

759
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,986
Give me the gun.
I'll take the first watch.

760
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:59,417
23:00 hours.
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

761
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,090
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.

762
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:09,511
Shut up, Teddy,
and keep your eyes peeled.

763
00:53:19,192 --> 00:53:21,765
- Cut it out.
- I'm trying to sleep.

764
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:27,106
The dogfaces rested easy...

765
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,868
...in the knowledge that
Corporal Teddy Duchamp...

766
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:33,119
...was protecting all that was dear to them.

767
00:55:07,497 --> 00:55:09,323
<i>It should have been you, Gordon.</i>

768
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:13,829
Are you okay?

769
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:18,297
You were dreaming.

770
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:31,513
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

771
00:55:36,689 --> 00:55:38,148
I miss him, Chris.

772
00:55:38,774 --> 00:55:40,233
I really miss him.

773
00:55:42,027 --> 00:55:42,976
I know.

774
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:48,484
Go back to sleep.

775
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:33,064
Maybe you could go
into the college courses with me.

776
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:34,900
That'll be the day.

777
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,692
Why not? You're smart enough.

778
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,243
They won't let me.

779
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:42,747
What do you mean?

780
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:46,494
It's the way the people think
of my family in this town.

781
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:50,795
It's the way they think of me. I'm just one
of those low-life Chambers kids.

782
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,374
That's not true.

783
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:54,377
It is.

784
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:58,128
No one asked me if I took the milk money.

785
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:00,921
I just got a three-day vacation.

786
00:57:06,936 --> 00:57:08,264
Did you take it?

787
00:57:08,479 --> 00:57:11,016
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.

788
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,809
Teddy knew I took it.

789
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:17,983
Everyone knew I took it.
Even Vern knew, I think.

790
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:25,529
Maybe I was sorry,
and I tried to give it back.

791
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:27,827
You tried to give it back?

792
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:30,363
Maybe, just maybe.

793
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:36,161
Maybe I took it to Old Lady Simons
and told her, and the money was all there.

794
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:39,918
But I still got a three-day vacation,
because it never showed up.

795
00:57:40,215 --> 00:57:42,504
And maybe the next week,
old Lady Simons...

796
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,759
...had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school.

797
00:57:46,387 --> 00:57:48,960
Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.

798
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:54,390
Let's just say that I stole the milk money,
but old Lady Simons stole it back from me.

799
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,177
Just suppose that I told this story.

800
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,434
Me, Chris Chambers,
kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

801
00:58:00,525 --> 00:58:02,932
Do you think anyone
would have believed it?

802
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:03,643
No.

803
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:07,899
You think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags...

804
00:58:08,198 --> 00:58:10,440
...from The View,
if they had taken the money?

805
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:11,944
- No way.
- Hell, no.

806
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:14,115
<i>But, with me...</i>

807
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,916
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time.

808
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:26,166
Anyway, she saw her chance
and she took it.

809
00:58:27,132 --> 00:58:30,216
I was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back.

810
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,015
<i>I just never thought...</i>

811
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:44,015
<i>I never thought that a teacher...</i>

812
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:48,604
Who gives a fuck anyway?

813
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,990
I just wish...

814
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:01,324
...that I could go someplace
where nobody knows me.

815
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:15,207
I guess I'm just a pussy.

816
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:17,924
No way, man.

817
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,210
<i>The freight woke up the other guys...</i>

818
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:10,715
<i>... and it was on the tip of my tongue
to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.</i>

819
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:14,262
<i>That was the one thing I kept to myself.</i>

820
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:17,436
<i>I've never spoken or written of it
until just now.</i>

821
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:28,698
How come you didn't get
some breakfast stuff like...

822
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:30,904
...Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

823
01:00:31,534 --> 01:00:36,658
Sorry. I guess a more experienced shopper
could've gotten more for your 7 cents.

824
01:00:38,164 --> 01:00:41,829
<i>With our stomachs rumbling,
we pressed on toward the Royal River.</i>

825
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:46,996
<i>The reality of Ray Brower was growing,
and kept us moving despite the heat.</i>

826
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:50,960
<i>For me, the idea
of seeing that kid's dead body...</i>

827
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:53,458
<i>... was starting to become an obsession.</i>

828
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,354
Gentlemen, the Royal.

829
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:12,737
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

830
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,653
We cut across this field right here,
we'll be there in an hour.

831
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,238
I think we should stick to the tracks.

832
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,284
I say we go across the field.

833
01:01:22,996 --> 01:01:23,944
Gordie?

834
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,622
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

835
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,951
Take no prisoners!

836
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:34,369
<i>You guys, it's a lot safer if we...</i>

837
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:38,131
<i>Come on, men. Let's take on the...</i>

838
01:01:38,218 --> 01:01:40,506
You don't know what's in those woods.

839
01:01:43,806 --> 01:01:45,348
You guys, wait up for me!

840
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:57,733
I gotta tell you something,
but swear on your mother's name...

841
01:01:57,818 --> 01:01:59,609
...that you won't tell anybody.

842
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:00,809
You got it, pal.

843
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,314
Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

844
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:07,692
What about him?

845
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:11,493
I'll tell you something, but you must swear
on your mother's good name...

846
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,861
...you won't tell nobody.

847
01:02:13,165 --> 01:02:17,412
<i>Billy and Charlie had managed to keep
their enormous secret for about 36 hours.</i>

848
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:19,750
<i>A personal record for both of them.</i>

849
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,835
<i>By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told
their secret to everybody in the gang.</i>

850
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:28,261
<i>I guess for those guys, protecting their
mother's good name wasn't a top priority.</i>

851
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:32,010
Ace, maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.

852
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,341
Maybe you could go without us?

853
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,429
You guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit.

854
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,896
I don't see your problem.

855
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:43,563
We take a bunch of fishing gear,
so if a cop asks us what we're doing:

856
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:48,561
<i>"We're here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river. Look what we found."</i>

857
01:02:48,655 --> 01:02:50,943
Come on, man, we're gonna be famous.

858
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:54,074
We'll be on every radio and TV show
in the country.

859
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:56,485
I still don't think we should go.

860
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:57,693
Okay.

861
01:02:59,498 --> 01:03:01,739
You've stated your position clearly.

862
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,743
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

863
01:03:04,335 --> 01:03:06,826
Get in the fucking car. Now!

864
01:03:07,004 --> 01:03:08,249
Let's go, man.

865
01:03:22,185 --> 01:03:25,138
<i>- I hate this shortcut.
- "I hate this shortcut."</i>

866
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:30,435
You flinched! Two for flinching.

867
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:35,898
But you flinched.

868
01:03:36,072 --> 01:03:38,230
I know. Two for flinching.

869
01:03:58,717 --> 01:04:00,709
How are we supposed to get across this?

870
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:03,423
- We use you as a raft.
- Very funny.

871
01:04:14,064 --> 01:04:16,733
It's not that deep. We can walk across.

872
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:29,738
I told you we should have stuck
to the tracks.

873
01:04:31,704 --> 01:04:34,871
Is it me,
or are you the world's biggest pussy?

874
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,742
I suppose this is fun for you.

875
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:40,119
No, but this is.

876
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:43,828
Want some more?

877
01:04:44,925 --> 01:04:47,380
- Stop it, come on!
- Act your age.

878
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:48,548
This is my age.

879
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:51,471
I'm in the prime of my youth,
and I'll only be young once.

880
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,426
But you're going to be stupid
for the rest of your life.

881
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,932
That's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant.

882
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,770
You die, Chambers!

883
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,109
Get him, Chambers!

884
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:10,104
- Vern's afraid he's gonna die!
- Teddy, you're gonna die!

885
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,191
Where do you think
you're going, Lachance?

886
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:18,411
Come on, you guys.

887
01:05:19,121 --> 01:05:20,201
Pile on!

888
01:05:22,082 --> 01:05:23,790
I don't want to do this.

889
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:26,533
Get off!

890
01:05:28,129 --> 01:05:30,537
- Sleeper hold.
- Stop it. I'm serious.

891
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:33,169
No one gets out of the sleeper hold.

892
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:37,470
- Vern, there's something on your neck.
- I'm not falling for that one, Lachance.

893
01:05:37,554 --> 01:05:39,428
No, there is something on your neck.

894
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:41,674
It's a leech. Leeches!

895
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,344
- Oh, my God!
- Leeches!

896
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,859
Get them off!

897
01:05:59,032 --> 01:06:00,194
Lay off me!

898
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:05,368
- Gordie, there's some on your back.
- Get them off!

899
01:06:07,081 --> 01:06:08,705
Are there any on mine?

900
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:31,887
Oh, shit, Chris.

901
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:35,766
Oh, shit, man.

902
01:06:58,209 --> 01:06:59,751
Are you okay?

903
01:07:01,796 --> 01:07:03,171
Can you hear me?

904
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:05,418
Are you there?

905
01:07:05,841 --> 01:07:07,086
Maybe he's dead.

906
01:07:07,175 --> 01:07:09,417
He's not dead.
He's still breathing, idiot.

907
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:10,542
I don't know.

908
01:07:10,971 --> 01:07:13,508
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

909
01:07:18,352 --> 01:07:20,890
I never met anybody who fainted before.

910
01:07:22,397 --> 01:07:25,149
Maybe he made a bad mistake
and looked at your face.

911
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,692
Shut up, Teddy.

912
01:07:27,235 --> 01:07:28,314
You okay?

913
01:07:29,737 --> 01:07:31,231
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

914
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:39,196
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

915
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:42,074
Great, Chambers,
now you're turning pussy, too!

916
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,657
What's your problem?
He had a leech on his balls. He fainted.

917
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:46,949
Are you his mother?

918
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,918
- Eat shit.
- You eat shit.

919
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,788
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

920
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:56,675
What a surprise! The king of the pussies
wants to go back, too.

921
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:58,967
<i>- Stop calling me that.
- What, "pussy"? Pussy!</i>

922
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:00,632
- Stop it!
- Pussy!

923
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:02,347
You four-eyed psycho!

924
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:03,929
Get off me!

925
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:08,305
Two for flinching.
Do I get two for flinching?

926
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:09,641
You like it, Teddy?

927
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:12,601
- Come on, you guys. Break it up.
- Stop it!

928
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:23,527
I'm not going back.

929
01:08:28,456 --> 01:08:30,828
- Idiot.
- Shut up! Retard.

930
01:08:36,088 --> 01:08:39,836
<i>At the time, I didn't know why I needed
to see that body so badly.</i>

931
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:43,710
<i>Even if no one had followed me,
I would have gone on alone.</i>

932
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:59,726
No way, Ace! Not this time, man.
No way!

933
01:08:59,817 --> 01:09:02,355
- Go for it, Vince.
- You want to race?

934
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:15,453
Oh, my God, I got him.

935
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,122
You are history. History!

936
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,749
- Fall back, Ace.
- Don't fuck around.

937
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,957
Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!

938
01:09:45,774 --> 01:09:47,434
Shit, man! Shit!

939
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:48,850
I won.

940
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,311
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.

941
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:06,409
Coming though the woods,
I bet we saved over an hour.

942
01:10:12,173 --> 01:10:14,165
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

943
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:19,294
The Brower kid must be
around here someplace.

944
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:21,759
Teddy and Vern
watch the left side of the tracks.

945
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:24,006
- We'll take the right.
- All right.

946
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:39,693
There he is! I see him! Look!

947
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,939
Look over there! I see him!

948
01:10:45,118 --> 01:10:46,862
<i>None of us could breathe.</i>

949
01:10:47,454 --> 01:10:50,739
<i>Somewhere under those bushes
was the rest of Ray Brower.</i>

950
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,840
<i>The train had knocked Ray
out of his Keds...</i>

951
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,846
<i>... just like it had knocked the life
out of his body.</i>

952
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,927
Jesus.

953
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,768
<i>The kid wasn't sick.</i>

954
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,060
<i>The kid wasn't sleeping.</i>

955
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,432
<i>The kid was dead.</i>

956
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:37,661
Let's look for some long branches.
We'll build him a stretcher.

957
01:11:50,927 --> 01:11:51,922
Gordie?

958
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:02,262
Why did you have to die?

959
01:12:03,396 --> 01:12:05,020
What's the matter with Gordie?

960
01:12:05,106 --> 01:12:06,185
Nothing.

961
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,192
You guys just go over there
and look for some branches?

962
01:12:09,276 --> 01:12:09,976
Okay.

963
01:12:22,246 --> 01:12:24,239
Why did he have to die, Chris?

964
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:28,248
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

965
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:31,873
I don't know.

966
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,920
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that.

967
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,677
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that, man.

968
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:43,796
I'm no good.
My dad said it. I'm no good.

969
01:12:43,974 --> 01:12:45,516
He doesn't know you.

970
01:12:47,018 --> 01:12:48,133
He hates me.

971
01:12:48,227 --> 01:12:49,722
He doesn't hate you.

972
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:52,264
- He hates me.
- No.

973
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,183
He just doesn't know you.

974
01:12:54,525 --> 01:12:57,644
He hates me. My dad hates me.

975
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,821
He hates me. Oh, God.

976
01:13:25,344 --> 01:13:27,917
You're gonna be a great writer someday.

977
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:33,886
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard-up for material.

978
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:54,869
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard-up?

979
01:13:57,706 --> 01:13:58,619
Yeah.

980
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:04,451
What the fuck do you know about this?

981
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:07,793
Son of a bitch! My little brother.

982
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:14,377
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

983
01:14:16,139 --> 01:14:17,597
You get away.

984
01:14:17,723 --> 01:14:19,550
We found him. We got dibs.

985
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:23,935
We better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

986
01:14:24,062 --> 01:14:27,894
We earned him. You guys came in a car.
That's not fair. He's ours.

987
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:29,898
<i>"That's not fair. He's ours."</i>

988
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:31,985
Well, not anymore.

989
01:14:32,236 --> 01:14:35,403
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

990
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:37,523
We will. Don't you worry.

991
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:45,038
Vern, you little son of a whore.

992
01:14:45,123 --> 01:14:48,456
- You was under the porch.
- No, I swear it wasn't me.

993
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:52,291
You keyhole-peeping bung.
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

994
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,801
You guys have two choices.

995
01:15:02,096 --> 01:15:04,717
Either leave quietly and we take the body...

996
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:08,052
...or you stay
and we beat the shit out of you.

997
01:15:08,477 --> 01:15:10,054
And we take the body.

998
01:15:10,145 --> 01:15:13,845
- Besides, me and Billy found him first.
- Vern told us how you found him.

999
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:17,308
<i>"Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car."</i>

1000
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:21,654
<i>"Billy, I think I just turned
my Fruit of the Looms into fudge factory."</i>

1001
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:24,229
- That's it. Your ass is grass!
- Hold it.

1002
01:15:27,744 --> 01:15:31,243
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.
This is your last chance.

1003
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,534
What do you say, kid?

1004
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:39,043
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

1005
01:15:43,758 --> 01:15:44,956
You're dead.

1006
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,302
Come on, let's split.

1007
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:50,217
- They're not taking him.
- Come on, this is crazy.

1008
01:15:50,305 --> 01:15:52,713
- They're not taking him.
- He's got a knife, man.

1009
01:15:53,642 --> 01:15:55,136
Ace, come on.

1010
01:16:00,481 --> 01:16:02,520
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1011
01:16:02,608 --> 01:16:03,853
No problem.

1012
01:16:17,663 --> 01:16:20,866
You're not taking him.
Nobody's taking him.

1013
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:26,619
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

1014
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:30,668
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

1015
01:16:31,884 --> 01:16:33,259
Don't move, Ace.

1016
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,296
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1017
01:16:39,599 --> 01:16:41,887
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1018
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:47,556
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

1019
01:16:51,651 --> 01:16:56,229
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

1020
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:05,485
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1021
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:07,953
No, just you.

1022
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,799
We're gonna get you for this.

1023
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,425
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1024
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:25,294
We will.

1025
01:17:38,026 --> 01:17:41,560
We're not going to forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

1026
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:44,029
This is big time, baby.

1027
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:02,831
<i>"Suck my fat one"?</i>

1028
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:06,962
Whoever told you,
you had a fat one, Lachance?

1029
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:10,420
Biggest one in four counties.

1030
01:18:28,654 --> 01:18:30,397
Are we going to take him?

1031
01:18:30,822 --> 01:18:31,604
No.

1032
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,652
But we came all this way?

1033
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,612
We're supposed to be heroes.

1034
01:18:40,206 --> 01:18:41,748
Not this way, Teddy.

1035
01:18:45,294 --> 01:18:47,203
Chris, give me a hand.

1036
01:18:50,006 --> 01:18:51,880
<i>Ray Brower's body was found...</i>

1037
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:55,050
<i>... but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit.</i>

1038
01:18:55,594 --> 01:18:59,544
<i>We decided that an anonymous phone call
was the best thing to do.</i>

1039
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:09,886
<i>We headed home. And although
many thoughts raced through our minds...</i>

1040
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:12,142
<i>... we barely spoke.</i>

1041
01:19:15,904 --> 01:19:18,739
<i>We walked all night
and made it back to Castle Rock...</i>

1042
01:19:18,823 --> 01:19:23,568
<i>... a little past 5:00 on Sunday morning,
the day before Labour Day.</i>

1043
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:29,164
<i>We'd only been gone two days,
but somehow the town seemed different...</i>

1044
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,119
<i>... smaller.</i>

1045
01:19:49,892 --> 01:19:51,268
See you in school.

1046
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:57,105
See you in Junior High.

1047
01:20:11,203 --> 01:20:12,199
Penny.

1048
01:20:21,003 --> 01:20:25,048
<i>I better get home, before my mom
puts me on the "10 Most Wanted List."</i>

1049
01:20:36,225 --> 01:20:37,933
No hard feelings, okay?

1050
01:20:38,853 --> 01:20:40,050
No way, man.

1051
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:07,911
<i>As time went on we saw less and less
of Teddy and Vern...</i>

1052
01:21:08,504 --> 01:21:12,252
<i>... until eventually they became
just two more faces in the halls.</i>

1053
01:21:12,382 --> 01:21:13,960
<i>It happens sometimes.</i>

1054
01:21:14,134 --> 01:21:17,798
<i>Friends come in and out of your life
like busboys in a restaurant.</i>

1055
01:21:18,346 --> 01:21:21,880
<i>I heard that Vern got married
out of high school, had four kids...</i>

1056
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:25,639
<i>... and is now the forklift operator
at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.</i>

1057
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:30,230
<i>Teddy tried to get into the Army,
but his eyes and his ear kept him out.</i>

1058
01:21:30,482 --> 01:21:32,770
<i>Last I'd heard
he'd spent some time in jail...</i>

1059
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:35,729
<i>... and was now doing odd jobs
around Castle Rock.</i>

1060
01:21:44,202 --> 01:21:47,203
I'm never gonna get out of this town,
am I, Gordie?

1061
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:51,073
You can do anything you want, man.

1062
01:21:54,336 --> 01:21:55,249
Sure.

1063
01:22:03,928 --> 01:22:05,303
Give me some skin.

1064
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:15,802
I'll see you.

1065
01:22:16,314 --> 01:22:18,022
Not if I see you first.

1066
01:22:22,945 --> 01:22:24,403
<i>Chris did get out.</i>

1067
01:22:24,529 --> 01:22:26,736
<i>He enrolled in the
college courses with me.</i>

1068
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:30,357
<i>And although it was hard,
he gutted it out like he always did.</i>

1069
01:22:30,493 --> 01:22:33,577
<i>He went on to college
and eventually became a lawyer.</i>

1070
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:36,993
<i>Last week,
he entered a fast-food restaurant.</i>

1071
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:40,251
<i>Just ahead of him,
two men got into an argument.</i>

1072
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,959
<i>One of them pulled a knife.</i>

1073
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:45,627
<i>Chris, who'd always made the best peace,
tried to break it up.</i>

1074
01:22:46,507 --> 01:22:48,215
<i>He was stabbed in the throat.</i>

1075
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,044
<i>He died almost instantly.</i>

1076
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,063
Dad, can we go now?

1077
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:16,321
- You ready?
- We've been ready for an hour.

1078
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,197
I'll be right there.

1079
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,453
He said that a half hour ago.

1080
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,576
Yeah my dad's weird.
He gets like that when he's writing.
