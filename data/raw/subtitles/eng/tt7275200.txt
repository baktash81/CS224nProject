In the big,
wide ocean lies Fishtail Reef

21
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,701
where Fifi and her friends
have adventures oh so sweet.

22
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,913
Every day they
go to fish school,

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,374
laugh, and have so much fun.

24
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,999
Come explore the sea with us!

25
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,087
Happy days have just begun.

26
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,213
Help!

27
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,341
Someone help me.

28
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,219
Please, can you help me?

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,097
I'm trying to find my
way to the sunken ship.

30
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,308
Which sunken ship?

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,395
There is more than one
sunken ship?

32
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,815
Oh yes sirree.

33
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,359
Lots of sunken ships down here.

34
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,280
Can't say how many, never
counted 'em.

35
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,448
I am lost.

36
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,410
I just moved to a sunken ship
a few days ago with my family

37
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,914
and I can't find my way home.

38
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,582
Lost?

39
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,459
That's terrible!

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,506
Sorry, can't help you right now.

41
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:17,177
Gotta get to the surface
for air.

42
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,805
Fifi, Finn,
and her parents too,

43
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,393
live in a seashell painted
purple, yellow, and blue,

44
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:30,314
amid colorful coral, squishy
seaweed, and sandy beach.

45
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,150
The Fish family loves
living in fabulous,

46
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,610
fun-filled, Fishtail Reef.

47
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,453
Fifi, you okay?

48
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,370
I was havin' a bad dream.

49
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:48,041
I was lost and I couldn't find
my way back

50
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,709
to Fishtail Reef.

51
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,211
I was alone and it was so scary.

52
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:55,840
Oh honey, it's okay, Fifi.

53
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,382
You're not lost!

54
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:00,470
It was just a bad dream.

55
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,971
It felt so real, Mama.

56
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,639
There were all these
mean sharks.

57
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,934
They were going to eat me!

58
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,395
Who was going to eat
my sweet little Fifi?

59
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:11,856
Sharks!

60
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,857
Sharks?

61
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,983
In my dream.

62
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,401
It was very scary.

63
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm sure it was, but
not all sharks are mean.

64
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,324
Like, like Professor Shark?

65
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,953
Well he's the best teacher
in the whole wide ocean.

66
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,249
He is a big friendly shark.

67
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,168
Papa, tell us again how
to scare away mean sharks.

68
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,463
Okay, Finn, I'll tell you and
Fifi how

69
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,840
to scare away mean sharks.

70
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,804
You look them right in the
eye and shout "goonches!"

71
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,851
Goonches?

72
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,268
Goonches?

73
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,812
Goonches?

74
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,774
Goonches are big sea monsters
that eat sharks, right Papa?

75
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,942
That's right, Finn.

76
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:00,905
Yell "goonches" and sharks swim
away fast.

77
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,036
Fell better, Fifi?

78
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:11,249
Oh yes, it's going to be a
great day.

79
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,375
It's the first day of school!

80
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,425
How do I look?

81
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,426
I like your pink bow, Fifi.

82
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,428
How do I look?

83
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,805
Your hip-hop-happening.

84
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,933
I like your baseball cap.

85
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,183
Thanks, sis.

86
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:32,937
We gotta look cool on
our first day of school.

87
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,897
You both look very nice.

88
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,233
Did you finish your breakfish?

89
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,526
Yes.

90
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,195
Since it's the first
day of school,

91
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,613
Mama and I are going to swim you
to class.

92
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:44,615
You ready?

93
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,490
Let's go!

94
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,338
Lily!

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,341
Look, it's my best friend Lily.

96
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,384
Thanks for swimming me
to school.

97
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,678
See you later, fishenators.

98
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,390
Have fun!

99
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:15,605
We'll be here after
school to swim you home.

100
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,399
Lily, it's so good to see you.

101
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,901
How was your summer?

102
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,861
My grandma and
grandpa are nice.

103
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:24,697
They are always eating.

104
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,783
How was your summer?

105
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,868
Super duper fun!

106
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,579
We played lots of games
in the reef.

107
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,500
Oh look, there's Petal!

108
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,502
Petal, how was your summer?

109
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,378
I learned a lot.

110
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,964
Did you get to walk on land?

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,384
What was it like?

112
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,551
I did walk on land.

113
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:52,474
It was a very sandy beach and
the sand tickled my flippers.

114
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,562
This is so much fun.

115
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,231
I love being friends.

116
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,863
It's Principal Barrowing Whale.

117
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,992
School is about to begin.

118
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,248
Who do you think we'll
get for our teacher?

119
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,459
I hope it's Professor Shark.

120
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,630
I heard he takes his class
on a lot of field trips.

121
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,134
I heard that too!

122
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,010
I hope Professor Shark
is our teacher

123
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,597
and we're all in the same class.

124
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,099
As the early
morning sunshine beats down

125
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,101
in the sea, the young fish wait

126
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,603
to hear who their
teacher will be.

127
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,659
The next 10 fish
will report

128
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,579
to Ocean Reef Cove Four
classroom.

129
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,498
Lily.

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,707
That's me!

131
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,791
Fifi.

132
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,627
We're together!

133
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,546
Petal.

134
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,841
I'm so happy.

135
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,010
Trigger.

136
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,719
Kiki.

137
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,180
Sammy.

138
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,016
Tang.

139
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:19,271
And lastly Hazel, Chopper, and
Finn.

140
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:22,647
Oh no! Ugh!

141
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,692
My brother is in my class.

142
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:29,324
All 10 of you report to class
Cove Four.

143
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,740
Your teacher will be

144
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,792
Professor Shark!

145
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,043
Yay!

146
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,921
Good morning, class.

147
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,507
Welcome to class Cove Four.

148
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,759
My name is Professor Shark.

149
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,637
Good morning,
Professor Shark.

150
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,265
I'm so happy to have
all of you in my class.

151
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:01,603
I have rows and rows of
sharp teeth in my mouth

152
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,272
but I am very friendly.

153
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:08,777
I have been teaching for
many years and I love my job!

154
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,656
I'm very excited to
meet all of you.

155
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,492
We're very excited
to meet you, too.

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,786
What is your name?

157
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,704
My name is Fifi.

158
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,581
Nice to meet you, Fifi

159
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,793
I have a very exciting
announcement to make.

160
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,711
Would you like to hear it?

161
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,130
Oh yes!

162
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,507
Would everyone
like to hear it?

163
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,847
For our first day of school
we're going on a field trip!

164
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,473
I've never been on
a field trip before.

165
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,935
What is a field trip,
Professor Shark?

166
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,686
What is your name?

167
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,399
My name is Chopper.

168
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:49,609
Well Chopper, a field
trip is when our whole class

169
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,824
travels together to a new
place to explore and learn.

170
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,492
Wow!

171
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,663
I love exploring new places.

172
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:00,747
Me too.

173
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,916
This is going to be so much fun.

174
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,752
There are a few
important things we must do

175
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,004
to prepare for our field trip.

176
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,881
Like what?

177
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,342
My name is Finn, I'm Fifi's
brother.

178
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,800
Hi Finn!

179
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,677
I will tell you what
we need to do.

180
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,473
First, each of you needs
to be paired with a buddy.

181
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,017
You will swim next to that buddy

182
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,728
at all times during
our field trip.

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,315
I hope I get to
be with you, Lily.

184
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,068
I hope I get to be
with you too, Fifi.

185
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,364
Okay Fifi and Lily, you will
be our first swim buddies.

186
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,116
Oh yippee!

187
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:37,951
Hurray!

188
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,203
Who is next?

189
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,746
How about me and Sammy?

190
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,579
Sammy?

191
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,998
I am Sammy Swordfish.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,376
Finn and me like to swim
through Fishtail Reef together.

193
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,877
Perfect!

194
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,378
I'm Trigger.

195
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,214
I think going on a field trip
on our first day of school

196
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,424
is fish sticks!

197
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,300
Fish sticks?

198
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,301
That means cool.

199
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:59,597
Who would you like to
choose as your swim buddy?

200
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,474
I would like Chopper
to be my swim buddy.

201
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,643
I would like that too,
Trigger.

202
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,895
Very good!

203
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,897
Trigger and Chopper
will be swim buddies.

204
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,401
Hi Professor Shark,
my name is Petal.

205
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:16,321
I was really hoping you
would be my teacher.

206
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,617
I'm glad you're my student,
Petal.

207
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:24,204
I would like Kiki the
pufferfish to be my swim mate.

208
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,748
I'm glad you chose me, Petal.

209
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,251
That leaves me and Tang.

210
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,084
My name's Diesel.

211
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,795
And I'm Tang.

212
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,424
Diesel and I like to
race through the reef.

213
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,343
Excellent, you're already swim
buddies!

214
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,970
What an interesting
group of sea animals.

215
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,431
Is everyone ready to swim
two-by-two

216
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,853
deep down to the bottom of the
sea to visit a sunken ship?

217
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,772
A sunken ship?

218
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,650
Maybe we'll find
some buried treasure.

219
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,776
Oh yippee!

220
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,320
That would be funtastic.

221
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,449
Fishy swishy bubbleyishy cool!

222
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:03,703
This is going to be
our best adventure ever!

223
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,414
The fish form
pairs to keep them safe

224
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,417
while the deep dark sea
can be a dangerous place

225
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,338
but our little fishes
need not fear

226
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,422
for Professor Shark and soon,

227
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,800
an assistant teacher
will be near.

228
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,177
Before we leave for the
sunken ship adventure,

229
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,266
I have one more surprise!

230
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,728
Alba!

231
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,645
Welcome.

232
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,230
Class, I'd like you
to meet Alba.

233
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,108
Hi class.

234
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,319
Alba is a white seal.

235
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,780
She is my teacher's assistant.

236
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,406
What is that?

237
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,033
A teacher assistant is
someone who helps

238
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,869
a professor in the classroom.

239
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,080
Alba is studying to be a
teacher.

240
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,416
- Hooray!
- Yay!

241
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,837
How do you learn
to be a teacher?

242
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,089
It's not easy,
I had to work hard

243
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,676
to get accepted into the
Aquatic Mammal University,

244
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,262
better known as AMU.

245
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,557
I am also going to learn a lot
by helping Professor Shark,

246
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,268
the best professor in the sea.

247
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,271
Yay!

248
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm very excited to
be joining you

249
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,858
on this special
first day of school

250
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,778
and on your very
first field trip.

251
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,863
Yay!

252
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,866
I see you are
already in pairs.

253
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,828
Are we ready to go,
Professor Shark?

254
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,373
One more important thing
before we go:

255
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,459
there are dangerous
creatures out by the wreck

256
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,673
including a sly shark named
Toothy Magrue, but don't worry,

257
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,426
Alba and I won't let
anything happen to you.

258
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,179
The students
swim, they bob and dip,

259
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,432
eager to start their
fun field trip.

260
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,102
They're going to
see a sunken ship.

261
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,978
As we swim to the sunken ship

262
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,982
I would like each of you
to tell Alba your name

263
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,066
and a little about yourself.

264
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,651
I will go first.

265
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:05,657
I'm Fifi, I'm a pink pastel
fish with big goldfish eyes.

266
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:10,872
I love to play games and
swim through Fishtail Reef.

267
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,541
Hello Fifi, it's nice
to meet you.

268
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,960
My name is Lily,
I'm a blue whale.

269
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,131
Whales are not fish,
we are mammals.

270
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,882
I can breathe air!

271
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,512
I love to each and I'm going
to be very big when I grow up.

272
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,266
And Lily is my best friend.

273
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,977
And Fifi is my best friend.

274
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,896
Nice to meet you, Lily.

275
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:39,066
Whales are very
special marine mammals.

276
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,276
My name is Finn,
I'm Fifi's brother.

277
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,695
I'm a blue pastel fish
and I want

278
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,031
to be a scientist
when I grow up.

279
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,325
I love learning about the sea!

280
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,203
So do I, Finn!

281
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,122
We are going to learn a lot
together.

282
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,123
I'm Sammy Swordfish.

283
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,958
Do you know a lot
about the sea, Alba?

284
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,419
I do, and I can't
wait to teach

285
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,213
you everything I know, Sammy.

286
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,632
Tell me more about you.

287
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,343
Chop chop, I have a
really cool sword as a nose,

288
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,762
I can swim really fast,
and I like to tell jokes.

289
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,141
Telling jokes is a very
special talent.

290
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,310
Can I tell a joke now?

291
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,938
Where does Alba like to eat?

292
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,065
A joke about me?

293
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,568
I don't know, where does
Alba like to eat, Sammy?

294
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,281
At a dive-in
you get it, yeah?

295
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,785
That was funny, Sammy.

296
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,829
That's funny.

297
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,123
And you are?

298
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,373
I'm Trigger.

299
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,002
I'm a seahorse,
a very special fish.

300
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,213
I have a head shaped
like a horse

301
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:47,175
and a really cool tail that
can wrap around seaweed.

302
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:51,390
I see you have four flippers
that's fishadocious!

303
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,850
That's right, Trigger.

304
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,310
I do have four flippers!

305
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,314
Semi what?

306
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,316
Oh, my name is Kiki.

307
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,863
Semiaquatic is a
very big word, Kiki.

308
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,156
It means I live part
of the time in water

309
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,868
and part of the time on land.

310
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,579
I'm a pufferfish so
I can't go on land

311
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,959
but I can blow my body
up into a big round ball.

312
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:21,919
I have a lot of sharp
spikes on my body.

313
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,171
I love to play ocean soccer.

314
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
I like to play soccer too!

315
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,471
Help!

316
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,680
I am so sorry
to interrupt your class

317
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,057
but it's an emergency.

318
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,642
What's wrong?

319
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,977
It's my daughter.

320
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,980
She's a little stingray and
she's lost.

321
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,608
Have you seen her?

322
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,525
Lost?

323
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,693
Yes!

324
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,695
We're on a field trip
to visit a sunken ship.

325
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,364
If we see a little
stingray we will

326
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,160
make sure she gets home safely.

327
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,244
We are very worried.

328
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,206
Oh no!

329
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,583
What is her name?

330
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,709
Her name is Cherie.

331
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,924
She is too little to be out
in the ocean all by herself.

332
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,259
Don't worry, we'll find her!

333
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,263
Yes, we will find her.

334
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,226
We will find Cherie!

335
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,896
Thank you so much.

336
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,569
I think I can help find
Cherie, the lost stingray.

337
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,778
You can?

338
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,241
How can you help us
find a lost stingray?

339
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,618
I am a detective.

340
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,661
Really?

341
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,122
Tell us more.

342
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,543
My name is Petal and
I'm a sea turtle.

343
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,464
Some turtles are semi, uh,
semiaqua...

344
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,176
Semiaquatic?

345
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,095
Yeah, what you just said.

346
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,432
I'm that too!

347
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:01,685
Sea turtles are reptiles,
I can breathe underwater.

348
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,024
I can also crawl onto the
land and let my hard turtle

349
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,902
shell soak up some sun.

350
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,612
That's right, Petal.

351
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:14,489
Some turtles live part
of the time in the sea

352
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,867
and part of the time on land.

353
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,078
I can help find Cherie,
the lost stingray,

354
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,748
because I'm not
just a detective,

355
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,544
I am a very good detective.

356
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,588
I can see you are very smart!

357
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,716
How can we find Cherie?

358
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,344
I'm going to solve
the mystery of Cherie,

359
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,807
the missing stingray,
by looking for clues.

360
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,226
That is a very good idea.

361
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,062
We can all look for clues when

362
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,189
we get closer
to the sunken ship.

363
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,356
My name is Diesel,

364
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,941
I can help find Cherie the
stingray, too.

365
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,862
How can you help us
find Cherie?

366
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,738
I'm a manta ray.

367
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,534
I have a really flat body
so I can swim super fast.

368
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,870
Can you swim fast, Alba?

369
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:04,373
Yes, but, maybe not as fast as
you.

370
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,209
I wanna be a singer.

371
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,047
♪ A, E, I, O, U ♪

372
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,844
Oh my, you sing beautifully!

373
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,055
What a wonderful voice!

374
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,266
I'm Chopper,
I'm an angler fish.

375
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,894
I have really sharp teeth
like Professor Shark,

376
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,271
only my teeth are long and thin.

377
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,401
But don't worry,
I'm friendly too!

378
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,236
I'm glad to hear that,
Chopper.

379
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,530
I want to be a deep
sea diver like my dad

380
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,742
and find buried treasures!

381
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,495
Maybe we will find
buried treasure today!

382
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,331
I'm Tang,
I'm a bright yellow fish.

383
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,043
I have a really cool feathery
crested fin.

384
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,712
I want to be a fish groomer.

385
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,382
The sea needs
good fish groomers.

386
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,299
What an interesting
group of fish.

387
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,261
I'm really looking forward
to teaching you this year.

388
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,971
Me too!

389
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,975
I am lucky I was
sent to this class.

390
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:04,978
Yay!

391
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,317
Ahoy there, class Cove Four.

392
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,488
I'm Dudley Dolphin.

393
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,241
I'm your tour guide today!

394
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,952
I'm here to tell you
everything you want to know

395
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,288
about sunken ships!

396
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,208
Hi Dudley Dolphin!

397
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,126
Professor Shark, Alba,

398
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,546
is it okay if I ask your class

399
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,382
a few questions
about sunken ships?

400
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,883
Of course, Dudley.

401
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,843
Proceed!

402
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,554
Okie Dokie Doo,
my little troopers!

403
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,226
Can any of you tell me
what is a sunken ship?

404
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,895
It's a big boat lying at
the bottom of the ocean.

405
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,025
Yes, that is true!

406
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,776
A sunken ship has
something to do

407
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,112
with the creatures
called people.

408
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,949
You know, the ones that
live on top of the water.

409
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:02,786
People!

410
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,329
People.

411
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,417
All those earthy creatures
with skin!

412
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,505
People have really
long flippers

413
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,257
that smack the water
when they try to swim.

414
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,053
They move all around but
they don't get very far.

415
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,722
People!

416
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,142
People.

417
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,688
Earthy creatures.

418
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,315
People don't have flippers,
Petal, they have arms.

419
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,442
Arms?

420
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,696
That's a funny word.

421
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,282
People arms?

422
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,660
People arms flop and
splash because people

423
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,871
have to keep their heads above
water so they can breathe.

424
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,668
Oooweee!

425
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:58,506
This is one smart
class!

426
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,924
Why are we talking
about people?

427
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,554
What do people have to
do with sunken ships?

428
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:08,391
People can't breathe
underwater so they build ships.

429
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:15,523
Oh correctamundo, oh
smart fish in the sea.

430
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:22,947
People build ships to
sail across the sea.

431
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,408
If the ship sails on top of
the water

432
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,744
how come we're going
to visit a sunken ship

433
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,871
lying at the bottom of the sea?

434
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,456
How did it get there?

435
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,501
That is a most excellent
question.

436
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,421
People do build boats to
sail on top of the water

437
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,843
but sometimes boats don't
stay on top of the water.

438
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,845
They sink to the bottom
of the sea.

439
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,389
Why do ships sink?

440
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,308
Don't people know how to keep
ships on top of the water?

441
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,143
There are many
reasons ships sink

442
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,103
to the bottom of the ocean.

443
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,607
Strong storm winds can blow
a ship in the wrong direction

444
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,526
and people get lost.

445
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:05,030
I would not like to
get lost in the ocean.

446
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,490
Me too, Fifi.

447
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,744
It would be scary to be
all alone in the ocean.

448
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,538
Scary!

449
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,624
I'll tell you something scary:

450
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,379
lightning can break
a ship into two!

451
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,968
Even scarier: the bottom
of the ship can hit

452
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:28,095
a rock that people don't see!

453
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:32,683
A rock punches a hole in
the boat and the boat sinks.

454
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:36,772
And scariest of all,
sometimes ships get attacked

455
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,192
by angry sea monsters!

456
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,777
Sea monsters?

457
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,321
Don't worry!

458
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,074
We're not going to
see any sea monsters.

459
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,120
Do sea monsters
live in sunken ships?

460
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,248
They doodley doodley
doodley do!

461
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,543
Dudley Dolphin, you're
scaring my students!

462
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,339
Sorry!

463
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,256
Don't be frightened.

464
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,424
Mostly we are going to see fish,

465
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,970
all kinds of fish live in
and around sunken ships.

466
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,972
Maybe one of
the fish that lives

467
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,726
in the sunken ship saw Cherie.

468
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,144
I heard about that
little lost fish.

469
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,565
I hope the sea monsters
don't eat her.

470
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,526
Sea monsters eat fish?

471
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,905
Oopa Oopa Oopsy!

472
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,161
Did it again.

473
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,497
Are there a lot of
sunken ships in the ocean?

474
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,789
Millions!

475
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,374
Millions?

476
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,628
That's a really big number.

477
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,298
Are there a
million sea monsters?

478
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,676
I can't even count to a million!

479
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,013
I think we've heard
enough about sea monsters.

480
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,514
Okie Dokie Doo.

481
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,769
The tour is almost through
and you lucky buckaroos

482
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,104
are about to see a sunken ship

483
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,441
at the bottom of the ocean blue.

484
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,486
Hooray!

485
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,571
Thank you Dudley Dolphin.

486
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,157
We will swim the class
the rest of the way.

487
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,660
Bye Dudley!

488
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,536
G'day my little baddoos.

489
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,082
Stay safe, swim two-by-two,

490
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,795
or the sea monsters
will eat you.

491
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,588
The students
continue their fun field trip

492
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,468
thinking of sea monsters and
sunken ships.

493
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,055
Will there be any sea
monsters that eat little fish

494
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,556
on the sunken ship, Alba?

495
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,267
Of course not.

496
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,562
Dudley Dolphin
is just being silly.

497
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,565
Sea monsters do not
eat little fish, Fifi,

498
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,776
but we do need to swim together.

499
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,236
There are some sharks,

500
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:52,280
including one very goofy
Toothy Magrue who might.

501
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,617
Let's not think about
sea monsters and sharks.

502
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,706
Let's be on the lookout for
that little missing stingray.

503
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,625
She must be really scared.

504
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:07,296
Don't worry, Alba, I,
the great Inspector Petal,

505
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:12,634
am going to find Cherie and
everyone is going to help me.

506
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,637
Yay!

507
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,931
I'm Inspector Petal's
assistant, Doctor Kiki.

508
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,059
I think we should start
looking for clues.

509
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,688
Good idea, Kiki.

510
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,149
What are clues,
Inspector Petal?

511
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,484
Clues are important
that we find

512
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,652
to help us solve a mystery.

513
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,530
I will look
very closely at everything

514
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,991
in and around the sunken ship!

515
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,786
We will find Cherie.

516
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:42,164
Lily and I will help you.

517
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,709
Everyone
stares at the sunken ship.

518
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:48,462
It is big and shiny,
the top of it dips,

519
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,466
one object catches all their
fish eyes:

520
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,761
a trail made of lots of
gold coins that shine.

521
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,430
Look at all these gold coins.

522
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,307
How did they get here?

523
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:03,061
Fish play, my dear Tang.

524
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,688
Inspector Petal is here to solve

525
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,067
the mystery of the gold coins.

526
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,526
What do you think,
Inspector Petal?

527
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,696
Do you see any clues?

528
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:15,948
Hmm.

529
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,119
I think the sunken ship
is a clue, Doctor Kiki.

530
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,746
The sunken ship is a clue?

531
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,790
That is a really big clue!

532
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,794
It is, but look, Doctor Kiki,

533
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,921
there are some coins
on that deck,

534
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,632
on the main part of the boat!

535
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,138
The main part of the
boat is called the hull,

536
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,765
right Professor Shark?

537
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,141
That's right, Diesel!

538
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:45,603
The main part of a boat is
called a hull.

539
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,729
Continue, Inspector Petal.

540
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,232
See those gold coins
in the hull?

541
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,111
The coins left a trail.

542
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,863
A trail that leads from the
boat to the sandy bottom.

543
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,287
I do see a trail of gold
coins, Inspector Petal.

544
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,039
Then you can see that the
treasure chest

545
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,625
fell off the ship when it sunk.

546
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,336
It fell off the ship and hit
the ground.

547
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,465
It hit the ground
and broke open.

548
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,592
And that is why there's a
trail of coins

549
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,386
on the sandy bottom near the
sunken ship.

550
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,847
You did it again,
Inspector Petal!

551
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,975
You solved the mystery.

552
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,768
Fish play, my dear Fifi.

553
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,063
Hooray!

554
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:34,401
Now we know why the treasure
chest landed on the ground.

555
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,278
Yes we do, Tang.

556
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,492
Very good, Petal, you are going
to make a great detective.

557
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,828
Petal, I don't think
I've ever met

558
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,498
such a smart sea turtle.

559
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,334
Shall we explore some more?

560
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,918
Hooray!

561
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,547
Let's go inside.

562
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,757
Time to
explore the sunken ship.

563
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,679
There are plants, and wheels,
and chairs, and boots.

564
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,641
There's pictures of pirates,
world globes, and maps.

565
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,393
They even found a captain's hat.

566
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,439
Chains and masts,
gold on the floor,

567
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:16,026
but wait, they're about
to discover so much more.

568
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,737
Wow.

569
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,738
So much to look at.

570
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,949
What's that, Professor Shark?

571
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,786
It's called a globe.

572
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,583
It shows all the land
and oceans of the Earth.

573
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,708
What's the Earth?

574
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,959
It's where we live!

575
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:35,921
That globe looks like a
ball I use to play soccer.

576
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,510
What's that?

577
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,179
That is a pirate.

578
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,639
What's a pirate?

579
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,225
It's a people that lives above
the sea,

580
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,934
right Professor Shark?

581
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,936
That's right, Lily.

582
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,563
A pirate is a person that sails
the sea

583
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,900
looking for gold and treasure.

584
00:28:55,902 --> 00:29:00,113
Looks like this pirate
found a lot of gold.

585
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,949
Or maybe sea monsters
leave a trail

586
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,909
of gold coins for little fish
like us

587
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:08,746
to follow when we're
inside the sunken ship

588
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:09,831
so they can eat us!

589
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,001
Don't worry guys, I'll
poke the sea monsters

590
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,713
with my sword nose.

591
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,722
Did you see that?

592
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,017
Something moved!

593
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,934
I did see something move.

594
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:42,613
Do you think it's a sea monster?

595
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,333
Hurry Fifi, swim faster.

596
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,169
Don't let the
sea monster catch us!

597
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,087
I'm swimming
as fast as I can!

598
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,090
That sea
monster's right behind us.

599
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,549
What are we going to do?

600
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,551
I don't know.

601
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,304
We are swimming away from the
sunken ship.

602
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,431
I don't see anyone
from the class.

603
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,017
I don't see anything but...

604
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,894
Open ocean!

605
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,771
Quick, in here.

606
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,607
Follow me.

607
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,614
We lost the sea monster.

608
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,240
Yay!

609
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,657
Are you Cherie?

610
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,117
Yes, how did you know?

611
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,205
Your mama and papa
are looking for you.

612
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,123
Everyone is looking for you!

613
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,792
They are very worried.

614
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,544
I miss my mama and papa.

615
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,462
How did you get lost?

616
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,422
I was swimming near
the sunken ship

617
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,884
when a sea monster started to
chase me.

618
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,847
He was yellow with
sharp pointy teeth.

619
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,975
And one eye is bigger
than the other eye?

620
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:56,019
That sea monster chased us too.

621
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,981
The sea monster chased
me and I swam so far

622
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,069
I could not find my way
back to the sunken ship.

623
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,197
That is what happened to us.

624
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,740
Have you been hiding in
this cave the whole time?

625
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,827
No, I swam through
the cave and found

626
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,996
an opening on the other side.

627
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,874
I swam through that opening
and this funny looking shark

628
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,461
started to chase me!

629
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,797
First you were chased by a
sea monster then by a shark?

630
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,260
It has been a very crazy day.

631
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,219
Then what happened?

632
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,140
I swam back into this
cave which is too small

633
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,057
for the shark to fit in.

634
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,184
Where did you see my
mama and papa?

635
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,439
We were on our way
to see a sunken ship.

636
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,524
We are on a field trip.

637
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:45,527
It is the first day of
school and Professor Shark...

638
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,029
A shark?

639
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:48,864
He is a friendly shark.

640
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,950
The best teacher in the whole
wide sea.

641
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,290
Oh no, it's the sea monster!

642
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,793
Quick, follow me.

643
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,171
Do you know where we are?

644
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:08,551
I'm not allowed to swim
this far from Fishtail Reef.

645
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:12,013
Do you know where we are, Lily?

646
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:16,183
No, I have never explored
the sea beyond Fishtail Reef.

647
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,393
My mother told me
a lot of sea animals

648
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:22,399
that live in open ocean
like to eat little fish.

649
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:41,834
Oh look, three adorable
little fish baits.

650
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,169
Fish baits?

651
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,590
Fish baits.

652
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:51,054
If you don't wanna
catch anything very big.

653
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
What's wrong?

654
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,809
I have a terrible toothache.

655
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:58,769
Very bad.

656
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,021
Very painful!

657
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:08,862
It's from the top of my fin
to the bottom of my tail.

658
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:10,947
Which tooth?

659
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,198
You have so many.

660
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,409
Can we do anything to help?

661
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,245
Help me?

662
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,832
Ha, you little fish bait want to

Well, normally I would but,

677
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:09,713
my tooth is killing me.

678
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:13,383
I have a row of flat
round teeth to eat

679
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,927
little fish along the reef.

680
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,639
I have rows of sharp teeth
that cut through bone

681
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,855
and those are the ones that
are making me moan and groan.

682
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,737
It must've been
that big pile of garbage

683
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,322
I ate this morning.

684
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,240
I was so hungry I
just chomped into it.

685
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:41,037
It had a lot of bones,
must've got a big sharp bone

686
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,581
caught between my teeth.

687
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,376
I have thought of
becoming a vegetarian

688
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,211
but the meat side argues
with the veggie side.

689
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,885
The only good thing is I
might lose some weight.

690
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,304
Do you think I'm fat?

691
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:02,559
I try to watch my weight
but I love food.

692
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:08,271
I have heard that sharks
grow back their teeth.

693
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:12,150
We do, but I got something
stuck right

694
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,446
between these two right here.

695
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:19,409
Called the shark dentist,
he can't be reached.

696
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,909
He's playing the back nine on

697
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,496
the underwater fish
croquet course.

698
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:26,708
And the pilot fish, they
usually clean my teeth,

699
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,503
but they're on
vacation in Hawaii.

700
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,380
Poor Toothy Magrue.

701
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,800
Maybe we can help you get rid
of the teeth that hurt you.

702
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,554
How can you help me?

703
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,264
I heard Professor Shark
once bit down

704
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,934
on a seaweed sandwich and broke
a tooth.

705
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,771
A really hard little rock
fell into the seaweed

706
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,441
and his tooth fell out.

707
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,487
Professor Shark, you say?

708
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:56,820
He's our teacher.

709
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,574
He's the best teacher
in all the ocean.

710
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,452
He took us on a field
trip to the sunken ship

711
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,371
on our very first day of school.

712
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,338
Well well well, my old
friend, Professor Shark.

713
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,840
Still teaching little sea
animals in Fishtail Reef.

714
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,927
He bit down on a hard rock,
you say?

715
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,554
It was a whale of a
fish story.

716
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,807
A big deal in the reef!

717
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:27,642
Everybody wanted that tooth.

718
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,271
Shark teeth bring fish luck.

719
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,190
Of course they do!

720
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:36,860
I saw some very hard
rocks outside the sea cave.

721
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:50,333
Well, well, well, my little
fish bait,

722
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:53,211
you did help me after all.

723
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:57,382
You gave me a good idea,
I'm going to find a rock

724
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,842
and bite down hard.

725
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:03,347
Since we helped you,
maybe you can help us.

726
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,016
Do you know how we can
find the sunken ship?

727
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,019
We are lost.

728
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,106
Oh, lost little fish bait.

729
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,066
Sorry, can't help ya.

730
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,153
Haven't seen a sunken
ship in quite awhile.

731
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:23,074
If you're lost, I can't let you
swim here,

732
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:24,909
you'll have to take
your little fins

733
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,704
right back through
that sea cave.

734
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,079
Why?

735
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:32,249
One of the sharks is
having a birthday party.

736
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:36,045
There's lots and lots of
sharks swimming all around here

737
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:38,255
and they aren't
friendly like me.

738
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:42,635
You mean they
don't have toothaches.

739
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:48,057
Exactly, they have
hungry, rumbling bellies.

740
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,559
Hungry, rumbling bellies?

741
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,229
We had better swim
back into the cave.

742
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,063
Thanks, Toothy!

743
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,983
Had a blast,
little fish baits.

744
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:59,193
Hope you find the sunken ship.

745
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:03,280
When you see Professor
Shark tell him he owes me.

746
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,449
Owes you?

747
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,075
For not eating his students.

748
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,087
Oh, we are stuck in this cave.

749
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:21,548
If we go that way
there are sharks.

750
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,054
If we go this way
there are sea monsters.

751
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:29,514
And we are lost, we don't
know where the sunken ship is.

752
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,892
What are we going to do?

753
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,269
I don't know.

754
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:35,479
This is all your fault, Fifi.

755
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,523
You saw something
moving in the seaweed

756
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,775
and we stopped swimming
with the class.

757
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:43,445
Professor Shark said we should
stay together at all times.

758
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:44,697
We didn't listen!

759
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,367
You did not have to look
at the seaweed with me.

760
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,162
You could've kept swimming with
the class.

761
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,954
I did not know we were going to

762
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,958
be chased by a sea monster!

763
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,628
Fifi and Lily, I am so
happy you were brave enough

764
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,382
to look in the moving seaweed.

765
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,842
I am happy you were
chased by a sea monster.

766
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:10,097
Why are you happy we were
chased by a sea monster?

767
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,182
That is how you found me!

768
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,894
Thank you so much
for finding me.

769
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:17,938
I was very afraid to be alone.

770
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,441
I'm glad we found you too,
Cherie.

771
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,195
It is scary out here.

772
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,197
I'm glad we are together too.

773
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,740
Three sea animals
are stronger than one.

774
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,534
We will figure this out
together.

775
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:33,539
I agree, Lily,
and I have an idea!

776
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,958
What is your idea, Fifi?

777
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,547
Okay, we will swim
to the end of the cave.

778
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:45,967
When we get there, Lily
will use her special sonar

779
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,469
to call the sea monster,

780
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:52,684
she can also make a loud

781
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:57,814
I understand why you
want me to.

782
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,943
Whale calls can be
heard from far away.

783
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:08,488
Professor Shark and Alba
will hear me

784
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,990
and come save us!

785
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,075
That is a good idea.

786
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,537
But why do you want
me to use my sonar

787
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,248
to call the sea monster
into the cave?

788
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,001
Well, I thought if the
sea monster chases us

789
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,545
we could swim to the
other end of the cave.

790
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:27,300
Then the sea monster will
follow us out of the cave exit

791
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:30,802
where Toothy and all the
other sharks are swimming.

792
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,097
Oh, I get it.

793
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,601
The sharks will see the
sea monster and chase him.

794
00:40:36,603 --> 00:40:38,519
Sharks would much rather
eat a sea monster

795
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:42,106
than little old fish bait like
us, right?

796
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:43,648
Right!

797
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,695
The sharks will chase the sea
monster and leave us alone.

798
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:49,572
That is a great plan, Fifi.

799
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:51,157
You are so smart.

800
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,036
That is why you're my best
friend in the whole ocean.

801
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:58,664
And you're my best
friend in the entire sea!

802
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,791
How about me?

803
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:03,336
You are our friend too,
Cherie.

804
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:07,342
Our new best friend,
and that is very special.

805
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,385
Where are you from, Cherie?

806
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:13,554
I am from a reef far far away.

807
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,305
We just moved here.

808
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,307
What is it like in your reef,
Cherie?

809
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,726
It is a bit warmer
and greener.

810
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,188
You live in the sunken ship?

811
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,691
Yes, I am a stingray.

812
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:28,610
My parents said it is good
to live in a sunken ship.

813
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,280
There are some yummy
plants to eat.

814
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:34,075
There are also many
plants that are soft

815
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,619
and make a nice bed to sleep on.

816
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,704
You are a stingray?

817
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:43,709
We have a manta ray in our
class, his name is Diesel.

818
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:45,670
He sings really good.

819
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,213
Do you sing, Cherie?

820
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:52,802
I sing sometimes but then
all the fish swim away.

821
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:57,682
Stingrays are like manta
rays but I have a stinger

822
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,766
at the end of my tail.

823
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:02,644
I come from a place where
there are lots of stingrays.

824
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,398
You are both in the same class
at school?

825
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,610
Yes, we are on a field trip
with our class right now.

826
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,322
Except we are lost.

827
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:15,657
We are from class Cove Four,

828
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,494
the best class in all the ocean.

829
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:23,833
I have friends in my reef
but they live far far away now.

830
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:26,626
We are your new best friends.

831
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,298
Yes, let's all three
of us be best friends.

832
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,798
When we're together...

833
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,342
Everything is better!

834
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,345
Got to stick together...

835
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,637
Through sun and
stormy weather...

836
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,849
Even when we're chased
by sharks?

837
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,934
Even when we're chased
by sharks.

838
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,019
Best friends forever!

839
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,396
Even when we're lost at sea?

840
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,816
Even when we're lost at sea.

841
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:50,735
Best friends forever.

842
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:53,070
Will you always remember me?

843
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:55,572
Yes, I'll always remember you.

844
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:58,492
What if I live in a
dirty old shoe?

845
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:00,288
Gotta stay together.

846
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,333
Best friends forever.

847
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:16,052
That sounded like one,
two, three, four, five,

848
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,720
six, seven, eight...

849
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:20,514
Only eight!

850
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,766
We are missing two.

851
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,061
Where's Fifi and Lily?

852
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,523
They were swimming right in
front of me.

853
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,191
They were swimming
in front of you

854
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:31,733
but when I asked you a
question...

855
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,862
I remember!

856
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:36,072
You asked me a question
about the sunken ship's

857
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:39,700
steering wheel and I

858
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:43,121
I don't know what
happened to Fifi and Lily.

859
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,373
It's okay, Alba,
we'll find them.

860
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,458
I just heard Lily
send a sonar call.

861
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,668
She sounded far away.

862
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,838
Another mystery
for Inspector Petal.

863
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,260
We must find our lost
classmates right away.

864
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,387
Let's look for clues.

865
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,222
That's a good idea, Petal.

866
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:05,226
We will swim back through
the ship and look for clues.

867
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:09,731
I hope Professor Shark and
Alba heard all my.

868
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:14,568
Me too, but don't worry,
Lily, we will be okay.

869
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,405
First we will help our
new best friend, Cherie,

870
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,282
get back to the sunken ship.

871
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:21,784
Then we will find our
way back to Fishtail Reef.

872
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:24,871
I would like to visit
you in Fishtail Reef.

873
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,079
You will!

874
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,831
Best friends forever.

875
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,916
Best friends forever.

876
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,840
How away a sea monster!

877
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:44,807
You're afraid of this guy?

878
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:47,769
Have you taken
a good look at him?

879
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,689
Let me introduce Glurp.

880
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:57,695
He's sayin'
hi in sea monster talk.

881
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,574
You talk sea monster?

882
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:04,702
Of course, don't know what
the brainy Professor Shark

883
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,621
taught ya, but let me, Toothy,

884
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:10,999
teach you a little bit
about sea monsters.

885
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:13,045
Sea monsters are not scary.

886
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,296
They're not?

887
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:17,798
Not anymore.

888
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,344
They used to be, well, monsters.

889
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:25,014
Scaring and eating all the
little fish

890
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:26,516
then a whale...

891
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:27,849
Like me.

892
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,436
Like you but bigger.

893
00:45:30,438 --> 00:45:32,604
Started feeding 'em
and petting 'em

894
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:37,070
and slowly, I mean very slowly,

895
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,487
like a few hundred years later,

896
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:43,032
sea monsters turned from
wild sea animals

897
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,869
into big floppy sea pets.

898
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:47,871
Sea pets?

899
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:52,374
We heard sea monsters
like to eat little fish.

900
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:55,086
Most sea monsters are tame.

901
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:59,259
Like I said, we fish turned
'em into cute little pets.

902
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,219
There are a few wild
ones left in the sea.

903
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:06,054
Those guys will eat ya.

904
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:09,891
They'll eat anything,
even sharks.

905
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:14,063
Those sea monsters are
called goonches.

906
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:17,360
They're a lot bigger and very
very strong

907
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:22,612
but there aren't many
of 'em left.

908
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:23,865
Goonches?

909
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,867
My papa said...

910
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:33,458
Calm down, there are no
goonches here.

911
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,293
Pet sea monsters don't like
ya to talk

912
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,505
about their nasty cousins.

913
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:46,889
My tooth is still killing me.

914
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,351
I tried biting on a rock,
didn't help me at all.

915
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:54,772
My tooth won't stop hurtin'!

916
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,813
Hey.

917
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:13,539
What are you talking about,
Toothy?

918
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,376
Sea monsters eat weird
stuff like barnacles

919
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:19,003
and mold and all kinda parasites

920
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,923
that no one else wants
to put near their mouth.

921
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:25,260
These guys, nasty stuff is yum
to them.

922
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:29,930
So I asked Glurp here if he
could remove

923
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:33,476
that pesky bone from
between my teeth.

924
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,936
Can he?

925
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:35,978
Yes!

926
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,563
Yay!

927
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:40,273
Sea monsters are
our new friends.

928
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,485
Toothy Magrue is our new
friend too.

929
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,320
Me?

930
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,072

My tooth!

950
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:41,126
I hope Glurp can get
this bone outta my tooth.

951
00:48:43,172 --> 00:48:44,130
He will!

952
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:47,300
And we're gonna find our
way back to the sunken ship.

953
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,094
If I were lookin'
for a sunken ship

954
00:48:50,096 --> 00:48:52,637
I'd go see the sardines.

955
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,557
Those guys are like sea maps,

956
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,354
they know every
inch of this reef.

957
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,981
What is it like to
live in Fishtail Reef?

958
00:49:01,983 --> 00:49:05,693
It is the best place
in the ocean!

959
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:10,113
We have our own merry-go-round
and the best school.

960
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,032
All the sea animals come to
our school:

961
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:16,204
sea horses, pufferfish,
turtles, manta rays.

962
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,246
And whales like you?

963
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:21,919
Hey, didn't we pass
this exact rock before?

964
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:25,796
Oh no, are we swimming
in circles?

965
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:28,090
We'll never get home that way.

966
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:31,719
What would Inspector
Petal and Doctor Kiki do?

967
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,679
They would find the
sardines and ask them

968
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:36,724
to show them the way
back to the sunken ship.

969
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:38,976
Who is Petal and Kiki?

970
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:40,811
They're in our class.

971
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:43,815
Petal is a sea turtle,
Kiki is a pufferfish.

972
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,441
Soon you will meet them too.

973
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:50,153
They play a game about
how to solve mysteries.

974
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,699
That sounds like fun.

975
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:56,161
We are lost in the sea,
we are the mystery.

976
00:49:57,288 --> 00:49:59,079
Let's find those sardines!

977
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:16,557
Look, Doctor Kiki, I see
something moving in the seaweed.

978
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,229
Yes, there is something
moving in the seaweed!

979
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,280
What's that?

980
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:35,450
It's a baby sea monster.

981
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,327
He's a tootie badootie cutie.

982
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,871
He doesn't look big
enough to eat us.

983
00:50:40,873 --> 00:50:43,081
He's a baby sea monster.

984
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:49,296
Sea monsters don't eat fish.

985
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:52,133
They want to be our friends.

986
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,097
His name is Slurp,
he's saying that he saw

987
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:00,432
his cousin Glurp
follow a pink fish

988
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:04,269
and a blue whale
into the open ocean.

989
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:05,313
The open ocean?

990
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,731
Oh no!

991
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,358
You speak sea monster?

992
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,193
Yes.

993
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,401
Let's go class, quickly!

994
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,320
Slurp said they went this way.

995
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:16,365
What do you know
about sardines?

996
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,534
Grandma whale said
sardines swim close together

997
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:20,036
because it is safer.

998
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:24,081
They are little fish and many
sea animals like to eat them.

999
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,499
School?

1000
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:26,835
Sardine school?

1001
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:30,463
Why do sardines
swim close together?

1002
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,173
Grandma whale said
sardines swim close together

1003
00:51:33,175 --> 00:51:34,425
because it is safer.

1004
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:38,179
They are little fish and many
sea animals like to eat them.

1005
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:41,474
It's easy to catch one
sardine,

1006
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:45,478
but not very easy to catch
a big ball of sardines.

1007
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,563
I can't wait to meet them.

1008
00:51:47,565 --> 00:51:50,150
Do you think they'll talk to us?

1009
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:56,740
Hi sardines!

1010
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,282
My name is Fifi.

1011
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:03,498
I'm sorry to disturb your
beautiful dance but we are lost.

1012
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,331
We need your help!

1013
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:10,337
Can you tell us how to
get to the sunken ship?

1014
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,258
Look, it's a beautiful square!

1015
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:28,311
Oh no,
they're swimming away!

1016
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:32,150
Don't go,
sardines, we need your help!

1017
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,401
Maybe they did try to help us.

1018
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:36,820
They danced into a square.

1019
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:39,197
Why did they form a square?

1020
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,200
I think it was a clue!

1021
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,409
A clue?

1022
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,744
What did it mean?

1023
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:47,500
Well, windows are
square, tables are square,

1024
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:51,336
what else is square?

1025
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,173
Hmm, a box is a square.

1026
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:58,258
In my reef there lives
a yellow-spotted box fish.

1027
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,720
I have never seen a
yellow-spotted box fish.

1028
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:04,264
I don't think the
sardines were telling us

1029
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:07,184
to find a yellow-spotted fish,
Cherie.

1030
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:09,436
Why else would they
swim into a square shape?

1031
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:11,648
A square has four sides.

1032
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,858
Wait!

1033
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,445
Isn't there a place
called Sweetwater Square?

1034
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:19,488
Yes!

1035
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,157
Seawater Square is a
place where lots

1036
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,284
of sea animals meet!

1037
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,659
A meeting place?

1038
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:26,704
I think the sardines
were telling us

1039
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:30,041
to go to Sweetwater
Square to meet someone.

1040
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,333
Who?

1041
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:32,918
I don't know.

1042
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,380
How do we get to
Seawater Square?

1043
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:41,552
Look, maybe he can help us!

1044
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:42,681
Hi, I'm Fifi.

1045
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:47,474
I'm a pastel fish from
Fishtail Reef.

1046
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,851
I'm Lily, I'm a blue whale.

1047
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:52,729
I'm Cherie, I'm a stingray.

1048
00:53:52,731 --> 00:53:55,148
I'm Jimmy, I'm a crab.

1049
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,901
Why are you lost?

1050
00:53:57,903 --> 00:54:00,780
We were on a
field trip with our class.

1051
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:03,199
A sea monster chased us.

1052
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:05,784
We thought sea monsters ate
little fish.

1053
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:08,204
Then we met Timothy Magrue.

1054
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:10,208
He's a really big shark.

1055
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,458
He has a lot of teeth.

1056
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,045
Rows and rows of teeth!

1057
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:19,090
He had a really bad toothache.

1058
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,842
He taught us that
most sea monsters

1059
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,760
do not eat little fish.

1060
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:25,262
Sea monsters are friendly!

1061
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:27,347
How do you know I'm friendly?

1062
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:31,686
Yeah, I'm very friendly too.

1063
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,813
I like makin' new friends.

1064
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,773
We are trying to get
to Sweetwater Square.

1065
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:38,443
Do you know how to get there?

1066
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,528
Everybody knows how to
get to Sweetwater Square

1067
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,405
but you can't go there.

1068
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:44,865
Why not?

1069
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:46,076
I am a crab.

1070
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:50,412
I have legs,
I have lots of legs.

1071
00:54:50,414 --> 00:54:52,623
You don't have any legs.

1072
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:56,918
Why do we need legs to
get to Sweetwater Square?

1073
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,421
The only way to get to
Sweetwater Square

1074
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:02,467
is to go through the cave
of the skeleton fish.

1075
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,510
I can crawl through the
sand, I can use my legs

1076
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:07,387
to bury myself in the sand.

1077
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:10,307
I can hide from the
skeleton fish.

1078
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:11,851
Why do you have to hide?

1079
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:13,936
What are skeleton fish?

1080
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:15,731
They are very scary.

1081
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:19,483
I'm not allowed to go to the
cave of the skeleton fish,

1082
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:21,610
fish ghosts live there.

1083
00:55:21,612 --> 00:55:23,362
Fish ghosts?

1084
00:55:23,364 --> 00:55:26,490
It is a very spooky place.

1085
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:29,494
Is that the only way to
get to Seawater Square?

1086
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:30,869
Yes!

1087
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,454
Then we have to go.

1088
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:35,624
We have to get Cherie
home to the sunken ship.

1089
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,959
We have to get back
to Fishtail Reef.

1090
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,713
I want to get Cherie back
to the sunken ship too.

1091
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:43,965
Then we're off to the
cave of the skeleton fish.

1092
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:47,010
You are very
brave sea animals.

1093
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:50,139
How do we get to the
cave of the skeleton fish?

1094
00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:53,726
Keep swimming and you'll
see a big ol' cave openin'.

1095
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:57,231
Thanks Jimmy, you are
a very nice crab!

1096
00:56:02,778 --> 00:56:04,153
Fish ghosts?

1097
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:08,532
Do you think there are really
fish ghosts inside the cave?

1098
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:10,242
I hope not!

1099
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:11,994
Sounds scary.

1100
00:56:11,996 --> 00:56:13,996
Maybe we shouldn't go.

1101
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:16,039
Don't be afraid, Cherie.

1102
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,501
How come you aren't afraid,
Fifi?

1103
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:22,921
I had a really scary
dream that I was lost.

1104
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:24,342
I was so scared.

1105
00:56:25,217 --> 00:56:29,262
In my dream I swam
into the open ocean

1106
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:31,555
and sharks chased me!

1107
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:34,141
Did you get away from the
sharks?

1108
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:35,811
It was a bad dream.

1109
00:56:36,771 --> 00:56:39,354
I woke up before
the sharks could eat me

1110
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:41,942
but it was a really scary dream.

1111
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:46,028
I could not find my way
back to Fishtail Reef.

1112
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,322
I was so scared!

1113
00:56:48,324 --> 00:56:52,034
Now you are lost and there
are lots of sharks around.

1114
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:53,494
Aren't you scared?

1115
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:56,664
I'm not scared like
I was in my dream.

1116
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,583
Why aren't you scared?

1117
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:02,463
In my dream I was alone,
here I am not alone.

1118
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:10,720
I have my two best friends
and I have an idea.

1119
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:12,304
Tell us your idea!

1120
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:14,724
We will swim like sardines.

1121
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,642
That is a very good idea,
Fifi.

1122
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:20,521
If we swim close together we
will be safe.

1123
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:22,773
One little fish is easy to eat

1124
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:25,193
but three fish together...

1125
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,735
Can not be beat!

1126
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:30,365
We will swim like a big
ball of sardine fish.

1127
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,742
♪ When we're together ♪

1128
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:34,619
Everything is better!

1129
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,662
Got to stick together.

1130
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:39,749
Swimming past ghosts in
skeleton cave.

1131
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,543
We will make those
fish behave.

1132
00:57:42,545 --> 00:57:45,298
You are very smart and brave.

1133
00:57:46,465 --> 00:57:48,425
I am lucky you found me.

1134
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:50,550
Ready?

1135
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:53,679
Stay close.

1136
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:55,682
I don't see anything.

1137
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,392
Maybe there are
no skeleton fish.

1138
00:57:58,394 --> 00:57:59,726
Who goes there?

1139
00:57:59,728 --> 00:58:02,563
Who disturbs our slumber?

1140
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:05,733
My name is Fifi, I'm a
pastel fish from Fishtail Reef.

1141
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:07,068
We are lost!

1142
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,903
The sardines told us to
get to Sweetwater Square.

1143
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:10,987
Jimmy Crab said we have
to swim through this cave

1144
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,572
to get to Sweetwater Square.

1145
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,534
Please don't eat us!

1146
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:16,661
Yes, please don't eat us.

1147
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:17,496
Why not?

1148
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,956
Little fish taste delicious!

1149
00:58:25,963 --> 00:58:27,713
You cannot eat us!

1150
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:30,048
We have to get Cherie
home to the sunken ship

1151
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,842
to see her mama and papa.

1152
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:34,679
We have to get home to
Fishtail Reef.

1153
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,014
Very brave.

1154
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:39,434
We could eat you!

1155
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:42,603
We could open our big
mouths and in ya go!

1156
00:58:42,605 --> 00:58:45,063
But you would just swim
back out again.

1157
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:47,441
Everything goes right
through us.

1158
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,737
So we can swim
through the cave?

1159
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:55,450
We didn't say that
we cannot let you pass.

1160
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:56,700
Why not?

1161
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:59,787
First,
you must answer a riddle!

1162
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:00,746
A riddle?

1163
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:02,081
A question.

1164
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,624
What question?

1165
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:07,045
What do sea monsters
like to eat?

1166
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:10,798
Toothy's sea monster
likes to eat barnacles and...

1167
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,634
Wrong!

1168
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:22,394
Sea monsters like to eat
what I do: skeleton fish.

1169
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,063
Toothy Magrue!

1170
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:27,481
My little fish baits.

1171
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,025
How are you feeling?

1172
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,028
Fantastic!

1173
00:59:31,237 --> 00:59:34,655
Glurp ate the fish bone
stuck between my teeth

1174
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:39,827
and no more toothache!

1175
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:48,672
Yay!

1176
00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:53,133
You helped me so
I'm gonna help you.

1177
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:57,762
The sardines said we need
to go to Sweetwater Square.

1178
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,137
Really?

1179
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:02,934
Sweetwater Square is right
through there.

1180
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,853
♪ Now I must go, I'm hungry so ♪

1181
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:08,690
♪ But our friend Glurp
will swim with you ♪

1182
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:11,900
♪ His home is in the
sunken ship too ♪♪

1183
01:00:11,902 --> 01:00:14,153
We will miss you,
Toothy Magrue.

1184
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:19,075
You're not a mean old shark,
you're our toothy fish pal.

1185
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:21,871
I will miss you too,
fish baits.

1186
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:29,293
There are so many sea animals,

1187
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:32,005
how do we know who we
are supposed to meet?

1188
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:35,883
Maybe everyone knows how
to get to the sunken ship?

1189
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:39,637
No one knows how to get
back to the sunken ship.

1190
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:45,142
Little stingray, I've been
lookin' all over for you.

1191
01:00:45,144 --> 01:00:46,351
You have?

1192
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:49,938
I had to swim to the
surface for a breath of air.

1193
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:54,153
I got some air, swam back to
help you, but you were gone.

1194
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:58,322
Can you help us get
back to the sunken ship?

1195
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:00,657
Is that where you wanna go?

1196
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,871
The sardines told me
you were lookin' for me.

1197
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:08,458
The sardines told us to
meet you in Sweetwater Square.

1198
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,628
Those sardines know
I always hang out here.

1199
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,885
My name is Gramps, I'm an old
brown seal.

1200
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,675
I'm Fifi.

1201
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:21,262
This is Lily and Cherie.

1202
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:25,099
And this is Glurp, he
is a pet sea monster.

1203
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,311
Nice to meet all of you.

1204
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:31,773
You must be on
quite an adventure.

1205
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,191
Glurp chased us.

1206
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,901
We didn't know he was friendly.

1207
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:37,945
We made friends with a shark.

1208
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:40,197
It's been very exciting.

1209
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:44,411
Tell me all about it as
we swim to the sunken ship.

1210
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:50,958
Everyone stay close together.

1211
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,878
I don't want to lose anymore
students.

1212
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,338
Yes,
Professor Shark.

1213
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,840
Where are we going,
Inspector Petal?

1214
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:01,802
We are going to find
Slurp's cousin, Glurp,

1215
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:05,555
he chased Fifi and Lily
into the open ocean.

1216
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:08,767
Dudley Dolphin said
sea monsters eat fish.

1217
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:11,354
Dudley Dolphin was
just being silly.

1218
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:12,813
Sea monsters are friendly.

1219
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:15,066
They make very nice fish pets.

1220
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:18,820
Then why was Glurp
chasing Fifi and Lily?

1221
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,655
We're going to find out.

1222
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:24,784
Don't worry, Chopper, I
have a sword for a nose.

1223
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:27,452
And I have very sharp teeth.

1224
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:30,414
And our teacher is a
tooth monster.

1225
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:36,713
Yeah, we're not afraid of
sea monsters!

1226
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:38,965
Is the sunken ship
much further?

1227
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,175
Not too far!

1228
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:44,720
I'm getting tired.

1229
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:47,597
Hold on, dear.

1230
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,644
I need to swim to the
surface for some air.

1231
01:02:51,646 --> 01:02:54,731
Don't go anywhere,
I'll be right back!

1232
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:58,653
Uh oh, those sharks
don't look very friendly.

1233
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:02,030
What should we do, Fifi?

1234
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,990
Stay close together.

1235
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,617
Maybe one of
them has a toothache.

1236
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,036
I don't think so!

1237
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:10,829
They all look very hungry to me.

1238
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:14,166
Everybody, look those
sharks right in the eye

1239
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:17,254
and yell goonches as
loud as you can.

1240
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:19,882
- Goonches!
- Goonches!

1241
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,052
- Goonches!
- Goonches!

1242
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:26,970
Look, Fifi, the sharks
are swimming away.

1243
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:27,972
Papa was right.

1244
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:30,974
He told me if I want
to scare a shark away,

1245
01:03:30,976 --> 01:03:34,019
I just have to yell goonches.

1246
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:37,815
Toothy Magrue said goonches
are big, mean sea monsters

1247
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:38,985
that eat sharks.

1248
01:03:39,943 --> 01:03:42,070
Fifi saved the day!

1249
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:42,905
Yay!

1250
01:03:44,157 --> 01:03:48,117
Alba, is that you?

1251
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,577
Gramps!

1252
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:53,164
I'm so happy
you found each other.

1253
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:56,958
Happy to be
part of your adventure.

1254
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,586
I'll see ya later.

1255
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:01,255
I knew you would find
them, Inspector Petal.

1256
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:04,758
We found Cherie and Fifi and
Lily too!

1257
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,010
Yay.

1258
01:04:06,012 --> 01:04:08,554
Fish play, my dear Kiki.

1259
01:04:08,556 --> 01:04:09,391
Fish play.

1260
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:14,434
Oh, Cherie!

1261
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:15,728
We just saw Gramps.

1262
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:18,271
He told us you were rescued.

1263
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:21,193
Mama, I have so much
to tell you.

1264
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:27,865
A sea monster!

1265
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,325
Stay away from us.

1266
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:30,952
His name is Glurp, Sammy.

1267
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,369
He's really nice.

1268
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:35,123
Keep away from my sister.

1269
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:38,376
He is yellow like me.

1270
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:41,295
Squiggly wiggly, a
sea monster with one eye

1271
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:42,921
bigger than the other?

1272
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:45,133
How do you know
which one to look at?

1273
01:04:54,143 --> 01:04:57,019
Sunken ship, here we come!

1274
01:04:57,021 --> 01:04:58,938
I am so glad I met you.

1275
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:03,150
I hope to visit you in
Fishtail Reef very soon.

1276
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:05,028
Best friends forever?

1277
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,070
Best friends forever.

1278
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,324
And ever and ever and ever.

1279
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:13,577
Time for us to head
back to Fishtail Reef.

1280
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:15,079
Aren't you going home
with Cherie

1281
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:17,749
to the sunken ship, Glurp?

1282
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,209
That means no.

1283
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:24,505
I think you have a new
pet sea monster, Fifi.

1284
01:05:24,507 --> 01:05:27,550
Wanna come home with me,
Glurp?

1285
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,054
Hooray!

1286
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:34,389
As the sun
sets on the ocean deep

1287
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:38,061
class Cove Four swims to
Fishtail Reef.

1288
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:41,271
Their first field trip
over and done.

1289
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:45,025
What an adventure,
exciting and fun.

1290
01:05:45,027 --> 01:05:48,695
A lot to talk about for weeks
and weeks.

1291
01:05:48,697 --> 01:05:52,575
But now they just want
to go home and sleep.

1292
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,956
Good morning, class!

1293
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,793
Good morning,
Professor Shark.

1294
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:06,213
I have a wonderful
surprise for you today.

1295
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:08,132
I love surprises!

1296
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:11,094
Are we going on
another field trip?

1297
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:13,097
Something even better!

1298
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:18,519
Meet your new classmate,
Cherie Stingray.

1299
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:22,521
Cherie is going to be
in our school?

1300
01:06:22,523 --> 01:06:25,816
Best friend Cherie in class
Cove Four.

1301
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:29,403
That is the best news ever.

1302
01:06:29,405 --> 01:06:30,699
Hooray!

1303
01:06:33,117 --> 01:06:37,036
In the big,
wide ocean lies Fishtail Reef

1304
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:41,289
where Fifi and her friends
have adventures oh so sweet.

1305
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:44,084
Every day they
go to fish school,

1306
01:06:44,086 --> 01:06:46,253
laugh, and have so much fun.

1307
01:06:46,255 --> 01:06:48,130
Come explore the sea with us.

1308
01:06:48,132 --> 01:06:50,426
Happy days have just begun.

1309
