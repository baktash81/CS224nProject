1
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:47,004
You called the dispatcher, right?

2
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:52,012
We've got multiple vehicles,
possible DOAs, multiple injuries.

3
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:57,785
Major accident.
We'll need more ambulances.

4
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,390
All units have been deployed.
I don't have an ETA.

5
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:04,321
-l need those medics.
-I'll do the best I can.

6
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:06,392
Just get them over here.

7
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,130
Can you hear me?

8
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,931
Listen to me.

9
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:14,101
Listen to me!

10
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,233
Look at me.

11
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:17,996
Look in my eyes.

12
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,972
Can you feel that?

13
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:25,009
That's my hand. Go on, hold it.

14
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,715
We'll get you out of here.

15
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,147
l need some help over here!

16
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,196
lt's okay.

17
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,572
You're safe now, all right?
You'll be okay. Just hang on.

18
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,575
All right? You're doing fine.

19
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,772
Don't let go. Don't let me go.
Stay with me.

20
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:28,671
Come on!

21
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,906
Stay with me, all right?

22
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,608
Stay with me.

23
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:37,879
Good.

24
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,782
Stay with me.

25
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:07,237
-What are you doing? That's my car.
-Nothing, l just--

26
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,742
-What'd you take?
-l turned off--

27
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,447
Did you take something?

28
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:15,881
-You take my phone, huh?
-Wake up! Wake up! l helped you.

29
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,520
l helped you.

30
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,691
l'm sorry.

31
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:35,062
That's the fiirst
question people ask.

32
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,973
Have l ever killed anyone?

33
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:43,135
So casually, like asking me
what kind of car l drive.

34
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,510
Why don't they ever ask
if l ever saved anyone?

35
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,776
Have you? Saved anyone, l mean.

36
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:58,392
My mother would argue that
God's the only one that saves.

37
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:05,093
lt must be pretty exciting, though,
catching bad guys.

38
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,895
ls this all we're gonna talk about?

39
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,100
Look, l'm sorry.

40
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:18,008
l'm not very good at dating.

41
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,704
I take it your date sucked.

42
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,374
l don't need to tell my story
to a stranger.

43
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,450
''What do you do, where are you from?''

44
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:07,558
Your problem wasn't that he asked
too many questions.

45
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:11,594
You just didn't want to clean
his little pipes.

46
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:15,027
No, all l wanted
to do was clean his pipes.

47
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,791
The conversation pissed me off.

48
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,799
Baby girl, if it's a servicing
you need....

49
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,871
Shut the fuck up.

50
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,604
We've talked about this every
week for six months.

51
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:09,716
We've talked about this
a thousand times.

52
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:13,713
Come on. No!

53
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:21,928
l am not having this conversation
with you again. Hang on.

54
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,631
None of your goddamn business.
Hang on.

55
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,291
What?

56
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:30,129
Your keys are in the door.

57
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,840
Then hang up. l don't care.

58
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,135
You're in 21 5, right?

59
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,570
Then fuck you!

60
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,111
Not you. l'm talking to this idiot.

61
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:50,952
You know what? Don't bother.

62
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:58,125
Candace.

63
00:07:58,998 --> 00:07:59,987
l'm Catch.

64
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,659
Charlie...

65
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,369
...was just about to go to bed,
weren't you?

66
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,263
Bye.

67
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,577
And l just ordered a pizza...

68
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,509
...so l don't know if you're hungry--

69
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:17,675
l gotta go.

70
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:26,081
See you around.

71
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,429
l didn't see his van, so....

72
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,399
Yeah, he's not here.

73
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:47,670
How you doing?

74
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:49,179
l'm okay.

75
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:53,709
And Cathy and Larry, Jr.?
l bet he's big now.

76
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,679
He's growing fast.

77
00:08:57,221 --> 00:09:00,212
Does he look like you,
or did he get lucky?

78
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:05,987
He's got Cathy's looks and my
strength. You should feel his grip.

79
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,396
So what's with the cryptic message?

80
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,999
''Call me, we have to talk.''
Sounds like bad news.

81
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:17,335
Mom and Dad are renewing their vows.

82
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,337
Church, priest, the whole thing.

83
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:22,266
Renewing their vows?

84
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:25,577
With a party at the house
afterwards.

85
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,180
Mom wants you to come.

86
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,110
Does he?

87
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,682
We're working on Dad.

88
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,748
Over 10 years,
and he won't let it go--

89
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,893
No, Sharon! l won't go
into that hole with you.

90
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:41,755
l'm over that shit.

91
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,665
You're still scared of him.

92
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,300
You know what?

93
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,505
You shouldn't come here
in your uniform.

94
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:00,180
People will think we're in trouble.

95
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,577
-Nice seeing you too.
-Yeah.

96
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:14,582
Cocksucker!

97
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:18,024
Get off of me!

98
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,094
-l'll kill you!
-Shut up!

99
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:24,762
Motherfuck--

100
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:28,501
l'm gonna bend you over the car,
bitch!

101
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:30,470
-Motherfucker!
-Shut up.

102
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,473
-You're under arrest!
-Fucking bitch!

103
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:38,583
You are a crazy one.
You are a pretty one, senorita!

104
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:41,847
Those honey-brown eyes-- Fuck you!

105
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:47,749
l'll take you in the back
and do you, baby.

106
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,756
You can suck my dick.

107
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:54,597
This is 7673. We're bringing in
one for processing.

108
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:58,359
Look good in that uniform.
Why don't you take it off?

109
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:02,027
Take my handcuffs off too,
you fucking bitch!

110
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,837
-Just one touch.
-Cut it out.

111
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:09,308
You're gonna bust me!
Give me one sweet touch.

112
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,047
Fuck.

113
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,181
Fuck you, faggot.

114
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,678
Smells like bacon in here.

115
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:21,090
That's not the touch l want, honey!

116
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,555
Sit here.
l ain't got time to babysit you.

117
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,629
Put your hand on top of your
head. Turn around. Sit down.

118
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,894
-Sit the fuck down!
-Fuck!

119
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:37,367
Mike, you got another booking sheet?

120
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,198
Fucking bitch!

121
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:42,775
He needs a rag.

122
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,403
Let me talk to you.

123
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,605
Do we need to have another
conversation?

124
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,047
You'd just let him
grab your balls?

125
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:54,787
l saw you plan that in the car.

126
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,481
Just waiting to
do something to him.

127
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,960
lf l was out of line,
put it in a report.

128
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:35,154
l hate the graveyard
shift. lt fucks my system.

129
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:38,797
All the shit you eat
is fucking up your system.

130
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,125
l love graveyard. No traffic.

131
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:45,532
Nothing's worse than a 459
crosstown during rush hour.

132
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,900
Might as well pull over,
because you're gonna be late.

133
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:52,201
You like graveyard because
you have insomnia.

134
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:54,436
l know what puts me to sleep.

135
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:59,174
The sound of your own voice?
That puts your wife to sleep.

136
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,631
Get down! Down! Heads down!

137
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:55,926
Do it now!

138
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:02,470
Call 91 1 !

139
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,451
Stop! Hold it right there!

140
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:16,418
Hold it!

141
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,185
-Hold it!
-Heading south, University Field!

142
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,155
Get down!

143
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,135
Wait, damn it!

144
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,558
Get up here!

145
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,532
Drop the gun!

146
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,733
Drop the gun!

147
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,853
Pogo, what's your 20?

148
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,581
Damn it!

149
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:34,295
This one's for my brother, bitch!

150
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,632
Drop the fucking gun!
Drop the fucking gun!

151
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:48,068
l said drop it! Get up!
Put your hands on top of your head.

152
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:50,769
Pogue, are you all right?
You all right?

153
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,778
Don't you move! Get down!

154
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,910
Stay away from the gun!
Are you all right?

155
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,882
Yeah! l'm good. l'm okay!

156
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:01,847
Don't move!
Put your hands on your head!

157
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:04,891
-He's okay!
-l told you to wait!

158
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:25,772
l got you nectarines.
The peaches were as hard as rocks.

159
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:28,307
Your coat's all dirty.

160
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:29,744
l tackled a guy.

161
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:32,650
Why did you tackle a guy?

162
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:35,083
He was going for a touchdown.

163
00:16:35,623 --> 00:16:37,090
Can you be serious?

164
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,725
-What day is it today?
-Wednesday.

165
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:41,986
No.

166
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,358
-l met somebody today.
-Good.

167
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:50,333
Oh, you got the broccolini.
Thank you.

168
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:51,765
lt was a woman.

169
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,940
You didn't tackle her too, did you?

170
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:59,873
-She's a police officer.
-Are you in trouble?

171
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:05,613
-l don't think so.
-Well, that's a good thing.

172
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:12,091
l better go now.

173
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,556
-See you next week.
-Okay.

174
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,168
Suddenly l see what's happening.

175
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,776
Where are all the baby pigeons?

176
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,845
l see nests with tiny eggs,
but l don't see tiny pigeons. Why?

177
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,610
You always ask the big questions.

178
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,550
l got a big question for you.
l can only ask you....

179
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:49,317
Here, use this. Call your wife.
Ask her instead.

180
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:50,858
lt's the hospital.

181
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,660
Yeah. Gonna be okay?

182
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:56,955
Yeah.

183
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,069
Brian's gonna be all right.

184
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,304
Didn't l tell you? He's tough.

185
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:05,371
Tomorrow? We'll be there.

186
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:08,237
-Where's your partner?
-He has a wife.

187
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,072
-l got a wife.
-But his wife actually likes him.

188
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,245
-Where you going?
-The head. All right?

189
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:18,012
-To fix her makeup.
-Pogue wears makeup?

190
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,712
Right, l need that
lipstick you borrowed back.

191
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:07,328
l didn't think you'd show.
Why are you sitting here?

192
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:11,293
l don't talk to a lot of people.

193
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:14,466
Would you like to sit down?

194
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,933
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

195
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:25,206
-l didn't thank you. l'm Sharon Pogue.
-l'm Catch.

196
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,318
-Just Catch?
-Just Catch.

197
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,422
Why would you do that, Catch?

198
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:39,155
-Jump somebody with a gun?
-He was gonna kill you.

199
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,434
He could have killed you.
You got a death wish?

200
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:47,127
l guess l didn't have time
to think about it.

201
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,236
-Hey!
-Hey, Pogo!

202
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:59,945
-What do you think about it now?
-lt was worth the risk.

203
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:04,149
-For somebody you don't even know?
-Yeah.

204
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,354
And for what you do.
l think cops are great.

205
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,053
Trying to keep it safe for everybody.
Tough job. Firemen...

206
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:18,200
...they're heros. lKids wave at them.
People should wave at cops.

207
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,236
-What are you laughing at?
-Nothing.

208
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:28,906
Ever think of how many people
are here because you saved them?

209
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,946
Or helped them, or arrested
somebody who would've hurt them?

210
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:40,351
-Never thought about it.
-Or just because you did your job.

211
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:45,216
Now l'm walking around
because of you.

212
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,292
Maybe you should be the cop.

213
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:54,226
Wow, l don't know.
l don't look really good in hats.

214
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:07,975
What do you do? Where do you live?
Where do you work?

215
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:12,875
Okay.

216
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:15,846
l'm sorry.

217
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:21,394
Every time l talk to people, it comes
out like an interrogation.

218
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,596
You have a nice smile.

219
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:29,757
Thank you.

220
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:38,568
-You gonna let us meet your hero?
-Catch, this is Ray.

221
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:41,179
-Hi, Ray.
-Catch.

222
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:45,707
Why don't you join us?
We want to buy you dinner...

223
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,250
...for saving Pogo's ass.

224
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:55,616
You know, l'm kind of tired.
l'm gonna head home.

225
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,997
-Did l interrupt something?
-All right.

226
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:04,430
l'll walk you to your car
if you'd like.

227
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:06,398
Yeah. Sure.

228
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:15,439
lt's a bad neighborhood.
Maybe l should walk you to your car.

229
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:17,273
l don't have a car.

230
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:19,176
You want a ride home?

231
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,114
No, thank you. l'd like to walk.

232
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,290
Are you okay to drive?

233
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,058
l'm not drunk.

234
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:33,659
You think l am? You'll know when
l'm drunk. l'll be throwing up.

235
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:35,956
And l never throw up, so....

236
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,868
Don't worry about it, okay?

237
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,197
Get in the car, will you?

238
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:01,452
l'm on Ashland, off 18th street.

239
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:18,533
-l never drive.
-Why not?

240
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:28,938
What?

241
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,841
l was trying to picture you
without your clothes.

242
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:36,283
-Excuse me?
-l didn't mean it like that.

243
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,051
l mean, l'm trying to picture
you out of uniform.

244
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:44,092
On your day off,
in regular clothes.

245
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,603
l don't live here.

246
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,840
l know. This is where l live.

247
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:07,616
You know those guys at the bar?
They're my friends.

248
00:24:09,255 --> 00:24:14,191
Sort of. We work together,
we tell jokes, we bullshit.

249
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:18,188
l can't say to them....

250
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,297
What?

251
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:29,100
Every time l shut my eyes,
l see that damn gun.

252
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,598
l hear that pop.

253
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:36,676
l feel a bullet slamming
into my chest and....

254
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:45,178
l don't know why l'm telling you,
except you were there....

255
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,858
l must be drunk.

256
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:03,030
l want to know why you were walking
by the stadium at that minute.

257
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,377
What if you hadn't been there?

258
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:14,137
l guess we were supposed to meet.

259
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:21,621
lf you want, you can come in
for a bit.

260
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,758
Okay.

261
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:33,032
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.

262
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:36,903
Mind getting the door?

263
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,674
Sit down or something.

264
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,645
l'm circling a while.

265
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,821
Don't look.
l didn't straighten up.

266
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:00,925
So? lt's more real this way.

267
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,187
lt's rude.

268
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:07,193
Now l'm here, you seem mad about it.

269
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,998
Trust me, when l'm mad,
you'll know it.

270
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,496
lt's just l'm not...

271
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,740
...used to letting anybody up here.

272
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,472
But you're here, so....
Anyway....

273
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,316
-Let's talk about something stupid.
-You first.

274
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:35,023
What's that ''supposed to'' business?
That we were supposed to meet?

275
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:40,025
lt sounds a little too
Psychic Friends Network to me.

276
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,436
Some people say we each give off
a particular odor...

277
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:50,767
...that can only be detected
by one other person's brain.

278
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:56,210
So we smell each other.

279
00:26:57,881 --> 00:27:00,349
-Who says that?
-l have no idea.

280
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,449
You're crazy.

281
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:24,772
Thanks for coming up here.

282
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:28,767
Does that mean l'm going?

283
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:32,446
No! l mean, you don't have to.

284
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:36,914
-So you're okay now.
-What, are you here as a medic?

285
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:40,446
ls this the ''mad'' part?

286
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:46,617
Maybe going is a good idea.

287
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,060
Can l come back sometime?

288
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:58,272
Why?

289
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,137
Must be the smell.

290
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:44,742
l gotta go.

291
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,346
Oh, God....

292
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:16,338
What's the matter, you blind?

293
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,179
Fucking idiot.

294
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,393
What are you guys doing here?

295
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:16,603
Hey, you!

296
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:20,835
Your mom's been bugging us
to come for lunch.

297
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:24,442
-Mom, can we go now?
-ln a minute.

298
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:28,346
So how is she?

299
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:32,846
She's really good.
She'll be happy to see you.

300
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:35,887
My dad's not here?

301
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,086
So you talked to Larry? He told me.

302
00:30:41,327 --> 00:30:45,854
Yeah. He told me about this
renewing-the-vows thing.

303
00:30:46,665 --> 00:30:48,633
You're gonna come, l hope?

304
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:52,629
Come, Shar.
l think you should.

305
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:02,108
Aunt Sharon, can l see
your police car?

306
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:09,276
-Come on, Mom!
-Hold on. l gotta go.

307
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:10,317
Bye.

308
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:36,674
Looks the same.

309
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,046
Still smells like cigarettes.

310
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:43,245
-Thought he quit.
-Only six a day.

311
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,727
Larry told you l stopped by?
ls that why you called?

312
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,533
l called you because we want you
to come when we renew our vows.

313
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:02,661
How come you're renewing your vows?

314
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:08,341
lt's a sort of a fresh start.

315
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:09,967
Your idea?

316
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,535
Both of us.

317
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:16,540
lt's a way of having
the marriage blessed.

318
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:18,852
Wasn't it blessed before?

319
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:25,358
Of course it was blessed before.

320
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:30,186
You just....

321
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:34,759
-l just what, Ma?
-You just think of the bad.

322
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:39,132
You never remember the good.
l wish you remembered that.

323
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:41,807
l wish l remembered it too.

324
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:46,935
Does Dad? Does he remember
anything good about me?

325
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:51,840
He doesn't hate you.

326
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,719
-He just still feels hurt.
-Hurt?

327
00:32:57,123 --> 00:32:58,215
l hurt him?

328
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,556
Being arrested like that?
Nobody forgets that.

329
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,287
How did you forget what he did to you?

330
00:33:06,832 --> 00:33:08,823
lt wasn't as bad--

331
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:14,937
You make it sound worse.
lt hadn't been like this for years.

332
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,837
l'm glad it hasn't been that way.
That means it worked!

333
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:20,568
That's why l did it!

334
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,543
Why do l get punished for this?

335
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:29,220
Nobody's punishing you.

336
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,917
We're inviting you.

337
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,285
Will you come?

338
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,929
-Do you have a machine?
-What?

339
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,762
-Do you have an answering machine?
-Yes.

340
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:00,166
Hang up, and l'll call your machine.

341
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:01,362
Why?

342
00:35:13,453 --> 00:35:16,979
Please leave a message after the tone.

343
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,882
lt's Sharon.

344
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,860
Maybe we can...

345
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:26,296
...have breakfast or something.

346
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:30,195
I usually get up early
to run in Lincoln Park.

347
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:33,235
There's a coffee shop
across the street.

348
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,398
Like 8 or so?
If you're there, you're there.

349
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:01,664
Please leave a message
after the tone.

350
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,732
Hi. Don'tpick up. Look...

351
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,197
...I didn't get much sleep...

352
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:11,465
...and maybe this was
a bad idea anyway.

353
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:14,939
I was feeling kind of weird
last night.

354
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:17,135
Anyway, I'm fiine now.

355
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:20,713
So let's just leave it where it's at.

356
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:33,684
Fuck!

357
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:36,687
What?

358
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,963
Who is it? What?

359
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,670
l was just getting to sleep, finally.

360
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:53,741
We made a date.

361
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,814
lt wasn't a date.

362
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,746
An appointment.
l keep my appointments.

363
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:03,082
Do you have door issues?
l called you at 7:00.

364
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,192
l get up early. l walked there.
l waited for you.

365
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,225
Check your messages.

366
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:13,125
l need sleep. Come back in a month.

367
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,599
-Why do you think l'd come back?
-Why are you here?

368
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,635
When you tell somebody
you'll be somewhere...

369
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:25,072
...that person rearranges his life.
Be aware of that.

370
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:27,872
-And more considerate--
-What's in the bag?

371
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,172
What?

372
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:32,781
-What's in the bag?
-None of your business.

373
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,408
Got coffee?

374
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,749
You think you deserve coffee?

375
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,323
What about food?

376
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,522
You definitely don't deserve food.

377
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,866
-l got coffee, sugar, sweetener--
-Black.

378
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,437
-Whatever.
-Just black.

379
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,638
So what kind of life
did you rearrange to get coffee?

380
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,476
You never talk about yourself.
What do you do?

381
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,812
-What's the difference?
-What's the difference?

382
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,954
You're standing in my bedroom,
looking through my panty drawer.

383
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,853
That's the difference.

384
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,616
Who are you?

385
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,763
Somebody who keeps his appointments.

386
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,468
Shit, you're married!

387
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,434
Give me my coffee.
Give it here.

388
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:32,697
What--!

389
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:44,919
l know, you're a criminal.
Probably a felon.

390
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,953
That's great.
That's all l need.

391
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:52,489
My name is Catch.
l don't commit crimes.

392
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,796
l like being with you.

393
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:56,223
That's bullshit.

394
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,424
l let you in here.

395
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:03,866
l'm not gonna know anything
about you? l need details.

396
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:07,734
-l need to start from here.
-That's ridiculous! Why?

397
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,942
Because that's the way it is.

398
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:13,707
Oh, your rules.

399
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:18,010
My rules.

400
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:24,013
Fine, l didn't want to know you
that much anyway.

401
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:28,853
l don't need this shit. l'm tired.

402
00:39:29,663 --> 00:39:31,824
Haven't slept all night.

403
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:42,405
Bye.

404
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,984
Can l come in?

405
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,344
Yeah. Come in.

406
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,046
Thanks.

407
00:40:35,826 --> 00:40:38,351
Get that door thing under control.

408
00:40:42,332 --> 00:40:43,458
You live here?

409
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,630
Nobody lives here. What is this,
some kind of front?

410
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,139
-ls this what you told me about?
-What?

411
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:58,142
Your interrogation.
So do l need a lawyer?

412
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:02,049
l don't like being jerked around.

413
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:03,474
l'm not.

414
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,750
Then tell me straight.
Who are you?

415
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:10,152
What are you looking for?

416
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:14,125
Your life.
l don't want any surprises.

417
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:19,491
This is it. l sleep here. l walk
around town. That's all.

418
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,867
That's all of it?

419
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:28,808
Except for you.

420
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,805
The way l feel about you.

421
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:35,504
Which is...?

422
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:43,220
Surprising.
l thought it was impossible.

423
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:47,284
l thought l was....

424
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:51,920
You thought you were what? Gay?

425
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:56,427
Dead.

426
00:41:58,037 --> 00:42:00,437
Am l supposed to understand that?

427
00:42:01,174 --> 00:42:02,539
No, you're not.

428
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:06,837
Do you ever wonder
what ''scratch'' means?

429
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:12,039
What people mean when they say,
''Let's start from scratch''?

430
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,945
This is scratch.

431
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:20,121
This is scratch, all right.

432
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,228
-So this cat knows where you live?
-He's not dangerous.

433
00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:36,532
He's in no databases.
There's no Catch anywhere--

434
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:39,073
You ran his name through?

435
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:42,643
-He's a ghost.
-l can't believe you did that!

436
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:47,784
-l'm just looking out for you.
-l don't need you to look out for me.

437
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:52,949
No last name. That shit's weird.

438
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:04,063
Oh, l remember that.

439
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:06,428
That was a smile.

440
00:43:06,636 --> 00:43:10,333
You know the cop? The woman cop?
She visited me.

441
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:13,432
You're seeing her?

442
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:17,912
She asks lots of questions.
She wants to know everything.

443
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:20,604
Of course she does. Everybody does.

444
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:23,016
Talk to her.

445
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:28,017
-Talk to her about what?
-Talk to her, Catch.

446
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,825
Talk to somebody.
lt's been almost a year.

447
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,996
Every time l talk to somebody,
it gets a little easier.

448
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,688
l'm not saying it goes away--

449
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,928
She nice?

450
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,863
She's...

451
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:49,607
...tough.

452
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:51,706
She pretty?

453
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,509
That doesn't matter.

454
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,608
She's pretty.

455
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,019
She's sort of pissed off at me.

456
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,588
Apologize.

457
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,518
-For what?
-lt doesn't matter.

458
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:11,459
We like it when men apologize.

459
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,358
l thought l'd get your machine.

460
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:51,592
Want to call back?
I won't answer.

461
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:55,402
l thought you'd be working.

462
00:44:56,106 --> 00:44:58,131
l wish l was.

463
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,706
Can't sleep?

464
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:02,970
Me neither.

465
00:45:04,314 --> 00:45:06,145
Want to go somewhere?

466
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,948
Now? lt's 3 a.m.
The whole world is sleeping.

467
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,815
Not the whole world.

468
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:18,023
ls this a date?

469
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:21,193
Just an appointment.

470
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:48,047
We can rest, if you want.

471
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,484
Well, then rest.

472
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:52,122
See you later.

473
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:58,356
l wish we could go swimming.

474
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,099
Why can't we?

475
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:02,328
ln our clothes?

476
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:07,898
Oh, my God! You can't take off
your clothes in a state park!

477
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,010
You need to learn to take a day off.

478
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:14,144
Come on!

479
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,646
Where are you going?

480
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,780
l'm gonna tell!

481
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:04,883
Oh, my God.

482
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:12,858
Oh, God!

483
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,238
Freezing!

484
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:33,354
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

485
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:11,256
lKiss me someplace
l've never been kissed.

486
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:31,668
Thank you.

487
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:38,337
What did l tell you about leaving
the apartment without me?

488
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:40,210
Gotta go.

489
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,047
1034 to Rob-67, location confiirmed
as Pogue residence...

490
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,749
...possible 415.
Neighbor is standing outside.

491
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,635
-Where's Larry?
-Calm down.

492
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,808
-Where is he?
-We waited to book him.

493
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,237
-Where is he?
-You gonna calm down?

494
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:19,174
Don't talk to me like l'm a child!

495
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:21,405
He's out back with Denny.

496
00:50:23,084 --> 00:50:26,348
lKathy's inside with the kid.
Vanessa's with him.

497
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:31,457
l'm gonna kill you!

498
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,063
l'm getting nowhere with her.

499
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:43,998
-Maybe you can try.
-Got it.

500
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:46,497
Are you okay?

501
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:51,705
Neighbors moved in two weeks ago,
and they're calling the police.

502
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:53,674
Welcome to the neighborhood.

503
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,010
-Must've gotten pretty loud.
-We had a fight. People fight.

504
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:01,613
Why don't you tell me--

505
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:03,412
Oh, my--

506
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:06,158
Shit!

507
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:09,756
-Don't make it worse.
-lt gets worse?

508
00:51:10,462 --> 00:51:14,523
-lt's never happened before.
-Oh, first time for everything.

509
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:18,827
Don't fucking patronize me.
l don't need this shit.

510
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:26,844
-Look at you.
- Look at you, in my house!

511
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:30,480
Policing my family!
Where do you get off?

512
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,315
lt's me. l didn't hit you.

513
00:51:35,486 --> 00:51:38,922
l don't want your fucking pity, okay?

514
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,090
lt happened, all right?
He's torn up about it.

515
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:47,687
He's torn up about it? Fuck him!
He's torn up?

516
00:51:49,499 --> 00:51:51,558
Has he hit Larry, Jr. yet?

517
00:51:53,536 --> 00:51:57,404
He'd never do that.
He's a good man, Sharon.

518
00:51:57,674 --> 00:52:00,142
That's what my mother said to us.

519
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:03,744
''Your father's a good man.
He's torn up about it.''

520
00:52:06,016 --> 00:52:10,247
Get out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

521
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:21,393
Have you looked into counseling?

522
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:25,055
-Want to hit a woman? Hit me!
-Fuck! Here we go.

523
00:52:25,301 --> 00:52:26,427
-Calm--
-Back off.

524
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:30,503
-lt was an accident.
-lt looks more like a car accident.

525
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:32,673
-Very funny. Look--
-Shut up!

526
00:52:33,408 --> 00:52:36,036
You disgust me, you fucking coward!

527
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:38,011
You're a fucking cunt!

528
00:52:38,813 --> 00:52:41,407
-What are you doing?
-Let go! Get off!

529
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:43,116
You guys saw that.

530
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:46,719
You saw that.
You're witnesses. That's assault!

531
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:49,520
l'll press charges.

532
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,691
Let him press charges!

533
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:54,894
What are you talking about?
l'm bleeding!

534
00:52:55,095 --> 00:52:58,155
l saw nothing.
l saw you trip and fall.

535
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,035
Look at her! She's crazy!

536
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:06,865
You lay a hand on her again
and l'll arrest you myself!

537
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,339
You're just like him!

538
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:13,541
Yeah, and what about you?

539
00:53:21,987 --> 00:53:23,011
Get some help.

540
00:53:25,491 --> 00:53:28,654
Okay. All right.
Thanks for coming down.

541
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:47,033
My mother always said
it was a family thing.

542
00:54:48,036 --> 00:54:52,837
That l'd broken some kind of
sacred oath. l don't know.

543
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,703
When we walked in that day
and saw him beating her....

544
00:55:05,753 --> 00:55:08,051
What was l supposed to do?

545
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:16,455
Larry was the one who'd always
jump in and protect her.

546
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,424
And he always paid for it.

547
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:25,362
l never did anything.

548
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,475
l just ran and hide.

549
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:35,011
You did the right thing.
You called for help.

550
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,477
A lot of good it did me.

551
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:40,647
But you didn't do it for you.

552
00:55:50,796 --> 00:55:52,923
All those years...

553
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:00,060
...my dad never hurt me.

554
00:56:01,305 --> 00:56:02,294
Not once.

555
00:56:05,977 --> 00:56:07,444
Yes, he did.

556
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:30,366
Stop right there! Stop!

557
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:32,668
Freeze!

558
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:36,205
Shit!

559
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:40,101
l got constitutionality issues
for my attorney!

560
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:43,140
Mr. Steak lKnife
has ''constitutionality issues.''

561
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:44,972
Bitch, that ain't mine.

562
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:46,545
Watch your mouth.

563
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:51,178
He's trying to stick up for his lady.

564
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,379
You want to share love with your
partner, right, Officer Ho?

565
00:56:55,624 --> 00:57:00,152
-Ho! Officer Ho!
-Or Officer Bitch? Which one is it?

566
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:01,760
You ain't seen nothing.

567
00:57:02,363 --> 00:57:05,127
Fuck up your life, l don't care.

568
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:08,392
You want this life
for your little brother?

569
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:12,869
Banging until he's shot in the head
like your older brother?

570
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:16,002
He's a kid. He's got a chance.

571
00:57:16,477 --> 00:57:21,277
-l ain't got a chance?
-No, l'm saying this is your chance.

572
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:25,018
Are you smart enough to recognize it?

573
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:36,595
Come on, get in back.

574
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,633
What, you found God or something?

575
00:57:41,867 --> 00:57:44,301
Don't bust my balls, all right?

576
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:05,445
Come in!

577
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:16,392
Hey, you got some new furniture.

578
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:22,497
-And a new friend. Who's this?
-Bob.

579
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:27,241
-You named your dog Bob.
-No, that was his name.

580
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:29,938
-He told you that?
-Yeah.

581
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:41,256
l got something too. An invitation
to my parents' renewal of vows.

582
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:45,393
lt came today.
Found it the mailbox this morning.

583
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:47,758
Are you gonna go?

584
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:51,060
l don't know.

585
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:53,696
Would you?

586
00:58:54,937 --> 00:58:57,462
Are you asking me to go with you?

587
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:00,866
Why, would you do that?

588
00:59:02,945 --> 00:59:04,037
Can Bob come?

589
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:08,838
Sure.

590
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,213
Now that we got that settled....

591
00:59:14,589 --> 00:59:16,250
Feed me. l'm hungry.

592
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:18,688
l'll get my jacket.

593
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:27,163
And change your T-shirt.
You smell like dog.

594
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,734
What are you doing?

595
01:00:13,979 --> 01:00:17,437
-What's with the toys?
-Don't go through my things.

596
01:00:17,649 --> 01:00:19,617
l wasn't. lt was open.

597
01:00:21,453 --> 01:00:23,648
Why do you have all these toys?

598
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,128
l didn't mean to upset you.

599
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:36,292
Come on.

600
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:38,365
Let's just go.

601
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:46,332
What?

602
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:48,466
Nothing.

603
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,068
Let's go.

604
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:52,041
Be good, Bob.

605
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,523
-You know everybody?
-How you doing?

606
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:03,352
Going uphill, man.

607
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,160
-You try it.
-No....

608
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:06,351
Go ahead.

609
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,062
l feel like a jerk.

610
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,195
Try again.

611
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,568
What?

612
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:27,478
You like blues?

613
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,416
Come on, let's go in.

614
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,009
Come on.

615
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,530
Take off your coat.
Let's stay a while.

616
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:55,363
Come on.

617
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:12,082
That was incredible!
l didn't know you played.

618
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:14,812
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l don't know.

619
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:18,459
-Why'd you leave? lt was great!
-Steve!

620
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,254
Oh, man, l don't believe this!
Steve Lambert!

621
01:06:22,463 --> 01:06:25,091
How you doing? You okay?
lt's been--

622
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:28,268
You have me confused with
somebody else.

623
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:30,994
You kidding me? Stevie, it's me.

624
01:06:31,205 --> 01:06:33,639
-Tony!
-l don't know a Steve.

625
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:36,434
ls it a joke?

626
01:06:36,643 --> 01:06:41,170
l was up in my office and
l heard that sound, your sound.

627
01:06:41,714 --> 01:06:43,682
l don't know who you are.

628
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:45,441
Get away from me!

629
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:50,353
You mind explaining this to me?

630
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:53,923
Who is that?
You owe him money or something?

631
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:56,924
l don't know who he is.

632
01:06:57,864 --> 01:06:59,331
ls your name Steve?

633
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,628
My name's Catch.

634
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:05,493
-What do you want?
-The truth!

635
01:07:05,937 --> 01:07:08,405
-Who's Steve Lambert?
-l don't know.

636
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:11,333
Are we living some kind of lie?

637
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:14,637
What'll l find out next?
That you are married?

638
01:07:19,017 --> 01:07:22,452
-Where are you going?
-What do you want me to say?

639
01:07:22,653 --> 01:07:26,384
l don't want you to say anything!
Don't say anything.

640
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:30,893
You want to go? Go.

641
01:10:40,809 --> 01:10:43,903
Please leave a message after the tone.

642
01:10:44,112 --> 01:10:46,774
Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?

643
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:54,415
Listen, I was wondering if
we could meet tomorrow.

644
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:58,853
At this place called Enrico's.
It's on Halsted and Marion.

645
01:10:59,993 --> 01:11:01,790
Around 2:00, okay?

646
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:05,420
Okay.

647
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:07,723
Bye.

648
01:11:45,604 --> 01:11:49,040
-About the other day--
-You don't have to explain.

649
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:50,765
l probably do.

650
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:53,874
But.... l'm fine.

651
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:00,275
Come on.

652
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:06,513
l thought we were having coffee.

653
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:09,716
-You can trust me, you know.
-l know that.

654
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:12,585
l'd never hurt you.

655
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:21,226
Remember when you said some people
were meant to meet each other?

656
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:27,042
Maybe we were meant to
meet that night.

657
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,908
The night l held your hand.

658
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:32,681
What do you mean?

659
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,541
Maybe you don't remember.

660
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:40,188
-You were unconscious--
-No, l don't.

661
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:42,713
l was there.

662
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,855
lt was me that was there that night.

663
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:48,795
At the accident?

664
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,624
What are you talking about?

665
01:12:54,268 --> 01:12:57,066
-Maybe it's why we met again.
-What are you doing?

666
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:59,762
-Trying to help.
-With what? l'm fine.

667
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:03,740
-l don't think you are. You pretend--
-l'm not pretending!

668
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,970
-You're lying.
-l'm not lying!

669
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:10,446
Then walk in there. And l'll
walk in there with you.

670
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:14,018
-Why are you doing this?
-Because you had a family.

671
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:16,985
-Shut up. Stop.
-You had a wife and a child.

672
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:20,489
l'm so sorry it happened.
l want you to have a life.

673
01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:22,628
l have a life. We don't need--

674
01:13:22,829 --> 01:13:26,492
-Please! lt happened.
-We don't need to go into this.

675
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,567
-Please--
-You like to push people, don't you?

676
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:33,034
l just want to understand you,
to know who you are.

677
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:38,302
l can't do that if you don't let me.
l know it's hard, l can imagine--

678
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:40,274
You can't imagine anything!

679
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,505
You have no idea how it feels
to do what l did--

680
01:13:46,018 --> 01:13:47,007
What?

681
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,489
Stay with me, okay?

682
01:13:54,693 --> 01:13:59,391
lt's not your fault.
l was there, l saw the reports.

683
01:13:59,597 --> 01:14:02,691
That truck, it just-- Catch, please.

684
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:06,029
l'm trying to tell you
something, okay?

685
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,074
l'm trying to tell you that....

686
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:12,670
You're not alone.

687
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:17,914
-l'm trying to tell you that l....
-Don't.

688
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:38,128
-You're supposed to be his dad!
-Can't you take him?

689
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:41,235
l'll be busy!
l won't have time today!

690
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:42,961
And l have time?

691
01:15:27,214 --> 01:15:30,650
That's a hell of a greeting.
What's up with you?

692
01:15:31,418 --> 01:15:36,378
You don't return my calls. Haven't
shown up for work three, four days.

693
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:39,659
You don't look like you got the flu.

694
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:45,256
-l take it Freak Show dumped you?
-Fuck you.

695
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:50,329
l wish l could say l'm sorry,
but l ain't.

696
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,663
l think it's best for everybody.

697
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:55,738
-Really? And who's ''everybody''?
-Me.

698
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:04,947
Martha Stewart, you gonna pour
your partner a cup?

699
01:16:08,687 --> 01:16:09,813
He had you.

700
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:12,122
He got you, didn't he?

701
01:16:14,493 --> 01:16:17,394
l'm gonna give you some
real strong advice.

702
01:16:20,065 --> 01:16:21,759
Change the subject.

703
01:16:26,404 --> 01:16:27,837
Charlene's pregnant.

704
01:16:32,309 --> 01:16:33,537
That's great.

705
01:16:35,513 --> 01:16:37,037
Congratulations.

706
01:16:39,283 --> 01:16:42,376
l'm not sure l'm ready to
be a daddy yet.

707
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,788
l haven't gotten over Miss Stillwell.

708
01:16:49,459 --> 01:16:50,483
Who?

709
01:16:51,928 --> 01:16:54,021
Tenth-grade English teacher.

710
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:57,095
Hot buttered Stillwell.

711
01:17:04,973 --> 01:17:07,874
l know you gotta go through this.

712
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:11,240
l'll tell the boss
l stopped by to see you.

713
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,881
You as sick as a dog,
coughing up organs and shit.

714
01:17:15,084 --> 01:17:17,814
But l can't let this
go on much longer.

715
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:21,245
We got us a job to do out there.

716
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:25,218
We gotta clean these streets
before my baby gets here.

717
01:17:25,693 --> 01:17:27,661
You know what l'm saying?

718
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:58,150
Has he been here?

719
01:17:58,725 --> 01:18:03,253
l was expecting him this
morning. He shops for me.

720
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:07,856
l give him money from the settlement
every week.

721
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,164
Can't talk about that with him.

722
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:18,802
When he comes here, do you ever
talk about the accident?

723
01:18:19,645 --> 01:18:22,773
-Does he ever mention the past?
-No.

724
01:18:22,982 --> 01:18:23,949
Why not?

725
01:18:24,483 --> 01:18:27,918
l try to let him
find his own way through.

726
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:31,084
l feel he needs that.

727
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:37,891
Why are you here, Sharon?

728
01:18:38,696 --> 01:18:40,994
l want to know how to help him.

729
01:18:41,232 --> 01:18:44,633
-You are helping him.
-l don't think so.

730
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:47,137
What makes you think that?

731
01:18:48,939 --> 01:18:50,998
l took him to the cemetery--

732
01:18:51,241 --> 01:18:52,572
The cemetery?

733
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:55,339
l thought it might help.

734
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:57,474
He needs to face it.

735
01:18:59,716 --> 01:19:03,117
He will face it, in his time.

736
01:19:06,423 --> 01:19:10,859
He built a wall around that whole day
and that night.

737
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:14,085
My daughter and my grandson.

738
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,264
He can't help it.

739
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:20,531
A cemetery....

740
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:26,336
Do you know how hard it is for me
to go to the cemetery?

741
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:31,135
l was just trying to help him
get back to some kind of life.

742
01:19:31,546 --> 01:19:33,013
He was coming back.

743
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:36,810
Don't you realize how he's
changed these past weeks?

744
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:40,783
His apartment, his life?
He fell in love.

745
01:19:41,022 --> 01:19:46,255
Why do you want to rush things? Why
does everybody rush things these days?

746
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:50,959
l was scared.

747
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,861
Scared of what?

748
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,330
Of losing him.

749
01:19:58,839 --> 01:20:01,808
And l guess that's what l did.
l lost him.

750
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:05,506
You were just trying to find your way.

751
01:20:06,146 --> 01:20:08,341
What else can we do?

752
01:20:08,949 --> 01:20:13,647
You think l'm always sure about what
l should or shouldn't say to him?

753
01:20:13,887 --> 01:20:16,720
l just try to do what's right...

754
01:20:16,956 --> 01:20:20,619
...and hope that he'll
find the love in it.

755
01:20:23,329 --> 01:20:24,887
Look at you...

756
01:20:25,598 --> 01:20:28,499
...so worried now, and miserable.

757
01:20:33,171 --> 01:20:35,162
There's love in that.

758
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:48,449
''l just...

759
01:20:49,354 --> 01:20:52,015
...wanted to wish you both the best.''

760
01:20:52,823 --> 01:20:57,522
''l just want to wish you both well
and say congratulations.''

761
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:05,525
''Hi, Mom, Dad.

762
01:21:06,037 --> 01:21:09,336
l just stopped by
to say congratulations...

763
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:12,531
...and l think it's great.''

764
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,377
These shoes, no.

765
01:21:28,692 --> 01:21:31,752
Please leave a message after the tone.

766
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:33,850
Catch?

767
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:36,531
Can you pick up?

768
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:44,897
Will you call me?

769
01:21:56,684 --> 01:22:01,815
You declared your love for one
another in the presence of Christ.

770
01:22:02,023 --> 01:22:04,116
He consecrated you in baptism...

771
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:08,728
...enriched and strengthened you
in the sacrament of matrimony...

772
01:22:08,963 --> 01:22:13,831
...so you can carry out the duties of
marriage in lasting fidelity.

773
01:22:31,818 --> 01:22:35,048
--congratulates you
and rejoices with you...

774
01:22:35,254 --> 01:22:38,314
...on reaching this milestone
in your journey.

775
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,616
Are you prepared to
give yourselves again...

776
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:44,318
...to that union larger
than yourselves...

777
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,761
...that union already
blessed by God?

778
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:49,525
-Yes.
-Yes, we are.

779
01:22:49,735 --> 01:22:53,694
Face each other and join hands
please, and say after me:

780
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,330
-l, Carl...
-l, Carl...

781
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:59,305
-...take thee, Josephine...
-...take thee, Josephine...

782
01:22:59,544 --> 01:23:02,377
-...to be my wife.
-...to be my wife.

783
01:23:03,281 --> 01:23:05,306
-l, Josephine...
-l, Josephine...

784
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:07,484
-...take you, Carl...
-...take you, Carl...

785
01:23:07,685 --> 01:23:10,620
-...to be my husband.
-...to be my husband.

786
01:23:10,855 --> 01:23:15,087
l promise to be true to you
in good times and in bad...

787
01:23:15,393 --> 01:23:17,223
...in sickness and in health.

788
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:18,860
l promise to love you...

789
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:22,963
...and honor you
till death do us part.

790
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:32,497
Annie.

791
01:23:34,711 --> 01:23:35,541
Max.

792
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,773
l don't want you to think
l forgot you.

793
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:45,950
lt's just that l couldn't find you.
l woke up and you were gone.

794
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:50,853
Everything was gone.
lt just disappeared in one minute.

795
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:54,723
l couldn't remember that minute.
l lost it.

796
01:23:55,998 --> 01:24:01,264
But l think l found it all now.
l used a calculator, see.

797
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:05,131
Do you know we get about
1400 minutes a day?

798
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,174
So l figured it out.

799
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:10,878
l was...

800
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,107
...29 years old...

801
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:16,113
...three months and eight days.

802
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:21,520
So it was minute number...

803
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:26,489
...1 7,810,200 or so.

804
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,060
That's the one l lost.

805
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:34,165
When l lost that minute,
l guess l....

806
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:36,233
l tried to lose it all...

807
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:38,270
...all the memories...

808
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:41,036
...because it hurt so bad.

809
01:24:43,376 --> 01:24:45,003
l tried, but....

810
01:24:51,784 --> 01:24:53,411
But l couldn't do it.

811
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:58,417
Max, you were sick that day, remember?

812
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,417
lt was your birthday...

813
01:25:02,661 --> 01:25:04,424
...and you ate too much.

814
01:25:14,439 --> 01:25:16,168
Annie, you said:

815
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:19,642
''Slow down, it's wet, okay?''

816
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:21,840
And you were right.

817
01:25:22,413 --> 01:25:24,438
l should have slowed down.

818
01:25:26,117 --> 01:25:28,915
l should have slowed down
lots of times.

819
01:25:29,987 --> 01:25:32,114
But l didn't always listen.

820
01:25:33,224 --> 01:25:35,283
l didn't listen when you...

821
01:25:35,893 --> 01:25:40,830
...when you said, ''Steve,
just please spend more time.''

822
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:51,105
That day l made you smile,
Max, remember?

823
01:25:51,308 --> 01:25:53,037
You looked at me...

824
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:55,343
...and I made a face...

825
01:25:55,779 --> 01:25:58,145
...and then we all smiled.

826
01:25:58,848 --> 01:26:00,679
lt was a great minute.

827
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:02,282
lt was.

828
01:26:05,521 --> 01:26:08,513
l'm so glad l found that minute.

829
01:26:10,926 --> 01:26:12,689
And no matter what...

830
01:26:13,229 --> 01:26:16,289
...no matter what,
l won't forget anymore.

831
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:24,360
Daddy!

832
01:26:56,903 --> 01:26:58,962
l won't forget anymore.

833
01:27:02,309 --> 01:27:03,708
l love you.

834
01:27:49,053 --> 01:27:52,079
Don't make him talk about
anything today.

835
01:27:53,457 --> 01:27:54,446
l know.

836
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:59,025
lt was a nice ceremony.

837
01:28:01,598 --> 01:28:03,862
We're running out of chicken.

838
01:28:04,435 --> 01:28:06,459
Nobody's eating the ham.

839
01:28:10,073 --> 01:28:12,200
lt's still a great party.

840
01:28:13,576 --> 01:28:15,009
You look happy.

841
01:28:16,512 --> 01:28:19,140
30 years and still in love, huh?

842
01:28:19,615 --> 01:28:22,083
You think that's wrong, don't you?

843
01:28:22,819 --> 01:28:24,184
Of course not.

844
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:32,186
You're beautiful.

845
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:14,822
Dad.

846
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:21,496
-Don't walk away, okay?
-What?

847
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:24,836
ls it working?
Do you need to check it?

848
01:29:25,612 --> 01:29:26,977
-lt's fine.
-Dad--

849
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,478
-What the hell are you doing?
-Sharon, please.

850
01:29:30,682 --> 01:29:34,015
Please, please what?
Why do you always protect him?

851
01:29:34,219 --> 01:29:35,982
''Don't bother your father.''

852
01:29:36,188 --> 01:29:39,851
l'm gonna bother you for a minute.
Can you handle that?

853
01:29:40,058 --> 01:29:43,926
-You get the hell--
-This is between me and my father.

854
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,498
So both of you, just leave us alone
for one goddamn minute!

855
01:29:54,705 --> 01:29:56,502
How about you, Dad?

856
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,336
You want me to go?

857
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:03,142
-lt's up to you.
-l'm asking you.

858
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:05,275
Am l welcome here?

859
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:10,252
You're here, aren't you?

860
01:30:10,455 --> 01:30:13,048
-What do you want?
-l want to know.

861
01:30:14,357 --> 01:30:16,188
Do you want me here?

862
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,922
Do you still love me?
l want to know.

863
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:39,478
l feel like....

864
01:30:42,151 --> 01:30:44,119
You feel like what, Dad?

865
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:53,059
l feel like l don't
have a daughter anymore.

866
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,322
Well...

867
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:05,562
...you do. And it's a shame that
you'll miss knowing her.

868
01:31:35,935 --> 01:31:37,129
l'm next.

869
01:31:38,971 --> 01:31:42,907
Hi, Mom, Dad. Congratulations.

870
01:31:44,544 --> 01:31:48,344
You know, being in this house
reminds of something.

871
01:31:48,848 --> 01:31:50,975
l was about 10 years old.

872
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:55,711
Me and Larry were playing
alien invasion.

873
01:31:56,988 --> 01:31:58,319
Remember, Lar?

874
01:31:59,124 --> 01:32:02,423
Anyway, we were making a lot of noise.

875
01:32:04,095 --> 01:32:07,758
Dad came home from work,
tired and pissed off.

876
01:32:08,633 --> 01:32:10,760
We were yelling like mad.

877
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:13,836
He burst into the room and he yells:

878
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:15,903
''What the hell are you doing?''

879
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,030
And l was scared.

880
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:20,974
l was really scared.

881
01:32:22,413 --> 01:32:23,744
And l said:

882
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:28,051
''We're playing alien invasion.''

883
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:33,155
And he said, ''l'll show you
a damn alien invasion!''

884
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:35,982
He picks me up.

885
01:32:36,192 --> 01:32:39,889
He picks me up off the floor
and he throws me on the couch.

886
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:45,363
Then he grabs Larry and picks him up
and throws him on the couch.

887
01:32:46,636 --> 01:32:47,898
And then....

888
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:52,264
Then he starts making monster noises.

889
01:32:54,177 --> 01:32:57,942
He says, ''We came to Earth
to kick ass!''

890
01:32:58,146 --> 01:33:02,173
Me and Larry, we're running
and jumping at him.

891
01:33:02,684 --> 01:33:04,515
We're laughing so hard...

892
01:33:04,853 --> 01:33:06,445
...l almost wet myself.

893
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:12,751
And we keep running and jumping
on him, and he keeps tossing us.

894
01:33:14,129 --> 01:33:16,097
And growling and beeping.

895
01:33:23,304 --> 01:33:24,635
lt was great.

896
01:33:29,343 --> 01:33:30,708
lt was great.

897
01:33:33,481 --> 01:33:35,381
l'll never forget that.

898
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,313
And l miss that.

899
01:33:47,594 --> 01:33:48,788
l miss it.

900
01:33:54,734 --> 01:33:56,463
Anyway, l just...

901
01:33:57,937 --> 01:34:01,064
...wanted to say thanks for that, Dad.

902
01:34:05,177 --> 01:34:06,405
Thanks.

903
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:16,610
Bye.

904
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:25,549
What are you doing here?

905
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:28,016
You invited me.

906
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,184
Are you okay?

907
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:32,290
Yeah, l'm okay.

908
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:37,361
l wanted to apologize.

909
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:39,326
For what?

910
01:35:43,103 --> 01:35:48,439
For wanting everything to be perfect.
You were right, l was pushing you.

911
01:35:52,212 --> 01:35:54,237
Then l realized that...

912
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:56,916
...it doesn't have to be perfect.

913
01:35:57,684 --> 01:35:58,514
l mean....

914
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:03,078
lt can be whatever it is.

915
01:36:09,362 --> 01:36:12,160
They don't like me very much
in there.

916
01:36:12,999 --> 01:36:15,627
They're lucky to have you in there.

917
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:20,439
-That's a nice thing to say.
-lt's not a nice thing.

918
01:36:20,673 --> 01:36:22,140
lt's the truth.

919
01:36:25,644 --> 01:36:28,340
Why do you try so hard not to cry?

920
01:36:33,952 --> 01:36:35,647
lt's not fair.

921
01:36:37,522 --> 01:36:39,251
l did the right thing.

922
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:42,626
l know l did.

923
01:36:44,029 --> 01:36:47,520
lt's not fair that
they're shutting me out.

924
01:36:55,105 --> 01:36:57,596
There's nothing l can do anymore.

925
01:37:02,813 --> 01:37:04,576
l went, Sharon.

926
01:37:06,883 --> 01:37:10,683
l went to see my wife
and my son today.

927
01:37:12,722 --> 01:37:16,624
l told them that l love them
and that l miss them.

928
01:37:17,861 --> 01:37:20,227
And then l told them about you.

929
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:27,368
l told them how much l love you.

930
01:37:44,653 --> 01:37:45,677
l love you.

931
01:37:50,224 --> 01:37:51,953
l love you too.

932
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,864
l'll drive.
