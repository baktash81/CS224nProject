00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:04,718
Last season on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

2
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:08,841
Alien structures
are going up over every city

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,047
that we know about.

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:12,812
They flew here in spaceships
and turned kids into slaves.

5
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:14,667
What's happening to us?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,148
You really think you can
deal with those lizards?

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,562
Skitters were our us too.

8
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,845
Who do you think they are?

9
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,468
I don't know.

10
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,372
I wish we could use these
against them.

11
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:31,171
We don't have enough people
 left for a suicide mission.

12
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:35,185
The harness...
is a process.

13
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,266
And Ben isn't free
from it.

14
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:40,173
They'll call him back...
unless you go with them.

15
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:41,950
You don't want to do this.

16
00:00:41,953 --> 00:00:43,654
No, I don't.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,700
Tom?

18
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,871
Tom.

19
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,133
Anthony!

20
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:52,751
Open fire!

21
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,707
Where the hell
is our backup?!

22
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:22,649
Keep your heads down!
Make every shot count!

23
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:32,993
Remember the drill,
Five-O --

24
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,929
arms, legs,
then the <i>cabeza!</i>

25
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:37,931
You ever think you enjoying
these turkey shoots

26
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,666
a bit too much,
convict?!

27
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,334
Life
hands you lemons...

28
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,203
Go!

29
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,740
...you blow
its frigging head off!

30
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:55,084
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,957
Cease fire!
Ben! Stop shooting!

32
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:07,097
Captain!
We look good down here!

33
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:09,066
Get the hell out of there!

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,436
We got...eight minutes, tops,
before those beamers respond!

35
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,139
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

36
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:22,380
Jimmy, stay close!

37
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,050
Ben! Come on!

38
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,819
We're moving out.
Got one still moving.

39
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,756
- Can't get a shot.
- Well, leave it!

40
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,226
Ben!

41
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:54,345
Ben! What the hell
are you doing?

42
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:06,224
Ben.

43
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,892
Ben, orders
are to bug out.

44
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,295
There's another one.
I can feel it.

45
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,546
Dad?

46
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,281
Dad!

47
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,149
It's Dad.

48
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,385
Dad? Dad.

49
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:33,855
Ben. Ben.

50
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,557
Hal.

51
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:40,328
You're alive, thank God.

54
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:59,313
We got beamers
on top of us!

55
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,217
Where the hell
is Hal and Ben?!

56
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,019
That wasn't
eight minutes!

57
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,489
Looks like the bad guys
are growing a brain.

58
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:09,525
Captain, hold on!
Hold on, Captain!

59
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,894
Got to get him
in the back of the truck!

60
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,229
Tom!

61
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,564
He's hurt bad.
Get the back open.

62
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,065
Let's get him
in the truck!

63
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,334
Pope, Anthony,
get out of here now!

64
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,336
Get him in the back!

65
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,472
Where's he hurt?
Come on! Hurry up!

66
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,074
Mason?

67
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,610
Where the hell
did <i>he</i> come from?

68
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,081
Go, go! Go, go!

69
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,294
Easy, easy!

70
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:49,432
Dr. Glass!
Dr. Glass! Anne!

71
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,033
Somebody get Anne!

72
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,301
Incoming!
Out of the way, people!

73
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,436
Get out of the way!

74
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,305
Let him through!
Easy, easy.

75
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,240
Tom Mason is alive!
Tom?

76
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,942
Is he okay?
Oh, my God. Tom?

77
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,611
He's been shot.
He lost a lot of blood.

78
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,947
Anne.
Was it a Mech?

79
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,216
Tell Ben
it wasn't his fault.

80
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,452
Uh, it was an accident --
friendly fire.

81
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,322
I didn't know!
It was dark.

82
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,491
Ben, I got to go.

83
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,098
Ben, it's okay.

84
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,577
Let's turn him over.

85
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,481
No exit wound.

86
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:40,917
That means the bullet's
still inside. Okay.

87
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:42,351
Lourdes,
I need his pressure.

88
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,119
Uh-huh.

89
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,322
Dad! Dad!
Hey, buddy.

90
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:48,523
What happened to him?!

91
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,291
He's been hurt pretty bad,
buddy.

92
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,460
But he's gonna be okay,
right?

93
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,462
90 over 70.

94
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,931
Start an I.V., okay,
and...

95
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:00,167
go get the propofol
we found in Fitchburg.

96
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,502
I can't stop the bleeding

97
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,170
until I find out where
the bullet is, okay?

98
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,672
I have to go in, Tom.

99
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:07,307
Guys, I know how much
you want to be here, but...

100
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:09,609
She's right. Come on.
Let's give them some room.

101
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,444
Let's give them
some room.

102
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,681
Come on, Ben.
It's all right.

103
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,182
Let's give them
some room.

104
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:20,318
Thanks for that.

105
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:24,022
I go in blind like this,
I could make things worse.

106
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:27,393
I trust you.

107
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,349
Hey!

108
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,317
I've been here for days!

109
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,386
I want to know about my son!

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,600
No!

111
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:12,506
Don't.

112
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:16,410
Karen?

113
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:20,679
Sorry for this, Tom.

114
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,452
I hope you're not afraid.

115
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,019
Whatever you think
they've done to me,

116
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:30,722
I'm still Karen.

117
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,495
This way.

118
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:51,640
You said what they were doing
to Ben was a process.

119
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,276
Whatever it is,
can it be stopped?

120
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,311
- That's up to you.
- Me?

121
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,448
Tom,
it's time to face facts.

122
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,083
They've won.

123
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:02,287
There's no use prolonging
hostilities for either side.

124
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:05,123
Meaning what? They're asking
for a cease-fire?

125
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,291
No, they're allowing
the resistance

126
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,060
to surrender.

127
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:11,596
"Allowing the resistance
to surrender"?

128
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,598
Sounds like we've been more
trouble than they expected.

129
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,568
Don't overestimate
a few small victories.

130
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:20,439
The resistance
is an inconvenience.

131
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:23,575
They are offering you
a gift, Tom --

132
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,679
a chance to have a life,
a real life,

133
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,681
with Hal and Matt
and Ben.

134
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,149
After everything
they've done,

135
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:31,583
you expect me
to take that on faith?

136
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,085
No.

137
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,488
Not on faith.

138
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,490
Once you hear
what they have to offer,

139
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:42,794
I'm sure you'll understand...
everything.

140
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,612
So, they finally
got the bullet out,

141
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,648
but Anne says he's looking
pretty weak.

142
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,518
Your father's a fighter, Hal.
I know that firsthand.

143
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:16,853
Yeah, but you saw
the way he looked.

144
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:18,521
There's no telling what else
he's been through.

145
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:19,857
How's Ben handling it?

146
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,692
He's been keeping
to himself.

147
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,828
You know, he's got to feel
like hell.

148
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,830
You notice anything else
about him?

149
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,799
Look, Ben's fine,
all right?

150
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,567
If the Skitters are still
pulling his strings,

151
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,202
I think they'd make him miss
every now and then.

152
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:34,471
I still want you
to keep an eye on him.

153
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,140
Now, I know
that you're worried

154
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:39,877
about your father, Hal,
but we got a situation here.

155
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,712
Yeah, like how this
eight-minute escape window

156
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,747
just turned into two.
Those munitions we lucked into

157
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,883
allowed us to inflict
some serious pain,

158
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:48,819
but these ambushes were
supposed to be a holding action

159
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,955
till we got new orders.

160
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,624
You're not thinking about
backing down, are you?

161
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:57,029
We haven't heard word one
from any of the other units

162
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,897
since that attack
on Boston.

163
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,699
For all I know, we're the only
ones still left in the fight.

164
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,802
And I'm for killing these
bastards every chance we get,

165
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,739
but we get boxed in,
we may not come out.

166
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,841
So we <i>don't</i> get boxed in.

167
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,242
All right?
We're finally drawing blood.

168
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,010
That was the point,
right?

169
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,912
Got to hurt them
as much as they hurt us.

170
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,792
I'm gonna go get some air.

171
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,694
If anything changes,
just come outside.

172
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,660
The girl told us you were
a historian before we came.

173
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,995
Karen?

174
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,669
It's not her anymore, is it?
I'm talking to you?

175
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:17,939
She is allowing me
to speak through her.

176
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,208
"Allowing"?
She has no choice.

177
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:23,044
You took her like you took...
Ben and everything else.

178
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,713
There was
no other way.

179
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,315
We've studied you
in great detail, Professor.

180
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,685
We've drawn from that
to make a proposal

181
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:33,187
that would end hostilities
between us.

182
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,590
In exchange
for sanctuary,

183
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,659
we will set aside
a protected area

184
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,094
where human survivors
will be relocated.

185
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:41,996
Some kind
of prison camp.

186
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:45,233
A place where you would be
allowed to live in peace.

187
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,969
You must be familiar
with the concept.

188
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:51,239
It's taken directly
from your own history.

189
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,975
The worst of it.

190
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,077
You can't hand-pick
from our darkest moments

191
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,745
like Cambodia
or Nazi Germany.

192
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,282
Or Nanking, My Lai,
the trail of tears.

193
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,817
Please,
Professor Mason.

194
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:05,020
We can think of dozens
of more examples.

195
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:09,157
Be honest.
Oppression is in your nature.

196
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:13,628
And <i>that</i> is your justification
for the murder of billions?

197
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:17,732
If those atrocities
are the <i>worst</i> of us...

198
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,734
what does that make you?

199
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:24,971
The ones who will decide
if your world lives or dies.

200
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:32,379
Ben, I've been looking
for you.

201
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:34,215
I wanted to be by myself
for a while.

202
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,883
You heard
what happened, right?

203
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:39,353
Yeah. I know you didn't mean
to hurt dad.

204
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:44,226
You're going out again.

205
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,994
Got no choice.

206
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:49,064
Pope and Anthony sent another
alien patrol our direction.

207
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,200
We don't ambush them
on our terms,

208
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:54,068
they could roll
right over us.

209
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:55,336
It's not fair!

210
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,238
I-I should be going
with you.

211
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:01,709
Okay,
you're nowhere near ready.

212
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:04,711
Because everyone keeps
treating me like a little kid.

213
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:08,248
I'm old enough to fight.

214
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,717
Old enough to know <i>how,</i>
<i>at least.</i>

215
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:11,951
How about this?

216
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,121
When I get back,
I'll see what I can do.

217
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,123
Thanks.

218
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,763
Sure you're up for this?

219
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,933
Skitters are coming,
whether we like it or not.

220
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,104
Hey, thanks, buddy.

221
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:34,241
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead. You first.

222
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,943
Wow. You sure know how
to impress a girl.

223
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,712
What's next --
his and her grenade launchers?

224
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,815
Who knows? I might do something
crazy like open a door for you.

225
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,149
Hey, Ben!

226
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,452
Hey, wait up!

227
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,257
Hey, I know what happened
with Dad was an accident,

228
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,792
but the next time
I give an order,

229
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,394
I need to know
you're gonna listen.

230
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,062
Whatever you say.

231
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,798
Hey. Hold up. Hey.

232
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,168
What's up, man?
I don't get you.

233
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,270
I mean, as much as he got
into it with Weaver,

234
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,106
Dad always understood
chain of command.

235
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,977
I'll follow your orders,
but you're not Dad, okay?

236
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:31,330
Pretty sweet spot
for wasting Skitters.

237
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,165
Put a shooter up on the roof
with a Barrett.

238
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,035
Yeah, a .50-Cal will put a hole
through anything.

239
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,537
Maybe get
a cross fire going

240
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,406
with that dry cleaner
right there.

241
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,175
While you kids
get that started,

242
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,843
me and the brain trust, we'll
get the cooties' attention.

243
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,979
We'll come back
to the north side.

244
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:49,283
Get out of the truck!
Take cover!

245
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,385
Get out of the truck!
Do it now!

246
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,359
Get down!

247
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,333
Not the Harley!

248
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,476
Pope! Stop! Stop!

249
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,816
Come on, man.
Let it go, bro.

250
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,051
Let it go!

251
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,120
Come on!

252
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,608
What the hell
went wrong?

253
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:45,311
Damned if I know.
Never even got off a shot.

254
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:48,347
They're onto us.
There's something else.

255
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,016
The way they kept laying fire
into the truck

256
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,918
after we bugged out --
it's like <i>that</i> was the target.

257
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:54,654
We know
they can pick up heat.

258
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,923
Could be the engine
is what got their attention.

259
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,792
First time
they've targeted vehicles.

260
00:16:58,826 --> 00:17:00,327
First time for everything.

261
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,861
With these beamers
on constant patrol --

262
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,429
We're screwed and blued,

263
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:05,465
and you can kiss
this ambush plan goodbye.

264
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,535
If we can't run our trucks,
we're not mobile.

265
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,904
The Skitters got to know
we're close.

266
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,472
Won't be long before
they catch our scent.

267
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:24,353
Captain,
you wanted to see me?

268
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:26,355
Dai tells me
that you're doing a fair job

269
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,957
of taking over for Scott.

270
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,659
He did?

271
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:31,995
I can only hope
he's right.

272
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,697
We think that the aliens have
recalibrated their beamers

273
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:36,966
to pick up the heat
coming off our vehicles.

274
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,302
Probably using
some infrared sensor.

275
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:41,839
As long as we stay put,
engines off, they can't see us.

276
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:43,574
Only that's not
an option.

277
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,843
Our patrols
just saw three alien units

278
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,512
all walking around out there,
all within five miles.

279
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,781
It's only a matter of time
before they nail us.

280
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:52,716
If we can't move our vehicles,
we lose our mobility,

281
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,052
and we lose most
of our supplies.

282
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,587
We need to find
a way to mask the heat

283
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,355
coming off those engines

284
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,557
long enough to put some distance
between us and those patrols.

285
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,724
Well, how far?

286
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,726
At least 20 miles.

287
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,862
20 miles?

288
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:09,964
That would mean keeping the engines
cooled out for at least an hour.

289
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,336
Okay.

290
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:16,571
All right. I'll try.

291
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:18,407
You don't get points
for effort.

292
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:19,675
We don't find a way
to move those vehicles,

293
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,411
people are going to die.

294
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:25,882
No pressure.

295
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:38,895
I don't care
what you wanted from us.

296
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,698
There must have been a way
to get it peacefully.

297
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,833
You didn't even try to talk
to us before the attack.

298
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,102
This was never
a negotiation.

299
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,104
That's why we'll never stop
fighting you.

300
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,773
We have no patience
for empty bravado.

301
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,042
So those
are our alternatives --

302
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,110
live as prisoners or die?

303
00:18:57,144 --> 00:19:00,112
Why would you expect
better from us

304
00:19:00,147 --> 00:19:03,716
than you do
from yourselves?

305
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,651
Because I look
around this ship,

306
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:09,521
at the technology that
brought you from another world,

307
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:12,791
and I want to believe
that only an advanced species

308
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:16,061
could have
achieved so much.

309
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,063
But I would be wrong.

310
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:23,102
You <i>will</i> lead your people
to the neutral zone.

311
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,877
No.

312
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:33,012
Then the choice
has been made.

313
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,183
I would be careful about drawing
too many lessons from the past.

314
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,819
Why is that?

315
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:42,957
Because our history
has yet to be written.

316
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,559
Tom Mason, 2nd Mass.

317
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,694
I didn't know
they had anybody else.

318
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,995
Neither did I.

319
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,997
Bonnie Garcia,
Vermont militia.

320
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:29,701
Bastards wanted me
to lead them to my guys,

321
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:32,471
talk them into buying
this sanctuary bull.

322
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:35,507
That's why they took us --
to finish what they started.

323
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,013
This isn't right.

324
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:55,928
Oh, my God.

325
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,503
Everybody run!
Don't give it a target!

326
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:05,871
Run!

327
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:43,934
Find your stance.

328
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,584
Lean forward a bit.

329
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,158
Hey, Ben!

330
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:52,894
What's Matt doing
with a gun?

331
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,996
Ben's teaching me
how to shoot.

332
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,330
Figured it was time.

333
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,966
He needs to learn
how to defend himself.

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,136
So you just gave him a rifle
without asking me?

335
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,539
I might have to follow
your orders on missions,

336
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,008
but not here.

337
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,983
Hal, wait!

338
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,625
Go back to camp, Matt.

339
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,596
Go back to camp.

340
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:31,100
You know, maybe he's ready,
maybe he's not,

341
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:33,202
but we both know
Dad didn't want that for him.

342
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:35,537
Three months ago. How do you
know what he'd say now?

343
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,439
I <i>don't</i> know
what he'd say right now,

344
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:39,174
and neither do you,
okay?

345
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:41,676
So how about we wait
and let Dad make that decision?

346
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,077
Only way we win this war

347
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,712
is by killing
every Skitter we see.

348
00:22:44,747 --> 00:22:47,015
If Matt's old enough
to load a gun,

349
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,450
he's old enough
to shoot it.

350
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,051
After what happened
with Dad,

351
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,021
you think you're the best one
to be giving lessons?

352
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:55,190
I just don't want him
to be taken away

353
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,691
the way they took me.

354
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:00,728
Or your girlfriend,
Karen.

355
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:11,071
I'm not the math geek
you used to push around.

356
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,406
Deal with it.

357
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:23,415
It's like I don't
even know him anymore.

358
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,484
Hal.

359
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,237
Michigan.

360
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,603
- Stop!
- Quit struggling!

361
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:50,306
Stop! Get off of me!
I swear, if you don't let go of that bag,

362
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,308
I will shoot you!
Leave me alone! It's all we have left!

363
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:54,143
Please!
I <i>will</i> shoot you!

364
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:55,644
No!
Do you understand?!

365
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,447
Every store within 20 miles
has been picked clean!

366
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:00,582
Please! Please!

367
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:14,295
Run!

368
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,630
If I see you again,
I'll use this!

369
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,491
My name's Tom.

370
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:49,565
I'm not gonna hurt you.

371
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,568
I just wanted
to see your bike.

372
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,203
No! It's mine!

373
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:55,338
Hey! Hey!

374
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,573
Stop it!

375
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,508
I'm not letting you
steal it!

376
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:03,211
Come on. Come on.

377
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

378
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,651
Look, I know
that you're scared.

379
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:16,392
But I'm not
gonna hurt you.

380
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:18,260
If he comes back,
we don't want to be here.

381
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,698
We had a few cans of soup.
That's all.

382
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:25,702
Go ahead!
Take it and leave me alone!

383
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:33,710
You hang on to it.

384
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:42,721
I'm on my way
into Boston.

385
00:26:42,755 --> 00:26:45,690
I left some people there --
friends and family.

386
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,225
They can help us.

387
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:51,562
Bike's yours, but I sure
would love to borrow it.

388
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:52,863
You can come with me.

389
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:56,333
Boston?
That's hundreds of miles.

390
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:59,203
Oh, I know it.

391
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,706
I've been on foot
for weeks already.

392
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,910
So...what do you say?

393
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,748
Just remember
it's a loan.

394
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:14,452
And only
as long as I say.

395
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:18,923
And only if we don't
leave her like that.

396
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,595
Fair enough.

397
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,258
Captain.

398
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:47,961
I'll have the med bus packed
and ready to go in a half-hour.

399
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:49,228
How's Tom?

400
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,631
I need to know what happened
to him on that ship.

401
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,666
Ben and Lourdes are with him.
He's weak.

402
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,268
But if we have to move,
I think it's all right.

403
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,574
Dr. Glass!

404
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:07,582
Do you know anything
about scotch?

405
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,921
Some's good,
some's better.

406
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:12,989
Why?

407
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,926
I found this...

408
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,062
couple of stops back.

409
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:23,633
It's a Glenfiddich.

410
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,068
30 years old.

411
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,837
Someone
has good tastes.

412
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,973
If we have to run,
it's just dead weight.

413
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:33,611
Seemed like it'd be a shame
to waste it.

414
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,090
Cheers.

415
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:48,961
Cheers.

416
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,207
Maybe it's a sign --
Tom coming back.

417
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,076
How do you mean?

418
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,379
I mean that if I hadn't let him
get on that ship...

419
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,884
...if he'd been here,
he would have warned me

420
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:18,287
that we were
pushing our luck.

421
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:22,158
He would have warned me.

422
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:25,294
But he wasn't here.

423
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:27,897
Second-guessing doesn't change
where we are.

424
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:33,636
I think you're wrong.

425
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,172
I remember something
he told me once,

426
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:39,175
about making the price
of the occupation so high,

427
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:41,343
the aliens have to leave.

428
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,712
That was the idea.

429
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:48,249
He would have said your strategy
is risky but worth it.

430
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:51,019
And when he wakes up,

431
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:53,020
he's gonna be proud
we're still fighting.

432
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:57,292
Hell, he might even have
a historical anecdote

433
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:59,294
to put it all
in perspective.

434
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:02,932
Captain.

435
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:05,901
What the hell is this?
Fiberglass.

436
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:07,136
It's light,
it's an insulator,

437
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:08,805
and these warehouses
are full of it.

438
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,073
We wrap our engines
with it,

439
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,175
we'll get a good hour
before it heats through.

440
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,044
I want people going
through every house,

441
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,345
every warehouse
on the block.

442
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,947
We're moving out A.S.A.P.

443
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,248
Dr. Glass?!

444
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,382
Anne?!
Ben?

445
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,384
Anne!

446
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,121
It's my Dad.
Something's wrong.

447
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,890
Let's go.

448
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,426
We're close now.

449
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,795
We got to keep going.

450
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,065
I don't know what happened.
He just started bleeding again.

451
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,803
I must have missed
a fragment.

452
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,071
He feels feverish,
too.

453
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:45,108
We still have a few bottles
of I.V. antibiotic.

454
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,909
Okay.
Okay.

455
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:50,446
I'm sorry, Ben.

456
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:04,461
The school's only a few miles
that way.

457
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,066
But they'd be long gone
by now.

458
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,271
I've been seeing
a lot of airships

459
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:18,141
heading southwest
to Connecticut.

460
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:21,144
Could be
they went that way.

461
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,312
The woman we buried.

462
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,782
That was my mom.

463
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:29,918
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:35,323
You never told me why you
helped me out with that guy.

465
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:41,129
That's what people
are supposed to do.

466
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:43,999
Not anymore.

467
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,168
I don't believe that.

468
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:52,175
And I'd hope that someone
would do the same for <i>my</i> kids.

469
00:31:58,314 --> 00:32:01,283
We were going
into the mountains,

470
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,552
trying to find
a place to hide.

471
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:06,855
I don't think that we can hide
from them anymore.

472
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,861
My middle son, Ben --
you'd like him.

473
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:15,028
He's about your age.

474
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:16,063
He's dead.

475
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:18,499
No.

476
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,969
They're all dead.
That's what happens now.

477
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:25,205
The aliens find you,
and they kill you.

478
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:27,507
Unless
we kill them first.

479
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:30,978
Come on.
We got to keep going.

480
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:34,381
This engine-blanket thing
better work,

481
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,850
or we'll be wearing
this truck for a hat.

482
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:38,251
That's another thing.

483
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,554
When the hell did I become
a damn baggage handler?

484
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:43,223
I was gonna say
it kind of suits you.

485
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:45,558
Yeah, well, I'll tell you,
if I had any brains,

486
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,560
I'd steal one
of these rice rockets

487
00:32:47,594 --> 00:32:49,929
and kiss Weaver's glorious
revolution goodbye.

488
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,831
Yeah, you try that,
and your brains

489
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:53,899
will be scattered
across two states, Pope!

490
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,903
You really are a true believer,
aren't you?

491
00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:58,338
In killing Skitters,
yeah.

492
00:32:58,372 --> 00:33:00,341
Yeah, well, that's pretty,
but, uh, you know,

493
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,844
there's no law that says
you got to do it with me.

494
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,246
My merry ex-band of outlaws
wasted your buddy,

495
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:08,851
and yet here you are,
Tonto to my lone ranger.

496
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,520
Well, first, I think you got
that "Lone Ranger" thing

497
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:13,089
a bit backward.

498
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:16,392
And don't think
that I forgot about Click...

499
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:17,993
or when you patched me up

500
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,529
after we went in
on that alien structure.

501
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:22,264
I can't make sense
of either.

502
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:23,398
We all make mistakes.

503
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:25,533
Captain!

504
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:26,967
Captain!

505
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,969
Hey, Cap! Incoming!

506
00:33:29,037 --> 00:33:31,405
Anthony, where's Cap?
Right there.

507
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,607
Captain, we got a Mech convoy
about a mile away.

508
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:36,376
They're straight east.
They're coming this way.

509
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,381
We move that med bus now,
Tom's not gonna make it.

510
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,123
Convoy goes!

511
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,959
Medical stays with Dr. Glass
until she can stabilize Tom.

512
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,128
I need four volunteers
to stay with the bus

513
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:54,530
in case
the Skitters show.

514
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:56,299
You know I'm in.
Sounds good.

515
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,567
Make that three.

516
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:58,968
Four.

517
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,470
Gather all the ammo
you can carry.

518
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,305
Dai's got the map.
We wait for you 20 miles out.

519
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:06,575
Stay safe.

520
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,312
We're moving out, people!
Five minutes!

521
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:27,363
All right, guys,
we got incoming.

522
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,965
Okay,
we're gonna go dark.

523
00:34:33,136 --> 00:34:37,239
There's something there.

524
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:39,241
I just
can't get ahold of it.

525
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,411
All right, guys,
we're gonna lay low

526
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:44,613
and hope the Mechs
pass us by.

527
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,717
Nobody shoot
unless I give the order, okay?

528
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,086
Hey.

529
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,254
Okay?

530
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,168
Get down!

531
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,669
Not yet.

532
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,306
Lourdes,
we have to hold him steady.

533
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:22,252
I think I've got it.

534
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,025
Not much to it.

535
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,563
It was enough.
We can close now.

536
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,242
I think they're gone.

537
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:49,046
Oh, God.

538
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:01,528
I think that was
our lucky day, right?

539
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:04,798
Come on. Let's go.

540
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:12,674
Hey, good job, man.

541
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,843
This is bad.
We need to keep riding.

542
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:21,845
It's close.

543
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,747
I don't want to
be here anymore!

544
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:26,750
That's Mech fire.

545
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:28,985
That's a shotgun.

546
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,520
That means
there's people.

547
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:32,556
You said when we started
it was just a loan.

548
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,024
Got to see
who's out there.

549
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:35,492
I'll come back
when I know it's safe.

550
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:38,361
My mom wanted to show me
the mountains.

551
00:37:38,396 --> 00:37:41,498
I'm going there.

552
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,633
For her.

553
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,369
I hope you find
your family.

554
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,440
Cease fire!
Save your ammo!

555
00:37:52,576 --> 00:37:57,546
We got eight minutes, tops,
before those beamers respond!

556
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,049
So let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Weaver?

557
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:41,594
Dad?

558
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:01,492
You're still here.

559
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:14,462
I never left, Tom.

560
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,201
You gave us
quite a scare.

561
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,969
You feeling all right?

562
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:25,906
Better.

563
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,511
My boys?

564
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,082
They're fine.

565
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:38,421
I should have
had faith...

566
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:41,358
that you'd come back
for them.

567
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:44,027
Not just for them.

568
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:05,951
Ben.

569
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:13,192
It's okay.

570
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:17,195
Dad, I, uh...

571
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,297
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know.

572
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:23,701
It was an accident.
Come here.

573
00:40:25,404 --> 00:40:28,206
It doesn't matter.

574
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:30,442
All that matters now
is that we're together.

575
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:34,679
Dad!

576
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:37,015
Oh. Ben, don't --

577
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:40,518
Look at what the cat
dragged in.

578
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:45,222
I missed you, old man.

579
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,692
I missed you, too.

580
00:40:47,726 --> 00:40:50,261
I missed
all of you.

581
00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:12,186
Tom.

582
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:15,122
- How you feeling?
- Like it's good to be home.

583
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:18,365
Captain,
we should talk.

584
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:21,327
Plenty of time for that.
You just get better first.

585
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:25,209
A lot of people
will be glad to see you.

586
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,242
Welcome back, Tom.

587
00:41:29,276 --> 00:41:31,239
Thanks, Dai.

588
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:38,672
Professor
happen to mention

589
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:42,412
how he, uh, busted out
of Skitter Central?

590
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:44,583
He did not.

591
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:50,253
Man strolls
onto an alien rocket,

592
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:54,792
only to just come waltzing back
three months later.

593
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,927
I don't know
about you, Cap,

594
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:00,465
but I'd be throwing a flag
on that play.

595
