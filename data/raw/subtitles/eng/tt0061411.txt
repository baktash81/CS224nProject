00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,533
Next slide.

2
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,505
The potter wasp.

3
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,258
If you look at his black head,
we see that for both sexes...

4
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,061
there is a golden spot at
the base of the antennae.

5
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:06,304
In the female, there is a golden
spot at the base of the mandibles...

6
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:10,193
and the male stands out
because he has the mandibles...

7
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:12,207
and the antennae entirely yellow.

8
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,203
In the male, the last joint
ends in the form of a hook.

9
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,237
We call her "Potter" because
the female gives her nest...

10
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:24,493
the shape of a vase widened at the base...

11
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,836
as a potter would do on his wheel.

12
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:31,478
This vase is short and wide
and without any opening.

13
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,301
I was telling you about
the moth last week.

14
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,066
Next slide, please.

15
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:43,408
This specimen represents
the normal form of a moth.

16
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:47,914
Its pinkish-gray color is
sometimes mixed with green tones.

17
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,868
These variations are
linked to the modifications...

18
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:53,968
which sometimes occur
between the upper and lower parts.

19
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:04,053
This specimen appears
in May and June.

20
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:09,399
It is found in the branches of
lemon trees or all around them.

21
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:16,001
Good evening, Inspector.
- Good evening, Granger.

22
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:17,709
I can enter ?

23
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,665
Is it possible to see
Professor Mallinger?

24
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,256
I fear the timing is not right.

25
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:29,089
The professor gives a lecture every
Thursday to the students of the university.

26
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,402
My presence will not disturb him and I will be
able to see him at the end of his conference.

27
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,151
- Like you want. Give me your hat.
- Thank you.

28
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:42,200
The Hawk Privet butterfly.

29
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,452
As its name suggests, it is on
privets that we find the latter.

30
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,920
It is seen in July and August on
the branches of the tree it feeds on.

31
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:55,445
It also feeds on other plants
such as lilac, ash and bay leaf.

32
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:57,847
They are often
attacked by ichneumons.

33
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:01,936
The southern part of England is
the main habitat for these butterflies.

34
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:05,656
Although it is found
in central and southern

35
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,194
Europe, as well as
in China and Japan.

36
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:11,039
This concludes today's conference.

37
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,470
Thank you for your attention.

38
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:22,715
If you have any questions, I
will do my best to answer them.

39
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,890
Can someone please
turn the gas up?

40
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,418
Inspector.

41
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,037
- Professor.
- I did not expect to see you here.

42
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:44,951
Refreshment, gentlemen?

43
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:47,123
- Good evening, Miss Clare.
- That's very sweet.

44
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,083
- Good evening. - How are you ?

45
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,513
You must be thirsty.

46
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:53,848
- I hope my presence does not bother you?
- Absolutely not.

47
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,012
- Are you interested in entomology?
- It could be, it's fascinating.

48
00:07:58,112 --> 00:07:59,574
I'm glad you like it.

49
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,023
The real reason for my visit is...

50
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:25,577
that I would like to ask you a
few questions about young Fisher.

51
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,881
Yes, young Fisher...

52
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,476
What a pain, a brilliant young man.
He was one of the best.

53
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,864
- Yes it was...
- What is the conclusion of the prosecution?

54
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,582
Killed by one or
more unknown people.

55
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:47,976
- What an idiot !
- I didn't think she would pass out!

56
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,892
Who is the manager ?

57
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:54,902
I didn't think she would react that way.
It was just a joke.

58
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:56,897
Out of my house!

59
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,911
- Bring me some water.
- Of course.

60
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:07,257
Excuse me, your sergeant
is asking to see you.

61
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,297
- Now ?
- He says it's urgent.

62
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,294
Very good.

63
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,439
- What's the matter, sergeant?
- Another, sir.

64
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,820
Be careful, there is blood everywhere.

65
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:28,071
- Call the professor.
- Yes sir.

66
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,525
- What is happening?
- A young man is injured,

67
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,762
I think he's still alive.

68
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,172
Tell Granger to bring my kit.

69
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:46,156
Inspector, please step aside.

70
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:02,385
Too late. He is dead.

71
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,195
Tea ?

72
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,012
- Is there any sugar?
- Two spoons.

73
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,394
I already told you not
to spill any in the saucer.

74
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,347
- Is the doctor still here?
- Yes, for almost an hour.

75
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:29,014
Did you find
anything in the moor?

76
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:32,597
No.
We will have to wait until tomorrow.

77
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,226
Should I organize a hunt?

78
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,983
Yes sergeant, do that.

79
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,650
Why is it so hot in here?
This place is an oven.

80
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,810
- How is he ? - Raving mad.

81
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,560
- Poor Joe.
- You know him ?

82
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,487
- Joe Trigg? For years.
- Has he had this kind of crisis before?

83
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,154
- Not that I know.
- He drinks ?

84
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,193
A few beers.

85
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:58,168
You know him.

86
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,165
You have taken his
cab more than once.

87
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:03,071
- He's a quiet man.
- Now he's a crazy man.

88
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:04,321
He will have to be taken to the asylum.

89
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:07,665
The only witness to the
murder and he's losing his mind.

90
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,197
- Did he say something coherent?
- No.

91
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,835
In his delusions, he speaks
of a species of creature.

92
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:14,407
Can I see it?

93
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,466
Of course.
But I don't think it will help you.

94
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:17,576
We never know.

95
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,954
Take this from me.

96
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:33,845
Joe, what happened?

97
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:38,761
There was a horrible
creature with huge eyes.

98
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:42,314
And wings, Inspector...

99
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,674
Leave me alone.

100
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:46,759
Calm down. What did she do ?
She flew away?

101
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:51,236
Yes, I saw his wings, they were
like that. Horrible black wings.

102
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:55,224
And his eyes !!!... Please,
leave me alone. No !

103
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:59,570
He is delirious.
Calm down, Joe, calm down.

104
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:11,200
- It's cold, can I bring you another one?
- No, it's going to be fine, thank you.

105
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:14,116
Did he say something?

106
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,791
No, the doctor is right.

107
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:21,905
I would like your opinion, doctor. I
wonder if he could be the murderer.

108
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:25,074
What if he suffered
from a split personality?

109
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:27,069
Holy spirit at times and
crazy to bind to others?

110
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:29,795
Even if he did, I don't think
he had the strength to do it.

111
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:32,520
Have you examined the
victim's wounds, Inspector?

112
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,663
Not yet.

113
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,253
I suggest we go and
examine the corpse.

114
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:40,255
- It's not a very pleasant sight.
- I imagine it.

115
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:53,261
Good evening.
Can you bring me something?

116
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:56,393
No. We want to see the body
we brought to you an hour ago.

117
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,637
Ah, yes, that one.
He's very interesting.

118
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,606
I installed it there, very
close to the window.

119
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,141
The most interesting, I always
put them near the window.

120
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,372
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

121
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,732
With these, the
same cannot be said.

122
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,720
Oh, what a mess.

123
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,652
You have arrived in the middle of a meal.
I have pie tonight.

124
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:20,191
It's still better
than cold meat.

125
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,822
- Do you want some?
- No thanks.

126
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:27,949
I can offer you beer.
Here, it is very fresh.

127
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:32,615
He's practically drained of his blood.
A normal injury wouldn't do that.

128
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,863
I find that weird...

129
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,075
It appears to have been scratched all over.

130
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,836
This is the sixth that they bring to me.

131
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,546
And all are in the same condition.

132
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:49,178
Serious injuries to
the skull, severely

133
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,054
damaged chest, and ribs
under extreme pressure.

134
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,874
But they are clean.
They have no more blood to lose.

135
00:14:55,974 --> 00:15:01,014
So take a look at number six.
This is a spectacle.

136
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:04,244
He was run over by
a cab in Piccadilly.

137
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,878
A lot of blood, really a lot.

138
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,245
Are they all like that?

139
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:12,130
Yes, the same pattern.
And without any motive.

140
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:15,884
Theft is not the reason.
All the victims are men.

141
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,415
What could have
caused these sores?

142
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,804
They may have been
inflicted by an animal.

143
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,328
By the way, our cat has
been missing for a week.

144
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:28,297
Thanks for your help.
Good night.

145
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:30,288
Good evening, Inspector.
Good evening, doctor.

146
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:36,116
Hey?...
For the cat, it was a joke.

147
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:39,273
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

148
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,417
oh, is that comfy?

149
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,448
Here are more of those things, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

150
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,652
- Hello.
- Hello sir.

151
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:28,091
- Clues ?
- There is no trace.

152
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,656
It was certainly there
that it happened, come on.

153
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,790
We call it "the lovers' walk". Although
nothing is happening here at night.

154
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,168
Look.

155
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,040
There is something else that seems
to me to have neither a tail nor a head.

156
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:50,001
The place is riddled with things like that.

157
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,576
- Do you know what it can be?
- Not the slightest idea, sir.

158
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,230
It's everywhere.
A few hanging from the bushes.

159
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,358
I'll take some.
Put them there, please.

160
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:04,940
Thanks, Sergeant.

161
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:08,152
I'm going to go to Clare House
to see Professor Mallinger.

162
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,645
Keep looking. - Very good.

163
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:35,503
Who is it ?

164
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,484
- Me, sir. - What do you want ?

165
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,446
I told you not to disturb me.
- The inspector is here.

166
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:41,911
Tell him I'm out.

167
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:46,197
I'm sorry, I fell badly. It's very
nice to receive me, anyway.

168
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,477
It's nothing.
What can I do for you ?

169
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,190
- I think you can help me.
- I'm going to try.

170
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:55,396
Is it possible that a large bird
is roaming free in the area?

171
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,583
Why are you asking me that?

172
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:01,842
The coachman who found
the man murdered last night...

173
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,758
keeps repeating a crazy story.

174
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:06,026
In his delirium, he swears
to have seen a huge bird...

175
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,921
spinning around the body.

176
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,958
There are no eagles
around here, of course.

177
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:14,102
Eagles are birds typical
of mountainous regions.

178
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:16,310
An eagle may have
escaped from a zoo,

179
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,788
but in this case, I would know.

180
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,590
Could an eagle attack a human?

181
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,356
There have been attacks
on mountaineers...

182
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,616
because they believed their
children were threatened.

183
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,989
They say they attacked each
other and allegedly even abducted a

184
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:36,431
child, but it is quite impossible
that an eagle could inflict...

185
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,858
injuries to a man in his prime.
That does not make any sense.

186
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,040
I know there are a
lot of species, but...

187
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,130
How big would an
eagle's talons be?

188
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,676
Come with me.

189
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:12,782
Here is one. "Eagle Chrysaetos".
A golden eagle.

190
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:14,625
A magnificent specimen.

191
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,601
Those claws and that beak
could do a lot of damage.

192
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:20,522
To an inanimate man, perhaps.

193
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,844
But not to a young man
defending himself, I don't think so.

194
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:29,084
Why do you give so much importance
to the delusions of a madman?

195
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:30,963
It is all I have.

196
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:32,640
Is that so.

197
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,525
Except that.

198
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,651
Where did you find them?

199
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,645
We found them at
the scene of the crime.

200
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,934
There are plenty of them on
the ground and on the bushes.

201
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:55,454
Do you have any
idea what this can be?

202
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,340
At first glance,
I can't tell you.

203
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:04,035
If you will allow me to examine
them more carefully in the laboratory...

204
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,506
Of course. I count on you.

205
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,132
If you find out what
it is, let me know.

206
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:11,978
Yes of course.

207
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,627
Goodbye, professor.

208
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,491
I will teach you, me...

209
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,298
Are you going to eat, yes or no?

210
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:41,280
Come on, here, eat.
I'll train you!

211
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:43,973
Granger!

212
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:47,275
How many times should I tell
you not to harass this poor bird?

213
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,343
I was feeding him and he attacked me.
- Outside !

214
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,540
Quiet, quiet, calm down.

215
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,785
- Did you get it, Culpepper?
- Yes sir.

216
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,510
So, it is understood, we
will put in the report that we...

217
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,797
consider these attacks to
be the work of a wild creature,

218
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:07,279
maybe a bird of prey.

219
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:10,987
If we want to avoid the panic triggered if we
learn that these crimes are due to a madman.

220
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:14,849
This will give grain to the
newspapers and distract their attention.

221
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,626
Jackson, I want a
section of your division...

222
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:20,709
pretend you're looking for a bird.

223
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,292
Hopefully the murderer will let his
guard down and make a mistake.

224
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:26,168
- Very good.
- Something else ?

225
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:27,458
I do not believe.

226
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:28,886
Good thanks.

227
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,970
POLICE STATION.

228
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,253
THE POLICE IS LOOKING
FOR A BIRD OF PREY.

229
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:42,087
- Good evening.
- Yes ?

230
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:44,161
Could you show me
the way to Clare House?

231
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,036
Do you know the area?
Do you know where Common is?

232
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,257
I'm afraid not, I'm a foreigner.

233
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:53,242
It is more difficult then, but turn right
on exiting, follow the road for a league...

234
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:54,622
Excuse me.

235
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:59,039
- Looking for the road to Clare House?
- Yes.

236
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:02,170
- Professor Mallinger's house?
- Yes, I'm coming to see him.

237
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,252
It's good.
Do you know the teacher?

238
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:09,044
We have never met.
May I know why this interests you?

239
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,128
There has been a murder in the
district and an investigation is underway,

240
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,070
That's why
foreigners interest us.

241
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,248
Yes of course.

242
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:18,525
You should know that I arrived
in England yesterday from Africa.

243
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,324
I am a naturalist, and I have to
give the doctor some live specimens.

244
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,358
- Do you want to know more?
- Don't be offended, I'm doing my duty.

245
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,649
Of course.

246
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:30,531
Very good sir.
Clare House... Let's see.

247
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:33,647
It's not very far,
but it's hard to find.

248
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,938
- Smith!
- Yes, sergeant.

249
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,490
- Are the duty officers out?
- They're leaving now.

250
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:40,027
Tell Agent Baraclagh
I want to see him.

251
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes, sergeant.

252
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,769
One of my men will take you there.

253
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:43,915
Thank you.

254
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:47,782
Sergeant?

255
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:50,591
- Are you patrolling the moor today?
- Yes, sergeant.

256
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,557
Take this young man to Clare House.

257
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:54,235
- It will be my pleasure, sir.
- Well.

258
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,279
- My agent will be waiting for you outside.
- Thank you.

259
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:00,439
Hope you catch the culprit.
- Thank you.

260
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,943
Sir will be delighted to
know that you have arrived.

261
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,262
He has spent the day waiting for you.
- Are my crates there?

262
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:13,969
Yes, it all happened this morning.

263
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,099
Well.

264
00:24:15,524 --> 00:24:17,344
Would you like something to drink ?
- Yes thanks.

265
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:19,148
- Madeira or Porto?
- A Madeira.

266
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,847
Was there no breakage?
- Not that I know.

267
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,810
The professor deposited
them in his laboratory.

268
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,672
He wouldn't open
anything until you arrived.

269
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:29,865
Well.

270
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,176
Thank you.

271
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,390
They say there was a murder.

272
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,833
A man's body was
found on the moor.

273
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,273
- That's what the police told me.
- Please excuse me...

274
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:48,423
I will announce your
arrival to the gentleman.

275
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,336
Very good.

276
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,419
Mr. Britewell?

277
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:15,200
- I'm Clare Mallinger.
- Mrs. Mallinger?

278
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,969
No, Miss Mallinger.
The teacher is my father.

279
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:21,795
Excuse me.
But I don't know the professor.

280
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,752
I've heard so much about you.
It's like I know you.

281
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,029
- Miss Mallinger...
- Call me Clare.

282
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:28,160
Thank you.

283
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,912
Sit down and tell
me about Africa.

284
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,159
- How is ? - It's very hot.

285
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:40,292
This can be seen.
You have a fantastic tan.

286
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,190
The point is, I got a
little too much sun.

287
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,290
We come from Limpopo,
I spent several days there.

288
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:50,527
I would like to go to Africa.
I like hot weather.

289
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,617
I am sure that I would be in my place in
the middle of the jungle and the swamps.

290
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:57,691
I don't think so, it's disgusting.

291
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:02,661
Snakes, crocodiles,
stinging or biting insects.

292
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:05,943
- And butterflies?
- Many.

293
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:10,532
It was the reason for my trip.
Capture live specimens.

294
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:13,969
How long are you going to stay?

295
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:17,109
I don't know, it
depends on Dr Mallinger.

296
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:19,887
At least stay until
tomorrow night.

297
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,181
We are having a party.

298
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,055
You will have to excuse
me, I have no clothes for this.

299
00:26:24,156 --> 00:26:25,512
I always travel light.

300
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:27,637
It's okay, it's not
that kind of party.

301
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:30,177
The students my
father lectures to...

302
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,551
perform a piece.

303
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,843
- At the local theater?
- Not here. We lend them this room.

304
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:36,896
And tomorrow night is the general.

305
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,140
You will come ?

306
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,615
- Are you going to play, too?
- There is no role for me.

307
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,389
Too bad.

308
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:46,146
You will see.
You will be surprised.

309
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:49,176
- Romeo and Juliet ?
- No! Nothing of that.

310
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,301
Mr. Britewell!

311
00:26:50,646 --> 00:26:52,837
I'm sorry, I wasn't
there when you arrived.

312
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:55,503
- Doctor!
- I see you meet my daughter.

313
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:57,795
- Yes, she's delicious.
- Did you offer him a drink?

314
00:26:57,895 --> 00:26:59,386
Your butler already did.

315
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,934
Your daughter told me that she
was also interested in entomology.

316
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,716
Yes of course.

317
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,539
I can't wait to see what
you have brought me.

318
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:12,337
When I received your cases, I had a
hard time not opening them immediately.

319
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,470
Did they resist the trip?

320
00:27:14,806 --> 00:27:17,838
When I delivered them to the
carrier, they were in perfect condition.

321
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:22,285
Britewell, I was very interested
in what you said in your last letter.

322
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:25,118
This chrysalis
that you refer to,

323
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:27,754
how long does it take after
incubation of the caterpillar...

324
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,952
Don't answer. Father, this
poor boy has to go up to his room.

325
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:32,909
He is exhausted from his trip.

326
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:35,201
There will always be time
to talk about this after dinner.

327
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,587
I'll show you to your room.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

328
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,668
They are gorgeous, especially this one.

329
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,924
- Lepidoptera Afrikana.
- Yes.

330
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:02,625
It is nothing special.

331
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:05,666
I am surprised that you are not
interested in more rare subjects.

332
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,250
No, this is the one I want.

333
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,129
What matters is the size.

334
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:11,918
Why ?

335
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,284
Do you want to
create a giant species?

336
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,300
Superb!

337
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:20,563
Do not touch ! Leave that!

338
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,860
How dare you !

339
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:24,340
If you had opened it, I would
have wasted years of work.

340
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,495
It is only an incubator. I would
only have opened the lid for a second.

341
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,037
A second would have been enough.
Go away !

342
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:34,595
If the temperature dropped by half a degree,
the whole experience would be wasted.

343
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:37,129
Why? What's in there?

344
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:41,740
Dear friend, I'm
sorry, it's my fault.

345
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,681
It's the heat that oppresses me.

346
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,842
A storm is coming.

347
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,182
It should work!

348
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:06,310
The heart is the pump
that brings the flow of life

349
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:11,339
If it stops beating, it
cannot be restored!

350
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:15,967
I will have tried everything!

351
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:17,693
Leave that !

352
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,019
We have to start all over again.

353
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,046
To forget everything.

354
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,373
I spoke with the gravedigger this morning.

355
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:27,699
He told me the next
body will be cooler!

356
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:31,150
He already said that last time!
and what have we received?

357
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,754
A man who has been deceased for 3 days...

358
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:41,385
and his skeleton was damaged!
I need a perfect specimen.

359
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,235
We have to find one...

360
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:47,238
You have to get
spasms and contactions.

361
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:53,192
Who is it ?
- Someone is looking for you outside.

362
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,995
He says his name is Stockwart.

363
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,021
Stockwart.

364
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:00,147
Well.

365
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:03,875
It certainly brings
me another victim.

366
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:08,203
Come over here Stockwart.

367
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:20,740
This man had an accident.
He passed away two hours ago.

368
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:21,989
Two o'clock?!

369
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,891
Two hours, but even
though he's dead...

370
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:29,821
I think he still retains
all the colors of life.

371
00:31:30,546 --> 00:31:32,047
Lift it up and put it on the table.

372
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:49,989
Strangled, this man
has been strangled!

373
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:51,515
That's it, young man.

374
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,665
But how did you go about
removing the body from the morgue?

375
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:58,269
Well, he didn't exactly
get to the morgue.

376
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:01,997
We could say that
poor young man...

377
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:07,026
had an accident just
as we crossed his path.

378
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,652
What luck, isn't it?

379
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,978
Drop the ten pounds young man!

380
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:12,303
This means that you...

381
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:17,733
Stupid questions
get stupid answers.

382
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,159
It's perfect.

383
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,486
Good game.

384
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:24,912
Good game.

385
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:31,342
Now...

386
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:32,868
connect the batteries.

387
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:36,896
Give me the electrodes.

388
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:38,922
Prepare yourselves...

389
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,651
Turn the switch.

390
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,180
More power.

391
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:53,509
Stronger !

392
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,637
Even stronger !

393
00:32:58,962 --> 00:32:59,963
Again!

394
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:02,289
More power!

395
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,518
It's impossible !

396
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:09,344
It does not work.

397
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:15,875
Look !

398
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,301
Rigor Mortis.

399
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:24,832
This happens when the death
goes back at least to twelve hours!

400
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:29,861
Open quickly, a tragedy
has happened to my mistress.

401
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:37,820
The train, a terrible accident.
Miss Josephine, your daughter... Dead!

402
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,862
My poor mistress!

403
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,197
Where is she ?

404
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:46,926
They brought her home,
poor thing. So pretty !

405
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:49,509
What a tragedy !

406
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,718
Outside, get out!

407
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:20,258
Clear the table.

408
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:27,471
Quick, raise his head.

409
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,318
She's still hot.
Connect the batteries!

410
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:38,005
No!

411
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,599
- Do what I say !
- I won't let you do that...

412
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:43,532
I will kill you.

413
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:46,422
This is madness ! No!

414
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:48,640
- Obey!
- Okay.

415
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,348
Okay.

416
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,398
Pass me the electrodes.

417
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:01,872
Contact !

418
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:07,297
More power!

419
00:35:11,057 --> 00:35:12,638
More power!

420
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:15,344
More power!

421
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:19,147
More ! Even more ! More !

422
00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:21,033
This is madness !

423
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:25,242
More power! She's moving !

424
00:35:26,837 --> 00:35:31,003
Maximum power !
Stronger ! Stronger !

425
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,955
Dead... both dead! My God !

426
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:55,124
It's blocked.

427
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:16,689
Fantastic.

428
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,116
Congratulations, it was great.

429
00:36:20,216 --> 00:36:21,953
The theater has
lost a great artist.

430
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:24,512
- It's not what you expected, is it?
- Not really.

431
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:29,783
How warm, I feel bad.
Let's go out and breathe some fresh air.

432
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,941
I'll expect you outside in ten minutes.

433
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,815
I'm going to change.

434
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:42,530
Galvanization! It is an idea !

435
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,001
It might help us!

436
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,204
Granger?

437
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:50,356
Tomorrow, let's try to recover one
of those machines from Wimshurst!

438
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:52,151
There is a place where...

439
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:07,865
Congratulations.

440
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:09,928
Oh, thank you very much.

441
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:12,665
Excellent piece. Who wrote it?
- Actually, it's me!

442
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:18,829
Awesome! Where does this idea
of ​​galvanic stimulation come from?

443
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,341
Pure invention!

444
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:38,723
Not here, let's get away from the house.

445
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,841
Look! What a beautiful moon.

446
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:04,987
Doesn't that make you romantic?

447
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,374
I don't need the
moon to feel romantic.

448
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,528
No no !

449
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,030
You have to catch me first.

450
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,694
Close your eyes.

451
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:16,987
Cover your eyes with your hands.

452
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,192
Do not cheat.

453
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,064
Hey!

454
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,746
Hey!

455
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,051
I'm over here.

456
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,712
This way.

457
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:39,743
It's all right, my boy.

458
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:40,885
You...

459
00:40:43,837 --> 00:40:45,095
Speak louder.

460
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,581
- Têt...
- What are you saying?

461
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:50,481
Skull.

462
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:52,954
What does it mean ?

463
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:58,387
There is a doctor nearby.
I'll take you there. Come.

464
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:54,433
There was an accident.
Tell your master.

465
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:03,304
Granger, have you seen Mr. BriteWell?

466
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:05,249
No, Miss Clare.

467
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:13,408
If you hurry you
can still save him.

468
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:21,376
I can't do anything anymore, he's dead.

469
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,231
Did you know him?
Was it one of your students?

470
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,801
I've never seen him before.

471
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,186
I'll go get the police car.

472
00:42:36,365 --> 00:42:40,844
No, that's all he said.
"skull", nothing else.

473
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:43,893
Some say strange
things before they die.

474
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:47,373
It doesn't mean nothing.

475
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:49,076
Do you believe that?

476
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:52,538
I saw that you are taking
your vacation next week.

477
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,449
You should hand the matter over
to a colleague in the meantime.

478
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:57,832
I just like to postpone
them if you don't mind.

479
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:03,653
Maybe it would be good to
leave for a bit. It's so recent.

480
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,538
The trees do not
yet reveal the forest.

481
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:09,542
- Does that mean that you withdraw the case from me?
- No, my dear friend.

482
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:11,667
I want to continue.

483
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,370
Your daughter will be disappointed.

484
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,385
I'll send him to
relatives in Sussex.

485
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:18,731
- I'll take him to the train.
- Of course.

486
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:20,779
There is nothing more to say.
Keep me informed.

487
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:21,930
I will do it.

488
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:11,861
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

489
00:44:12,154 --> 00:44:14,511
It's nothing, we have time.

490
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:16,891
I'll be back in two hours.

491
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:19,259
I would like you to do
something right away.

492
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,296
Find the name of the last victim,
I want all to know about him.

493
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,268
I know who it is. He lived in
Clare House with the Mallinger's.

494
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:28,135
Recently arrived from Africa,
he was a collector of insects.

495
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,196
How do you know all this?

496
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:32,616
He stopped at the police
station to ask for directions...

497
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:33,954
and we chatted.

498
00:44:34,066 --> 00:44:35,512
To Clare House, quickly.

499
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,994
Stay here, Meg.
I will enter from behind.

500
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,284
Don't be too long.

501
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,255
Granger?

502
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,982
Are you there, Granger?

503
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,043
- Police station !
- But I'm going to miss my train!

504
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:19,964
- You'll take the next one.
- It was the last!

505
00:49:20,064 --> 00:49:21,730
You will be leaving tomorrow.
Quick!

506
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:27,107
Injuries to the face have no
relation to the cause of death.

507
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:31,311
The fatal wound was made
at least three hours after these.

508
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:33,848
- Could he have made them himself?
- Impossible.

509
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:38,226
The spinal injury was done
with a sharp object, and

510
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:40,685
by someone who has a
great knowledge of anatomy.

511
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:44,947
I think he knew too much.
We killed him to shut him down.

512
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:52,741
- Hello, sergeant.
- Hello, Smiler.

513
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:55,998
- How's the job going?
- It's dead.

514
00:49:58,547 --> 00:50:00,088
Did you eat onions again?

515
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:02,294
I have to see the inspector.

516
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,198
Do the wounds resemble
those of other victims?

517
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:07,462
Absolutely.

518
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:11,935
Excuse me. It took a while for me to
contact the servants at Clare House.

519
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,981
I found the cook and the maid.
They are at the police station.

520
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,566
Fine, I’m going.

521
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:34,110
It was the biggest surprise of my life.

522
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,949
We received one month's
payment for any notice...

523
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:38,449
and we were told to leave.

524
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,836
- What do you think is the reason?
- I do not know.

525
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:43,497
When the butler told
me, I fell overwhelmed.

526
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:46,347
- Did the butler warn you?
- Yes.

527
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:51,517
- Did they fire him too?
- I don't know, he didn't say it.

528
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:55,599
He's a strange man, he
has his own way of life.

529
00:50:55,817 --> 00:50:58,012
You could hardly see
him in the service room.

530
00:50:58,112 --> 00:51:01,148
For me strange things
happened in this house.

531
00:51:01,697 --> 00:51:02,732
What do you think?

532
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:08,830
I don't know, but there was something
behind the room at the green door.

533
00:51:08,956 --> 00:51:12,623
No one entered but
him, not even to clean up.

534
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:17,796
Do you have any idea where
Professor Mallinger might have gone?

535
00:51:18,424 --> 00:51:19,492
No sir.

536
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:22,925
Sam, the driver drove them to
the station early this morning.

537
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,069
We were ordered to close the
house and leave in the afternoon.

538
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,890
- What station was it?
- Waterloo.

539
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:31,804
Are you sure? - Absolutely.

540
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,807
Not easy to forget.

541
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,468
The mess he made with his luggage!

542
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:39,290
He didn't want them in the
car, he wanted them with him.

543
00:51:39,823 --> 00:51:41,037
How many suitcases did he have?

544
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:45,280
Bah, none.
Just little wooden boxes.

545
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:46,954
He didn't want to be touched.

546
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:50,750
If we only had clients like that.
A half-sovereign for each of us.

547
00:51:51,552 --> 00:51:53,925
What was his destination?
- Upper Higham.

548
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:57,682
Are you sure?
That's the address that was on it.

549
00:51:58,685 --> 00:51:59,798
Upper Higham.

550
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:02,018
- Indeed.
- Thank you.

551
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:09,135
Do we have the pathologist's
report on the human remains found?

552
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:10,815
No, I'm still waiting for him.

553
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:13,280
Is that enough to start
legal proceedings?

554
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,407
Not yet.

555
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,894
First, I want to know
everything about Mallinger...

556
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,728
and the latest
victim, BriteWell.

557
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,236
- You have my full cooperation.
- Thank you sir.

558
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:24,741
I'd like to leave Sergeant Allan
here to do the investigation.

559
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,136
And you?

560
00:52:26,236 --> 00:52:29,006
With your permission, I am leaving
immediately for Upper Higham.

561
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,255
I'll take my daughter, as
if we were going fishing.

562
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:33,959
Is it appropriate?

563
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,541
If your suspicions are
correct, there may be danger.

564
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:40,512
This will be done under your responsibility.
- I understand and accept it.

565
00:52:42,017 --> 00:52:43,592
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

566
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,682
- Pay attention to expenses.
- Yes sir.

567
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,032
What should I do, father?

568
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,203
Nothing special, just enjoy.
We're on holiday.

569
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:08,203
Remember that you don't have
to know that I'm a police officer.

570
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:11,785
I'm a bank manager in Kingston, and
you're my daughter, Miss Thompson.

571
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:14,613
The countryside is magnificent.

572
00:53:14,714 --> 00:53:17,668
Yes, very beautiful.
We will be arriving at the hostel soon.

573
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,917
You are hungry ?

574
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:36,205
Hello.

575
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:37,837
Hello miss.

576
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:40,228
- Who are you ?
- Clem Willis.

577
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:42,270
Where do you live, Clem?

578
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:47,196
In the house by the river.

579
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,319
With your parents?

580
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:52,024
No, they are in the village.

581
00:53:52,124 --> 00:53:54,661
I see them on weekends,
when I finish my job here.

582
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:57,205
I see.

583
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:00,143
Have a nice day, Clem.

584
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:03,214
Have a good day.

585
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,016
We have arrived.

586
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:29,420
Thank you.

587
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:33,735
Thank you, check.

588
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:35,076
At your command, sir.

589
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:38,435
Hello.

590
00:54:38,535 --> 00:54:41,004
- Mr. Thompson? Yes.
This is my daughter, Meg.

591
00:54:41,104 --> 00:54:42,195
Come in.

592
00:54:42,395 --> 00:54:44,307
Can you bring us
the luggage, please?

593
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:45,851
Immediately Sir.

594
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:30,807
I told you not to come in here.

595
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,421
- What do you want ?
- You know it very well.

596
00:55:35,806 --> 00:55:37,264
You still have to be patient.

597
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:41,934
Why did we come
to this damn place?

598
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,841
You know very well why
we had to leave Clare House.

599
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:49,484
Quennell is becoming
dangerous, I think he suspects us.

600
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:52,448
We might even have to get out of here.

601
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,013
- Should I wait a long time?
- Not really.

602
00:55:55,114 --> 00:55:57,436
But I would finish faster
if you left me alone.

603
00:55:57,574 --> 00:55:58,738
Get out of here.

604
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,322
And...

605
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:04,529
don't leave the house.
Stay well inside

606
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:51,618
Good evening, Mr. Thompson.

607
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:53,646
Hope the rooms
are to your liking.

608
00:56:53,746 --> 00:56:55,204
Very comfortable, thank you.

609
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,789
These pikes are magnificent.

610
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,867
Are there still similar
ones in the river?

611
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:03,338
Certainly there are, but
it is not easy to find them.

612
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:05,354
I fished this one
over 5 years ago.

613
00:57:05,454 --> 00:57:08,657
But you might be lucky.
- It's spectacular.

614
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,372
Will the girl take
breakfast with you?

615
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:13,638
Yes please.

616
00:57:13,738 --> 00:57:16,325
We are preparing a lunch
box for the fishermen.

617
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:18,962
They hate wasting time eating.

618
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:21,971
If you let me know in advance
I could prepare one for you.

619
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,306
How nice.
Do you have a lot of guests?

620
00:57:24,406 --> 00:57:27,526
No, for us the season
has just started.

621
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:29,102
There are only two other customers...

622
00:57:29,202 --> 00:57:31,514
Mr. Warrender and his son, of Birmingham.

623
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,814
They have already come last year.
Very good people.

624
00:57:33,914 --> 00:57:36,489
Dinner will be served in five minutes.
Do you want something else?

625
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:38,945
A glass of Madeira,
if it's not too sweet.

626
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:40,990
I have excellent Madeira.
You'll see.

627
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:42,205
Thank you.

628
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:44,591
- Boss, I think about it...
- Yes?

629
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:49,081
An old acquaintance of mine lives
around here, Professor Mallinger.

630
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:50,461
Do you know it?

631
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:54,292
I know almost everyone around here...
Mallinger, is that it?

632
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:55,508
Yes.

633
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:58,600
No...
I don't know anyone by that name.

634
00:57:58,732 --> 00:57:59,810
Thank you.

635
00:58:12,044 --> 00:58:15,320
- Ha, good evening.
- Good evening.

636
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:16,598
Mr. Warrender? - Yes.

637
00:58:16,698 --> 00:58:19,142
- My name is Thompson, nice to see you.
- How are you ?

638
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:21,111
The boss told me
that you are a regular.

639
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:24,148
- Yes, and I hope to come back often.
- Is the fishing good?

640
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:28,077
The fishing is great, but this is
the place. I feel comfortable there.

641
00:58:28,177 --> 00:58:31,342
And the cellar is exceptional
for a place so far from everything.

642
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,305
Your Madeira is served.

643
00:58:33,638 --> 00:58:35,125
- Will you come with me?
- Thank you.

644
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,680
- A second, please.
- Of course.

645
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:42,020
- Here.
- Thank you.

646
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:46,749
- To your health, Mr. Warrender.
- Thank you. Cheers.

647
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:50,191
I have never seen
such large pike.

648
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:54,354
No, are you kidding?
They are fakes.

649
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:56,156
False?

650
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:57,541
Take a closer look.

651
00:58:58,414 --> 00:58:59,839
But why, what a funny idea?

652
00:58:59,997 --> 00:59:02,932
To attract customers.
They all want to fish for similar ones.

653
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,613
- Me, in any case,
they had me well.

654
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,205
Are you going to stay for a long time?

655
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:10,306
I requested a month's
vacation from the bank.

656
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,717
The bank?
Me, I am in construction.

657
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:14,276
Warrender and Edgecombe.

658
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:16,506
We are very well known in the Midlands.

659
00:59:16,606 --> 00:59:17,683
Meg.

660
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:19,645
Mr. Warrender, my daughter.

661
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:21,814
- How are you ? I am delighted.

662
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:23,761
Do you like to fish?

663
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:27,313
I don't fish, but I
love to watch my dad.

664
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,394
My son, no.
Only worms matter to him,

665
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,060
insects and butterflies.
- Excuse me sir.

666
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:34,606
But he's a good boy.
He is doing very well in college.

667
00:59:34,706 --> 00:59:37,742
Here it is.
William, we have company.

668
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:40,243
Mr. Thompson and his lovely daughter.

669
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,970
- How are you ?
- I am delighted.

670
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,080
Your father tells me that
you are an entomologist.

671
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,599
Really?
My father couldn't tell you that.

672
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,339
At home, they call me
"Billy the Critter Catcher".

673
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:53,582
It's just a hobby.
I study science at university.

674
00:59:53,682 --> 00:59:55,208
- Oh yes?
- He's in Oxford.

675
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:57,250
- Dinner is served.
- Thank you.

676
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,676
- Meg, will you serve us?
- Of course, father.

677
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,427
Sit down.

678
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:07,185
- Some soup?
- Thank you.

679
01:00:34,936 --> 01:00:36,638
Look, one more.

680
01:00:41,267 --> 01:00:42,568
I can take it ?

681
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:53,002
Hello.

682
01:00:53,126 --> 01:00:54,428
Did you catch something?

683
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:55,653
No, not much.

684
01:00:57,078 --> 01:00:58,079
It must come from time.

685
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:01,707
They don't seem to have
bad weather next door.

686
01:01:04,033 --> 01:01:06,636
Before it gets dark,
I'll go for a walk.

687
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,462
Alright honey, see you later.

688
01:01:08,786 --> 01:01:11,713
William is on the hill chasing
butterflies, you can find him.

689
01:01:11,813 --> 01:01:12,914
Yes, I'm going.

690
01:01:13,038 --> 01:01:14,139
Goodbye.

691
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:16,089
Are you going fishing?

692
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,891
No, I'd rather see how you do it.

693
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,418
What are you using?

694
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:21,543
Artificial bait.

695
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:28,173
You might need to change baits.

696
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:31,601
And he doesn't
even use a real cane.

697
01:01:59,574 --> 01:02:01,768
- Hello, Meg.
- Salvation.

698
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,477
Have you seen a
peacock fly around here?

699
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,902
- A peacock?
- Yes, it's a butterfly.

700
01:02:06,495 --> 01:02:08,273
With red and blue wings?

701
01:02:08,373 --> 01:02:10,524
Yes, with the red and blue wings.
Where did he go ?

702
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:11,955
Is he like this?

703
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:15,136
Yes.

704
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:19,493
- My God, how did you catch him?
- I didn't catch it, it landed on me.

705
01:02:19,593 --> 01:02:23,090
Awesome. Put it there, please.

706
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:24,879
In there? To do what ?

707
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:28,633
It's a jar... of cyanide.

708
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:31,595
- Oh no!
- Why not ?

709
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:34,555
- I like butterflies.
- But me too.

710
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:36,881
And I need it for my collection.

711
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:39,316
But I like to see them fly.

712
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:42,527
Meg, they can't fly in a
collection. Give it to me.

713
01:02:44,947 --> 01:02:46,515
Why the hell did you do this?

714
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:48,024
Because of the collection.

715
01:02:49,717 --> 01:02:50,981
Oh... Women!

716
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:28,801
Meg, quick, he's behind the tree.
Come.

717
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:36,628
Slowly.

718
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:50,320
What do you have in there?

719
01:03:51,462 --> 01:03:53,622
A butterfly. A "skull" I think.

720
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,860
What are you doing here ?
It is private property.

721
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,881
- Mr. Miles said that could come...
- Go away!

722
01:04:02,096 --> 01:04:03,259
Right now.

723
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,673
This is the second specimen
that I am missing today.

724
01:04:11,773 --> 01:04:14,808
- Who was it ?
- I don't know, I've never seen her.

725
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:17,849
- Look, there's another one!
- Leave it.

726
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:46,309
I told you not to come in here.

727
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:47,838
When will you be done?

728
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:51,632
In two or three weeks, maybe.
I do not know.

729
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:54,899
- I've heard that before.
- I'm doing everything I can.

730
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,363
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?

731
01:05:59,072 --> 01:06:04,114
Yes. Galvanization does not work.
He needs food.

732
01:06:06,078 --> 01:06:12,532
- Some blood.
- Yes, blood... human blood.

733
01:06:14,294 --> 01:06:15,539
The blood of a virgin?

734
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:19,224
It would do just fine.

735
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:32,850
Hello.

736
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:36,012
Aren't you the girl who was
chasing butterflies the other day?

737
01:06:36,112 --> 01:06:38,683
No, it's the boy who
was with me, William

738
01:06:39,406 --> 01:06:43,482
Nice to meet you.
I want to apologize, I was so rude.

739
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:47,025
I can't stand to see such
gracious beings hurt or kill.

740
01:06:47,532 --> 01:06:50,283
Neither do I. Yesterday I released one.

741
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:52,527
So we are friends?

742
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:56,273
I've never seen you before.
Do you live around here?

743
01:06:56,703 --> 01:07:01,028
No, I'm on vacation with my dad.
We are from London.

744
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:06,037
From London ? Then you
must find this place very boring.

745
01:07:06,247 --> 01:07:08,120
No, I love the countryside.

746
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:11,074
- Where were you going?
- I was walking.

747
01:07:11,843 --> 01:07:16,217
I'm just going for a walk.
Go upstairs, we'll do it together.

748
01:08:09,513 --> 01:08:10,590
It's enough.

749
01:08:12,814 --> 01:08:14,058
It has to stop.

750
01:08:35,072 --> 01:08:36,102
Meg?

751
01:08:37,445 --> 01:08:38,594
Meg!

752
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:43,235
When I give you the
signal, you will wake up.

753
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,615
- Did you hear ? - I heard you.

754
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:53,824
Tomorrow, you will come back, at
the same time, by the same entrance.

755
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:58,076
- Did you hear ? - I heard.

756
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:02,825
When you wake up you
won't remember anything.

757
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:06,747
- Did you hear that right?
- I heard.

758
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:12,206
- And you will obey.
- And I will obey.

759
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:42,433
Meg!

760
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:46,225
Where were you ?
It's late, I was worried.

761
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:48,968
I just walked around.
- William has been home hours.

762
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:50,806
I was not with William.

763
01:09:50,906 --> 01:09:54,948
You shouldn't go alone.
You are very pale.

764
01:09:55,784 --> 01:09:57,824
- Are you okay ?
- Yes.

765
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:00,517
If you don't mind,
I'll go to bed.

766
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:03,905
- You don't want to have dinner first?
- No, I am not hungry.

767
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:06,317
Are you sure you are okay?

768
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:10,412
Yes, very good.
I just have a little headache.

769
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:12,123
Okay.

770
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,762
- I hope you will feel better tomorrow.
- Good night.

771
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:15,956
Good night.

772
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,284
- Clem?
- Clare!

773
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:02,369
- I thought...
- I couldn't come earlier.

774
01:11:02,986 --> 01:11:06,540
No... let's get out of here.
I don't like fire.

775
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:40,043
Clare!

776
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:51,863
Clare!

777
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,513
Clare!

778
01:12:15,686 --> 01:12:17,892
I was lucky enough to catch up with him.

779
01:12:18,355 --> 01:12:21,105
I still think they
are prettier in flight.

780
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:24,268
It's very strange to
find one in England.

781
01:12:24,902 --> 01:12:27,605
There are some in Europe, but further south.

782
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:31,232
The chrysalis must have
gone through in a fruit crate.

783
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:36,899
Look, we can see the "skull".
Yes.

784
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:39,366
What did you say ?

785
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:43,572
It's a butterfly I caught this morning.
Acheroticu Atropus.

786
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:47,736
It is called "Sphinx skull"
because of the marks on the thorax.

787
01:12:47,836 --> 01:12:49,659
Do you want to see them?
- Please.

788
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:55,414
Be careful, don't touch it.
They are covered with small scales.

789
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,837
Hence the name Lepidoptera.
"Scaly wings".

790
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:04,123
Yes. Do you have a more powerful
magnifying glass to see them better?

791
01:13:04,223 --> 01:13:05,336
- The shells?
- Yes.

792
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:07,424
You can see them under a microscope.

793
01:13:07,977 --> 01:13:11,595
I think I have
some in this sample.

794
01:13:11,896 --> 01:13:13,548
- I can look ?
- Of course.

795
01:13:13,648 --> 01:13:15,107
Yes that's it.

796
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:25,024
- You can watch.
- Thank you.

797
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:39,498
It's fascinating.

798
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:42,694
Thanks, William. You have
a very interesting hobby.

799
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:43,892
Yes.

800
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:45,875
Do you want to see them, Meg?

801
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:56,638
- I see nothing.
- Of course you moved the light.

802
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,845
Here.

803
01:14:00,142 --> 01:14:01,342
Take it easy.

804
01:14:02,936 --> 01:14:04,052
Boss.

805
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:05,839
Mr.

806
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:07,831
The nearest telegraph, please?

807
01:14:07,931 --> 01:14:11,053
There is one in the village,
give me the message I will go.

808
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:12,858
No, I prefer to go there myself.

809
01:14:17,281 --> 01:14:18,974
- It looks nice.
- Yes.

810
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:20,894
But you must not kill them.

811
01:14:24,453 --> 01:14:26,114
You couldn't wait, eh?

812
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:28,991
Did I not create you?

813
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:33,704
And how do you make me pay it? Everywhere
you are causing death and destruction.

814
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:37,704
And I have committed
the folly to create another.

815
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:41,792
- Do you think he's ready?
- Yes.

816
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:46,678
It will be ripe in a few days, and you
will have the companion you wanted,

817
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:48,678
a male of your kind.

818
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:51,754
But now I realize
what I have created.

819
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:54,424
I will destroy you both.

820
01:15:17,662 --> 01:15:20,192
- Are you okay, dad?
- Hello, Mr. Warrender.

821
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,329
- It bites?
- Today, yes.

822
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,740
Meg, isn't your dad here?

823
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:28,077
He went to Farnham to see somebody.

824
01:15:28,295 --> 01:15:33,001
Too bad he loses that, what a great peach.
Where were you going ?

825
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,511
- We are going for a walk.
- Don't come home too late.

826
01:15:36,637 --> 01:15:37,915
Of course not.

827
01:15:58,986 --> 01:16:01,677
Hey, William, give
me a hand, I'm hooked.

828
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:06,401
Here, take the cane.

829
01:16:07,118 --> 01:16:08,612
I'll pull the thread.

830
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:16,774
Its good.

831
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,136
William, give me the hook.

832
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:12,749
Good evening sir.

833
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,059
Good evening, Sergeant.
You arrived quickly.

834
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:17,458
I left as soon as I
received your telegram.

835
01:17:17,632 --> 01:17:19,367
These steam engines go fast!

836
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,495
- Do you want some tea ?
- That would be very timely.

837
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,582
- I suspected it.
- The information you asked me for.

838
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:25,692
Very good.

839
01:17:26,431 --> 01:17:27,627
Thank you.

840
01:17:28,055 --> 01:17:30,382
- Tell the boss to serve us.
- Yes sir.

841
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:35,093
Boss!

842
01:17:38,274 --> 01:17:39,767
Looks like no one is there.

843
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:43,520
Too bad, sit down.
Let's see these reports.

844
01:17:43,653 --> 01:17:44,731
Yes.

845
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:48,123
The body we found in the
basement of Clare House...

846
01:17:48,224 --> 01:17:51,005
is that of the butler... I know.
But it's the other one that interests me.

847
01:17:51,158 --> 01:17:54,579
The one who spoke of the "Skull".
- Britewell. It's here.

848
01:17:54,679 --> 01:17:55,792
Thank you.

849
01:17:57,185 --> 01:18:00,446
Frederick John Britewell,
27, British, homeless, has just

850
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:04,185
arrived from Africa. He
studied in Worcester and Oxford.

851
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:07,808
Holder of Natural History, M.R.S.E.
That's it, we are reaching the goal!

852
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:09,207
M.R.S.E. ?

853
01:18:09,307 --> 01:18:11,537
Member of the Royal
Society of Entomology.

854
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,199
Someone who studies insects.

855
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:16,715
Carl Oscar Mallinger.
Age unknown.

856
01:18:16,815 --> 01:18:20,606
It is assumed that he was born in Vienna.
Holder in biochemistry.

Merit for his studies in...

859
01:18:28,463 --> 01:18:29,592
What ?...

860
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:32,543
For his studies
on entomology...

861
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:35,072
and his thesis on
reproductive processes...

01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:42,201
I understood everything.

864
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:45,026
- Thanks to Billy "the critter hunter".
- Billy the what?

865
01:18:45,126 --> 01:18:47,623
A young man staying here.
Do you remember this?

866
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,505
Yes, that's what
was on the moor.

867
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:55,382
Yes. These are the scales
of a large insect, a moth.

868
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:57,425
A moth?

869
01:18:59,537 --> 01:19:01,976
- You're kidding, sir.
- No!

870
01:19:02,076 --> 01:19:04,789
- That young man I told you about...
- The bug hunter?

871
01:19:04,889 --> 01:19:06,869
Himself.
He collects butterflies.

872
01:19:07,169 --> 01:19:09,726
He showed me the scales of a
"Sphinx skull" under the microscope.

873
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:13,820
They are identical, but a hundred
times larger than the normal size.

874
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:18,284
I believe that Professor Mallinger,
by accident or by intention,

875
01:19:18,384 --> 01:19:22,556
created a gigantic "Skull Sphinx"
which feeds on human blood.

876
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:23,803
A carnivorous insect?

877
01:19:24,003 --> 01:19:25,798
- He would have raised at Clare House?
- Surely...

878
01:19:25,898 --> 01:19:27,804
in his laboratory.
- And the girl?

879
01:19:27,904 --> 01:19:29,457
- What young girl?
- But his daughter.

880
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:31,583
She must have noticed something.

881
01:19:32,664 --> 01:19:33,832
Sergeant!

882
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:37,260
- We would like to have tea.
- Hold on, Mr. Thompson.

883
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:39,728
You arrive faster than expected.
He's up there.

884
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:40,819
Who is that, sir?

885
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:43,997
- Mr. Warrender didn't tell you...
- Tell me what?

886
01:19:44,132 --> 01:19:47,495
Sergeant, there has been an accident.
A man drowned in the river.

887
01:19:48,126 --> 01:19:50,692
I say it was an accident,
but that's up to you.

888
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:52,036
Over here, sergeant.

889
01:19:53,384 --> 01:19:55,168
- Go for it. - Yes.

890
01:19:56,974 --> 01:19:59,026
- You remain incognito?
- Yes.

891
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:07,735
These accidents are
always very painful.

892
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,621
What do you have ?

893
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:15,623
Wait for me, will you.

894
01:20:22,379 --> 01:20:25,659
- Already back ?
- You better go.

895
01:20:25,759 --> 01:20:26,661
Why?

896
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:28,789
He didn't drown, he still is.

897
01:20:28,889 --> 01:20:31,246
- What do you mean ?
- Come and see the wounds.

898
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,151
Wait, do you think
Mr. Thompson should see this?

899
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:42,517
This is Inspector Quennell
from the National Police.

900
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:44,660
Inspector?
I thought he worked at the bank.

901
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,549
He travels incognito.
To investigate an important case.

902
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,793
- What do you think of the injuries?
- Exactly the same as the others.

903
01:20:53,129 --> 01:20:54,240
Do you know this man?

904
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:57,675
It's young Clem.
He was a gardener at Old House.

905
01:20:59,804 --> 01:21:02,960
- When was the body found?
- When you're gone.

906
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:06,846
Mr. Warrender was fishing in the
river with your daughter and William...

907
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:10,212
- Did they see him too?
- I'm afraid so.

908
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:11,228
Where are they?

909
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:14,233
I believe they went to Old
House, Mr. Miles' house.

910
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,279
Young William often goes there
to see his collection of butterflies.

911
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,933
- He's a very nice man.
- Is this house far from here?

912
01:21:20,033 --> 01:21:22,337
- Two miles by road.
- Is the car available?

913
01:21:22,438 --> 01:21:23,839
- Yes. - Take us, immediately.

914
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:26,792
- Sergeant are you armed?
- Yes. boss, close the door.

915
01:21:26,892 --> 01:21:27,922
Yes sir.

916
01:21:44,324 --> 01:21:46,738
Does the coachman want to kill us?
I hope not.

917
01:21:47,963 --> 01:21:50,774
Do you really think Miles
is Professor Mallinger?

918
01:21:50,874 --> 01:21:52,250
I'm sure.

919
01:21:52,752 --> 01:21:56,005
I'm sorry, my
father can't see you.

920
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,759
Never mind.
It wasn't important. Good night.

921
01:22:02,766 --> 01:22:03,797
Wait.

922
01:22:04,436 --> 01:22:05,450
What did you want from him?

923
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:10,522
It is pointless.
I wanted to show him one thing.

924
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:13,145
I think it's a "Skull Sphinx".

925
01:22:17,579 --> 01:22:18,628
- It is.

926
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:21,662
- Do you know butterflies?
- Yes.

927
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:24,914
Great. Thank you.

928
01:22:25,756 --> 01:22:27,214
Did you kill him?

929
01:22:27,383 --> 01:22:30,753
Yes, for my collection.
He is magnificent.

930
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:33,875
I'll walk you to the door.

931
01:22:33,975 --> 01:22:36,810
Do not bother.
I can see very well in the dark.

932
01:22:37,146 --> 01:22:38,475
Not as good as me.

933
01:24:09,397 --> 01:24:11,355
Meg!... Help me.

934
01:24:16,874 --> 01:24:18,910
- Will you do it, sir?
- Yes, quickly put out the fire.

935
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:20,042
Yes.

936
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:33,081
- What happened ?
- She fainted. Help me.

937
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,639
Yes, inspector.

938
01:24:42,485 --> 01:24:43,594
- The fire is out.
- Well.

939
01:24:43,694 --> 01:24:45,188
- How is she ? It will be fine.

940
01:24:48,776 --> 01:24:50,635
Take care of her!
Take a lantern.

941
01:24:59,054 --> 01:25:00,405
Over here, Allan!

942
01:25:05,075 --> 01:25:06,635
My God!

943
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,580
No, you could hurt the boy!
Shoot in the air.

944
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:23,507
Are you okay, William?
- How's it going sir.

945
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,248
- Are you sure?

946
01:25:28,162 --> 01:25:29,622
You will never have it like this.

947
01:25:30,453 --> 01:25:31,726
Give me the lantern.

948
01:26:26,212 --> 01:26:30,021
What are we going to tell them?
No one will ever believe us.

949
01:26:30,512 --> 01:26:32,151
No one could.
