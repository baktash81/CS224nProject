our bodies become the grass...

eat the grass...

It's a little lion!

- That is not a lion,

720
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,556
it's a furry bird!

a closer look. Excuse me.

what we're dealing with here.

Wait, Timon, wait!
(STAMMERS) It's a little lion!

727
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,355

728
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,358
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

729
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,440
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

I'll clean it up.

He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

But one day,
when he's big and strong,

734
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,789
he'll be on our side!

Well, to change the future,

772
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,194
you gotta put your past
behind you.

773
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400

775
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,991
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

776
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
Right.

777
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,800
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

you turn your back
on the world!

779

And only embrace what's next!

780

into "so what?"

TIMON: Nice one, Simba.

1055
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,360
Oh, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

1056
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,352
(FARTS) Or the crickets.

1057

(PUMBAA LAUGHS)

1058
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,480
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

1059
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,958
Hey, Timon.

1060
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,349
Do you ever look up there

1061
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,750
and wonder
what those sparkly dots are?

1062
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,636
TIMON: Oh, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

PUMBAA: Really? What are they?

1064
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,719
They're fireflies.

1065
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,874
Fireflies that got stuck on
that big, bluish-black thing.

1066
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Oh.

1067
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,389
I guess that makes sense.

1068
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,557
I always thought
they were balls of gas

1069
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,711
burning
billions of miles away.

1070
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,190
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

1071
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,800
I know.

1072
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,793
- What do you think, Simba?
- Yeah.

1073
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,191
Oh, I don't know.

1074
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,272
But somebody once told me...

1075
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,636
the great kings of the past
are up there...

1076
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,838
and they're all
watching over us.

1085
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,736
I mean, Simba,
think about it.

1086
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,070
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

1087
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,232
- We're outcasts.
- Royal warthogs!

1088

- I can't! I can't!
- I can't! I actually can't.

That's stupid.

I'm gonna go get some grubs
