00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,639
But i never
had the time

3
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,644
time

4
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,655
i always thought
that we were friends

5
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,160
time

6
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:28,672
but you slipped
right through my hands

7
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:46,190
but i never had
the time.

8
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,733
Hey, ace.

9
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:45,249
Speed's expensive. How
fast do you want to go?

10
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,281
Any town's a nice little
town when you nail a broad.

11
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,785
Starting to get
nervous, huh?

12
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,296
There she is.

13
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,306
- Yeah, i know what you mean.
- I figured you would.

14
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,869
I promised you after word
from sonny's drive-in.

15
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,418
Go ahead.
Back it off.

16
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,948
Hey! Asshole!

17
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,428
I was washing my hair.

18
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,938
Hello?

19
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,954
- Yeah?
- Everything under control?

20
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,961
It's been delivered
and it's just waiting.

21
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,465
Okay, i'll see
you real soon.

22
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,987
Call him.

23
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,490
I said, call him.

24
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,030
- Yeah- would you like me to
get that? - No. Do you know her?

25
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,034
Oh god, please answer.

26
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,564
Please.

27
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,083
If you don't give
him the money.

28
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,593
Let me talk to him.

29
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,111
I changed my mind.

30
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,667
Morning, mr. Stanton.

31
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,177
It was supposed
to be open.

32
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,690
It's a local call.

33
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,219
Whoever it is, get rid of
'em like i told you before.

34
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,725
- Hello?
- Is the man of the house there?

35
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,251
Yeah, that's right

36
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,259
- you can't let him do this. Please.
- No.

37
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,277
It'll be all right now,
honey. It'll be all right.

38
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,781
Terrific.

39
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,285
I even brought
my own bag.

40
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,791
Try not to squash
the tomatoes.

41
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,816
And you cease to be a family
man right then and there.

42
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,223
Hi, asshole.

43
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,727
What did you do
with the keys?

44
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,740
She ought to be
paid like one, right?

45
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,245
If you don't give me those
keys, i'm going to pop you.

46
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,753
Oh!

47
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,261
That's right, lady.
Now, let's have the keys.

48
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,771
Okay. Relax.

49
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,797
Those were the keys
to my grandfather's pickup.

50
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,812
You just holler.

51
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,332
Did you see that crazy son of a bitch?

52
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,871
- You won't yell?
You promise? - Uh-huh.

53
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,877
I'm trusting you now

54
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,897
no. Would you go back
to your office now?

55
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,403
Mr. Stanton?

56
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,435
You better check with the
stewardess in tourist section.

57
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,956
Get in.

58
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,971
As full of shit
as that, huh?

59
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,020
Honest, i was spouting off
to a dial tone.

60
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,531
You are a neighbor
and, uh...

61
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,545
did i get a wrong-

62
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,563
after an incoming call.

63
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,104
- Yeah.
- Far out!

64
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,679
Had to pick up
a flag, didn't you?

65
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:11,188
- What?
- I don't know, i thought maybe you'd know.

66
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,292
Souped?

67
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,800
Let's go.

68
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,837
I'm glad!

69
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,351
Your friend's
a real dazzler.

70
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,856
D-a-z-z-l-e-r.

71
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,882
Okay, hang on.

72
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:28,320
You know what it means when somebody
like me gets off to a bad start?

73
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,324
Not a god-damn thing.

74
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,891
You've been holding those cars over my
head a year and i'm getting tired of it.

75
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,937
It's got nothing to do with you
or you getting your new patrol cars.

76
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,941
Kiss my ass.

77
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:35,948
That's not nice.

78
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,988
Sheriff's department,
please, right away.

79
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,403
I'd like to get out
and look at the car.

80
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,915
Oh, just beautiful.

81
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,931
Yeah. Thanks.

82
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,935
Come on. Let's get
this turkey under-cover.

83
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,965
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir. Yes, sir."

84
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,973
Haul ass to mccullough!

85
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:16,502
Now, that was cute.
That was real cute.

86
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,025
Headquarters
to cars 2 and 12.

87
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:49,034
This is a hell of a time
for a pit stop.

88
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:31,076
- Deke, you going to be a while?
- Yeah.

89
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,080
Great.

90
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,097
Of how little
i was getting.

91
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,169
That is totally true.

92
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,189
Unload.
Kiss off.

93
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:43,208
- Goodbye!
- Hello.

94
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,215
Deke, what are you trying to
do, establish squatter's rights?

95
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,732
And you underneath
with me.

96
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,237
Terrific.

97
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,751
- Hey!
- What?

98
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,260
Maybe i don't want
to say goodbye.

99
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,271
But i'm having trouble

100
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,782
trying to win enough money
to build some real speed.

101
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,798
And now l-
i've got-

102
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,303
i need you...

103
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,808
to help us
with the car.

104
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,317
You got it.

105
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:16,653
And see if you get the words
"son of a bitch" in print.

106
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:39,676
Hey, start moving
the wheel!

107
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,682
Just a second.

108
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,705
Well, pay attention.

109
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,209
I'll pay attention.

110
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,217
- She got bored.
- Oh, great.

111
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,221
Turn it to the left!

112
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,729
- Is it coming?
- Yeah, work it some more!

113
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,735
To the right!
Are you stupid?!

114
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,244
Larry?

115
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,748
Larry!

116
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,257
Uh...

117
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,284
yes, sir.

118
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,934
Why?

119
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,937
G.
'Cause we're stoppin

120
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,962

to europe with jamie richardson.

121
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:59,501
- Mister, she's gonna talk.
- So what?

122
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,510
Check the map
for that second turn.

123
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,015
- Where'd you put it?
- Under the seat.

124
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,519
Have you gone crazy?
It's not here.

125
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:29,031
That's what
i'm going to break.

126
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:57,059
- Hi.
- Hi. Hand it over.

127
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,063
Oh, sure.
Why not?

128
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,577
- Then you-
- get in.

129
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,127
Car 10 in hot pursuit.

130
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,823
What, are you worried
you can't outdrive him?

131
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,843
Don't mean a thing.
She always overheats.

132
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:58,347
Come on, baby!
God damn it, let's go.

133
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,360
I ain't blowing
nothin', partner.

134
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,877
Whoo!

135
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,889
Tappets.

136
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:30,439
Contact that helicopter. Tell them
to meet me at beacon's corner.

137
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:58,467
Yeah, well we're going
to get right back on it.

138
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,595
Headquarters calling
captain franklin.

139
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:14,102
Give me that thing. Franklin,
this is donahue. Come in, please.

140
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:20,108
Donahue: Everett, i want you
to get back to headquarters now.

141
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:26,615
Everett, aren't you taking this
pursuit a little bit personal?

142
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:38,126
What's that
supposed to mean?

143
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:56,144
That's all you got in your brain is
having the biggest troop in this state.

144
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,651
I want you
to catch 'em.

145
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,170
- Hey, carl?
- What?

146
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,673
Kiss my ass!

147
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,242
I was given orders to hit it
and get it, and i follow orders.

148
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,748
Let's go.

149
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,682
There she is.

150
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,190
Then we'll get the tools.
Come on.

151
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,702
- I said i'll be back in a minute.
- Oh.

152
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,740
I'll take it.

153
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,768
Why don't you watch out
what you're doing?

154
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,782
Mm-hmm.

155
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:44,308
What's the matter, mary? Ain't
we good enough for you anymore?

156
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,819
Same old technique.
Whew!

157
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,843
Look what i got you.

158
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,856
Hey, there's a blue chevy.

159
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:02,386
Hey, i think
we should go.

160
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,912
Car 20 to headquarters.

161
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:46,930
- Which way are they headed?
- Fryman road area, south.

162
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,938
Notify all of the cars to
make a sweep in that area.

163
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:09,953
Uh, i might not be able
to hear them pipes.

164
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:15,959
Did anybody see
a license number?

165
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:21,965
Hey, had a black
racing stripe.

166
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,015
Mmm!

167
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:23,026
Larry: Well, well, well. Hi, guys.

168
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,542
They're about four miles
south of miner road.

169
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:44,047
Oh, shit.

170
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:49,052
Officer:
Son of a-

171
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,563
now, what did
that billboard say?

172
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:48,111
That means he's gonna
set up roadblocks.

173
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,659
Where are you?

174
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:50,174
All right.
Listen to this.

175
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,193
Unlimited.

176
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:17,701
The roadblock at old 99
junction is now set up, sir.

177
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:36,720
Hey, what do you know?

178
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:40,224
A landing spot.

179
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:34,278
Aphrodisiac, huh?

180
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:37,781
With you around?

181
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,810
Hey, that's $1.85.

182
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,329
Computer.
Shit.

183
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,346
Lots of green between
those balls, you know?

184
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:50,854
This table's
kind of screwy, too.

185
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:22,886
When deke shoots pool, he's so loaded,
he usuall y can't see the table.

186
01:03:30,394 --> 01:03:33,897
Hey now, bunky, that ain't an
excuse to go on a binge, you know.

187
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,910
Ain't no drunk costin
g me another race.

188
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:55,419
You walk now, mister, and
we'll hang it up for good.

189
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:02,926
I think maybe
we ought to go.

190
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,215
No sign of them
yet, sir. Over.

191
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,223
18 minutes since
your call. Over.

192
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:56,730
Maybe that clown
got us wired.

193
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,780
Give me a piece of paper
and a pencil.

194
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:03,797
- Little miss mary's gonna do us a favor.
- Why should i?

195
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,803
Well, because
i'm asking you to.

196
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:16,810
Okay.
What is it?

197
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:42,836
Let's gas up
and get out of here.

198
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:14,368
Over and out.

199
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:38,392
Ooh-whee!

200
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:45,899
Hey, hold it!

201
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,428
Swing off and pass.

202
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:51,465
- Bunky! Hey, bunky,
cheer up!

203
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,969
All right, get me
to that walnut grove.

204
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:54,528
- What you slow down for?!
- He wants to play.

205
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:02,035
I think someone's
knocking on the door.

206
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:14,548
I hope he's
a good sailor.

207
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,580
Give me that mic.

208
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:07,100
If you really get it on,
you may be able to cover 15.

209
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,615
Listen to him.

210
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:56,650
It's just a matter of when.
Now, get off that line.

211
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:35,689
We haven't got
any fuel left.

212
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:13,727
You probably did.

213
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:21,235
Let's go fix up
the front end.

214
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,739
Hey, wait a minute.
Fix up the front end?

215
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:47,261
Yeah.

216
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:44,318
I got a way. Maybe you
can save yourself, mary.

217
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:14,848
Don't you do that
again, ever.

218
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,853
If she has any sense about
her, i won't need to.

219
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:31,865
To get up by yourself, you
don't think anybody can, huh?

220
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,372
Come on!
Say it again!

221
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:47,381
Just fix
the god damn wheel.

222
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:23,917
Hey!
Wait a minute!

223
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:45,939
Why?

224
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:51,945
I'm his mechanic

225
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:57,451
so what?
You don't have to be.

226
01:16:59,453 --> 01:17:02,956
Well, i mean, you said half
the money's yours, right?

227
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,960
You and i, we could-

228
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:12,466
it's not that at all.

229
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,972
Well, i do lie a little.

230
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:28,482
But the reason
i lie...

231
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,987
i know you, miss mary.

232
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,992
You do?

233
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:51,505
I mean, you're good.
Even i know that.

234
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:06,019
I drank myself right out
of the entire circuit.

235
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,535
I don't have
anything else to do.

236
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:35,549
Yeah, but i
always think that.

237
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:41,555
Now, let's get on
with our business.

238
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:57,089
Just hold on to them.
Be right with you.

239
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:07,099
I'm gonna stick right up
your ass this time, buddy.

240
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:13,105
Hang on. I think we got a mover here.

241
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:21,613
I'm gonna eat your lunch,
you long-haired faggot.

242
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,121
He's staying with you.

243
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:40,132
You'd better get, and i'm gonna
put you right up against the wall.

244
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:50,142
- If he gets any closer, i'm gonna lunch him.
- Come on! Shake him!

245
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:02,154
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna powder his face.

246
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:19,171
It's gonna take more than that to dust
me off 'cause this is where i came from.

247
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:41,693
I'm going to show you
my twice-piped system, buddy!

248
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:17,229
Keep going, partner, 'cause
my top end is unlimited.

249
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:37,749
Damn.

250
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:13,577
And the steering wheel's
loose anyway.

251
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:32,429
Get me over there.
Come on.

252
01:23:48,946 --> 01:23:50,447
You're just wasting gas.

253
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,954
- All right. It's up to you.
- What is?

254
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,958
- I want 'em stopped.
- Stoppedhow?

255
01:24:15,973 --> 01:24:19,977
'Cause i'm going to give
it a try. So go on down there.

256
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:23,480
I said go on
down there!

257
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:34,491
Come on!

258
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:55,512
Let me talk to him.

259
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:10,527
This ain't no dirt track,
roundy-rounder.

260
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:19,036
Come on!

261
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:08,585
I believe you're right.

262
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:12,589
Crash into him!

263
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:26,603
- Fuel!
- Come on!

264
01:26:28,105 --> 01:26:30,607
- We're out of fuel!
- God damn it!

265
01:26:37,114 --> 01:26:39,616
Go ahead
and set it down!

266
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:54,631
All you got to be is willing
to take it to the max.

267
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,662
Those cars ain't within 10 miles of
where he's talking. What's he doing?

268
01:27:31,168 --> 01:27:33,670
Mary:
And you go right.

269
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:57,194
Jeez.

270
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:13,210
From your coordinate,
r-3 and walnut.

271
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:22,219
Two up and left again.

272
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:38,735
He's trying to make 'em
outdrive themselves.

273
01:28:59,256 --> 01:29:01,758
One over, left!

274
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:17,274
Okay.
Two up, left.

275
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:48,806
Hey, bunky,
he's strokingyou.

276
01:30:27,344 --> 01:30:31,348
Yeah, but i'd like
to call not collect.

277
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:05,382
It sure looks that way.

278
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:57,434
Time

279
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:08,946
i always thought
that we were friends

280
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,951
time

281
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:25,462
but you slipped
right through my hands.
