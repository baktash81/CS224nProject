As a matter of
fact, I think we

27
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,941
should probably
move everybody over.

28
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,949
Are you
sure he'll be alright?

29
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,534
He'll be just fine.

30
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,746
And listen, my cat travels
this way all the time.

31
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,329
I hope so because
Tiffany hasn't

32
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,914
been feeling too well lately.

33
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,499
She has sort of a condition.

34
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,670
Well, we'll take good care
of her I promise you that.

35
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:47,482
But you only have
three tickets here,

36
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,049
I show a four reservation.

37
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,135
Oh well, Dr. Chapman isn't
coming until next week.

38
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:55,555
I did phone in and
postpone that reservation.

39
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,432
Let me check, ma'am.

40
00:05:58,683 --> 00:05:59,683
Computers.

41
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,981
We're going to Greece.

42
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:05,940
I'm sorry?

43
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,442
We're going to Greece.

44
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,985
Yes, I know.

45
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:10,278
You do?

46
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,330
Well, it's the only
place this flight goes.

47
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:14,698
Oh.

48
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:17,868
Excuse me.

49
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:20,205
What day was Dr.
Chapman's reservation?

50
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,122
Thursday.

51
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,414
Thursday?

52
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,668
I'll be right back, ma'am.

53
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,463
It's not pounds,
it's kilograms.

54
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,355
There's over two pounds
In each kilogram.

55
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,423
Oh.

56
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,134
Did you think Benji
had lost weight?

57
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,637
No, I was just joking,
I knew it all the time.

58
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,138
You did not.

59
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,430
I did too.

60
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,478
I'm sorry this
Is taking so long.

61
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,271
Oh, that's alright.

62
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,485
Where in
Greece are you going?

63
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,277
To Crete.

64
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:52,195
Really?

65
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,530
That's where we're going.

66
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,091
Oh well, it's a
beautiful island.

67
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,616
I've been there
many times myself.

68
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:57,534
I'll have to tell you some good

69
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:58,928
places to go while you're there.

70
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,953
Good.

71
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:03,081
There's no need if we
don't make the plane.

72
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,041
Okay,
ma'am the doctor's

73
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,853
reservation for next
week is confirmed.

74
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,087
Have a nice day.

75
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,588
Oh, thank you very much.

76
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,634
Okay, kids, we're off to the
land of Diogenes and Aristotle.

77
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,310
What's an Aristotle?

78
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,555
Aristotle
is a who, not a what.

79
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:20,598
I'm sure
he's just joking

80
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,809
and knew it all the time.

81
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,519
Oh, sure.

82
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:23,703
Hi there, Benji boy.

83
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,602
This won't hurt a bit.

84
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:56,444
Easy boy, easy, come on.

85
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,970
Come on.

86
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:24,842
See you in Crete.

87
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,714
Oh no, now you've done enough.

88
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,006
No, no I insist on it.

89
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,317
I know the place
too, believe me.

90
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,777
Tonight you're gonna
have the greatest

91
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,469
food you've ever
had in your life.

92
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,428
Oh, do you believe that?

93
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Will it be Greek food?

94
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:53,014
Very Greek.

95
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,306
What's Greek food like?

96
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,893
Well, it, well
let's just say there's

97
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,895
not going to be a
lot of fried chicken.

98
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,939
- Hey Mr.
- Dietrich, look.

99
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,500
Can
you believe that?

100
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,943
You can't escape them anymore.

101
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,113
Paul, Cindy.

102
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,908
I'm
Chandler Dietrich.

103
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,372
Did he leave his
name or anything?

104
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:39,894
Is anything wrong?

105
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,914
Oh no, I just have a phone
call to make that's all.

106
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:42,938
I'll be back in a minute.

107
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,065
Okay.

108
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:44,982
Oh, listen, could
you do me a favor?

109
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,317
Of course.

110
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,086
Keep an eye out for
my luggage, will you?

111
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,570
I have two bags,
both of them blue

112
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,964
with a stripe down the side.

113
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,031
Okay.

114
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:53,634
Oh, and ['ll tell you
what, I'll get a cab for us.

115
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:54,898
We can ride into town together.

116
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,231
That way you won't have to worry

117
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,954
about any language
problem on the way.

118
00:13:58,246 --> 00:13:59,286
That's great, thank you.

119
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,873
No, no thank you.

120
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,128
Um,.

121
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:39,912
Welcome
to Greece, Mr. Dietrich.

122
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,747
Do you have the coordinate code?

123
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,083
Yes, I have it and
it's in a safe place.

124
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,375
Good.

125
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,169
The map is in an envelope taped

126
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,214
under the shelf below the phone.

127
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:53,968
The project is getting out
of hand, waste no time.

128
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,845
Signal if you need help.

129
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:58,055
We'll always be watching.

130
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,184
I won't need any help and
I don't like being watched.

131
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,644
I'll handle this myself.

132
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,980
Do you understand?

133
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,272
Hello?

134
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:08,523
Hello?

135
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,488
Well, where are they
and why aren't they here?

136
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,115
I'm sure they'll arrive.

137
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,327
They must have missed the
plane change in Athens.

138
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:19,409
Now please, don't worry.

139
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:20,773
I go call and find out for sure.

140
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,275
And I promise you
they'll get the

141
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,016
best of care and be
on the next flight.

142
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,165
Well, please hurry.

143
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,500
What is the next flight?

144
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,294
Tomorrow morning.

145
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:32,089
What's the matter?

146
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,883
Benji and Tiffany
didn't get here.

147
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:34,800
What?

148
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,292
Well, he seems to think they

149
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,705
missed the plane
change in Athens.

150
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:38,803
But he's not sure?

151
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:39,889
Well, he's gone to call.

152
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,183
Well, why don't you
let me check it for you?

153
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,226
Don't forget to tell
him they haven't had

154
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:48,230
anything to eat or drink
in almost I2 hours.

155
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,233
And that Tiffany
has a condition.

156
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:28,937
Ah.

157
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Hey!

158
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,432
I say, is this the
baggage storage area?

159
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:33,561
My word!

160
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:34,605
What was that?

161
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:37,357
It's him!

162
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,165
Well, I must say,
he's frightfully rude.

163
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:43,989
No, you ninny, the dog,
come on quickly, come on!

164
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,251
I'm almost positive
It was him, but it all

165
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:36,385
happened so fast I have
no idea which way he went.

166
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:38,346
Well, he's going to come
and jump into your lap,

167
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,597
so I suggest we keep on looking.

168
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:40,621
Yes, dear.

169
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,358
Oh, do stop the Greek lessons.

170
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,403
You know I can never understand
a word of that gibberish.

171
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,364
Too bad, I was commenting
on your intelligence.

172
00:36:06,656 --> 00:36:08,700
Then I'm very glad I
didn't understand it.

173
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,327
On the contrary,
occasionally you give birth

174
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:14,581
to the most marvelously
brilliant ideas.

175
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,292
However simple.

176
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,379
And although I hate to admit it,

177
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:26,134
checking at the dog
pound was one of them.

178
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:33,308
I hope you realize I won't
be the only one to think of it.

179
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,518
And with all this
interest around Benji

180
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,478
there's going to
be a few visitors.

181
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,022
I'm sure of It.

182
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:40,565
It seems our hideaway scientist

183
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:42,525
has become a very important man.

184
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:43,985
And very valuable.

185
00:36:44,277 --> 00:36:45,277
Quite true.

186
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:48,615
Have you found anything?

187
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:49,907
Not a thing.

188
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,326
Not a thing.

189
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:53,077
If only we knew where to look.

190
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,249
I say, it's started already.

191
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,338
You answer the
door and I'll take

192
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,173
our popular friend
upstairs and take

193
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:06,883
a few photographs
out of the window.

194
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,175
Uh.

195
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:19,604
Just give me a few
moments to prepare

196
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:21,773
and then get rid of them.

197
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,585
I'm sorry,
there must be a mistake.

198
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,461
We haven't been there
and we do not have a dog.

199
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:47,131
Oh, this is
your name and address?

200
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:50,635
Yes, it is,
but we do not have a dog.

201
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:52,428
Never have had and we did not

202
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,000
pick up a dog at
the pound today.

203
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,515
There is no way
we would ever have

204
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,768
a dog within a
hundred yards of us.

205
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,561
I see, well maybe

206
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:02,397
your husband picked up the dog.

207
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:05,233
My
husband hates dogs.

208
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:06,526
I see.

209
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:07,818
I do not.

210
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,088
Well,
thank you very much.

211
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,446
Don't you believe
a word of it.

212
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:12,031
You're welcome.

213
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,791
Oh good.

214
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,670
Can I have a look at
your face, please?

215
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:27,755
Ah, thank you very much.

216
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,987
Well what do you
think Benji, old boy,

217
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,261
Is he really with Olympic?

218
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,181
I wouldn't want to
lay a bet on it.

219
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:40,393
Oh well, we have
him nicely recorded.

220
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,529
No, no, no, no, no I'm afraid
you've got to stay in here.

221
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:56,617
There's a good boy.

222
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:02,790
Here, here, we'll
have none of that.

223
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,250
No, bad dog.

224
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:11,090
Now you might just as well
make yourself comfortable.

225
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,552
This is going to be
your home for a while.

226
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,035
Yes?

227
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,496
How do you do?

228
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:43,998
I'm here about the dog you
picked up at the pound today.

229
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,290
I'm sorry,
that is somebody's mistake

230
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,628
and I wish whoever it
is would correct that.

231
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,506
You're the second person
to ask that question.

232
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:20,867
Benji!

233
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,627
Steady boy, steady.

234
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:34,632
Just don't move.

235
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:38,677
Good boy.

236
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:26,821
Ah!

237
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:23,798
Benji.

238
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:30,472
I know you're in here, Benji.

239
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Benji?

240
00:52:54,496 --> 00:52:56,290
Here, Benji.

241
00:52:56,582 --> 00:52:57,582
Here, Benji boy.

242
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:05,631
Benji.

243
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:09,136
Why are you afraid of me?

244
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:10,428
Hmm?

245
00:53:11,096 --> 00:53:12,514
I never hurt you.

246
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:28,280
Benji, Benji.

247
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,161
Benji.

248
00:53:34,453 --> 00:53:35,453
Benji.

249
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:40,208
Benji.

250
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,835
Benji.

251
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:43,420
Come on, Benji.

252
00:53:43,712 --> 00:53:44,963
Come on, boy.

253
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,840
Benji, come on boy.

254
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:38,344
Hey!

255
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:41,973
Shoo!

256
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,265
Shoo!

257
00:56:44,893 --> 00:56:46,186
Shoo, shoo!

258
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:47,478
Shoo!

259
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:48,562
Shoo!

260
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:52,776
Shoo, shoo!

261
00:59:02,697 --> 00:59:04,574
Ah, ah, ah, don't
get up gentlemen.

262
00:59:04,866 --> 00:59:05,866
Just stay put.

263
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:11,039
I assume you Know your
identity's no longer a secret.

264
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,583
Tell you what, give me
the dog and I'll try

265
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,395
to see that you come
out of this alive.

266
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:17,796
No, I'll take
care of that myself.

267
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,090
You gentlemen have a nice day.

268
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,061
Stay!

269
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:44,538
Benji!

270
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:46,332
Look Mary, it's Benji!

271
01:04:54,215 --> 01:04:55,258
Benji, Benji!

272
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:03,182
It really is him!

273
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,059
Oh hi, there you little pumpkin!

274
01:05:07,312 --> 01:05:08,312
You can go.

275
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:18,114
All over Athens and
couldn't find him.

276
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:20,366
I was scared we'd
never even see him again.

277
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:23,661
And guess who else is
gonna be glad to see you.

278
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:28,248
Okay, go on.

279
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:33,004
You know,
I think he's gonna...

280
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,297
Yes”?

281
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:38,509
Oh, I need to borrow
your dog for a few days.

282
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,136
I beg your pardon?

283
01:05:40,428 --> 01:05:43,139
I said I need to borrow
your dog for a few days.

284
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:46,267
Who are you, what
are you talking about?

285
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,102
Look, believe
me, it's at least

286
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:49,754
partially for the
dog's own safety.

287
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:52,023
He'll be returned
unharmed in a day or two.

288
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,900
Oh Chandler, I'm
so glad...

289
01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:54,692
Chandler!

290
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:55,985
Why did you do that?

291
01:05:56,277 --> 01:05:58,196
Will you tell me
what's going on here?

292
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:00,406
Mary, it's okay,
I promise you.

293
01:06:00,698 --> 01:06:02,075
Now don't worry, here.

294
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,786
You take this gun, keep it on
him and call the police, okay?

295
01:06:05,078 --> 01:06:06,162
No, it's not okay.

296
01:06:06,454 --> 01:06:10,041
I don't like guns and I don't
know what this is all about.

297
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,752
Well, I can't
explain right now.

298
01:06:13,044 --> 01:06:16,255
I just can't, you're gonna
have to trust me that's all.

299
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:17,882
Trust you for what?

300
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,510
Well, I'm gonna have to take
Benji for a couple of days.

301
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:23,096
Why, what has he done?

302
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:25,598
Cindy, he hasn't done
anything and I'm gonna

303
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,017
take very good care of
him, I promise you that.

304
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:29,669
Well, if he hasn't
done anything,

305
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,229
why do you want
to take him away?

306
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:34,857
And why does this
man want to take him?

307
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:38,820
Mary, listen to
me, all of you.

308
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:42,240
I work for the United
States government.

309
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:46,536
And Benji is the key to a
very important situation.

310
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:52,583
Now it's my fault he's involved
in all this and I'm sorry.

311
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:56,713
I had no idea it was gonna
become so complicated.

312
01:06:57,004 --> 01:06:59,632
But it has and that's
all I can say right now.

313
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:02,301
Does that mean Benji's a spy?

314
01:07:02,593 --> 01:07:04,053
No, he's not a
spy, but he is very

315
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:05,638
important to the United States.

316
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,725
Hey, that's neat, he
might become famous.

317
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:10,476
This is not neat.

318
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:12,103
No Cindy, you're right.

319
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:13,395
It's not neat.

320
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:16,315
But he is important
and necessary, okay?

321
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,401
But what did he do,
why is he necessary?

322
01:07:18,693 --> 01:07:20,361
Honey, I can't tell
you that right now,

323
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:24,490
but I'll explain it to you
when I bring him back, okay?

324
01:07:24,782 --> 01:07:25,782
Hmm?

325
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:27,576
Good girl.

326
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,414
Mary, I'm sorry.

327
01:07:31,706 --> 01:07:32,957
Oh, that's okay, I guess.

328
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,609
But you will take
good care of him?

329
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:36,878
I will and you better
call the police right away.

330
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:41,090
And if he wakes up
point that right at him.

331
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:42,382
Come on, Benji.

332
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:47,764
But I don't know
anything about guns.

333
01:07:48,055 --> 01:07:49,724
The only thing
you have to know is

334
01:07:50,016 --> 01:07:53,394
you point it at him and
he won't bother you.

335
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,983
Cindy, I think you'll
be very proud of Benji

336
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,986
and I'll see you
in a few days, huh?

337
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,875
Far out, Benji's a spy.

338
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,752
He is not a spy.

339
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:20,463
I bet that guy's a spy, too.

340
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:22,964
- Mary!
- Mary!

341
01:08:26,427 --> 01:08:28,805
You stay exactly
where you are.

342
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:30,890
Kids get behind the bed.

343
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,603
Would you please send
the police to room 701?

344
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,855
Yes, I did, the police.

345
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,147
Thank you.

346
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:43,443
Where's the dog?

347
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:44,612
The brown one.

348
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,406
He's safely away from here.

349
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:49,298
Is he with
Chandler Dietrich?

350
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,492
Is that who that was?

351
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:53,162
That doesn't happen to
be any of your business.

352
01:08:53,454 --> 01:08:56,916
I suppose he told you he
was a United States agent?

353
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,835
That's not your
business, either.

354
01:08:59,126 --> 01:09:00,336
Yes, lady, it is.

355
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:02,755
You see, Chandler Dietrich
was found this morning

356
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:04,567
at the bottom of a
river in New Jersey.

357
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,884
The man who was here is
not Chandler Dietrich

358
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,336
and he's not an agent for
the United States government.

359
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:12,348
Now will you please put down
that gun so I can go after him?

360
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,351
I suppose you're gonna
tell me you are an agent.

361
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:16,643
What else?

362
01:09:16,769 --> 01:09:18,020
I don't believe you.

363
01:09:18,312 --> 01:09:19,632
Well, we can
wait for the police

364
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:21,456
and wait 30 minutes
for them to get here,

365
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,131
another hour for
them to check it out

366
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:24,878
and by that time your
Dietrich imposter

367
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:28,281
could be halfway
to Saudi Arabia.

368
01:09:28,573 --> 01:09:31,409
Of course, it's not
terribly important.

369
01:09:32,994 --> 01:09:35,371
I'm just trying to save the
life of a top scientist,

370
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:39,417
preserve a project of worldwide
significance, no big deal.

371
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:45,423
Well, say something!

372
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,550
I don't know what to say!

373
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,760
Okay.

374
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,514
How about say
goodbye to your dog?

375
01:09:53,806 --> 01:09:55,224
Because this man who has him,

376
01:09:55,516 --> 01:09:58,769
once he's through,
he'll probably kill him.

377
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,189
I can't believe that.

378
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:04,400
Chandler is a very nice man.

379
01:10:04,692 --> 01:10:06,444
Lady, he's an
international thief.

380
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:08,905
He's a probable murderer
and what your dog

381
01:10:09,196 --> 01:10:10,615
probably has tattooed somewhere

382
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:12,366
on his body is
worth nothing to him.

383
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:14,011
If anyone else gets
their hands on it.

384
01:10:14,035 --> 01:10:15,411
Now, If he's killed a person,

385
01:10:15,703 --> 01:10:18,873
is he going to stop
at a little brown dog?

386
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:28,549
I'm sorry I had to say those
things, but you won't be.

387
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,460
Well, Benji boy, it
looks like we made it.

388
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:08,130
Do you still plan
to dispose of him?

389
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:12,635
You see, the wife and I sort
of like the little chap.

390
01:11:12,927 --> 01:11:14,512
What are you doing here?

391
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,306
Well, to be frightfully
honest we thought

392
01:11:17,598 --> 01:11:19,517
it might have
crossed your mind to,

393
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,395
as you say, run out on us.

394
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:23,729
Run out on you?

395
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,613
There's nothing to run out on.

396
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:36,242
You see you didn't
complete your half

397
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:38,202
of the bargain, you
let him get away.

398
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,079
Yes, of
course, I suppose

399
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:42,665
full value wasn't
received, but all in all,

400
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:44,500
a partnership's like a marriage,

401
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:47,378
you know, for
better or for worse.

402
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:52,341
And we did expose ourselves
to an enormous amount of risk.

403
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:55,469
Yes, I
suppose that's true.

404
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:59,765
Still, if you would have
delivered the goods.

405
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:04,020
Uh, I do hope this
Isn't going to be a problem.

406
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,232
No, of course, not.

407
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:12,653
I suppose you do deserve
something for your effort.

408
01:12:12,945 --> 01:12:14,697
Shall we try to hit
on a compromise?

409
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:53,052
Under
the circumstances,

410
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:56,030
I think those are
very fair terms.

411
01:12:56,322 --> 01:12:57,406
What do you think, my dear?

412
01:12:57,698 --> 01:12:59,492
I think
it's quite honorable.

413
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:01,619
Well, shall
we have a drink then?

414
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,037
Excellent idea.

415
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:04,330
Come along, Elizabeth.

416
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:06,499
Well, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

417
01:13:06,791 --> 01:13:07,791
My dear.

418
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:11,545
Oh, by the way, you
never said about the dog.

419
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:14,673
Oh, he goes overboard,
but then so do you.

420
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,220
Benji!

421
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,305
Benji!

422
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,766
Call him again.

423
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:41,058
Benji!

424
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,020
Come here, Benji!

425
01:21:04,685 --> 01:21:07,020
So, anyway,
Benji just happened to be

426
01:21:07,312 --> 01:21:09,231
going to the right
place at the right time.

427
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:11,441
For security reasons
someone decided

428
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,860
to let him carry
the coordinate code

429
01:21:14,152 --> 01:21:16,071
for the secret meeting
with the scientist.

430
01:21:16,363 --> 01:21:18,448
What's so important
about the scientist?

431
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,576
They think he's close
to a formula that'll

432
01:21:20,867 --> 01:21:23,078
turn one barrel of
oil into 10 or 12.

433
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,080
And you can guess how many folks

434
01:21:25,372 --> 01:21:26,957
would like to get
their hands on that.

435
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,543
The whole thing sounds
like a James Bond movie.

436
01:21:29,835 --> 01:21:34,131
Yeah, except in a movie
I'd be Robert Redford

437
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:36,842
and you'd be Genevieve Bujold.

438
01:21:38,385 --> 01:21:40,887
Anyway, it was a very
simple and very clever plan

439
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:43,849
except the man we thought was
Dietrich found out about it,

440
01:21:44,141 --> 01:21:46,935
eliminated the real
Dietrich and took his place.

441
01:21:47,227 --> 01:21:50,939
He was gonna sell the scientist
to the highest bidder.

442
01:21:51,231 --> 01:21:53,066
Would have worked
too, if Benji hadn't

443
01:21:53,358 --> 01:21:56,069
missed that plane
change in Athens.

444
01:21:57,487 --> 01:22:00,240
Hey, you're not living up
to your part of the bargain!

445
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:02,576
If I'm gonna talk,
you've gotta pull.

446
01:22:02,868 --> 01:22:04,244
So talk.

447
01:22:04,536 --> 01:22:06,163
This person you
thought was Dietrich,

448
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,165
how did he found
out about all this?

449
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:09,617
Oh, I don't know,

450
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,126
security leak
somewhere, I guess.

451
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:12,794
Happens all the time.

452
01:22:13,086 --> 01:22:16,131
By the way, how's Benji,
any signs of wear and tear?

453
01:22:16,423 --> 01:22:18,925
I don't think
Benji's ever been better.
