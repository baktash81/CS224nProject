1
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,960
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

2
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,200
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,800
If I should die before I wake,

4
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,480
I pray the Lord my soul do take.

5
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,200
God bless Mrs Higgins.

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,920
God bless Mrs Denham.

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,360
And God bless the trustees,
and please make us good children.

8
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,520
Forever and ever. Amen.

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,080
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night.

10
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night.

11
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,200
And God bless my sister, Mary. Amen.

12
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,760
Please take very good care
of my duck and my pony.

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Please see that they don't catch pneumonia.

14
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,520
Spunky.

15
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,920
You'll get me in trouble.

16
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,000
What you need, Spunky, is a hot lemonade.

17
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Will you be quiet?

18
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,520
Spunky, do you like the superintendent?

19
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
What? What?

20
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,720
Do you like Mrs Denham?

21
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Do you like the trustees?

22
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,040
Do you like me, Spunky?

23
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
Spunk?

24
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Good morning. Nothing must be allowed
to go wrong today. Absolutely nothing.

25
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,480
I hope to please all the trustees, but I'm
anxious that we make a good impression

26
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,560
- on Mr Morgan.
- I think I understand.

27
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,520
You think? Why, that isn't good enough.

28
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,760
Read that, Henrietta.
Read it carefully.

29
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,800
Mr Morgan is our richest trustee.
He's coming here today for the first time.

30
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,560
If he is really pleased with the orphanage,
I believe he'll double his donation to us.

31
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,320
- Oh, how wonderful.
- Exactly.

32
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
- Seven o'clock. Call the children.
- Very well.

33
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,120
Henrietta, I forgot. Mr James Wyckoff
will be among the trustees who will visit.

34
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,400
I want you to make sure a large bottle
of Mr Wyckoffs famous cough mixture

35
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,800
is displayed in our medicine cabinet.

36
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll see to it.

37
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,400
Elizabeth Blair, what have you got
to say for yourself?

38
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,200
Oh, my goodness!

39
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,800
Elizabeth Blair, come into my office - at once.

40
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,040
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,800
This is the second time in a month you've
been called to the superintendents office.

42
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,120
- Yes, ma'am.
- The last time you were here,

43
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,320
your sister Mary was also brought before me.

44
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,720
You both admitted that you had been
singing and dancing without permission.

45
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Do you know why you are here this time?

46
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,680
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then tell me why.

47
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,640
Don't you know?

48
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Quiet. Now, Elizabeth,
tell me why you are here.

49
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,640
- Because I took a pony to bed with me.
- Child, you're absolutely uncontrollable.

50
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,800
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,720
I am well aware that your late father
and mother were in the theatrical profession

52
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,840
and that you came here
with no sense of discipline.

53
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
I have made every allowance for you.

54
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,160
But when you bring animals
into the dormitory, I must act.

55
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,760
That's what my daddy and mummy
used to do.

56
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,000
- What?
- Act.

57
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,880
Don't be impudent.

58
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,440
Now, your pony and your duck
will be sold immediately.

59
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,920
Please, Mrs Higgins, please.

60
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,880
I'll be good, but don't take Spunky
away from me, and my poor little duck.

61
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
And why not?

62
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Because my pony and my duck
are notjust ordinary animals.

63
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,480
My daddy and my mommy
teached them to do tricks on the stage.

64
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,000
And just what is your duck trained to do?

65
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,880
My duck does a wonderful trick.
My duck can lay an egg.

66
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,320
- And just what is so wonderful about that?
- Well, can you lay an egg?

67
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,880
Oh, excuse me.

68
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,200
Elizabeth, I have decided to
get rid of your pony and your duck.

69
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,440
- They will be sent away this morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

70
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,600
No sniffling, now.

71
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,440
- Yes, ma'am.
- What?

72
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,120
No, ma'am.

73
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,800
There, baby, don't cry.

74
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,240
Mary, don't let them.

75
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Please don't let them
send Spunky and my duck away.

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, darling... Now, listen to me, dear.

77
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,720
Listen very carefully
to what I'm going to tell you.

78
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
All right.

79
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,520
Spunky would be very unhappy
if he saw you crying.

80
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,080
- I suppose so.
- You don't want to make him unhappy?

81
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,520
- Oh, no.
- All right, then.

82
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
When it's time to say goodbye to Spunky,

83
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,240
you'll have to be just as brave
as brave can be,

84
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,280
so you can make him brave too. See?

85
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,320
- Spunky and I are such awfully good friends.
- I know, dear.

86
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,920
All right, Mary. I'll try and be brave
about Spunky and my duck.

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,680
Good for you. Look,
how'd you like to help me get lunch?

88
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,200
I'd love that. I like to make things to eat
and I especially like to eat them.

89
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,600
Oh, my goodness!

90
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,800
Singing in the dining room! Is this
the kind of manners you teach them?

91
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,160
Of course not, Mr Wyckoff. They've been told
they must be quiet at mealtimes.

92
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, they've been told, have they? Well, just
telling them doesn't seem to be good enough.

93
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,320
Perhaps a bit of real discipline
wouldn't do them any harm.

94
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,520
- Have you been told not to sing?
- Yes, sir.

95
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,280
Then why do you do it?
You're a bad and wicked child.

96
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,600
She isn't a bad and wicked child.
She's just a baby.

97
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,000
She was making the children laugh.
It wasn't her fault.

98
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,320
I told her to sing for the children.

99
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
And who are you, young woman?

100
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,880
- Are you an orphan too?
- Yes, sir.

101
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,320
Then what right have you to be here,
living on charity at your age?

102
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,480
I'll tell you what I'm doing here.

103
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
I scrub the floors, make the beds, wash,
iron and cook from morning until night.

104
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,480
- Quiet!
- I won't be quiet.

105
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,080
- You're mean and hateful to frighten children.
- Report to me after the meeting.

106
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,320
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,480
The rest of you, go to the yard and wait there
till it's time for inspection by our trustees.

108
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,320
<i>Yes, Mrs Higgins.</i>

109
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,400
- Aren't you going to join us, Mr Morgan?
- What?

110
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,360
- Yes, of course, the meeting of the trustees.
- Of course.

111
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,200
Would you mind beginning without me?
I'd like to look about the place.

112
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,040
- But we have important matters...
- I'll join you in a few minutes.

113
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,280
- Well, of course...
- Thank you.

114
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,840
She isn't wicked...

115
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,920
- Oh... I'm sorry.
- Please don't get up.

116
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,760
I just wanted to tell you how much I admired
your spunk in standing up for that youngster.

117
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
- She didn't mean any harm.
- Of course she didn't.

118
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,280
I don't think singing that song
was such a terrible crime.

119
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,880
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed your playing, too.

120
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,760
Thank you very much.

121
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,880
Tell me, where in the world did that youngster
pick up such a charming song?

122
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,200
- Well, I write them and...
- You write music?

123
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,840
- If you can call it music.
- I call it delightful music.

124
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,720
Look here, would you promise not to
give me away if I made a terrible confession?

125
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
Of course.

126
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,880
The deep, dark secret in my life is that now
and then I compose a bit of music myself.

127
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,480
But isn't it fun, getting a melody
and then finding just the right words for it?

128
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,160
Great. You know, the happiest days of my life

129
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,240
were those I spent studying music
under Professor Auspitzer, in Brünn.

130
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,280
Those must have been happy days.

131
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,360
But that isn't all of it.
I love the people in the little Austrian towns.

132
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,800
They're so proud because their music
is the music of the world.

133
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,120
It seems that most everyone in those quaint
little villages has a "Hello, neighbour" smile.

134
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,120
They love the simple things in life.

135
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,560
The simple things in life.
That almost sounds like the words of a song.

136
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll remember the suggestion.
Perhaps someday they might make a song.

137
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
- Will you do me a great favour?
- Certainly.

138
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,720
I have to run along to the meeting, but I'll
be back. Will you play me some more music?

139
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,440
- If you'd like to hear it and Mrs Higgins...
- I asked to.

140
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,360
- All right.
- Until later, then?

141
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
And what's this item?

142
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,560
"Sandboxes and swings"?

143
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,080
It's a problem to keep them occupied.

144
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,360
When I was young,
we didn't have a play problem,

145
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,080
because we didn't have time to play. No.

146
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,000
"Floor runner for the dormitory. "

147
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,240
- What's the matter with the linoleum?
- It's been so cold this winter.

148
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,640
The children have coughed so badly
that I've been worried.

149
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,840
No need for that.

150
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,840
Madam, you have no doubt heard
of the famous Wyckoffs cough mixture.

151
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
Of course.

152
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,440
I have manufactured and sold
that cough mixture for many years.

153
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,880
Anyone taking it regularly will never cough.

154
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,000
I would suggest that
you lay in a fresh supply.

155
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
- Very well.
- When I was young, I lived in Maine,

156
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,960
where the weather was 20 below zero.

157
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,480
In those days, we didn't even have linoleum.
And look at me now.

158
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,800
When I was young, I lived in Maine, where
the weather was about a thousand below zero.

159
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,360
No, no, Mrs Denham.
No carpets, no linoleum, no nothin'.

160
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,800
And look at me now.

161
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Madam, is this the kind of respect
you teach them?!

162
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh, my goodness!

163
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,920
- How dare you take my hat and coat!
- I beg your pardon, but those are mine.

164
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
- Yours?
- Yes.

165
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, yes. I see.

166
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,960
- This eyesight of mine is bad, you know.
- I was only playing.

167
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,640
There, Mrs Higgins.
That's what comes of letting them play.

168
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
- Ridiculing their benefactors.
- I'm sorry.

169
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,440
It seems to me that this child
is absolutely incorrigible.

170
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
Every time I see her,
she's making a disturbance.

171
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,080
- She is rather a problem.
- Problem?

172
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,320
She's the sort of problem that might be
better solved at a public institution.

173
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,840
<i>- We couldn't send her away.</i>
- I say you shall send her away!

174
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,680
I say she'll have to go to a public institution.

175
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,080
She'll have to do nothing of the kind.

176
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,920
If she's sent away,
I shan't contribute another cent.

177
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
- Now, Mr Morgan, you can't...
- Oh, yes, I can.

178
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Mrs Higgins, I'd like to talk to you
and to this little girl privately.

179
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,400
- Your office would be the best place.
- Why, of course, Mr Morgan.

180
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,840
Young lady, I've got a great idea.

181
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,840
Would you like me to tell it to you?

182
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,800
- Yes.
- Elizabeth.

183
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,040
Excuse me. Yes, sir.

184
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,800
That's better.

185
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,560
Now look here. Here's the secret.

186
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,600
How would you like it if you and I
got to be very, very good friends?

187
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,200
- I don't think I would like it, sir.
- Why, Elizabeth!

188
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
I would like to talk to Elizabeth alone.
Do you mind?

189
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,760
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

190
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,480
Tell me. Why wouldn't you like to be
friends with me?

191
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,000
- Oh, just because.
- Just because?

192
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,320
You've got to give me
a much better reason than that.

193
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,560
Well, it's just because
when grown-ups come to visit us

194
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:11,200
we have to say "Yes, ma'am"
and "No, sir" and smile all the time.

195
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,400
- Can you keep a secret?
- A secret?

196
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,840
Mm-hm.

197
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,720
- I won't tell anybody.
- Shake.

198
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,000
Now, here's the secret:

199
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,640
You don't have to say
any of those things to me.

200
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,760
You see, all this business
out here is new to me.

201
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,480
- My regular business is being a lawyer.
- What's a lawyer?

202
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,600
If you ever get into trouble, a lawyer
is a person who gets you out of trouble.

203
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Oh, my, I could use one almost every day.

204
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,640
- Tell me, what's your name, sweet?
- Elizabeth Blair.

205
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,040
Elizabeth Blair. I've got
a much better name for you than that.

206
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,840
If I had my way, I'd call you Curly Top.

207
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,040
That's what my daddy used to call me,
and my mommy too.

208
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,400
They did? I'll bet you're
just as wise as wise can be.

209
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,800
- Well, I can recite.
- Recite? Recite what?

210
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,920
- Oh, poems.
- What kind of poems?

211
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,600
"Before I was a little girl,
I was a little bird.

212
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,320
"I could not laugh, I could not dance,
I could not speak a word.

213
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,200
"But all about the woods I went
and up into the sky.

214
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,600
"And isn't it a pity I've forgotten how to fly?"

215
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,440
I think that's the loveliest poem I ever heard.

216
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,000
- I know more.
- Go right ahead.

217
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,480
"I wake in the morning early,
and always the very first thing,

218
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,280
"I poke out my head, and I sit up in bed,
and I sing and I sing and I sing. "

219
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,840
- I know more.
- I'll bet you do.

220
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,200
But listen, I've got a friend that...

221
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,280
- Oh, I bet that isn't true.
- What?

222
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,080
You said you had a friend.
I bet you have lots of friends.

223
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,840
Curly, you are an old flatterer.

224
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,080
- Is that something bad?
- Of course not, darling. Now, look here.

225
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm pretty sure this friend of mine
would like you.

226
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,880
I think he'd like to give you a beautiful home,
lovely dresses to wear, dozens of dolls,

227
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,640
and send you to the grandest kind of school
and all sorts of nice things like that.

228
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,120
How could your friend do all that? I thought
only daddies could do such nice things.

229
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,760
Well, being a lawyer,
that's where that comes in.

230
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,520
You are too young to understand, but I could
arrange with my friend to legally adopt you.

231
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,560
All I want you to tell me is how you'd like it if
my friend could do those nice things for you.

232
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,640
- Would you want him to?
- I don't think I could do it.

233
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,480
You couldn't? Why not?

234
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,720
Do I have to say right off?

235
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,800
You mean you want time to think it over?

236
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,480
- Could I come back and tell you in a while?
- Why, of course. I'll wait for you right here.

237
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,880
- Promise?
- Promise.

238
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,120
Cross your heart?

239
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,800
Mary!

240
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,680
Mary! Oh, Mary!

241
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,040
Mary! Mary!

242
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
Mary!

243
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,400
Mrs Denham, suppose that youngster
had a real chance in life.

244
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,280
Suppose someone gave her
everything money can buy.

245
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Of course, we always hope
our children may be adopted.

246
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,280
But Elizabeth's case
presents a special problem. You see...

247
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,240
There's no human problem
that can't be solved by kindness.

248
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,280
- By Jove, Mrs Denham, I'll do it.
- You mean that you'll adopt Elizabeth?

249
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,640
On one condition. She must
never know that I'm her guardian.

250
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,040
Why not?

251
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,200
Because she's always had to
give thanks for every mouthful.

252
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,880
She's never gonna have to be grateful to me.

253
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,640
From now on, she's going to have
all the lovely things in life,

254
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,880
just because she has a right to them.

255
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:08,200
- But the child will have to be told something.
- That's right. Let's see.

256
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,520
I've got it. Tell her that I'm acting for a client.

257
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,520
We'll say that she's being adopted
by a man by the name of...

258
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,360
- Let's call him Hiram Jones.
- Oh, Mr Morgan...

259
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,840
Before you go on, there's something
about Elizabeth that you must know.

260
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,600
Come in.

261
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,240
Well, have you made up your mind?

262
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,040
- You haven't? Why not?
- Could I tell your friend?

263
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,000
My friend?

264
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
Oh!

265
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,000
You mean Mr Jones. Hiram Jones, hm?
What is it you want to tell him?

266
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,640
I would like to tell him that I'd love to go and
live in his house if my sister could come too.

267
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,320
- Your sister?
- Yes, my sister, Mary.

268
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,800
- She works in the kitchen. There she is.
- This is Mary Blair, Mr Morgan.

269
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,760
We've met.

270
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,560
Isn't my sister pretty?
And she's awfully nice, too.

271
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,080
Mr Morgan, I'm very grateful to you -

272
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,760
I mean, to your friend -
for wanting to adopt Curly.

273
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,080
But you see, when my father and mother...

274
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,040
- Darling, could you run outside?
- Must I?

275
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,800
- I think you'd better.
- All right.

276
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,800
You see, Mr Morgan, at the time
my father and mother were killed...

277
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,760
- Killed?
- Yes, in an automobile accident.

278
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,880
- I'm so sorry.
- At the hospital, just before they...

279
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,040
just before they died,

280
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,680
I promised them Curly and I
would never be separated.

281
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,520
I couldn't break that promise, Mr Morgan.
She needs me. And I need her.

282
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,160
I understand.

283
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,960
I hope you'll thank your friend for us.
Please tell him how grateful we are, but...

284
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,160
Goodbye, Mr Morgan.

285
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,600
- I like that.
- Thank you, Aunt Genevieve.

286
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,640
- One of your own compositions?
- The melody came to me only this evening.

287
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,680
Quite the nicest thing you've ever done,
Edward. It has real feeling.

288
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,840
Your little nephew has real feeling,
my darling, just like anyone else.

289
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm going upstairs to write some letters.

290
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I'll come down and kiss you good night
before I go to bed.

291
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,640
- Promise?
- I do.

292
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
All right, it's a bargain.

293
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,480
In the meantime I shall be thinking up
at least six new compliments for you.

294
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,440
Edward?

295
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,640
Edward.

296
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,000
- Aunt Genevieve.
- Well, I'm waiting.

297
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,520
- For what?
- For my compliments, of course.

298
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,520
- You promised me an even half-dozen.
- So I did.

299
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,920
I shan't be able to keep my promise.
I've been very busy.

300
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,120
- Busy.
- Word of honour.

301
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,640
I've been playing an old and charming game.
I've been daydreaming.

302
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,040
Just suppose, for example...
See that painting there?

303
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,000
But of course I do. I'll have you know my
eyesight's every bit as good as it ever was.

304
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,040
Suppose the figure of that lovely child
should suddenly come to life.

305
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Suppose it smiled at you and waved its hand.

306
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,880
- What would you do?
- I'd call a doctor.

307
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,040
Now, Edward, now, now, take it easy.

308
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,600
Well, the truth of the matter is,
I just love your game.

309
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,440
I'd adore it if the child in that picture could
come into this home and actually live with us.

310
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,920
Do you really mean that, Aunt Genevieve?

311
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,720
There's nothing that makes a home so happy
as the sound of a chilïs laughter.

312
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,200
- By Jove, I'll do it.
- Do what?

313
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,960
We'll open our place at Southampton. I can
arrange for all the necessary legal details.

314
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,080
You can do all the shopping required:
Dresses and all the gadgets that go with them.

315
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,920
We'll have a glorious summer.
I'll send the limousine out next week...

316
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,280
- For what?
- For that lovely child in the painting.

317
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,200
Now, Edward, game or no game,
you sound to me a little tetched in the head.

318
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,800
I've gone mad, Aunt Genevieve.
Delightfully mad.

319
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,520
- I think I will send for that doctor.
- I should if I were you.

320
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,600
And before the doctor arrives,
let me be the first to congratulate you.

321
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,760
- Congratulate me? For what?
- My dear, you're about to become a mother.

322
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,200
- Bye, Mrs Denham.
- Bye.

323
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,240
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Mrs Higgins.

324
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,440
Goodbye.

325
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,720
Goodbye, Mrs Higgins.

326
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,880
- All right, Mister.
- Very good, Miss.

327
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,520
Goodbye, Jeanie. Goodbye, Betsy.

328
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

329
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,160
Henrietta, what are you blubbering about?

330
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,840
I can't help it. I'm so happy.

331
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,840
There's no need to be sentimental.

332
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,040
What are you crying for?

333
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,600
Why shouldn't I? Why can't I be happy too?

334
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,640
Mrs Higgins said that
now we're going to live in high society

335
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,120
we must always remember to be grand ladies.

336
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
Oh, I won't forget.

337
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
My word!

338
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,560
Will you tell Mr Morgan
that Miss Blair and her sister are here?

339
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Hello, Mister.

340
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,480
Elizabeth.

341
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,520
Am I to understand that the livestock
are also calling on Mr Morgan?

342
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,520
- They are.
- My word!

343
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,120
- A Miss Blair and her sister to see you, sir.
- Aunt Genevieve, they're here.

344
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
Hello.

345
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,440
Curly!

346
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,800
Well, where in the world
did the menagerie come from?

347
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,920
- They were right behind us all the time.
- Right behind you?

348
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,560
Yes, sir, in the back seat.

349
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,160
Aunt Genevieve, meet our new family.

350
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,680
- Mary, Elizabeth, this is Aunt Genevieve.
- My dears, I'm very glad to see you both.

351
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
- Won't you come in?
- Hello.

352
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Hello!

353
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Oh, Reynolds, will you see to it that our
other guests are comfortably taken care of?

354
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,160
You mean the, uh... livestock, sir?

355
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,360
Right.

356
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,280
Butling to a pony and a duck!

357
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,560
Now, no nonsense now.

358
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,040
I say, do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

359
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,240
My word!

360
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,840
- How do you like your new home?
- It's wonderful.

361
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,520
- Would you like to look round?
- Mm-hm.

362
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,800
But first I would like to see where
Spunky and Betsy are going to sleep.

363
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh, no, Edward.
Elizabeth must rest before dinner.

364
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,000
- Come now, Aunt...
- Mr Jones has given strict orders.

365
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,160
Mr Jones insists that Elizabeth and Mary
have only the best of care.

366
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,240
- I see. Well, we can't argue with Mr Jones.
- That's what I thought.

367
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,640
All right, then, Mr Jones wins.
But I'll see you all at dinner, hm?

368
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
Come, dear.

369
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Breakfast at eight. Luncheon at one.

370
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,960
Dinner at seven.

371
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,600
My word!

372
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,920
I think this will help you, Miss.

373
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,880
Allow me.

374
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,160
Now I'm just like a grown-up.

375
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,160
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Miss.

376
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,960
Why, I didn't do anything.

377
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,880
- Yes, Miss?
- Wouldn't you like to sit down too?

378
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,040
Well...

379
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,720
<i>- Coffee on the terrace, Reynolds.</i>
- Very good, sir.

380
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,920
Could I say something
to Mr Reynolds, privately?

381
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,040
I think it could be arranged.
But don't stay too long.

382
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,200
I won't.

383
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,360
I want to thank you for a very nice dinner, sir.

384
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,560
Thank you, Miss.

385
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,640
You wish for something else, Miss?
What is it, Miss?

386
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Couldn't you come down here
so I could talk to you?

387
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,680
<i>Oh, my word, you are a package!</i>

388
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,840
Will you be my friend?

389
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,080
Whenever I do anything wrong at the table,
will you always stop me?

390
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,240
I will indeed, Miss.

391
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,680
- Promise?
- I do, Miss.

392
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,240
I'll always attempt to serve you
as if... as if you were a princess.

393
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,000
A princess? My, you are nice.

394
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,520
- Happy?
- I didn't know such happiness existed.

395
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,680
Promise to let me know
if Mr Jones can do more for you?

396
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,120
He couldn't do anything more.

397
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,400
- But you could do me a great favour.
- Done. What?

398
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,280
Tell me all about Mr Jones.

399
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,400
Not knowing him or even what he looks like
makes him seem such a strange person.

400
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,640
He is a strange sort of person, Mary.
Very strange.

401
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,760
Perhaps I can best explain him to you if I tell
you what he said just before you came here.

402
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,320
Do tell me.

403
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,760
He told me that all of his life
he's had a hunger in his heart.

404
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,320
A hunger to love and be loved
just for himself.

405
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,280
Said he'd travelled all over the world
- Europe, Egypt, the Orient -

406
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,280
he'd searched everywhere for a simple
sort of happiness and companionship.

407
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,600
- He never found it?
- Not real happiness.

408
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,480
He will find it someday. He must.

409
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,120
Maybe you're right, Mary.
Happiness may come to Jones, and soon.

410
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:36,160
Just before he sailed for Europe, he said that,
at last, there was... hope in his heart.

411
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,600
I wish I could thank him for all he's done.

412
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,720
Tell him how grateful I am for all
the happiness he's brought to Curly and me.

413
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,560
Just knowing that you and Curly have
found happiness here, that'll make him happy.

414
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,720
I can promise you that.

415
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,840
This is not a dream, is it?

416
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,440
No, darling. Come to bed now.

417
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,800
- Good night. Did you say your prayers?
- Mm-hm.

418
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,240
- Mary?
- Yes, dear?

419
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,280
My pyjamas feel awfully nice.
What are they made of, Mary?

420
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,160
- Silk.
- Silk?

421
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,400
Oh, my goodness!

422
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,560
Good night, dear.

423
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,720
Good night.

424
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,520
Mary.

425
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,240
Uncle Edward said that Mr Jones was
going to send you to a music school.

426
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,920
Uh-huh.

427
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,080
And he said that he was going to give me
a pony cart and lots of pretty dresses.

428
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,800
I know, dear. It's all so wonderful,
I can hardly believe it.

429
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,880
But we mustn't talk about it any more tonight.
It's time to go to sleep. Good night.

430
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,040
Good night.

431
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,760
Mary... is Mr Hiram Jones a very rich man?

432
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,200
He must be, darling.

433
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,320
Do you think maybe he could be
the richest man in the world?

434
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,760
Mm, he might be.

435
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,720
The richest man in all the world?
Oh, my goodness!

436
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,800
- Your Southampton bills, sir.
- Thank you.

437
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,360
Two aquaplane boards. Don't you think
it's dangerous for that youngster to...?

438
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,760
Dangerous? That child swims like a fish.

439
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,080
I really believe
she's Neptune's daughter in disguise.

440
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,680
I hope you enjoyed your lunch,
Miss Elizabeth.

441
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,680
- I always like to eat.
- A splendid habit, Miss, if I may say so.

442
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,760
- Did my pony and duck have a nice lunch?
- Oh, quite, Miss.

443
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,120
- Are you going to give me a nice dinner?
- Without fail, Miss.

444
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,800
- I wish you wouldn't bow so much.
- I'm sorry, Miss.

445
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,440
There you go again.

446
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,120
You'll make my back ache.

447
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,360
My word!

448
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,560
<i>- Isn't that the funniest picture ever?</i>
- Mm-hm.

449
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,560
Curly, careful of your eyes in this sunlight.

450
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh, this won't hurt my eyes.
This is just the funny papers.

451
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,840
Isn't that the one I've read you
at least a dozen times since Sunday?

452
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,000
Mm-hm.

453
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,280
- Will you read it to me again?
- Yes, if you like.

454
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,080
But suppose we wait until later
in the afternoon, after you've had your nap?

455
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,200
All right. I won't forget.

456
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,560
Jimmie, the Atlantic Ocean seems rather quiet
without you splashing about.

457
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,960
- Why aren't you swimming today?
- I couldn't make it today. I had to work.

458
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,320
Work? I hope you don't call
flying that airplane of yours work.

459
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,000
Mary loves to fly.
She's been up lots of times with me.

460
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,720
Yes, she's told me all about it.
You've been very nice to Mary this summer.

461
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,720
- That isn't hard to do.
- No, I gathered you didn't find that hard work.

462
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,680
Mrs Graham, I'd like to
talk to you about Mary.

463
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,520
- Well, there's no law against it.
- Mary is a wonderful girl, Mrs Graham.

464
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,960
We've had grand times
together this summer.

465
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,360
Seems that, no matter what,
we always like the same things.

466
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,440
She likes to fly with me,
she's a beautiful dancer,

467
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,040
and we're both crazy about
all kinds of outdoor sport.

468
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,800
I'd like to talk about Mary
to her guardian, Mr Jones.

469
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,440
- But the catch is that he's in Europe now.
- What would you like to say to Mr Jones?

470
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,360
Well, you see, Mary doesn't want to
make up her mind about anything -

471
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,480
I mean, anything important -
without Mr Jones' permission.

472
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,920
- I thought maybe I could write him a letter.
- What about?

473
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,120
Well, I... I really can't tell you that,
Mrs Graham.

474
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,480
- I haven't even told Mary about that.
- Oh, I see.

475
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,440
- Do you think I ought to write to Mr Jones...
- Jimmie.

476
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,920
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Jimmie.

477
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,680
The water was wonderful.
Aunt Genevieve, did you sell him a ticket?

478
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,440
- Mary, I forgot.
- A ticket? For what?

479
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,880
Don't tell me you don't know about it.
We're giving a show.

480
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,080
- Who is? What's this all about?
- It's Curly's show, really.

481
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,240
I'm just going to help out.
It's a benefit performance.

482
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,880
- A benefit? For whom?
- Curly had the most charming idea, Jimmie.

483
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,960
She couldn't forget her friends
in the orphanage.

484
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,320
She wanted to raise some money
to buy playthings for them.

485
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,200
- It was so nice of you to come, Mrs Denham.
- Wild horses couldn't have kept me away.

486
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,560
Do you know,
this is the biggest thrill of my life.

487
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:05,240
- I'd try awfully hard to make you happy.
- Jimmie, you're pretty swell,

488
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,320
but I... I just couldn't marry you.

489
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,440
Is there someone else?

490
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,000
- I can't tell you that.
- Well, I know there is, all right.

491
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,880
I watched you at dinner tonight
and I watched you...

492
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,320
Well, you're always looking at Mr Morgan.

493
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,960
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because I don't like him.

494
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,400
He's got a swelled head, and just because
he's got all the money in the world, he...

495
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,360
Jimmie... I won't let you
talk about him that way.

496
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,360
I'm sorry.

497
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,560
- It's all right.
- I'll always love you, Mary.

498
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,480
Even... even if you say
you can't really care for me.

499
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,280
Oh, Jimmie...

500
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,400
Do stop that ridiculous prowling about.
You act as if you had the heebie-jeebies.

501
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,120
- I'm just restless.
- You've been restless for the last three days.

502
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,680
Ever since you arrived to see Curly's show.

503
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,240
Can't you think of something more
interesting to talk about? I'm just nervous.

504
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,920
I might be able to change the subject
if I really put my mind to it.

505
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,680
- It'd make a hit with me if you will.
- Very well.

506
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,800
Let me see, what shall we talk about?

507
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,680
- Have you seen Mary since dinner?
- Nope, I haven't.

508
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,960
She, uh... she went out somewhere
with Jimmie, didn't she?

509
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,200
- How should I know?
- Don't they make an adorable couple?

510
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,960
- Do they?
- He's very much in love with her.

511
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,840
He's a wonderful catch. He comes into money
on both sides of his family.

512
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,360
He does, does he? Maybe that's
the reason he's got a swelled head.

513
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,120
That, and the brass buttons
on his trick uniform.

514
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,480
Why, Edward, I didn't know
you'd ever noticed Jimmie.

515
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,800
I am surprised to learn that you've even
observed the kind of clothes he wears.

516
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,000
Conceited young idler.

517
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,720
- Will you stop laughing?
- I will not.

518
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,480
Edward Morgan, insanely jealous,
and acting like a sixteen-year-old Romeo.

519
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,200
Oh, dear, this is
the happiest moment of my life.

520
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,440
I'm not at all jealous. Do you think
I care anything about Mary Blair?

521
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,600
The only reason she's here is because it was
impossible to take Elizabeth without her.

522
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,440
- I'm not in the least interested in Mary.
- I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

523
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,920
- Relieved? Why?
- Edward, I've been noticing things.

524
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,560
And I had convinced myself
that you'd grown very fond of Mary.

525
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,320
- In which case, there might be complications.
- Complications?

526
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,680
I'll try to make myself clear.

527
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,800
I believe that Jimmie Rogers means to
propose to Mary before the summer is over.

528
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,440
- How do you know that?
- I looked at him.

529
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,520
You think you can tell a thing like that
by just looking at a man?

530
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,800
Any woman of my age and experience
who can't tell just by looking at a man...

531
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,160
Oh, nonsense!

532
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,360
What are you thinking about?

533
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,920
- I'm not thinking. I've decided.
- Decided what?

534
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,280
- I'll get the fastest plane in the country.
- You aren't going to fly it yourself?

535
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,400
Certainly. Why not?

536
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:17,080
And that isn't all. I'm going to start learning
some of those trick dances, too.

537
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,680
- I'll make you happy, Mary. I know I will.
- I believe you, Jimmie.

538
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,760
- Oh, hello, Mr Morgan.
- Jimmie, will you pardon me?

539
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,440
- Mary, I want to talk to you alone.
- You'll have to ask me about that, sir.

540
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,280
- What?
- Jimmie.

541
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,880
I want to tell him. I'm the luckiest man
in the world, Mr Morgan.

542
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,040
Lucky? What do you mean?

543
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,320
- Mary and I have just become engaged, sir.
- Engaged?

544
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:47,640
That's right, sir. The way I feel about it, well,
I just want to go out and tell the whole world.

545
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,320
I understand, Jimmie.
You should be very proud.

546
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,720
Mary's a fine girl.

547
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,960
- I want to be the first to congratulate you.
- Thank you, sir.

548
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,280
Mary, my congratulations to you.

549
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,920
I'm sure that you and Jimmie
will find real happiness.

550
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,920
- I'll do everything to make that come true.
- I'm sure.

551
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,800
And if there's ever anything I can do to add
to your happiness - anything, understand? -

552
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,960
- I want you to promise to let me know.
- Say, Mr Morgan, you're pretty swell.

553
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:23,520
- I mean it, Jimmie, every word of it.
- Thank you, sir.

554
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:30,240
Well, good night. Good night
and my best to both of you, always.

555
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,120
Uncle Edward! Uncle Edward!

556
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,320
Time to get up.

557
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,560
Uncle Edward.

558
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,400
Oh, my goodness!

559
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Sleepy head! If you aren't really awake,
I can jump on your stomach again.

560
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,400
Never mind!

561
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,960
- You can't go back to sleep again.
- This is Sunday morning...

562
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,440
Oh, no, Uncle Edward. No, sir!

563
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,880
All right, you win.

564
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,840
- Read me the funny papers?
- Wait a minute.

565
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,200
How about breakfast and Sunday school?

566
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,520
I like Sunday school. Will you take me?

567
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,280
- Yes, siree.
- Give me a ride?

568
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,280
- I'll get your bathrobe and slippers.
- All right.

569
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,440
Yippee!

570
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,640
All right, that's enough of that.

571
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,600
Now, I want you to tell me everything
you've been doing while I've been away.

572
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,600
I've been in the city for a whole week.
What have you been up to?

573
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,400
- Every day I was wishing that you were here.
- Curly, you flatterer.

574
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,120
- Any special reason you wanted to see me?
- Very special.

575
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:18,840
- I wanted to talk to you about something.
- All right, here I am. What is it?

576
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,520
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about getting married.

577
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,400
<i>What?!</i>

578
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,800
Curly, whatever put that notion
into your funny little head?

579
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,800
- Please don't laugh, Uncle Edward.
- I'm sorry. I forgot that this was very special.

580
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,880
Now, just what is it you want to know
about getting married?

581
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,200
- Well... what does getting married mean?
- You mean like Jimmie and Mary?

582
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,320
That means they'll have their own home
and always live together.

583
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,360
Mary said that I was going to
live in Jimmie's house.

584
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,240
Does that mean Jimmie's
getting married to me too?

585
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,400
- I'll tell you all about that some other time.
- I don't want to get married to Jimmie.

586
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,000
- Why not?
- I want Mary and me to get married to you.

587
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,240
Curly, you're a designing woman.

588
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:14,320
Now get up and get out of here.
I've got to get dressed. Do you hear me?

589
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,160
Come on.

590
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Now, breakfast, funnies,
Sunday school and lunch.

591
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,200
- Then I've got a real surprise for you.
- Is it a present?

592
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,720
It wouldn't be a surprise
any more if I told you.

593
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,120
Mary! Mary!

594
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,960
My word!

595
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,800
- Look at Aunt Genevieve.
- Edward, how dare you spy on me!

596
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,120
- What's the matter, growing pains?
- Why shouldn't I grow up?

597
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,360
- Please, Uncle Edward, what's my surprise?
- I have two surprises for you, young lady.

598
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,560
- Two?!
- Mm-hm.

599
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,680
Come on, darling.

600
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,240
- Ready for the first one?
- I can hardly wait.

601
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,880
You won't have to wait - not another minute.

602
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,280
You sit right here
and listen very, very carefully.

603
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,120
All right.

604
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,920
Whoopee!

605
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,040
- Oh, but you are a bundle ofjoy.
- That was beautiful, dear.

606
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,560
Thank you.
Have you got a present for me too?

607
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,000
Yes, one for you and one for Mary.

608
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,480
- Will you run and tell Mary to come in?
- Mm-hm.

609
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,160
Mary! Mary!

610
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,120
Uncle Edward has a surprise for us.

611
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,320
You might as well admit
that you're in love with Mary.

612
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,240
- Why don't you tell her so?
- Haven't you heard the news?

613
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,000
It so happens that
Mary's engaged to Jimmie.

614
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,240
Have you ever told her that you love her?

615
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,800
Here she is, Uncle Edward.

616
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,640
- Can I have my surprise first?
- Yes, indeed you may.

617
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,280
- Oh, goodie.
- Here you are, young lady.

618
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,640
A string of pearls.

619
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,760
Pearls?

620
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,880
They lookjust like those
little stones on the beach.

621
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,640
- Oh, Elizabeth!
- Do you like them?

622
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,560
I would really rather have
a pair of roller skates.

623
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,400
Well, we'll throw them in for good measure.

624
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,720
I'm sailing for Europe next week.

625
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:24,480
Before I go, I want to give you an engagement
present and wish you every happiness.

626
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,640
I can't take it.

627
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,360
Why not?

628
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,640
I wasn't really in love with Jimmie.
We're not engaged any more.

629
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,400
I told him last night.

630
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,280
- You aren't going to marry him?
- No.

631
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,720
- Mary, you'd better watch out.
- Watch out?

632
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,880
You might not get married at all.

633
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:53,280
I asked Uncle Edward to marry us
this morning and he said he wouldn't.

634
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:58,200
- Oh, Elizabeth, you didn't?
- Oh, yes, I did.

635
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,200
Didn't I ask you to marry us, Uncle Edward?

636
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,560
Oh, Elizabeth!

637
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,760
Mary, wait. I... I want to talk with you.

638
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,760
What's the matter?
They seem kind of excited.

639
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,600
- We'll go abroad and stay a whole year.
- It sounds like heaven.

640
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:24,000
- We'll make it heaven, darling.
- Look, can't we share our happiness?

641
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,120
- What do you mean?
- With the person who made it possible.

642
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,520
- You mean Mr Jones?
- Yes.

01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,400
Oh, Mary, you blind little sweetheart.
There never was any Mr Jones.

644
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,640
- You mean that... you're Mr...?
- Mm-hm.

645
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,400
Oh!

646
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:47,640
Mary, do you mind if Uncle Edward
could come now and read me the funnies?

647
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,560
Oh, my word!
