00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,240
It began so innocently.
They said it was strange that a woman...

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,480
would want to publish a defense
of D.H. Lawrence...

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,480
and that his words are considered
an incitement to sex.

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,800
- Then he said, "You write about sex..."
- With some authority, Miss Nin.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,440
You must've led a rather free life.

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
Free?

8
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,880
You must've had a lot
of experience.

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,800
You know, affairs.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm interested in how you came...

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,240
to have such insights
into the erotic.

12
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,960
For literature.
Yes, I love Proust and...

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,440
I suppose my real awakening
came when my husband Hugo and I...

14
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
first arrived in Paris
and rented a bachelor apartment...

15
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
for the summer.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,520
One day, I was tidying up.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,640
As I was going through the closets...

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
where the owner left his belongings...

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
I discovered...

20
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,760
In that closet...

21
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,480
I became familiar with the endless
varieties of erotic experience.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,760
Come here.

23
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
- Hugo!
- I thought you might need a lift.

24
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,720
Are you all right, Pussy Willow?

25
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,920
- He kissed me.
- What? Oh, my God!

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,040
It was just one kiss.

27
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,520
He kisses me once.

28
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,120
Then he caresses all of my body.

29
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
He seeks my breasts...

30
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,240
and my most secret,
sensitive part.

31
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,600
His hands are deft.

32
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm tempted by unknown pleasures.

33
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,800
When I see that I have let him
be aroused...

34
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,400
I let him release his desire
between my legs.

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,320
I just let him...

36
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,240
out of pity.

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I tell Hugo...

38
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
only part of the story.

39
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,320
Pussy Willow!

40
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,320
Remember to meet me at 8:00 tonight.

41
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh, Hugo, would you mind very much
if I didn't go this evening?

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,680
I would mind.

43
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm sorry, but all they talk about are
bad loans, trusts or estate planning.

44
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
Estate planning can be very creative!

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,360
Look, the bank is how we got to Paris.

46
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,560
I need this job and I admit
I sometimes enjoy it. Why not?

47
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Why not?

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
You're changing into someone else.

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
You are even beginning to smell
like the bank.

50
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,960
I'm working so you can write.

51
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,760
I need to know people who are alive.

52
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
You're not consummating.
You're holding back.

53
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Do it again.

54
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,800
I can't seem to concentrate anymore,
Eduardo.

55
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,680
My life? Sometimes I think
I need something else.

56
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,320
An older man,
a man stronger than I am.

57
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,080
You like to make me suffer.

58
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,320
I've loved you
since we were children, Anais.

59
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,480
But, I've always had a fear that...

60
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,400
I wouldn't be able to.

61
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Look at them.
They're so exquisite.

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,920
If I were a man,
I'd be swept away.

63
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
They don't move me like you do.

64
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,320
Hell of a place you got here, Hugo.
Peaceful.

65
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
Been here long?

66
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,600
- Just since the Crash.
- Since the Crash? How'd you live before?

67
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
We lived well.

68
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,600
This is Henry Miller, the American
writer Osborn is putting up. My wife.

69
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,520
- Anais Nin.
- How are you, Anais?

70
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Eduardo Sanchez, Anais' cousin.

71
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Anais, you ought to read Henry's stuff.
He's got it over D.H. Lawrence.

72
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
- I'd love to read what you've written.
- Henry hasn't been published yet.

73
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
And you're comparing him to Lawrence?

74
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,640
I don't want to be compared to Lawrence.
He would've hated the way I write.

75
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,160
- Henry writes for the man on the street.
- I don't care for his writing.

76
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,520
Anais has been writing a book
about Lawrence.

77
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,880
Perhaps his sexuality
is too strong for you.

78
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,520
Too strong? He's childish.
He's prudish.

79
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
The French have been writing
about this. Rabelais, Flaubert!

80
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,840
I can't imagine any modern writer
not to owe a debt to Lawrence.

81
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
We should eat.

82
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,520
He makes too much out of sex.
He makes a damn gospel out of it.

83
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,200
To my way of thinking,
sex is natural...

84
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,200
like birth or death.

85
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm not interested in literature
or poetry as we know it.

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,080
What are you interested in?

87
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,440
- Henry writes about fucking.
- Fucking?

88
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm writing about self-liberation.

89
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,200
- It's definitely about fucking.
- We should eat something.

90
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,160
Amelia's waiting.

91
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,000
I flipped through more pages,
and I realize...

92
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,760
this is my own novel I'm reading
with some joker's name on it...

93
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,920
written in French, being sold
in the best bookstore in Paris.

94
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,320
- Unbelievable.
- How's that possible?

95
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Remember last year when some guy stole
my briefcase with my manuscript in it?

96
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,400
This guy swiped my manuscript, but what
he doesn't realize is I'll get him.

97
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,760
The souffle is from
an old family recipe.

98
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
So this is a souffle!

99
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
I hope it's substantial enough.

100
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,200
This joker doesn't know I'll get him
because I'm a copyright lawyer.

101
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
I'll go after him
like I went after the other joker.

102
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,480
- The guy who stole your play.
- That's on Broadway.

103
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,080
That's on Broadway...
I told you this already?

104
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,760
About how this guy must've stolen
my play out of my briefcase?

105
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,520
I'd be a well-received writer by now
if it weren't for these jokers.

106
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,640
But I'll get them. I'm not taking
any chances. This is my new baby.

107
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,560
You're laughing at me?

108
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,160
I just feel so good. Wonderful.

109
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,960
What a fine moment we have here.
A free lunch.

110
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
Fire in the fireplace.
Wonderful wines.

111
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,400
The colors blue and orange.
It's wonderful! No other word for it.

112
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,520
What do you write,
poetry or something?

113
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,920
Most of my writing
is in these diaries.

114
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,080
No, I never let anyone read it.

115
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,960
I never show it to anyone...

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
except Hugo...

117
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
sometimes.

118
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,560
I always wanted to read The Captive.
La Prisonnier.

119
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,160
I want you to have it.

120
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,480
I'll borrow it. Thanks.

121
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,120
Pussy Willow!

122
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,520
I used to go to the six-day bike races
we had in Brooklyn.

123
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah, I love bikes.

124
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
- But I couldn't take it.
- I want you to have it.

125
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,680
- What will you use?
- I'll borrow yours.

126
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,280
You can't ride a man's bike.
Henry should take mine.

127
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,720
Hey, thanks, Hugo.

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,360
That's swell of ya.
I can really use this.

129
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,840
I'll visit.

130
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,320
Come on, Eduardo, I'll race you
back to Paris before it gets dark.

131
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,240
On your mark.
Come on.

132
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I don't race anymore. To me, a bike
is just a means of getting home.

133
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Get set.

134
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
- You're no match for me.
- Are you set, Eduardo?

135
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,600
- I warn you I used to race.
- Go!

136
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,440
- I'd love to read something he wrote.
- Fat chance. He'll never get published.

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,400
I've met Henry Miller.

138
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,080
He is virile, flamboyant.

139
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
He is a man life intoxicates.

140
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,240
He is like me.

141
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,760
But he doesn't know it yet.

142
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,360
Henry's quite a character.

143
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,720
Good night.

144
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,560
'Night, Hugo.

145
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,320
- Let me help you.
- I'll be fine.

146
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
Osborn said he'd be home,
and I want to surprise Henry.

147
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,360
I thought you could use a hand.
You're all right?

148
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,560
Yes, I'm fine!

149
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,880
I'll take the train,
and meet you home later.

150
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,120
I'll wait a minute just in case.

151
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
I don't want you to wait.

152
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,480
I'll see you tonight.

153
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,160
See you tonight.

154
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,560
Henry?

155
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
Osborn?

156
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,800
- Oh, excuse me!
- Oh, God, I forgot.

157
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

158
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,560
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Wait.

159
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,240
Hiya, kid.
Slumming, huh?

160
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,200
I went to Osborn's place.
He told me where to find you.

161
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,560
I brought my typewriter.
I thought you should have it.

162
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Can we go and sit down somewhere?

163
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,040
Why not?

164
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,080
There's a little cafe back here.

165
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
Come on.

166
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
That actress in the film...

167
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,960
she reminds you of someone.

168
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,080
A woman who obsesses you.

169
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
I know that feeling.

170
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm often obsessed.

171
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,360
You oughta eat something, kid.
You eat like a bird.

172
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
All right, I'll tell ya.

173
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,680
June appeared like an angel.
I offered her a fool's fate.

174
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
She was a taxi dancer.

175
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,480
I paid my dime.

176
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
She put her head on my shoulder.

177
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,840
But then the lies began.

178
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,000
She told me her mother
was a Gypsy.

179
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,000
Her father was a count.

180
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,240
Later I saw a film and realized she
swiped her childhood out of the film.

181
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
And so?

182
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
So I married her.

183
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,720
She gave me the courage to quit my job
to write full time. She believed in me.

184
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,040
Somehow she got some money so
we could buy strawberries in the winter.

185
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,480
We're broke,
living in a dump in Brooklyn...

186
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,240
but we're living like kings.

187
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,880
Then one day she meets an artist.

188
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Brings her home to live with us.

189
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
Pretty soon we're supporting Jean, too.

190
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,120
How is she getting the money?

191
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840
- Pop.
- Pop?

192
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Pop's her scam.

193
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,120
I found out about Pop only after
she barged in with a fistful of money...

194
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,800
and suggests I go to Paris to write.

195
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,080
Then she'll join me later.

196
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,200
I take one look into her lying eyes,
and say...

197
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,680
"Anything you say."

198
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,360
Pack my bags
and I'm off to Europe.

199
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,440
But...

200
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm not quite the sap
she takes me for.

201
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,480
Something tells me to double back...

202
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,240
and take a see.

203
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,760
But when I confront her,
she gets furious with me!

204
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
She said we would've starved
without Pop. "Pop's my patron saint."

205
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,880
Your patron saint?

206
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,800
Yeah. That's what she calls him.

207
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
Only she's been telling Pop
that it's her writing.

208
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,040
That's why Pop's been buying it,
because of her.

209
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,240
How you doing? Bonjour.

210
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
And I should be grateful.
She's done it all for me.

211
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,840
Then she says, "I love you."

212
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,200
And everything else vanishes.

213
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,160
In that moment, I lived eternities.

214
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,960
Why does she get angry, hurt,
jealous or cruel?

215
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,280
Why does she lie?
That I can't understand.

216
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,080
Maybe you're not asking
the right questions.

217
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,520
Oh, yeah?
What would you ask?

218
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,400
I'd asked:
What makes her lies necessary?

219
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,040
What is she afraid of?

220
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Who is she afraid of?

221
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
The kinds of things a woman would ask.

222
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,520
A woman?

223
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,120
Excuse me, pal. Could you spring
for a few francs? I'm short today.

224
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
Beat it!

225
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
I could give you some money
if you need it.

226
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,200
Thanks. That's swell of ya.

227
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
Careful.

228
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,320
See you, kid.
You can get home okay?

229
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760
Yes, of course. I'll be fine.

230
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,280
Should be taxis all the time.
A lot of your swanky types come here.

231
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,920
See ya.

232
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,040
I'm getting interesting
shadowy images.

233
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,680
I like it.

234
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,400
You fall in love
with people's minds.

235
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,680
I'm afraid I could lose you
to Henry.

236
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,440
Don't be ridiculous.

237
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,320
He's so rough!

238
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,320
He calls me "kid."

239
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,960
I hate him.

240
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,280
He's a parasite, an egoist.

241
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,840
Maybe it's just jealousy.

242
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,000
What are you jealous of?

243
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,440
His life seems
so full of pain and chaos.

244
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,960
He has someone who drives him
to pain and chaos.

245
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,280
Anais, meet my wife June.

246
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,560
Thanks for taking care of Henry.

247
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,320
He didn't describe you right.

248
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,280
You didn't, Henry.

249
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,120
The colors you've used!

250
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,560
It's as if you painted each room
for a different mood, Anais.

251
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,040
It's Anais.

252
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,520
Henry gets everything wrong.

253
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
Oh, sorry!

254
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,560
- Always merry and bright.
- You said it!

255
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
What's the title of your book
going to be?

256
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm knocking around a couple.

257
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,320
I Sing the Equator
and Tropic of Cancer.

258
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,200
- I like Sing the Equator.
- No!

259
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,120
- Tropic of Cancer.
- Without question.

260
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,680
You are so absolutely right.

261
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,200
You see, Henry, I told you so.

262
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
So?

263
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,680
What do you think of her?

264
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,640
June? Not much.

265
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,720
You're afraid of her?

266
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,040
I just don't trust her.
Do you?

267
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
Trust her?

268
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,800
Of course not.

269
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,440
But you do think she's beautiful,
don't you?

270
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,840
No. That's the truth.

271
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,480
You have no aberrations...

272
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,560
no cruelty.

273
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I don't want to be cruel.

274
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,120
I hate men who are afraid
of a woman's strength.

275
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm not afraid of your strength!
I love it.

276
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,040
The stronger, the better.

277
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,320
Come here.

278
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,920
You don't hate me, do you?

279
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,080
Tell me some more truth.

280
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Or some lies!

281
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,880
Whisper to me.

282
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,040
How would you lie to June...

283
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,840
if you were making love to her?

284
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,760
Making love to her?

285
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,440
Yes.

286
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,400
To her body.

287
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
Her voluptuous body.

288
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,600
She's so perverse, so naked.

289
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,920
Tell her that you love her.

290
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,040
I love you!

291
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,720
Hold tighter.

292
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
Possess her like a man.

293
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,800
I want to fuck her like a man.

294
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,480
- Fuck her.
- I am.

295
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
I am fucking her, Pussy Willow.

296
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,000
Pretty good, Hugo.

297
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,760
I used to pace the six-day
bike races in Brooklyn.

298
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,520
- You're pretty damn good to keep up.
- Let's go!

299
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,080
I guess it's natural with me.
I've always loved sports.

300
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Hey, come on!

301
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,320
That was fun.

302
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,120
A little different than horseshoes.

303
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
Match that.

304
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,360
- It's a tie!
- Okay. It's a tie.

305
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,120
You're like the schoolteacher.
I'm like the young girl.

306
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,880
Always merry and bright.

307
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,920
What's your name?

308
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm Count Bruggar!

309
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Where do you come from?

310
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,280
Count Bruggar's been on the stage.

311
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
That's why he's so spoiled.

312
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,680
Count Bruggar is not spoiled!

313
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,080
Jean made Count Bruggar.

314
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,920
She's an artist.
Her hands are incredible.

315
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,320
Her beauty's more like a man's.

316
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,640
She's no ordinary woman.

317
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,640
No ordinary woman
could make Count Bruggar!

318
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,120
- Quiet. We're talking.
- Shut up.

319
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,640
You shut up, too!

320
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,320
- Where did you learn how to do this?
- My parents were show people.

321
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,920
My father was a magician in the circus.
My mother was a trapezist.

322
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,280
I was born on the road.

323
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,400
What has Henry told you?

324
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,600
Nothing. Really.

325
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,200
He mention Pop?

326
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
No. Who's Pop?

327
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,360
Pop is a patron saint of the arts
I know.

328
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,280
Henry's jealous of him
because Pop's rich.

329
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,360
Henry sees a lecher under every rock.
You know how men get.

330
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Do you love women?

331
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,520
What do you mean?

332
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,640
What about Jean?

333
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,040
Did Henry tell you about Jean and me?

334
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,920
No! You've been telling me
about her.

335
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,120
Sometimes he has a way of making...

336
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,160
everything ugly.

337
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,360
- He's not sleeping with you, is he?
- What?

338
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,360
I guess not.

339
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,080
- Did we pay?
- Let me.

340
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,000
Good. I've got to book my passage.

341
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,400
Passage? To where?

342
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,200
Home to New York.

343
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,160
Come on, Bruggar.

344
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,280
I've got my own life to lead.
So many things up in the air.

345
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,560
My friends, my acting. There's
an audition I don't want to miss.

346
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
Excuse me,
this is all the money you have?

347
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,200
Yes.

348
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,360
Sorry. I can't do anything for you.

349
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,120
What do you want me to do, swim?

350
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
Of course not.

351
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,040
We'll find a solution.

352
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,840
Something's happened.
I don't know.

353
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,080
The price has gone up,
or the exchange rate's gone down.

354
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,560
I tried to get a reduction, but I don't
have enough even for third class.

355
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,440
- Here. Let me...
- I couldn't.

356
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,880
Please, take this.

357
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,200
It's swell of you.

358
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,640
Thanks.

359
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,640
About that boat.

360
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,560
So, did you find a solution?

361
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,600
I hope so.

362
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,400
- I'd really like to travel first-class.
- It's possible.

363
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,040
Maybe you know a place
we could meet for a drink.

364
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,520
Let's say 6:00.

365
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,560
- 7:00's better.
- 7:00.

366
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,280
- Thanks.
- See you then.

367
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,440
Here I am.

368
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,440
This character, Mona.
She's supposed to be me?

369
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,360
Why?

370
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,640
Nothing.

371
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,760
It's so good.

372
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,160
I always wanted you to be...

373
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,440
Dostoyevsky.

374
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,120
- Is that good?
- Good?

375
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,760
I struggled, suffered...

376
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
for this?

377
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,560
This isn't me.
This is not me!

378
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,440
Of course it's you.
It's the you inside me.

379
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,000
It's a distortion.

380
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,320
Henry, look at me.

381
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Look!

382
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,320
You can't see me or anyone
as they are.

383
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I wanted Dostoyevsky.

384
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,200
Who can be Dostoyevsky with you?

385
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,200
You make that impossible!
What do you want?

386
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,160
- What do I want?
- Yeah?

387
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
After I brought the world to you?

388
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,400
After I told you all of my stories?

389
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,760
Sing my praises!

390
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,440
Make me an admirable character.

391
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,680
- I'm not a portrait painter.
- I'll say you're not.

392
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,440
Look what you've done to Anais.

393
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,400
You make everything ugly.

394
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Beauty is a joke to you.

395
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,560
You're so negative.

396
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,320
You're a failure as a writer.

397
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,200
You're not a man.
You're a child!

398
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,760
You use women!

399
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,920
You used me, you fucker!

400
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
You fuck!

401
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,160
Get rid of her.

402
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,400
I'll drive you wild.

403
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,920
I love you.

404
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
I wanna be drunk.

405
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,680
And make...

406
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,520
you drunk.

407
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Because I'm intimidated by you.

408
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,360
I need to feel free to say anything
and know that you'll forgive me.

409
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,200
I want to tell you things
so you won't stumble through life.

410
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,920
I've done the vilest things...

411
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,680
foulest things.

412
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,920
But I've done them superbly.

413
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,680
I feel innocent now.

414
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,880
Do you believe that?

415
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,000
You are innocent.

416
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,880
I want to be innocent like you.

417
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,920
I want to experience everything
you've experienced.

418
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,920
Take care of Henry for me.

419
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,040
I'll be leaving in the morning.

420
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
What?

421
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,560
The morning?

422
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,440
But when will you come back?

423
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
Maybe soon.

424
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,680
Maybe never.

425
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,200
There is so much I wish
I could've done with you.

426
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,200
I wish I could've taken opium with you.

427
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
Give me your wrist.

428
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,680
No! You have so few things.

429
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,440
I wanted to give you more.

430
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,400
I wanted to hold you.

431
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
She's crazy. Don't you see it?

432
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,640
No, I don't see.
I don't care.

433
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,760
She's just using you.

434
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,240
You just don't understand.
You're jealous of her.

435
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,320
No, I'm not.

436
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,640
Besides, you'll never see her again.

437
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,760
Where did you get this?

438
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,560
Show me!

439
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,960
Does she think she can love anything
in you I haven't loved?

440
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,680
Henry, you may have genius
and passion...

441
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,680
but something is definitely missing.

442
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,960
Oh, yeah? What?

443
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,600
Compassion.

444
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,080
Compassion for whom?

445
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,120
June, for instance.

446
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,600
Might as well have compassion
for the moon.

447
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,680
I'm going to write a book about June.

448
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,280
I'm writing about her.

449
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,560
I know more than anybody will know
about her.

450
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,360
I'm talking about something
totally different. As a woman.

451
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,880
From the inside out.

452
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,560
I can get into the poetry of June.

453
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,880
Hey, she's my fucking wife.

454
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,920
You don't understand
your own fucking wife.

455
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,320
I kissed her.

456
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,280
Write about whatever you want
to write about, for Christ's sake.

457
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,200
And more power to ya.

458
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,080
- I gotta get back to work.
- Stay longer if you can.

459
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,320
She's been under stress.
Just getting back on her feet.

460
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,160
Say, they've got Haitian drums
up there.

461
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,160
That fellow said I might sit in.

462
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,680
I saw your true nature
when you were dancing.

463
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,240
You don't understand.

464
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,000
Maybe I'm just a peasant,
and only whores can understand me.

465
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,920
You wanna dance?

466
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,360
Dance.

467
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,480
Move your legs wider.

468
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,040
I love you.

469
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,480
I need you.

470
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,280
What are you doing?
You're driving me wild.

471
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,320
Perhaps I am a demon to be able
to pass from Henry's arms into Hugo's.

472
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,400
Hugo lies next to me
as I write this.

473
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,680
I love Hugo.

474
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,280
And I feel innocent.

475
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,800
Did I ever tell you about when I was
a little boy growing up in Puerto Rico?

476
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,880
My father used to take me
to the carnival.

477
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,000
There were wild drums beating
and frightening masks.

478
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,840
There was something going on that was
terrifying, that I didn't understand.

479
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,960
I said to my father,
"I'm not afraid.

480
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,960
But give me your hand."

481
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,680
I have to go.

482
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,600
Hello, Mr. Richards.

483
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,680
Hello, Hugo.
Mr. Grant can't join us till Friday.

484
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,720
Anais, I don't know how much
I dare write you.

485
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,840
I would call you,
only I'm afraid Hugo would answer.

486
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,600
God forgive if this letter's
ever opened by mistake.

487
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,720
I can't help it.

488
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,760
I want you. I love you.

489
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,280
I've been living with you constantly.

490
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,680
But I've been afraid to tell you.

491
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,120
I thought it would terrify you.

492
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,240
But today as I watched Dreyer's
Passion of Joan of Arc...

493
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,080
I saw the mad monk
played by Antonin Artaud.

494
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,800
I thought of you like Joan...

495
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,000
in all your youth and purity
and single-minded madness.

496
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,960
And I saw myself in Artaud.

497
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,080
A hungering monk in love with you
and with my madness...

498
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,040
and your madness.

499
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,800
And the demon in Artaud's eyes
was like the demon in your eyes.

500
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,960
We fit so well together.

501
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,120
With Hugo, it's so difficult sometimes.

502
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,040
We have to use Vaseline.

503
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,080
His penis is so big.

504
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,840
But you and I fit so well.

505
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,920
Oh, Henry, I want to know
what you know.

506
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,200
I want my life to match your life.

507
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,920
Look at that, will ya?
Isn't that something?

508
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,560
Just read your goddamn book
on D.H. Lawrence...

509
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,320
and my, oh, my
it's one hell of a book.

510
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,240
Shows me I didn't know shit
about Lawrence when I spoke.

511
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,160
Who am I to go shooting off
at the mouth about him?

512
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,320
He was much greater, finer
than I ever thought.

513
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,160
Never mind how he failed
or triumphed as a man.

514
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,760
As an artist, did he succeed?

515
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,160
I say magnificently.

516
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,240
He tried to liberate literature.

517
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,240
And that's our task:
Liberation, freedom.

518
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,880
Let's toast to Lawrence.
Let's toast to our defects.

519
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,160
Toast...

520
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,280
to our friendship.

521
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,960
Drink cold, piss warm.

522
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,360
To Henry.

523
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,400
Fuck the Huns.

524
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,640
You know who I really am?

525
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,200
It's only me from over the sea.
I'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

526
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,600
I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree
I'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

527
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,720
I'll sail the sea until I croak
I'll fight and swear and drink and smoke

528
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,160
But I can't swim a bloody stroke
I'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

529
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,360
I'll put my mast in whom I please
I'm Barnacle Bill the sailor

530
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,760
I'll drink and fight and fuck and smoke
But I can't swim a bloody stroke

531
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,040
I'm Barnacle Bill the sailor
Barnacle Bill the sailor

532
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,560
Perverts yourselves!

533
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,680
- Fuck you.
- Jack.

534
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,720
- What?
- Say, fuck you, Jack.

535
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,000
Fuck you, Jack!

536
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,840
Twelve meters.

537
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,600
Pull it.

538
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,200
Yeah, scram.

539
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,560
Everybody says sex is obscene.
The only true obscenity is war.

540
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,320
I'd believe only in a god...

541
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,080
who understood how to dance.

542
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,520
Isn't that something?

543
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,720
Nietzsche says that at the same time...

544
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,560
the Huns and Germany are gearing up,
perverting, what he says.

545
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,200
We're given this gift:
The ability to understand.

546
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,520
Yet no one wants to understand.

547
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,760
We're given the ability to read.

548
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,520
Read Nietzsche, Thomas Mann...

549
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,560
read Spengler, Joyce, Rambaud.

550
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,960
Read fucking Alice in Wonderland.
Huh, Osborn?

551
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,920
Everything's out of whack.

552
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,280
People just worry about money
and deny their inner self.

553
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,120
What is money, anyway?

554
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,760
There's an old Portuguese saying...

555
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,400
"If shit had value,
the poor wouldn't have asses."

556
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,160
Money. Money.

557
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,840
They walk through the night crowd
protected by money...

558
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,600
lulled by money, dulled by money.

559
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,240
No single object anywhere
that is not money.

560
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,880
Money everywhere and still not enough.

561
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,320
Then no money or little money
or less money or more money.

562
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,720
But money. Always money!

563
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,520
If you have money or don't have money,
it's the money that counts.

564
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,960
And money makes money.
But what makes money make money?

565
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,440
I say, what the hell!

566
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,920
We gotta die to the world
like the clowns. Right, clowns?

567
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,200
I've never seen the sun rise in Paris.

568
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,680
I've never been up all night.

569
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,600
I've never been with a woman
I could be so sincere with.

570
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,760
I feel so free to write now.

571
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,960
I'll help you.

572
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,960
And I'll help you.

573
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,240
I feel so pure.

574
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
So strong.

575
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,720
So new, Henry.

576
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,440
You and I together,
not any man or woman together.

577
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm gonna demand everything of you.

578
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,560
Even the impossible.

579
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,080
Because you encourage it.

580
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,000
Maybe I should get down on my knees
and worship you.

581
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,120
I'm gonna undress you.

582
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,320
Vulgarize you a bit.
Lift up your dress.

583
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,000
No, not here.

584
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,840
Don't look around.

585
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,920
You little aristocrat.

586
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,240
Don't care.

587
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
I want to fuck you...

588
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,640
teach you things...

589
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,760
humiliate you a little.

590
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,000
Wrap your leg around me.

591
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,760
I'm gonna make you come with me.

592
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,400
Remarkable.

593
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,640
This is one of the most beautiful things
I've ever read.

594
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,760
I've never shown this diary
to anyone before.

595
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,320
No one will ever know these things...

596
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,800
but you.

597
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,760
You're becoming all the things
you wished to be as a little girl.

598
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,840
- I had a cricket.
- What?

599
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,640
A little cricket in a cage.

600
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,280
I love your accent.

601
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,880
I carried it everywhere with me.

602
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,240
But when we arrived in America,
they took it away at immigration.

603
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,600
The only thing they let me keep
in America was my diary.

604
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,760
And my accent.

605
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,360
I love you at 11.

606
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,960
I love you now.

607
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,880
I will love you at 100.

608
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,960
Here. Take a look.

609
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,920
What have you got here?

610
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,840
This is good.
Powerful.

611
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,840
Yours, too.

612
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,840
You tell the truth with such...

613
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,120
delicacy.

614
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,880
- I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

615
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,560
Why should I mind?
I welcome constructive criticism.

616
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,240
Good.

617
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,560
If it's constructive.

618
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,360
- What are you doing?
- Just a few things.

619
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,520
Here it's all shrieks...

620
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,400
and abstracts.

621
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,480
It's too melodramatic.

622
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,200
You gotta take time to expand.

623
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,920
You're enjoying this.

624
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,640
- What?
- Cutting me up.

625
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,400
I don't want to write
the way you write.

626
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,560
I don't want you to write
the way I write.

627
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,280
You've got to write in your own voice.
I'm just making a few suggestions.

628
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,800
It's tight in places.
Here.

629
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,080
Read it out loud
and see how it sounds.

630
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,360
- I won't give you that pleasure.
- Pleasure?

631
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,280
Hold on a minute here.

632
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,840
Can't you take it?
You gotta take a few taps on the chin.

633
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,160
A few taps on the chin?

634
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,400
Amuse yourself with someone else.

635
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,800
A prizefighter, for instance.

636
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,480
You're right exactly.
A prizefighter.

637
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,680
You've got to get knocked down
occasionally to acquire ring tactics.

638
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,840
The strategy,
the art of fighting.

639
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,080
You can't just shadowbox in your room.

640
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,200
You wouldn't last two minutes
when you step into the ring.

641
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,000
I am not interested
in stepping into a ring with you.

642
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,000
The world will give us
plenty of beatings.

643
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,000
We need each other's support.

644
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,440
Should I criticize you
like an outsider?

645
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,080
Should I say you write
caricatures?

646
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,880
That you write only from a man's point
of view and can't understand women?

647
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,920
Should I say that sometimes there's
a touch of the brute in your writing?

648
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,680
That you're too much of a realist?

649
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,680
What's the matter?
Can't you take it?

650
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,040
Like a prizefighter.

651
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,480
Knock it off.

652
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,280
You want to fight, huh?

653
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,600
Don't.

654
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,240
Leave it. It looks nice that way.

655
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,080
Wild.

656
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,880
Loose.

657
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,920
You never like the way I look.

658
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,320
I do love your hair.

659
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,920
I just think it shouldn't be so severe.

660
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,440
So tight.

661
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,400
Like my writing?

662
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,920
No, not like your writing.
I love your writing.

663
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,280
I believe in you.

664
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,560
Last night I thought that you were
the woman I should've been married to.

665
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,680
You're always ironizing with me.

666
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,680
"Ironizing"? There's no such word.
It's "to be ironic."

667
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,440
Look it up.

668
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,560
Then he steals my ideas
and puts them in his novel.

669
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,480
Henry wouldn't do that.

670
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,040
I'm sure of it.
Somehow...

671
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,600
he got into my briefcase
and swiped my ideas.

672
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,760
Those phrases are mine.

673
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,320
That way of expression,
that rhapsodizing, it's mine.

674
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,320
Nietzsche?
I introduced him to Nietzsche.

675
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,480
I introduced him to Hugo and you.
He stole you from Hugo.

676
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,960
- Don't, Richard.
- He stole you from me.

677
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,520
That's true.

678
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,440
It was my idea to become your lover.

679
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,520
He betrayed me by stealing you from me
and from my best friend, your husband.

680
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,560
This man is treacherous to the core.

681
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,000
This Neanderthal from Brooklyn
is trying to murder me.

682
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:49,600
For all his pretended friendship, his
most intimate friends are only fodder...

683
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,720
for the unrolling of his own sanctified
destiny, his own creative urges.

684
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,200
I leave the two of you
to your destiny.

685
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,560
And one more thing.

686
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,200
No more sex in my apartment.
I won't stand for it.

687
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,760
I won't stand for it.

688
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,720
I love that guy.

689
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,760
He understands me,
even though he is...

690
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,720
Pas maintenant. Later.

691
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,680
Even though he is ironizing.

692
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,360
I have only three desires now:

693
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,480
To eat...

694
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,840
to sleep...

695
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,920
and, uh...

696
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,160
And?

697
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,120
- Jerks out there.
- It's just the Art Students Ball.

698
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,600
Maybe you just don't want it tonight.

699
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,320
It's fine.

700
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,680
I understand.

701
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,440
It's natural.

702
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,800
I've read about such moments.

703
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,640
It happens to women, too,
only women can conceal it.

704
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,000
Sorry.

705
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,360
Don't be.

706
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,160
You feel that you have to fuck me
or I'll be disappointed.

707
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,080
But you don't always
have to fuck me.

708
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,920
Don't say that word.

709
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,320
What word?

710
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,800
Fuck?

711
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,760
It just bothers me now.

712
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,720
Maybe it's the accent.

713
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,720
Maybe it's just because you can't fuck.

714
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,240
It's important not to imagine
terrible things...

715
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,600
like being impotent from now on.

716
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,320
It's nothing.
We should just laugh about it.

717
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,600
I love you, Pussy Willow.

718
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,120
I love you, too, Hugo.

719
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,600
I gave myself with such feelings
against Henry...

720
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,520
that I experienced
a great physical pleasure.

721
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,360
My first infidelity to Henry...

722
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,280
was with my own husband.

723
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,760
I've changed.

724
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,320
I feel restless, spirited...

725
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,760
adventurous.

726
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:52,440
To be truthful, I hope secretly
to meet someone else.

727
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
I have erotic imaginings.

728
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,120
I want pleasure.

729
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,040
Every time I go out with you
I love you more than ever.

730
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,440
You seem so wild tonight.

731
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,760
Tonight I could do anything.

732
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,360
I could, too.

733
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,920
We need to think of something
that will stimulate us both.

734
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,800
Anything you say, kiddo.

735
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,280
Henry told me about this place.

736
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,240
This ought to be something.

737
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,680
Wait here.

738
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,840
- I'm with you.
- We'll just look.

739
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,600
What's an exhibition?

740
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,000
Then you must choose two.

741
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,200
An exhibition is...

742
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:16,040
us watching a man and a woman
doing it?

743
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,320
No man. Only women.
One pretends to be the man.

744
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,520
It is better that way.
N'est-ce pas?

745
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,000
Of course.

746
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,280
You will not be disappointed.
You will see everything.

747
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,760
And now you must choose.

748
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,560
Her.

749
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,800
And...

750
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,600
There are 66 ways
in which to make love.

751
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,320
Oh? Really?

752
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,480
They will show you love
in a taxi.

753
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,840
Love when one of the partners
is sleepy.

754
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,640
Love in the street.
Etcetera, etcetera.

755
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,360
You like something else?

756
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,520
Yes. Stop pretending to be a man.

757
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,520
Would you like to join us?

758
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,640
As you wish. You're the boss.

759
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,440
Anais, what?

760
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,440
I love your green eyes, Eduardo.

761
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,760
I want to show you things.

762
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,720
Teach you things.

763
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:10,080
I want you to relax.

764
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,800
Relax, Eduardo.

765
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,480
I had a dream.
A nightmare.

766
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,040
June had suddenly returned.

767
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,480
We shut ourselves in a room.

768
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,080
I began to undress.

769
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,440
I begged her to undress.

770
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,120
I asked to let me see between her legs.

771
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,280
As she lay over me...

772
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,640
I felt a penis touching me.

773
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,600
Aren't you glad?

774
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,760
Aren't you glad?

775
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,960
I'm passing through a crisis, Eduardo.

776
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,520
Be careful, Anais.

777
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,440
Abnormal pleasures kill the taste
for the normal ones.

778
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,280
I hate you, Henry...

779
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:56,040
because I now realize I love you
as I have never loved anyone.

780
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,280
I miss your voice,
your hands, your body...

781
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:03,280
your tenderness,
your bearishness and your goodness.

782
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,080
Most of all,
I miss our friendship.

783
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,040
I'm finished.

784
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,600
Pussy Willow!
I'm home!

785
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,360
I'm home!

786
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,640
Henry's exhausted.
Hasn't slept for two days.

787
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,600
He's just finished his novel.

788
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,120
Henry.

789
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,040
This is wonderful.

790
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,600
Stupendous.

791
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,200
- Come and join us.
- Lay down with us, Henry.

792
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,200
I hope you don't mind.
Anais was reading this.

793
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,680
I'm a nosy guy,
so I took a peek.

794
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,160
I love it.

795
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,640
I've been trying
to write something about it.

796
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:28,360
About how necessary this book is
for our times.

797
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,440
You give us a blood transfusion.

798
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,360
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

799
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,400
Wait till June reads this.

800
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,800
She'll be so thrilled
that you've finished your book.

801
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,080
Each mention of her name...

802
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,720
each page I read is painful.

803
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,400
Well, this was a swan song.

804
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,320
It was a way to understand her
so I could free myself from her.

805
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,280
- It's finished now.
- Not yet.

806
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,120
- Now we've got to get it published.
- Published?

807
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:15,360
Who will publish it?
I know what they'll say.

808
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,240
There's even laws against
what I've written.

809
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,280
But I feel good now.

810
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,880
I'm ready to celebrate my failure.

811
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,000
I won't let you be a failure.

812
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,280
I'll make the world listen to you.
I promise.

813
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,400
I'm ready now to call on the pope...

814
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,480
and all the kings...

815
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:36,720
and all the editors and publishers
in the world to get them to support you.

816
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,960
It's Anais.

817
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,240
- Eduardo.
- Hello, Henry.

818
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,360
- Where's Hugo?
- Hugo's gone on business.

819
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,480
Osborn's gone, too.
Gone crazy.

820
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,560
Really.

821
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,920
Totally.

822
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,640
We're celebrating Osborn's madness.
This is a rare occasion.

823
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:59,120
It doesn't happen every day. I hope
he's really insane and not faking it.

824
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:02,480
- They came and took him away.
- He was a monster.

825
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,920
That was his best side.

826
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,400
We've got the whole place to ourselves.

827
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,120
You ever see what
a good contortionist can do?

828
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,560
Yeah.

829
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,000
I'll get you something to drink.

830
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,640
Sorry I couldn't keep in touch.

831
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,040
I thought of you every day.

832
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:49,000
You know me with writing.
I have a terrible time.

833
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,200
I don't have the gift
like you and Henry.

834
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,800
I found your book
lying around here.

835
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,960
I hope you don't mind.

836
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,280
I took a peek.

837
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,240
House of Incest?

838
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,120
It's nice.

839
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,440
Is this character Sabina
supposed to be me?

840
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,160
"The muffled, close half talk
of soft-fleshed women.

841
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:27,520
Deep into each other
we turned our hollowed eyes."

842
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,520
It seems like poetry sort of.

843
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,440
It's so damn sweet of you
to try to write something about me.

844
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,320
I really...

845
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,360
I really expected something more...

846
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,160
I don't know.
More real.

847
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:53,640
More real?

848
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:58,280
Yeah. More about, you know, life.

849
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,760
Hey, don't get upset.

850
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,280
Some of it's really beautiful.

851
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,320
I promise I'll read it again.

852
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,480
Things have been so damn tough for me.

853
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,400
The acting didn't pan out.

854
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,280
Then Jean, my friend, left.

855
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,800
Anais, what's happened to Henry?

856
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,240
He's so changed.

857
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,720
June, I don't know.

858
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:39,640
I don't know what to say.
I've been busy.

859
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:45,000
I've seen him occasionally. We work
on our writing together sometimes.

860
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:49,120
But, I don't know.

861
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,480
I've been seeing someone.

862
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,280
- You mean you have a lover?
- Yes.

863
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,160
That man you came with?

864
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,120
Yes. Eduardo.

865
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,440
Anais, I'm so happy for you.

866
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,560
I don't know who I came back for.

867
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,480
Don't let it come between us.
Please.

868
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,400
I need your faith.

869
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,040
That could be good luck, too.

870
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,000
Could be.

871
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,240
Jack, you've come.

872
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,720
How are you?

873
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,440
June, I'd like you to meet Jack...

874
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,560
the man who wants to publish my book.

875
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,640
- My wife June.
- Hiya, Jack.

876
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,160
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Miller.

877
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,400
I feel I already know you intimately
from reading Henry's book.

878
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,080
Yeah? What do you think?

879
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:17,920
I think it's strong meat.
That's how we'll market it.

880
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,480
- What's our cut?
- Your cut?

881
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,720
Lt'll be 5%.

882
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,960
A crummy 5%?

883
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,960
Henry spends years
writing the book.

884
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,800
Lives like a bum.
Busts his nuts.

885
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:37,400
- Stay out of this, June.
- I scrape by and do without.

886
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:41,560
And pour my heart and soul in making him
some kind of Dostoyevsky.

887
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,520
And all we get is 5%?

888
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,040
With me, the percentage
will mean something.

889
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,360
What does "mean something" mean?

890
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,440
I believe it's a fair deal.

891
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,040
Well, I'll be.

892
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:54,960
Of course, if you don't want
to publish it...

893
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,920
Henry just doesn't get business.

894
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,800
Let's us talk.

895
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,840
By all means. But as I've said,
before we can do anything...

896
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,320
it's absolutely necessary to have
the money to print it.

897
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:13,080
Jack, I've told you.
I'll get the money.

898
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,840
I guess I was naive about
how things work in your business.

899
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,800
I hope I didn't upset you.

900
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,800
I was wondering if some advance
might be possible.

901
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,280
Or maybe there's room
to improve in the percentage.

902
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,240
Let's not discuss it now.

903
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,440
Here is not the place.

904
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,520
Maybe you know a place
where we could have lunch?

905
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,400
I certainly do.
A marvelous place.

906
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,080
It's done then.
It's been so good to meet you.

907
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,360
Really. It's been wonderful
having you.

908
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:55,840
You, too.

909
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,200
Good night.

910
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,280
- Yes.
- See you.

911
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:03,720
Good-bye.

912
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,160
Who's he trying to kid?

913
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,040
A crummy 5%.

914
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:16,320
He hasn't dealt with
this Brooklyn girl yet.

915
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:19,880
- Let's go for a nightcap, Henry.
- Go ahead. We'll join you later.

916
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,680
- Always merry and bright.
- To you, too.

917
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,400
- I should go.
- No, Anais.

918
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:33,960
Don't go. You can catch up
with Eduardo later.

919
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,440
All right, Eduardo?

920
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,040
Say, you know...

921
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,320
I don't know.

922
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:10,640
I was thinking maybe it's not time
to publish Henry's book just now.

923
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,400
Not publish?

924
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,680
What the hell you talking about?

925
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,640
I'm talking about the crappy deal.

926
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,800
And the fact that you're
taking advantage of Anais.

927
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:27,080
And Hugo, too.

928
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,960
They're not made of gold, Henry.

929
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,320
Am I right, Anais?

930
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,480
Yes, but... No.

931
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,440
We believe we have to publish it.

932
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,480
I'll get it published.

933
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:43,960
The right way,
just like I always have.

934
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,520
We've always managed to survive,
you and me.

935
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:53,040
Besides, it needs work.

936
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:56,200
- What?
- It's not ready.

937
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,600
It's better than
when I first read it...

938
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,800
but it could be even better.

939
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,080
There's too much anger in the book.

940
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,520
Too much anger?

941
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,520
Too much fucking anger?

942
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:12,480
Even Anais agrees that you
distorted me in your book.

943
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,920
She had to write her own book.

944
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,960
- Isn't that right?
- No.

945
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:21,120
I did tell June you failed to perceive
certain things.

946
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:25,000
- Don't.
- After all I've done for him.

947
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:29,000
He owes me for all the years
I sacrificed.

948
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,120
Your sacrifices just add
to your greatness.

949
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,560
- I don't owe you a thing.
- You don't what?

950
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:37,080
What Henry really means is...

951
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,640
For Christ's sake,
can't you see what she's doing?

952
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:43,680
- Don't yell at me!
- He treats you like a child.

953
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,920
- She's a woman, Henry.
- I know she's a woman.

954
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,440
- I'll bet you do.
- What the fuck do you mean by that?

955
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,920
I'm leaving.

956
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:57,160
How can you treat her this way?

957
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,640
You're drunk.

958
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,400
So what?

959
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:02,800
You're weak.

960
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:07,160
I hate when you get weak.
Be a man!

961
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:09,080
God, that's it!

962
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,360
Violence.

963
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,640
I hate your violence.

964
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,360
Men.

965
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,640
Anais, don't go.

966
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,600
I love you.

967
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,760
You're cruel and clever.

968
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,000
You're both cruel and clever.

969
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,720
I'm afraid of both of you.

970
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,200
Oh, God.

971
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,960
I'm the wrong woman for you, Henry!

972
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:53,320
I'm the wrong woman for you, Anais.

973
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,640
Leave me alone.
Don't touch me.

974
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,960
I'm so terribly sick.

975
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,000
Give me peace.

976
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,960
I love you.

977
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,600
Get some sleep, Anais.

978
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:17,400
I don't know why I keep thinking of
this little Chinese restaurant...

979
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:21,200
Henry and I used to go to
after I got off work.

980
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:25,440
He'd wait for me outside the dance hall
at 2:00 in the morning.

981
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,200
And we'd rush through
the freezing cold...

982
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,160
holding each other tight.

983
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,880
We'd get there
just before closing time.

984
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,480
Sit in the booth by the window
eating chow mein...

985
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,800
watching the snow swirl by.

986
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:46,920
There was some kind of unbelievable
thrill in the air between us.

987
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:53,280
I feel kind of honored by it now.

988
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:55,840
Chin Lee's.

989
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,880
It's funny.

990
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,840
It seems like a dream.

991
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,240
Your eyes make me shy.

992
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,640
Don't be shy.

993
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:13,320
You're so lovely.

994
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:16,160
So small.

995
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,200
I burnt myself out.

996
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,920
June, I worship you.

997
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,040
I don't want worship.

998
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,880
I want understanding.

999
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,800
I understand you.

1000
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:47,120
We should go away somewhere together...

1001
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,520
where there's lots of snow.

1002
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,480
How little you are.

1003
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,880
So thin.

1004
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,080
I could break you in two.

1005
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,680
I feel innocent now.

1006
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,560
Let yourself go.

1007
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,240
Relax.

1008
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,160
You're still holding back.

1009
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,440
Let me see your body.

1010
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,680
It isn't beautiful enough.

1011
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,640
Beautiful June.

1012
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,920
I heard a noise out there.

1013
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:23,520
Henry was listening.

1014
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:27,440
No. Once Henry falls asleep,
nothing can wake him up.

1015
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:31,640
Yeah?

1016
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,280
I'm sorry.

1017
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,200
- I lost my head. I was drunk.
- Don't be sorry.

1018
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:47,360
This new lover of yours
has really made you bloom.

1019
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:50,120
- It's chilly.
- Tell me more about him.

1020
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,360
Did you make curtains for him?

1021
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,360
Did you give him books to read?

1022
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,040
Did you give him a typewriter?

1023
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:04,320
No, you don't understand.

1024
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:06,360
I don't understand?

1025
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:08,480
What don't I understand?

1026
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,320
That I love you.

1027
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,160
Love?

1028
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:16,840
You just want experience.
You're a writer.

1029
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,920
You make love to whatever you need.

1030
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,720
- You're just like Henry.
- No, I'm just like you.

1031
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,640
I can see exactly what you're doing.

1032
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:30,600
You're so slippery.
So slippery.

1033
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,040
You bitch!

1034
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,800
Liar, trickster.
You bought his love!

1035
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,520
Shut up!

1036
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,520
You both robbed me blind.

1037
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:43,080
You stole everything.

1038
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:46,560
- What do I care? I've got more to give.
- Shut up.

1039
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:50,360
To someone new.
Some truly great writer.

1040
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:55,640
Henry said you just took us in
because you were bored.

1041
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,360
That's a lie.

1042
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,080
A lie.

1043
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,160
I was dreaming about you.

1044
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,560
Anais.

1045
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,200
What's wrong?

1046
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,920
She lies.

1047
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,080
She lies.
What is she afraid of?

1048
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:37,000
I don't understand.
I tried to give her everything.

1049
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,920
I know.

1050
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:43,920
Very pretty.
Just like I figured it.

1051
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,160
Now I know everything.

1052
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,600
I wanted to return something
before I leave.

1053
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,720
Some books I borrowed.

1054
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,240
June, you're wrong!

1055
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:05,040
We're just friends.
I never touched her.

1056
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:07,200
Get rid of her, Henry.

1057
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:14,280
All right, you made your choice.

1058
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:17,040
I've only got one more thing
I can give you.

1059
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,720
Your last chapter.

1060
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,160
Watch closely.

1061
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,680
What are you doing out here?
It's freezing.

1062
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,600
I thought she'd do something crazy.
I never know.

1063
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:08,360
I looked all over for her.

1064
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,760
She's gone.

1065
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,080
This is mine.

1066
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:59,000
This is mine, too.

1067
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,720
I feel like the war's over.

1068
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:20,160
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.

1069
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,720
Leave that there.

1070
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:33,920
Stay with me, for Christ's sake.
We gotta talk.

1071
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,400
I can't.

1072
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,520
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1073
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,040
What?

1074
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,800
Yeah.

1075
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:49,360
Hugo.

1076
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,320
I love him, too.
You married a great guy.

1077
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,320
Fuck you, Jack.

1078
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,680
That won't do it.

1079
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,640
That won't get rid of me.

1080
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,720
You're my friend.

1081
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,040
I'm going to come after you.

1082
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,880
Hey, how can you leave me
at a time like this?

1083
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,520
I need you.

1084
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:23,680
I need you.

1085
02:04:57,560 --> 02:04:59,440
I thought you might need a lift.

1086
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:10,680
Is everything all right?

1087
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,600
Hey, Henry.

1088
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,880
Give me your hand.

1089
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,200
That morning I wept.

1090
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:16,080
I wept because I loved the streets
that took me away from Henry...

1091
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:18,080
and would lead me back to him.

1092
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:24,760
I wept because the process
by which I had become a woman...

1093
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,200
was painful.

1094
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I wept because from now on...

1095
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:31,960
I would weep less.

1096
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:36,760
I wept because I had lost my pain...

1097
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:39,660
but I was not yet a custom to it's absence.
