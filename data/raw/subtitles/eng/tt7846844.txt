[bicycle rattling]

3
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,125
[effort grunt]

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,500
Now, where to begin?

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,916
{\an8}[baby crying]

6
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,625
The first thing you need to know
is that my mother named me Enola.

7
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,125
She insisted on it, in fact!

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,250
[Eudoria whispering] Enola...

9
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,416
- [normal voice] Enola.
- [Enola coos]

10
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,875
[Enola] I know it's an unusual name,

11
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,916
but my mother is rather a fan
of word games.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,791
- [Eudoria] On your marks.
- [Enola] Get set.

13
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,708
[Eudoria] Go!

14
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,083
[Enola] <i>And Enola spelled backwards</i>
<i>reads, well,</i>

15
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,791
"alone."

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,291
Yes!

17
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,958
[Enola] <i>She would continually tell me...</i>

18
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,666
You'll do very well on your own, Enola.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,083
- [Enola coos]
- [Eudoria] Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,416
[Enola] <i>And yet we were always together.</i>

21
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,041
- No. No.
- [laughing] Yes!

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,583
[Enola] <i>My father died when I was young.</i>

23
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,208
<i>I don't really remember him.</i>

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>And both my brothers left home soon after.</i>

25
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,916
<i>I barely remember them, either.</i>

26
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,625
<i>So then it was just the two of us,</i>

27
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,833
<i>and it was wonderful.</i>

28
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,083
[glass shatters]

29
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,791
<i>She was not an ordinary mother.</i>

30
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,125
<i>She didn't teach me to string seashells
or practice my embroidery.</i>

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>We did different things.</i>

32
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,791
<i>Reading,</i>

<i>sports,</i>

35
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>all sorts of exercise,</i>

00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,500
<i>- both physical...</i>
- [grunts]

37
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,583
<i>and mental.</i>

38
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,333
<i>Mother said we were free to do anything
at Ferndell...</i>

39
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh. Sorry, Grandpa.

00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,166
[sighs]

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,083
[Enola] <i>...and be anyone.</i>

42
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,625
<i>She was my whole world.</i>

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
[both laugh]

44
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,125
<i>But she didn't share everything with me.</i>

45
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,125
[Eudoria] Right, ladies, to conclude:
our choices.

46
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,958
The bankmen met,

47
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,708
entangle herb,

48
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,083
- Ellie Houseman.
- [woman] Ooh, marvelous.

49
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,291
- [Eudoria] Are we all agreed? Yes?
- [women] Yes.

50
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,000
[Eudoria] Ellie Houseman.

51
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,041
[woman] Of course.

52
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,041
[woman gasps]

53
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,791
[Enola] <i>Mother believed</i>
<i>privacy was the highest virtue,</i>

54
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,750
<i>and the one most frequently violated.</i>

00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,500
[birds chirping]

56
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,666
[brakes squeal]

57
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Which leads me to the second thing
you need to know.

58
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,666
[rooster crows]

59
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,000
<i>A week ago,
on the July morning of my 16th birthday,</i>

60
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,041
<i>I awoke...</i>

61
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,666
Mother?

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,416
<i>To find that my mother was missing.</i>

63
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,833
[breathing heavily]

64
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,291
<i>She'd left Ferndell Hall, our home,</i>

65
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,958
<i>at some point during the night.</i>

66
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,208
Mother?

67
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,750
<i>And she did not return.</i>

68
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,916
[bicycle rattling]

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,625
She left me with little, bar some gifts

70
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,000
that she instructed Mrs. Lane
to give me at teatime.

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,583
{\an8}[Mrs. Lane] What kind gifts!

72
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,000
{\an8}And, look, she's made this herself.

73
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
[Enola] We were happy.

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,083
Weren't we, Mrs. Lane?

75
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,833
Shouldn't she give me
these presents herself?

76
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,125
- [lively music plays]
- [bicycle rattling]

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

78
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,458
[grunts]

79
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,958
[pants]

80
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,125
And the third thing you need to know,

81
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,625
and there may be those amongst you
who have already guessed it,

82
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,208
is that cycling
is not one of my core strengths,

83
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,166
but needs must
when you must speed somewhere.

84
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,500
[train whistling]

[train whistling]

87
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,000
The fourth thing you need to know

88
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,708
is that I'm presently on the way
to collect my brothers,

89
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,333
<i>Mycroft and Sherlock,</i>

90
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,375
names which backwards spell out,
respectively,

91
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
Tforcym and Kcolrehs.

92
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,833
Perhaps one shouldn't read too much
into the "alone" idea.

93
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,958
- [woman] Thank you.
- [Enola] Yes.

94
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,416
Sherlock Holmes.

95
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,375
The famous detective, scholar, chemist,

96
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,041
virtuoso violinist,

97
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,625
<i>expert marksman,</i>

<i>pugilist,</i>

100
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,625
and brilliant deductive thinker.

101
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,458
{\an8}<i>My genius brother.</i>

102
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,375
He will have all the answers.

103
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,541
[inhales sharply]

104
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,458
[clears throat]

105
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,250
Mr. Holmes?

106
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,125
And, um, Mr. Holmes?

107
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,125
Yes.

108
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,708
You sent for me?

109
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,791
You sent a telegram.

110
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,208
Asked me to meet you here?

111
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,250
And the fifth thing you need to know

112
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,833
is that they haven't seen me
in quite some time.

113
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,291
Enola.

114
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,500
My God.

115
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,208
Look at you.

116
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,541
You're in such a mess.

117
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,083
Where's your hat and your gloves?

118
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:07,916
Well, I have a hat.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,416
It just makes my head itch.
And I have no gloves.

120
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,291
She has no gloves?

121
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Plainly not, Mycroft.

122
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,000
We didn't send for you, silly girl.
We sent for the carriage.

123
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,583
- Did you at least bring it?
- The carriage?

124
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,375
Yes.

125
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,208
What carriage would you be wanting?
Because I have a few in mind...

126
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,208
The carriage I pay for.

127
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

128
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,625
I think you may have us confused
with another house.

129
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
Boy, fetch us a carriage.

130
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,583
Quickly!

131
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,750
[Mycroft] Oh.

132
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,208
What the...

133
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,125
[Mycroft sighs]

134
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,583
Oh, dear God, look at the house.

135
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,500
[Enola gasps]

136
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,958
[Enola] Isn't it wonderful?

137
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,791
[Mycroft] What the hell
has she been playing at?

138
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,791
[Mrs. Lane] Gentlemen, welcome home.

139
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,958
It's been some time.

140
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,458
[door creaks open]

141
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,791
What is this?

142
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,583
Tennis?

143
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,250
Mother says I'm getting quite proficient.

144
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,916
[effort grunts]

145
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,125
- [glass shatters]
- Oh!

146
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,333
[inhales through teeth]
I suppose that's game.

147
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,125
[shuddering breath]

148
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,583
[shuddering breaths]

149
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,083
Where the hell is she?

150
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,750
I would say this is going quite well,
wouldn't you?

151
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,541
Her bed hasn't been made.

152
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
Hmm. Chrysanthemums.

153
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,000
[Mycroft] Clothes haven't been put away.

154
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,750
And <i>laurustinus, </i>and Queen Anne's lace.

155
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,791
[Mycroft] Enough with the bally flowers,
Sherlock.

156
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,375
[Sherlock sighs]

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,833
[Sherlock] Huh.

158
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,708
But it wasn't foul play.

159
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
How? Are you certain?

160
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,916
Her regular supply of drawing pencils
has dwindled to nothing.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,375
She clearly had decided
not to replace them,

162
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,083
and you rarely find that kidnap victims

163
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,708
have planned for their own disappearance.
[chuckles]

164
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,000
She wasn't returning,

165
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:33,208
and yet she disguised her intentions
perfectly.

166
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,916
That's good news, is it not?

167
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,375
Depends if you're relying on her
coming back.

168
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,333
[Mycroft] Hmm.

169
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,750
[Mycroft] Oh, good God! Feminism.

170
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,583
Perhaps she was mad, or senile.

171
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,083
Though madness, in our family?
I would doubt it.

172
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,458
- Ooh. [grunts]
- [Sherlock] I think I can surmise

173
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,583
by the way that she left
leaving no clear leads,

174
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
she still had her full wits
about her. [sniffs]

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,291
No madwoman could compile the accounts
she sent me over the last ten years.

176
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,125
Perfectly clear and orderly,
detailing a bathroom...

177
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,208
- Which does not exist.
- [Mycroft] And a water closet.

178
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,291
Likewise.

179
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,041
[Mycroft]
And the constantly rising salaries

180
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,250
of the footmen, the housemaids,
the kitchen maids,

181
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,375
- gardeners, under gardeners...
- You get the point.

182
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,125
And for Enola, a music teacher,

183
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,166
a dance instructor, a governess.

184
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,083
Enola, you at least had a governess?

185
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,583
She wouldn't like you in here.

186
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,541
This is her private space.

187
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,208
Tell me, she at least saw
that you had an education?

188
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,375
She valued education.

189
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,666
[scoffs]

190
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,166
She taught me herself.

191
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,541
She made me read every book
in Ferndell Hall's library.

192
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,708
<i>Shakespeare, Locke,</i>

193
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,458
and the encyclopedia,

194
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,541
and Thackeray, and the essays
of Mary Wollstonecraft.

195
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,083
And I did it on my own account.

196
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,083
For my own learning.

197
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,666
Which, Mother said, was the best way
to become a young...

198
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,041
woman.

199
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,291
Well, <i>this </i>is what
she wanted you to become?

200
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,833
- Mycroft.
- What?

201
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,250
I don't know what she wanted me to be.

202
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,750
She's left me too.

203
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,208
[scoffs]

204
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,750
She will return, won't she, Sherlock?

205
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,291
[inhales deeply]

206
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,083
Won't she?

207
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,125
[Mycroft] What is she up to, Sherlock?

208
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,583
She was too old to remarry, she had
no passions or ambitions I was aware of.

209
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,791
She simply had to ensure Enola
a decent life

210
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,750
and to live her remaining years
with dignity.

211
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,250
This is my house, not hers,
and has been since Father died.

212
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,875
She asked for 16 years
to bring up Enola here.

213
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,333
I gave it. And for that,
I deserve to be robbed?

214
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,500
I am not the villain here.

215
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,333
Perhaps she needed the money.

216
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
You clearly don't,

217
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,666
- or has the government cut your salary?
- [Mycroft sighs]

218
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,125
[Mycroft] It's always the same, isn't it?
Always the same.

219
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,916
We don't see each other for months,
and then you blast in without a care

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,916
and condemn me with your <i>bon mots.</i>

221
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,625
- Simply inquiring.
- You are judging.

222
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,833
You are judging something
for which <i>you </i>took no responsibility.

223
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
You've never shown an interest
in this family.

224
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,583
[Sherlock] I don't mean to judge.

225
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,875
We have two problems, as I see it.

226
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,041
One, finding a boarding school

227
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,833
that is willing to take Enola on

228
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,458
so she won't be a <i>complete </i>failure
in this world.

229
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
<i>That I am in the process of solving...</i>

230
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>with the help of an old friend.</i>

231
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,208
[brakes screech]

232
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,208
<i>And two, finding Mother.</i>

233
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,708
The first is my problem,
the second I consider yours.

234
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
My dear!

235
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,291
- Oh!
- [Mycroft chuckling] My dear!

236
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,000
Ooh. [chuckles]

237
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,416
- [Mycroft] Let me.
- [sighs]

238
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,333
A motor car.
How delightful, Miss Harrison.

239
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,041
[Miss Harrison]
Well, I am an educator, Mr. Holmes.

240
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,125
I like to keep ahead of the times.

241
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,000
Enola <i>may </i>prefer to stay here.

242
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,083
You could acquire a governess.

243
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,916
- She needs a firm hand, Sherlock.
- [Miss Harrison] <i>Where is she?</i>

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,958
[Mycroft] She's inside,

245
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,625
though I must warn you in advance,
she's unbroken.

246
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,208
[Miss Harrison chuckles]
We'll soon see about that.

247
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,583
We need to break her and build her up.

248
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,583
- [Miss Harrison] Stand tall, girl.
- [door closes]

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,875
That's better.

250
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,708
In Mother's absence,
she is my ward, not yours.

251
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,208
- [seamstress] Waist, 24 inches.
- [Miss Harrison chuckles]

252
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,500
- [seamstress] Chest, 33 inches.
- Well, that's too small.

253
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,708
They are perfectly fine.

254
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,125
[seamstress] Hips, 35 inches.

255
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,583
Oh, how disappointing.

256
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,458
We will have to use an amplifier.

257
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:56,375
A wild and dangerous woman
brought up a wild child.

258
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,833
She seems intelligent.

259
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,291
Hips are simply a function of legs,
aren't they?

260
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,250
What need have they of amplification?

261
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
Aren't you the clever little tongue?
I'll enjoy that.

262
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,958
I won't enjoy being imprisoned
in those preposterous clothes.

263
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,791
These clothes will not imprison.
They will free.

264
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:16,083
They will allow you to fit into society,
to take part in its numerous pleasures.

265
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,916
To catch an eye, to attract.

266
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,708
With Miss Harrison's help,
we'll make her acceptable for society.

267
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,958
Father would be turning in his grave.

268
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,625
[Miss Harrison] <i>At my finishing school,</i>

269
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,041
you will learn how to be a young lady,

270
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,083
and you'll make many new friends.

271
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't need friends.
I have my own company.

272
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,708
[Mycroft] <i>An unedcated, underdressed,</i>

273
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,375
poorly mannered wildling.

274
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,916
And I don't need to go
to your ridiculous school.

275
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,791
[Enola grunts]

276
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,708
[panting]

277
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,458
[sighs]

278
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,833
[Enola] No! Please don't do this to me.

279
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
Let me remain happy. I am happy here.

280
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,333
You are a young woman now, Enola.
You need an education.

281
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,208
Test me on anything you think
I need to know

282
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,625
- to be sufficient for this world.
- If she taught you so well,

283
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,708
you wouldn't be standing
in your undergarments in front of me.

284
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
You have no hope of making a husband
in your current state.

285
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,791
I don't want a husband!

286
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:14,125
And that is another thing
you need to have educated out of you.

287
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,083
[Enola whispers] Sherlock.

288
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,250
- Don't let him do this to me.
- You are his ward.

289
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,583
Make me yours.

290
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,541
Guide me. Teach me.

291
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,791
- For him, I am a nuisance. For you...
- Enola.

292
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,291
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,458
It's out of my hands.

294
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,500
Just like his cruelty to our mother
was out of your hands.

295
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,333
She is not dangerous.

296
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,375
She is remarkable and always has been.

297
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,000
And if you still can't see that,
then shame on you both!

298
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,958
So remarkable that she left you
in <i>my </i>care.

299
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,583
[footsteps approaching]

300
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:58,708
Well, we have had a lovely little chat,
haven't we?

301
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,708
I can tell we're going to be firm friends.

302
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,500
Oh, Miss Harrison,
I'm so grateful for your kindness.

303
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,416
Mr. Holmes,

304
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,291
it's an honor.

305
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,375
I shall bring her tomorrow myself.

306
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,833
[Miss Harrison] Yourself?

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,833
Good.

308
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:21,958
[sighs]

309
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,875
[birds chirping]

310
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,000
[Sherlock] I also enjoy a sketch.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,125
[Sherlock sighs]

312
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,041
Helps me think,

313
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,750
process my thoughts.

314
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,541
Helps me do the same.

315
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,125
[Enola grunts]

316
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,583
[Enola sighs]

317
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,083
[chuckles]

318
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,875
A caricature.

319
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,375
Perhaps best if Mycroft doesn't see it.

320
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,416
- Do you intend to stay up there?
- I was hoping for some privacy.

321
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,375
[Sherlock] You know, last I remember,
you were quite a timid little thing.

322
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,708
You had a pine cone wrapped in wool,

323
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,916
<i>dragged it with you wherever you went,</i>

324
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,541
calling it Dash.

325
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,125
<i>Someone told you that Queen Victoria
had a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</i>

326
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,125
called Dash,

327
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,041
and you decided you wanted the same.

328
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,833
We could never persuade you

329
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
- to put any trousers on.
- [Enola gasps]

330
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,375
Your bottom was always bare.

331
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,416
[Sherlock chuckles]

332
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,791
- [Enola grunts]
- I think that's all the memories I have.

333
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:35,791
[Enola] Thank you.

334
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,541
If you could now forget them all.

335
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
A pine cone called Dash?

336
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,833
That sounds ridiculous.

337
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,000
Father used to chase you
all about the place, shouting,

338
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,625
- "Get that damn dog out of my house!"
- [chuckles]

339
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,458
[sighs] Why did you never visit?

340
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,458
[sighs]

341
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,375
I lead a busy life.

342
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,541
[sighs]

343
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,791
[grunts] Why did you never write?

344
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,291
Would you have cared for my letters?

345
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,250
I have kept every clipping
of every case of yours I could ever find.

346
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,750
That's flattering.

347
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,791
And yet it took our mother's disappearance
to bring you home.

348
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
She meant to go.

349
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,583
She's not coming back.

350
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,333
No.

351
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,583
But the truth is,
Mother always had a reason for everything.

352
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,833
Her own way of doing things.

353
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,916
And those kind of mysteries
are always the most satisfying to unpick.

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,958
I don't want a mystery, Sherlock.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,083
I want my mother back here
and my life as it was.

356
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,250
You're being emotional.

357
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,416
It's understandable,

358
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,333
but unnecessary.

359
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,166
[sighs]

360
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,250
Look for what's there,

361
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,125
not what you want to be there.

362
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,458
You'll see the truth soon enough.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,833
[sighs]

364
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
"Own way of doing things..."

365
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,041
And, look, she's made this herself.

366
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,875
[frustrated grunt]

367
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,708
"Alone."

368
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,875
That's my name.

369
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,333
M... S...

370
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,958
A...

371
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,291
C.

372
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
Try it backwards.

373
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,791
Bear with me.

374
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,250
[sighs] "Chrysanthemums...

375
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
my in look...

376
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,666
Enola."

377
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,500
I hear you, Mother.

378
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,916
[floor creaking]

379
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,083
[whispering] Chrysanthemums,
chrysanthemums...

380
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,583
"The bestowing of chrysanthemums
indicates familial attachment

381
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,916
and, by implication, affection."

382
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,541
[sniffs]

383
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,500
[sighs]

384
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,333
<i>"My </i>chrysanthemums."

385
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,291
[gasps]

386
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,000
Not the ones she bought.

387
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,541
The ones she painted. [gasps]

388
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,875
Money. She must have left a message.

389
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,875
"Our future is up to us."

390
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,125
What future?

391
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,083
There are two paths you can take, Enola.

392
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,375
Yours...

393
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,541
or the path others choose for you.

394
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,000
"Our future is up to us."

395
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,958
[chuckles]

396
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,041
[Enola sighs]

397
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,166
Mother was able to vanish from Ferndell,
and so must I,

398
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,500
in the clothes
Sherlock himself grew up in.

399
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,333
It's a necessary distraction.

400
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,666
I was just beginning to master it.

401
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
Phase one of the plan complete.

402
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
<i>I'm coming to find you, Mother.</i>

403
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,708
The game is afoot.

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,958
[train whistles]

405
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,541
I couldn't go to my local station,
of course,

406
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,708
so I chose a different line altogether.

407
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,791
With my brothers after me,
there's no telling where they'd search.

408
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,041
[whistle blows]

409
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,958
[policeman] No sign of him anywhere, sir.

410
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,541
[Lady Tewkesbury] I want an assurance
that my son is not...

411
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,250
[police commander] He's not on this train.

412
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,375
Of course he's on the train!
You simply haven't looked properly.

413
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:38,000
Sir, I've had my officers search
this train from top to bottom.

414
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,375
- Darling, perhaps we should just...
- Quiet, Mother.

415
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,875
He had the carriage drop him here
this morning. He must be here somewhere.

416
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,583
Well, we're not even sure
the darling boy's on the train.

417
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm so sorry. This is such a fuss.

418
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,958
[station master] This train must leave.
We're running extremely late.

419
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,333
- You don't understand. This is my son.
- It leaves <i>now.</i>

420
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:56,250
[whistle blows]

421
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,458
Don't let this train leave
without someone on it!

422
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,000
- [conductor] All aboard!
- I insist!

423
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,625
[train whistling]

424
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,375
[train whistling]

425
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
- [Mycroft] Enola! Time to go!
- [knocks]

426
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,458
[knocking]

427
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,500
Enola, the carriage is waiting.

428
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,708
[door opens]

429
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,041
Enola?

430
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,291
Sherlock!

431
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,541

[effort grunts]

437
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,750
[grunts] Whoa!

00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,166

[pained grunts]

441
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,833
Hello.

442
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,708
- Please get out of this carriage.
- I can't.

443
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,333
I'm in hiding.

444
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,416
Bit of a to-do. Bribed a porter
to put me in this and get me on board.

445
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,375
[inhales sharply]

446
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,458
Very daring.

447
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,708
Get out of this carriage right now.

448
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,666
You're a...

449
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:52,000
a strange-looking gentleman.

450
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,625
You think you look normal?

451
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:54,708
You're not a boy at all.

452
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,291
I might be a boy.

453
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,875
- Who are you?
- What are you?

454
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,708
I'm Viscount Tewkesbury,

455
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,416
the Marquess of Basilwether.

456
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,208
You're a nincompoop.

457
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,125
I'll have you know, I have just undertaken
a particularly daring escape...

458
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,708
You have not escaped.
There is a man in a brown bowler hat

459
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,375
currently on this train searching for you,
and once he finds you,

460
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,291
he will think I helped hide you,
and I will be endangered by this.

461
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,875
Therefore, I ask you
to get out of this carriage.

462
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,458
You remind me of my uncle.

463
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,083
I've left him at the station.

464
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:33,000
Of course he's on the train.
You simply haven't looked properly.

465
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,458
[Tewkesbury] He's bossy too.

466
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,291
Left them all: my mother, my grandmother.

467
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,708
But I'm fine. I'm free.

468
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,041
Good.

469
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,208
Get out of the carriage, then.

470
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,750
A man in a brown bowler hat?

471
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:51,791
[breathes heavily]

472
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,083
It'll be fine.

473
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,000
[breathes deeply]

474
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:00,916
It'll be fine.

475
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,041
[sighs]

476
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,291
- [Tewkesbury] He's coming!
- Of course.

477
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,541
- He's checking every carriage.
- [Enola] Wonderful.

478
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,833
You have to help me.

479
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,750
- [breathes heavily] He didn't see me.
- Of course he did.

480
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,125
Therefore, I say good day to you,

481
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:21,416
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

482
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,916
You really do remind me of my uncle.
You have that same stare.

483
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,000
[sighs]

484
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,833
[breathes deeply]

485
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:41,041
Ah, there you are, sir.

486
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:42,958
[struggling grunts]

487
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,083
[struggling grunts continue]

488
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,583
[Eudoria] Paint your own picture, Enola.

489
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,000
Don't be thrown off course
by other people.

490
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:53,791
Especially men!

491
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,708
[sighs]

492
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,583

[struggling grunts]

494
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,833
Aah!

495
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,458

496

[yells] Help!

498
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,083
Help!

499
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,291
Help!

500
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,625
Somebody help me!

00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,125
Help!

503
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,833
- [Enola yells]
- [Tewkesbury] Aah!

504
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,583
Oh! Oh!

505
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,208
[breathing heavily]

506
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,833
Oh! Aah!

507
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,291

508
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,333
[breathing heavily]

509
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:40,750
[Tewkesbury] Who is that?
He was trying to kill me!

510
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,125
I'm not ready to die on a train.

511
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,666
I'm not ready to die at all.
I wasn't going to before I met you.

512
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,458
- [Tewkesbury] Where are we going?
- [Enola] I don't know yet. Let me think.

513
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,666
[woman gasping]

514
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:53,666
Terribly sorry.

515
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,208

[screeching]

518
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,416
- Is this truly the best way to come?
- Can you think of a better way?

519
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,791
[breathes heavily]

520
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,166

[breathes heavily]

522
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,833
Do you trust me?

523
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,041
- No!
- [breathes heavily]

524
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,708
If we time it correctly,

525
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,208
- we can leave him stranded.
- Time what correctly?

526
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,875
- [woman screams]
- [Enola] Listen, Tewkesbury.

527
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:01,916
We have two choices.

528
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And which one involves me <i>not </i>dying?

529
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,083
This one!

530
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,166
[Tewkesbury screams]

532
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,625

533
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:22,750
[train whistling]

534
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,083
[Tewkesbury panting]

535
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:27,083
- [Enola panting]
- [Tewkesbury grunting]

536
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,166
[Tewkesbury groans]

537
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,208
Aah!

538
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:34,500
[Tewkesbury breathing heavily
and grunting]

539
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,166
[breathing heavily]

540
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,333
You do make an awful lot of noise,
don't you?

541
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,583
Well, it turns out,
being thrown off a train

542
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,625
hurts considerably more
than you might think.

543
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,875
[Tewkesbury exhales sharply]

544
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,125
And I've lost a button.

545
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,583
[train whistling]

546
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,166
[Sherlock] So now we've lost them both.

547
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,833
I presume they have no clue
as to where she's gone, Mrs. Lane?

548
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:03,333
No, they found her bicycle.

549
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,250
Planted so as to send us
in the wrong direction.

550
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,958
This isn't as fun as you might think,
Master Sherlock.

551
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,000
She has your wits.

552
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,583
She runs rings around me
just as easily as you once did, but...

553
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,458
- Yes?
- She knows nothing of the world.

554
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,458
I must admit to being
quite seriously concerned for her.

555
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,041
Mycroft will make sure to find her.

556
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,375
[Mrs. Lane] Well, Mycroft isn't blessed
as you are.

557
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,375
As she is.

558
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,750
A matter of great bitterness for him

559
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,166
and not a small part
of the cause of this mess.

560
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,166
Enola is special.

561
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,583
She has such a good heart.

562
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,333
She's even left money on my bedside table.

563
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,291
Money?

564
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,541
You've already abandoned her once, sir.

565
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,166
I'm asking
that you don't abandon her again.

566
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,166
[footsteps receding]

567
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,166
[Enola] You do know you've entirely ruined
phase three of my plan?

568
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,833
[Tewkesbury] Phase what?
Who the hell are you?

569
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,333
Look, I believe our recent
brush with death

570
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,500
deserves me at least a name.

571
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,875
Enola Holmes.

572
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,916
Holmes... Like Sherlock?

573
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,916
And I am undercover, so forget I told you
that piece of information.

574
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,125
- Undercover working for him?
- Undercover <i>from </i>him.

575
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:31,666
- Hence why you're dressed as a boy...
- Hence why you are to say nothing.

576
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,833
So?

577
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,000
What?

578
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,250
Thank you?

579
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,875
You're supposed to say thank you.

580
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:45,833
For what?

581
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,583
[animal bleating in the distance]

582
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:01,833
[Enola sighs]

583
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,750
[Enola] We should think
about sleeping soon.

584
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,083
[Tewkesbury] We should think
about eating soon.

585
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,000
[Enola] We have nothing to eat.

586
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,000
[Tewkesbury] Of course we do.

587
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,333
<i>Arctium lappa,</i>
which you'll know as burdock.

588
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,250
Very tasty.

589
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
Um, and then there's <i>Trifolium.</i>

590
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,916
Clover.

591
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,166
And is that...

592
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,833
[chuckles] Yes, I knew it!

593
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:25,916
Mushrooms!

594
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,166
<i>Agaricus lanipes.</i>

595
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,083
The Princess.

596
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,083
Delicious.

597
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,958
If you can get a fire started,

598
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,375
I can make us a feast.

599
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,166
Fine.

600
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,833
[sighs]

601
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,666
I'm not entirely an idiot, you know.

602
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,333
[fire crackling]

603
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,041
[Enola] Hmm.

604
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,875
I've been thinking.
You need to disguise yourself a little.

605
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,041
- How do you feel about your hair?
- I've never cared for it.

606
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,625
Cut it off with a knife.
Of course you will.

607
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,916
Who taught you
how to sharpen it like that?

608
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,375
My mother.

609
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:24,791
Your mother is very different to mine.

610
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,791
[both chuckle]

611
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,333
- Who taught you about flowers and herbs?
- My father.

612
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,541
[Enola] I never really knew my father.

613
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,208
My father's dead too.

614
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,375
[both] I'm sorry.

615
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,666
[sharpens knife]

616
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,958
[Tewkesbury] Why have you run?
From home, I mean.

617
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,916
I didn't want to go to Miss Harrison's
Finishing School for Young Ladies.

618
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,250
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

619
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,250
Why have you?

620
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:55,750
Well, uh,

621
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,250
a tree branch broke above me
while I was collecting wild mushrooms.

622
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,791
It should have crushed me,
but I managed to roll out of the way,

623
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,333
and I realized that...

624
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,166
What?

625
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,458
- You'll laugh at me.
- I won't.

626
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,583
My life seemed to flash before me.

627
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,083
I was just about to take my seat
in the House of Lords.

628
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,458
I had these ideas
about how we might progress the estate.

629
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,125
But my family were set
on me joining the army

630
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,375
and then going overseas,
just like my uncle.

631
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,791
And I realized I was scared,

632
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,958
scared I would hate every second
of the rest of my life.

633
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,041
Why would I laugh at that?

634
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,791
- Don't I sound pathetic?
- No.

635
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,041
Why were they going to send you
to the finishing school?

636
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,291
[Enola sighs]

637
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,416
In the morning, we'll have to move fast.

638
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,208
The bowler hat man
will be hot on your tail...

639
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,291
Where's your destination? I'm going to...

640
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,208
London.

641
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:56,666
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

642
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,375
Well, then,

643
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,833
shall we, um, stick together?

644
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,416
If you like. [slight chuckle]

645
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,333
No.

646
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,166
We'll get to London
and go our separate ways.

647
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,500
- Understood?
- [inhales deeply]

648
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,958
Understood. [clears throat]

649
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,500
Totally. [pained grunt] Entirely.

650
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,750
Do you have to be quite so brutal
with the hair?

651
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:18,666
[Enola] Yes.

652
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,791
[sheep bleating]

653
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,750
- Well, you would say that.
- [chuckles]

654
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,083
[both laugh]

00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,541

[sheep bleating]

659
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,000
- Oh, so this is where we part?
- [Enola] It is.

660
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,291
Then, thank you, Enola Holmes,
for helping me here.

661
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,875
You were supposed to have forgotten
that name.

662
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,500
Then you'll have to find another.

663
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,166
[sheep bleating]

664
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,250
He'll be fine.

[Eudoria] Oh, you've time enough
for the world.

670
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:23,958
Let it do its damage later.

[horses whinnying]

672
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,250

[Enola] <i>And the finest things</i>

A shilling apiece!

- this country isn't ours, it's theirs.
- [crowd cheering]

686
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:04,291
We must petition the Lords.

687
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,583
And we've not only got to do it
for ourselves, but for our children!

688
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,750
[man 2] Vote for change!

689
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,583
So if I am to fit in
and stay hidden from my brothers,

690
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,000
I must become something...

691
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,250
unexpected.

692
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,750
[man 1] This is our chance!
Demand the vote!

693
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,083
Vote for all men!

694
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,875

no one anywhere.

The girl has simply vanished.

698
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,750
Of course, it doesn't help

699
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:43,000
that England's suddenly consumed
by this ridiculous marquess.

700
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,291
[attendant] Sir?

701
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:46,083
- Sherry, please.
- [attendant] Certainly, sir.

00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:47,958
You haven't been offered it, have you?

703
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,916
What?

704
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,083
The marquess case.

705
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,208
I knew his father, obnoxious sort.

706
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:57,833
Liberal, but worth a fortune.

707
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,625
I have, and I have refused it.

708
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,083
I'm rather more consumed elsewhere.

709
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,958
- Oh, in finding Mother?
- In finding our sister.

710
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,208
No.

711
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:09,958
No.

712
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,416
Your job, I made clear,
was to find Mother.

713
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,458
I'm looking for her too,
as will, no doubt, Enola.

714
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:24,541
- You never cared about her before.
- She's only 16.

715
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,375
You haven't given our name
in the search for her.

716
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,500
Of course not.

717
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:40,666
I don't want anyone knowing our business
any more than you do.

718
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,083
Oh, don't worry, little brother.

719
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,041
She may have escaped us for now,

720
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,000
but I have the best police officers
in London

721
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,291
looking for a child
matching her description.

722
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:55,041
And they <i>will </i>find that stupid little girl
and bring her back to us.

723
00:37:59,041 --> 00:37:59,958
Reform.

724
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,500
God help us. If there's one thing
this country doesn't need,

725
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,833
it's more uneducated voters.

726
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,291
England is going to pot.

727
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,583
[snoring]

728
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,625
And what does a boy like you
want with those?

729
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,208
I shall need a whalebone corset.

730
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,541
[Miss Gregory]
You shall need no such thing.

731
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,291
This is a respectable shop.

732
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,708
- Then I shall respect it.
- You don't look like you will.

733
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,916
You don't smell like you will.

734
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:40,791
And I...

735
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:41,708
[gasps]

736
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,833
Do you have anywhere I can dress?

737
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,916
[shuddering]

738
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,416
In the back.

739
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:01,541
The corset: a symbol of repression
to those who are forced to wear it.

740
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,333
But for me, who chooses to wear it,

741
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,583
the bust enhancer and the hip regulators

742
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,916
will hide the fortune
my mother has given me.

743
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,000
And as they do so,

744
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,500
they will make me look
like that truly unlikely thing:

745
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,083
a lady!

746
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,750
"You have to go to school, Enola!"

747
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:28,583
"But I don't want to go
to a finishing school, Mycroft."

748
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,583
"Well, what else
are we going to do with you?

749
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,916
You're a <i>girl!"</i>

750
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,958
Oh, come on, seriously?

751
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,875
[gasps]

752
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,416
Now, where might I find a lodging house?

753
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,916
I'll pay handsomely for good value.

754
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,000
[chuckles]

755
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,875
Is this really good value?

756
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:57,750
Oh, best value you'll find.

757
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,875
You're lucky you found me.

758
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,666
Here you have it.

759
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,166
[voices yelling and arguing]

760
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,291

[train whistling]

765
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,708
It's lovely.

766

[train chugging]

767
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,000
[Enola] <i>Now I've finally got</i>
<i>some peace and quiet to think,</i>

768
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,958
it's time for phase five of my plan.

769
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,875
Or possibly phase four.

770
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,375
Or possibly phase six.

771
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,166
I've entirely lost count.

772
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,416
It is time to find my mother.

773
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,250
To find Mother, the first thing
I need to do is leave a cipher

774
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:54,083
in every newspaper she might read.

775
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,083
"Thank you, my chrysanthemum.

776
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,166
Are you blooming? Send iris, please."

777
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,708
Iris means "message."

778
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:04,791
{\an8}Now, how to disguise them?

779
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,250
Mother can untangle anything,

780
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,291
so I need to make it most devious.

781
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,875
<i>I placed it
in the personal advertisements column</i>

782
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,375
<i>of </i>The Pall Mall Gazette,

783
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,291
which my mother seldom missed.

784
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,250
Plus the <i>Magazine of Modern Womanhood...</i>

785
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,708
[typewriter clacking]

786
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,500
<i>And </i>The Journal of Dress Reform...

787
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,375
two publications
I thought might tickle her.

788
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,875
This gentleman seems to be getting
a lot of attention.

789
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,875
Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.

790
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:41,250
[clears throat] Then I had to find out
who she really was.

791
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,208
Is.

792
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,125
Was.

793
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,833
My mother only corresponded
with one address with regularity.

794
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>It was wrong of me
to look where it was addressed to,</i>

795
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,916
<i>and entirely wrong of me
to have memorized it.</i>

796
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,208
<i>But when growing up in the countryside,
there is little excitement,</i>

797
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,875

one can get.</i>

806
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,666
Noisy bloody women!

[Edith] No, harder.
Don't be afraid of her.

810
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,916
Step forward this time. Good.

811
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:35,375
Good afternoon.

812
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,416
- You wanting to be recruited?
- No.

813
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,833
- [woman thuds and grunts]
- Uh...

814
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:43,166
I'm looking for Eudoria Vernet Holmes.

815
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,375
Enola?

816
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,583
Enola Holmes.

817
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,875
It is you, isn't it?

818
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,541
Why are you dressed like a powder puff?

819
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,208
Oh, my!

820
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,583
You look the spit of her.

821
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:02,583
You recognize me?

822
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,000
Of course I do.

823
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,375
I was your first teacher.

824
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,125
Don't you remember?

You've progressed nicely, I can see.

829
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,958
You're alone? In London?

830
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,041
Yes.

831
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,208
There was a useless boy,
but I rid myself of him.

832
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,791
[Edith] Hmm.

833
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,333
I have money, lodgings.
I just need to find her.

834
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,458
What makes you think
that she wants to be found?

835
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,791
Eudoria's been hiding all her life.

836
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,375
If she wants to stay hidden, she will.

837
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,208
- And besides, she has work to do.
- What work?

838
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,000
I cannot say.

839
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:51,333
[Eudoria] Right, ladies, our choices:

840
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,041
the bankmen met, entangle herb,

841
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,083
or Ellie Houseman.

842
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,750
[Enola] So you were at that meeting too.

843
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,666
[Eudoria] So, we're all agreed?
Ellie Houseman.

844
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,083
Who is Ellie Houseman?

845
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,083
- I wish I could help you more.
- You can, but you won't.

846
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:17,333
I must get back to my students.

847
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:19,166

- Hey!

Ah, the corkscrew.

00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,541

be tough,

857
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,083
be tough,

858
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,625
live the life,

859
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:51,083
but don't do it
because you're looking for someone.

860
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,708
Do it because you're looking for yourself.

I am Lestrade of Scotland Yard,

1063
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,666
and I'm a close personal friend
of Sherlock Holmes.

1064
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,750
So you claim.

1065
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:16,416
- He's never mentioned him.
- And you are not his assistant.

1066
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,166
He doesn't have an assistant.

1067
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,625
Sherlock Holmes always works alone.

1068
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,208
He's changed his ways
since you claim to have known him.

1069
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:26,958
- Impossible.
- Ask me three questions about him,

1070
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:30,166
and I'll ask you three, and we'll discover
who knows him best. Shall we?

1071
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,291
Enough! This circus is not appropriate
for Basilwether.

1072
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:36,750
- She's right. Leave, both of you.
- [shuddering breaths]

1073
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:37,791
But, madam, you know me.

1074
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,666
I am Lestrade, I am from Scotland Yard,

1075
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,291
and I'm investigating
your son's disappearance.

1076
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,041
- He <i>has </i>proven useful.
- Mama!

1077
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,666
I don't care if you're from the Houses of
Parliament. Leave this house this instant.

1078
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,708
[clock ticking]

1079
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,916
Me too.

1080
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,083
[door opens]

1081
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,208
[Enola] Thank you for having me.

1082
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,458
[birds chirping]

1083
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,208
His favorite tobacco?

1084
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,166
Black shag.

1085
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:19,291
- Favorite dessert?
- Plum pie.

1086
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,208
His favorite composer?

1087
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,791
Paganini.

1088
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,833
Favorite meal of the day?

1089
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,625
Breakfast.

1090
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,208
Are all your questions about food?

1091
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,375
His favorite case?

1092
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,125
The one before.

1093
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,416
Favorite board game?

1094
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:43,083
How do you know Sherlock Holmes?

1095
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,125
Chess.

1096
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,416
But only with a worthy opponent.

1097
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:48,750
[Lestrade] Hmm.

1098
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:06,375
[chuckles]

1099
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,250
[Enola panting]

1100
01:00:09,166 --> 01:00:10,000
I say!

1101
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,083
I'll pay you five pounds...

1102
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:14,875
to swap clothes with me.

1103
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,916
You needn't wear my dress
if you prefer not to.

1104
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,500
The young master,

1105
01:00:23,041 --> 01:00:24,916
he was outside a lot. Am I right?

1106
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,625
Could never get him inside.

1107
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,416
[Enola] Where would he go?

1108
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,875
The woods.

1109
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,208
[chuckles]

1110
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,375
[man] Hey! Hey!

1111
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:37,875
[people chattering]

1112
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,125
[entrance bell jingles]

1113
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,333
Grab a book and have a seat,
and I'll be with you as soon as I'm free.

1114
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,875
Delightful.
Perhaps you could join me for tea.

1115
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:50,875
I advise you not to... walk away.

1116
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,666
And yet you walk away anyway.

1117
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,916
Whatever you think you know,
Sherlock Holmes,

1118
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,750
please be advised that if you disturb
any of my customers...

1119
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,000
You'd hurt me badly?

1120
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,458
I am well aware of your talents,
Miss Grayston.

1121
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,166
The question is, what you'd risk

1122
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,125
if I were to advise my friends
in the government

1123
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,750
to take a look at this place.

1124
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,500
I know my brother would be delighted

1125
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:15,625
to browse your seditious, dangerous,
and extremely banned bookshelves.

1126
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,000
[scoffs]

1127
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:18,916
[Sherlock] You see?

1128
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,041
We can both hurt each other.

1129
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,291
Now, please put the teapot down.
In your hands, it is a mighty weapon.

1130
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:28,708
[scoffs]

1131
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:29,791
[Sherlock] Thank you.

1132
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,208
Do you have any sense
as to where my mother is?

1133
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,708
How did you find me?

1134
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,500
Letters hidden up her chimney.

1135
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,000
The ash on the sole of her shoe
and the coal dust led me to them.

1136
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:44,416
She always said you never missed anything.

1137
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,625
She needs to be home.
She has a daughter that needs her.

1138
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:51,250
Enola seems to be surviving perfectly well
on her own.

1139
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,541
So you've seen her?

1140
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,041
- Is she safe?
- She's had company,

1141
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,250
a useless boy.

1142
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,708
But clearly,
she didn't feel like she needed him.

1143
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,375
Enola is on her own path,

1144
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:07,708
and so, for better or worse, is Eudoria.

1145
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,500
- Whatever mischief you two are...
- Mischief?!

1146
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,125
A poor choice of word.

1147
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,791
Try not to sound like your brother.

1148
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,375
You haven't any hope of understanding
any of this. You do know that?

1149
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:22,833
Educate me as to why.

1150
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,875
Because you don't know
what it is to be without power.

1151
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,791
Politics doesn't interest you.

1152
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,291
- Why?
- Because it's fatally boring.

1153
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:34,166
Because you have no interest
in changing a world

1154
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,958
that suits you so well.

1155
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,125
- A pretty speech.
- [Edith] A scary one.

1156
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,625
You're intelligent enough to know
that every word of it is true.

1157
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,250
[Edith chuckles]

1158
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,500
What a family!

1159
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,000
A lost child, a puffed-up misanthrope,

1160
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:53,833
a revolutionary, and yourself.

1161
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,250
No wife, no friends,

1162
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,083
just a strange occupation

1163
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,958
obsessed with footprints and coal dust.

1164
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,416
You see the world so closely,

1165
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,750
but do you see how it's changing?

1166
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:07,833
[breathes deeply]

1167
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:10,416
The reform bill is just the beginning.

1168
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:11,958
If it passes.

1169
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,958
I have to get back to work now,
Mr. Holmes.

1170
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:18,916
Customers to serve.

1171
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,750
Cakes to bake.

1172
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:23,708
[Edith sighs]

1173
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,208
I'm pleased you're interested, at least.

1174
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,750
Eudoria thought
that you'd just ignore your sister,

1175
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:30,875
like the ostrich you are.

1176
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,583
But I suspect that she needs you.

1177
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,416
So everyone keeps telling me.

1178
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,958
- [door closes]
- [bell jingles]

1179
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,791
[sighs]

1180
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,875
A simple shave, please, Martin.

1181
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,916
Her name?

1182
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,291
May Beatrice Posy.

1183
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:09,750
[Mycroft] <i>She looked?</i>

1184
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,291
<i>Small, dark, young.</i>

1185
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,458
- How young?
- [Lestrade] Barely past 20.

1186
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:16,416
[Mycroft] Hmm.

1187
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,708
- [Mycroft] <i>Her mind?</i>
- [Lestrade] <i>Sharp as a tack.</i>

1188
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,083
<i>And what she knew of Sherlock...</i>

1189
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,583
Oh, she knew a great deal?

1190
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:24,750
As much as I.

1191
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:26,708
Oh, another sycophant.

1192
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,416
How very exciting.

1193
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:31,125
Will you tell me who she is?

1194
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:34,000
Do you have any sense
of where she might have gone?

1195
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,541
[Lestrade] Oh, you wish to track her down.

1196
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:40,291
I've been engaged in trying to do so
for a number of days.

1197
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,041
[Lestrade chuckling] Of course!

1198
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,125
She's your sister.

1199
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:46,041
Keep your mouth shut!

1200
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,916
[Mycroft sighs]

1201
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:50,666
Yes.

1202
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:54,125
And I believe I explicitly told you
to look for her.

1203
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:57,833
W... You explicitly told me
to look for a scrappy girl with no poise.

1204
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,583
This was a woman with extreme poise.

1205
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,916
[Mycroft] Oh, there's a wild thing
underneath,

1206
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,250
that I assure you.

1207
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,208
Find her,

1208
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,875
and you will be well rewarded.

1209
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,333
[Mycroft sighs]

1210
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,958
- [door opens, closes]
- [bell jingles]

1211
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,541
[chuckles]

[birds chirping]

1213
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,375
A tree branch broke above me
as I was collecting wild mushrooms.

1214
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,083
It should have crushed me.

1215
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,916
[wind chime tinkling]

1216
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,833
[Enola] Tewkesbury?

1217

[grunts]

1218
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,333
[grunts]

01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,666
[grunting]

1220

[owl hooting]

1222
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,375
[breathing heavily]

[bird squawking]

1224
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,333
[breathing heavily]

01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,708
[train whistling and chugging]

1226
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:18,000
[Enola] <i>So this is where</i>
<i>you laid your plans.</i>

1227
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:24,541
{\an8}<i>Or maybe that's what
you wanted them to think.</i>

1228
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,625
<i>You were leading them astray.</i>

1229
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,208
This must be why Bowler Hat was there...

1230
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,208
- [screams]
- following your breadcrumb trail.

1231
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,666
So what was your real plan?

1232
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,041
[chuckles]

1233
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,791
Oh, you tickle me, Viscount Tewkesbury,

1234
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,916
you magnificent
Marquess of blooming Basilwether.

1235
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:02,083
{\an8}And you're a cleverer boy
than I perhaps gave you credit for.

1236
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,875
{\an8}- [woman] It's not as stable as you think.
- [gasps]

1237
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,500
Some of those branches
are extremely capricious.

1238
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:15,541
Good morning.

1239
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,166
I believe we've already met,

1240
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,541
though you were dressed differently then.

1241
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,333
You'd already discovered this, hadn't you?

1242
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,541
[woman] We found it a few days ago.

1243
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,000
Would you care to come down?

1244
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,958
Did you see anything to report

1245
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,958
- to your... "employer"?
- [grunts]

1246
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,291
Oh.

1247
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:40,125
No.

1248
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,291
Sherlock. Um...

1249
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,708
He'll probably want to come by.

1250
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:49,583
- What did you say your name was?
- May.

1251
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,125
May Beatrice Posy.

1252
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:58,041
And how old are you, Miss Posy?

1253
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,208
Twenty-two.

1254
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,208
I'll have to let the gardener go
for lending you his uniform.

1255
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:07,416
No.

1256
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:08,916
No, I forced him.

1257
01:09:10,291 --> 01:09:11,166
Tied him up.

1258
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,375
I know jujutsu.

1259
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,083
[grunts]

1260
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,000
It's a martial art.

1261
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,083
You are most intriguing, Miss Posy.

1262
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,333
[chuckles]

1263
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,500
Or should I say "missus"?

1264
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,291
My condolences, by the way.

1265
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,833
[birds chirping]

1266
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:34,583
Beautiful, isn't it?

1267
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,875
It always felt an honor to me

1268
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,500
that my family was given
this part of England to protect.

1269
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,208
To protect?

1270
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:45,583
That is what it is
to be an ancestral landowner.

1271
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,625
As the world becomes
increasingly unstable,

1272
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:54,458
it feels important
that these ideas of England are preserved

1273
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,125
for the safety and security
of the future of our country.

1274
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,541
It is lovely here.

1275
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,583
But you're probably
one of those new thinkers.

1276
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,375
My son was a new thinker too.

1277
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,125
Never could focus on what was,

1278
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,208
it was always about what could be.

1279
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,291
I suspect my grandson is the same.

1280
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,541
England's true glory...

1281
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,625
is what is.

1282
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,000
Do you see?

1283
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,333
I can see much beauty.

1284
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:36,875
Very sensible answer.

1285
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:39,375
Now go.

1286
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:42,958
If my son or daughter-in-law
finds you here, they'll have you arrested.

1287
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:48,458
If you see my grandson before I do,

1288
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,583
will you tell him
that I care about him a great deal?

1289
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:56,500
I will.

1290
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,875
Off you go.

1291
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,708
- [horse neighs]
- [people chattering]

1292
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,333
I want four yellow flowers,

1293
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:23,625
two blue, and a red one.

1294
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,083
I don't care about the breed.
Any flower will do.

1295
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,208
What are you doing here?

1296
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:31,666
Why, if you're passionate about flowers,
would you come to London?

1297
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,208
- Because I can be lost here.
- And yet I found you.

1298
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,500
And why have you done so?

1299
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:41,916
You're here for the money.
They've offered a reward.

1300
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,875
Have they?

1301
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:44,750
I didn't know.

1302
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:48,375
Well, I must tie you up and claim it!

1303
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:50,333
[Enola laughing]

1304
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,833
Stars and garters,
are you really so ridiculous?

1305
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:58,375
I've come here because I've grown
to like you more in your absence,

1306
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:01,375
and because, as it turns out,
your life is still in danger.

1307
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,458
What's made you like me more?

1308
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,875
Really? <i>That </i>is your question?
Not "Who is trying to kill me?"

1309
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:17,291
I found your flower pressings.
They were quite beautiful.

1310
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,250
I don't give a fig about flowers,
of course.

1311
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,041
- That's because you're ignorant.
- Ignorant? How dare you?

1312
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,833
Ignorant and willfully so.

1313
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:26,250
- You could change your mind about a boy.
- I'm not a boy.

1314
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,666
[inhales deeply] I'm a man.

1315
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,875
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

1316
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,958
You do look better in breeches,
I'll give you that.

1317
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,083
I've missed you, Enola Holmes.

1318
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,750
I wanted to miss you,

1319
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
but I kept getting dragged back
towards you.

1320
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,750
Now, come on. We're in serious danger,
if you didn't know.

1321
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:58,250
- Is this how you're living?
- Did you just rent a room at the Ritz?

1322
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,833
I afforded myself
a shade more comfort than this.

1323
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,083
Well, the woman I boarded off
assured me this was a fine room.

1324
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:06,041
[Tewkesbury] Mmm.

1325
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,750
The woman you boarded off lied.

1326
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:16,916
I have but a single bed,
so you'll have to sleep on the floor.

1327
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,000
You keep old newspapers?

1328
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:25,041
Be careful with that.
I haven't finished reading it yet.

1329
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:26,958
Oh. I'm in this one.

1330
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,708
- So you are.
- Look.

1331
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:37,083
Why do you keep all these old newspapers,
Enola Holmes?

1332
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,583
My mother.

1333
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,500
I'm waiting for her to leave me a message.

1334
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,625
- She hasn't yet.
- "Message"? What...

1335
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:50,375
[Enola] She likes ciphers.

1336
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,166
Coded messages that need to be deciphered.

1337
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,500
And why would she leave you a message?

1338
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:01,958
Because she left me.

1339
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,875
And I thought she meant
for me to find her,

1340
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,416
but I'm not sure she did now.

1341
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,250
So I left her a message,
and I'm hopeful of a reply.

1342
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,500
I keep the newspapers to check.

1343
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,041
[both grunt]

1344
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,041
[Enola] I got it.

1345
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:21,541
[Enola chuckles]

1346
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,375
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1347
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,541
Don't look at me like that.

1348
01:14:27,583 --> 01:14:28,541
I'm sorry.

1349
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:30,958
I don't want your pity, Tewkesbury.

1350
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,458
If you don't stop looking at me like that,

1351
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,666
Viscount Irritation,
Marquess of Bothersomeshire,

1352
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,291
I'll murder you myself.

1353
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,708
People don't seem to want us, do they?

1354
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:50,750
No.

1355
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,958
Still, at least we've got each other.

1356
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,583
I'll make us some tea.

1357
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,375
[both chuckle]

1358
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,166
So you genuinely believe
my life's in danger?

1359
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,666
Uh, from whom?

1360
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,333
- Your past and your future.
- Whatever does that mean?

1361
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,791
[Enola] Your family. They didn't send
a detective to find you.

1362
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:21,041
They could have, and they didn't.
Instead, they sent a murderer.

1363
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,625
[Tewkesbury] Why would anyone
want me dead?

1364
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,041
Countless reasons.

1365
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,625
Your personality, your ridiculous hair,
your silly smile,

1366
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,791
or possibly your land, your estate,
your title, your seat.

1367
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,791
Same reasons they wanted your father dead.

1368
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,875
Greed does funny things to people,
Tewkesbury.

1369
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,500
So now you're saying
you think they killed my father?

1370
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:40,708
I don't think.

1371
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,291
I know.

1372
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,666
No. No, none of this
makes the slightest sense.

1373
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,083
My father's death was caused
by a botched burglary,

1374
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,750
and... and it would have been easier
to kill me before I ran away,

1375
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,166
- rather than now...
- I entirely agree. I think they tried to.

1376
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,125
I found the branch that almost killed you.

1377
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,000
- It had been cut.
- Cut?

1378
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,583
- [Lestrade] Better you...
- [Enola yells]

1379
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,541
[Lestrade grunts] Oh, gosh! Oh!

1380
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:02,916
- Oh, gosh, you...
- [Enola] Come on!

1381
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,208
- [Lestrade grunts] Come back here!
- Who's he?

1382
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,500
- Didn't you get her, Inspector?
- Shut up, you!

1383
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:10,666
[Enola] Move the chest! Move the chest!

1384
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,250
[grunts] Where are they?

1385
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,333
Open up, Miss Posy,

1386
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:18,125
- or should I say Miss Holmes?
- [Enola and Tewkesbury grunting]

1387
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:21,333
Inspector Lestrade,
I need to report an attempted murder.

1388
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:22,958
You're supposed to be on our side.

1389
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:25,083
[grunting]

1390
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,916
Help me get in through this door.

1391
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,791
Well, I'll help you when I get my money,
my finder's fee.

1392
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:32,375
You'll get your money when we catch her.
Come on!

1393
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,458
[Enola] See that window over there?

1394
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,833
It leads onto a roof.

1395
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:39,500
I need you to climb out
and take off into nowhere.

1396
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:40,416
And leave you?

1397
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,875
I need to hold this door!

1398
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,833
- But you need to get away too!
- [Lestrade grunts]

1399
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,791
If he catches you,
your life will be in danger.

1400
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:49,541
If he catches me,
it's simply a life I do not want. Now go.

1401
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:52,083
I don't want to leave you, Enola.

1402
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:53,541
[banging on door]

1403
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:54,666

He's worth more,

1418

You may not think what I'm doing is right.

1424
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,750
But even your blessed mother made a match.

1425
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,416
Even your blessed mother was a bride.

1426
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,916
I want you to be happy.

1427
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,833

You want <i>you </i>to be happy.

1429
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,125
You want me controlled.

1430
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:11,208
Because otherwise you think
I will affect your standing.

1431
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,333
You already have done immense damage.

1432
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:16,833
As has that errant brother of ours.

1433
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,333
Let me out of this carriage.

1434
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:24,375
I will deny I am your sister

1435

The name Holmes

1448

is coming to mean something
in this country.

1449

At this school,

[Miss Harrison] Do you know why
I am an educator?

It's because I want to make people happy.

1482
01:20:58,791 --> 01:21:01,666
I want you to live
a full and vibrant life.

1483
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:05,791
Not with anger and endless questions,
but with answers.

I prepare my girls for the world,

for the <i>real </i>world.

1486
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,666
I would never abandon you...

and leave you to fend for yourself.

1488
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,500
Yes.

1489
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:22,666
Mycroft told me.

1490
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,208
My mother had her reasons.

1491
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,083
I'm sure she did.

1492
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:31,916
I knew your mother.

1493
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:35,166
We were friends for a while.

1494
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,208
At school.

1495
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:40,208
She was a peculiar little thing.

1496
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,875
Was always unpredictable,
always challenging.

1497
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:46,458
She never truly cared for anything
except her own...

1498
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:48,541
unusual ideas.

1499
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,083
She cared for <i>me.</i>

1500
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,333
Then why did she leave you?

1501
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,708
Prefects will accompany you
to and from lessons.

1502
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,833
This door will always be kept locked.

1503
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:09,958
You'll thank me...

01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:52,208
You.

1514
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:55,416
Thank you, Miss Harrison.

1515
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:58,625
Oh.

1516
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,166
Of course.

1517
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:05,666
[door closes]

1518
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:09,000
I have never seen
such a range of romances in my life.

1519
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:11,625
It's enough to turn you to newspapers.

1520
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:16,541
What in heaven's are you looking for?

1521
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:21,083
Why might you be interested
in the personals? You've gone quite mad.

1522
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:24,166
I have a right to be mad
in a place like this.

1523
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,875
I was forced into calligraphy as a child.

1524
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:29,291
Ah.

1525
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,625
Hated it, but there's rarely a case

1526
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:35,541
where someone's handwriting
doesn't tell me something I need to know.

1527
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:37,916
And what might I learn from deportment?

1528
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,166
The way a person stands
may disguise who they are.

1529
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:44,125
Nothing's wasted.

1530
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:46,500
Have you found her?

1531
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,833
No, not yet.

1532
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:52,583
I went to the tearooms,
where Edith threatened me with a teapot.

1533
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,250
And to Limehouse.

1534
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,750
I believe you went there too.

1535
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:03,541
[chuckles]

1536
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,416
You've become quite the detective, Enola.

1537
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,333
Did you find the gunpowder?

1538
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,750
- And the bombs?
- I did.

1539
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,583
- Why would she...
- [Sherlock] I shudder to think.

1540
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,333
Perhaps she wants to change the world.

1541
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:23,875
Perhaps it's a world that needs changing.

1542
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,791
Will you stop her?

1543
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:31,041
I don't get involved in politics.

1544
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:34,458
Or people, either, unless they're clues.

1545
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,958
- Did you help Mycroft catch me?
- No.

1546
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,250
But you found out about the money.
You told him.

1547
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,333
You disappeared.
We had to know how far you would run.

1548
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:45,458
I'm just a case to you, aren't I?

1549
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:48,375
A curiosity. Is that why you're here,
to pick my brains?

1550
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,750
- No.
- Or possibly you're feeling guilty.

1551
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,458
I'm here because I care for you.

1552
01:24:57,583 --> 01:24:58,916
You're being emotional.

1553
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:02,583
It's understandable, but unnecessary.

1554
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,625
- [Sherlock] It's an intrigue, isn't it?
- [Enola] Emotion?

1555
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,541
The Tewkesbury case.

1556
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:21,166
A bit more complicated
than a simple disappearance.

1557
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,458
He jumped from the train...

1558
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:25,625
with another boy.

1559
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,833
Were they being chased, do you think?

1560
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,125
How did you know that?

1561
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,666
I traced your departure
to the same station that he left from.

1562
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,333
Edith mentioned "a useless boy."

1563
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:44,458
And I was telegrammed
about a young female assistant of mine

1564
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,750
who visited the Tewkesbury residence.

1565
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,875
Have you solved it?

1566
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:54,041
Not yet.

1567
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:56,875
The only advice I can give to you,

1568
01:25:58,333 --> 01:25:59,750
one detective to another,

1569
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,250
sometimes you must dangle your feet
in the water

1570
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,208
in order to attract the sharks.

1571
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,000
So that's why you came here.

1572
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,375
Shark lessons.

1573
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:13,958
No, no.

1574
01:26:16,125 --> 01:26:17,416
I came here... [sighs]

1575
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,375
To give you this.

1576
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,958
I found it under her pillow.

1577
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,333
She kept it, you see.

1578
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,000
[Enola] Dash...

1579
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:36,500
Sentimental, really, but she always did...

1580
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:40,791
She always found you quite extraordinary.

1581
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:49,125
As do I, Enola Holmes.

1582
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,583
The choice is always yours.

1583
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:00,750
Whatever society may claim,

1584
01:27:01,625 --> 01:27:02,750
it can't control you.

1585
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,250
As Mother has proven.

1586
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:08,791
[Enola breathes sharply]

1587
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,041
Keep the paper.

1588
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:14,125
[footsteps depart]

1589
01:27:15,375 --> 01:27:16,625
[door opens]

1590
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,375
[Enola] <i>Mother thought</i>
<i>I was extraordinary.</i>

1591
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:45,958
Extraordinary...

1592
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:47,500
[chuckles]

1593
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,250
The Lords...

1594
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:11,125
Lord.

1595
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,458
"Every vote counts."

1596
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:24,666
- [knocking]
- [gasps]

1597
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,166
[man] Delivery from Ferndell Hall.

1598
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,583
Care of Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

1599
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,708
What does he want? [sighs]

1600
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,541
Well... [sighs] whatever it is,

1601
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,000
it's heavy.

1602
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:39,125
[grunting]

1603
01:28:39,208 --> 01:28:40,083
[thuds]

1604
01:28:40,916 --> 01:28:43,333
- [door closes]
- What on earth does Mycroft want?

1605
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:44,500
[basket rustling]

1606
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:47,916
[continues rustling]

1607
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,083
[sneezes]

1608
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:54,125
[male voice] Ow!

1609
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:56,791
[breathing heavily]

1610
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:58,041
Tewkesbury!

1611
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,458
[chuckling] Whoa!

1612
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:00,958
[breathing heavily]

1613
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:04,041
You're supposed to be helping me out,
not getting in with me.

1614
01:29:04,375 --> 01:29:05,291
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1615
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:08,291
- How did you find me?
- Well, you said you didn't want to come

1616
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,625
to Miss Harrison's Finishing School
for Young Ladies.

1617
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,458
I have quite the prodigious memory
when I choose to use it.

1618
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,125
So I thought we'd go out
the same way I came in.

1619
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,083
[Enola] Huh.

1620
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:20,666
I even wore my most porter-ish coat.

1621
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:23,375
That's an excellent idea!

1622
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:27,291
Nope! Nope, nope, nope. Help me up.

1623
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,250
Miss Harrison,
she will see right through you.

1624
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,333
- [Tewkesbury] Oh! I knew there was a flaw!
- Shh. Let me think.

1625
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:38,625
Do you have any ideas?

1626
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,875
[grunting]

1627
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,000
[Enola groans]

1628
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:48,333
- [Tewkesbury] Quiet!
- [grunts]

1629
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:50,291
[students chattering in the distance]

1630
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,083
[grunts]

1631
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:54,291
[grunts]

1632
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,500
[grunts]

1633
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:00,375
[Miss Harrison] Stop there.

1634
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,458
Who are you?

1635
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:06,375
Have you permission to be in this school?

1636
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:07,916
Um...

1637
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,041
I was just delivering a package, miss.

1638
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:12,666
Um, to the headmistress.

1639
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:17,166
Could you please direct me to her office?

1640
01:30:18,666 --> 01:30:20,916
I am the headmistress of the school.

1641
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,625
Well, then, um, this is for you.

1642
01:30:28,541 --> 01:30:30,291
Well, open it up.
Let me see what's inside.

1643
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,333
Oh, I can't, miss.
I was given express instructions

1644
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:33,708
that this be opened in private.

1645
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,333
- Oh, how ridiculous.
- By my employer, miss.

1646
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,125
[Miss Harrison] And who might that be?

1647
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,041
Mycroft Holmes.

1648
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,875
[bell ringing]

1649
01:30:43,041 --> 01:30:44,000
Mycroft Holmes...

1650
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,875
[students approaching]

1651
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:49,916
Girls...

1652
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:54,166
Would you just take this parcel
into my office

1653
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:56,541
that I might open it later?

1654
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:58,875
[girls grunt]

1655
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,000
[girls breathing heavily]

1656
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:02,125
- [Miss Harrison] No dilly-dallying.
- [girl] Ouch!

1657
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,833
Oh, this weighs a ton!

1658
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,083
[girls grunting]

1659
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:09,250
- Why is it so heavy?
- So, what are you waiting for? A tip?

1660
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:12,458
- Go on, begone.
- [basket thuds]

1661
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:13,541
[girls sighing]

1662
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,000
[breathing heavily]

1663
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:51,750
[lively music plays]

1664
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:59,916
- [Tewkesbury] Can you actually drive this?
- I know the basic rudiments.

1665
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:01,583
[grunts]

1666
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:02,583
[pants]

1667
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:03,500
[cranks gear]

1668
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:06,041
[car sputtering]

1669
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,416
My automobile!

1670
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,208
[Tewkesbury]
Left, right, watch out, Enola!

1671
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,875
- Oh, no!
- [Tewkesbury] The bush!

1672
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,875
- [Enola] Whoo-hoo!
- [Tewkesbury] Enola!

1673
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:17,083
- [Enola] I'm not finished yet!
- [Miss Harrison gasping]

1674
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:19,833
- [Miss Harrison screams]
- [tires screeching]

1675
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,125
Thank you. That was, uh...

1676
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:24,833
You did save me.

1677
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,125
[Tewkesbury chuckles]

1678
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,375
The best bit was my idea,
but you did save me.

1679
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:30,958
You're welcome. I think.

1680
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:32,791
I didn't like it in there.

1681
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,375
No. No, of course not.

1682
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,458
Now, let's get back to London
and find a proper hiding place.

1683
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:43,916
[brakes screeching]

1684
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,000
[Tewkesbury] Why have we stopped?

1685
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,041
Enola, whatever you're planning...

1686
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,041
[Eudoria] <i>There'll come a time</i>

1687
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,583
when you have to make a hard choice.

1688
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:02,625
- Enola...
- [Eudoria] <i>And, in that moment,</i>

1689
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:05,500
<i>you will discover
what mettle you truly have,</i>

1690
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,625
and what you're prepared to risk,

1691
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,750
for what matters.

1692
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,416
Your move, Enola.

1693
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,125
We need to go to Basilwether.

1694
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,041
What?!

1695
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:26,625
An injustice has occurred.
It's time to right some wrongs.

1696
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:29,166
You want a culprit, find the motive.

1697
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,875
- I don't understand.
- When were you due

1698
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:35,666
- to be inducted into the Lords?
- I'm Viscount Tewkesbury.

1699
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,833
- Well, he's a bloomin' marquess.
- Imminently.

1700
01:33:37,916 --> 01:33:40,583
- How would you have voted on the bill?
- Votes for all men!

1701
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:43,666
- The same as my father. I'd be for it.
- Who knew that?

1702
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,750
I had these ideas,

1703
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,583
<i>but my family were set on me
joining the army and going overseas.</i>

1704
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:50,666
And who stands to gain the estate
with your father dead and if you die?

1705
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:53,000
My uncle.

1706
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:55,708
My sister-in-law
has all the help she needs. Show her out.

1707
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,333
You think this is my uncle's doing?

1708
01:33:58,541 --> 01:33:59,541
Doesn't it make sense?

1709
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,916
[Tewkesbury] <i>But he's a powerful man.</i>
<i>What on earth could we do?</i>

1710
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,875
Solve the crime, of course.

1711
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,416
Enola, we are both extremely lucky
to have lived this long,

1712
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,416
and you want to drive us into a place
where there is most certain danger?

1713
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,083
Sometimes, Lord Tewkesbury,

1714
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:17,083
you have to dangle your legs in the water
to attract the bloody sharks!

1715
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:19,500
Why would we want to attract
the bloody sharks?

1716
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,083
[sighs] Good point.

1717
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:28,791
[Tewkesbury] <i>This is a terrible idea.</i>

1718
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,208
<i>The closer we get,
the worse this idea becomes.</i>

1719
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:33,291
Why are we doing this?

1720
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:38,833
Unlike most well-bred ladies,
I was never taught to embroider.

1721
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,958
[grunts] I never molded wax roses,
hemmed handkerchiefs,

1722
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,500
or strung seashells.

1723
01:34:43,583 --> 01:34:47,250
I was taught to watch and listen.
I was taught to fight.

1724
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:49,083
This is what my mother made me for.

1725
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:50,416
[sighs]

1726
01:34:50,791 --> 01:34:51,666
Trust me...

1727
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,958
to find the answers we need.

1728
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,250
You don't know how to embroider?

1729
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,583
[sighs]

1730
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:00,791
We need to do this.

1731
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:03,875
You need to do this.We... are doing this.

1732
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:09,791
Come on.

1733
01:35:15,791 --> 01:35:17,291
[floor creaking]

1734
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:25,833
Where are all the servants?

1735
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,875
Welcome to the future.

1736
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:34,583
Mother?

1737
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,291
What's happening?

1738
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:52,750
They know we're here.

1739
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:58,625
- [rifle cocks]
- Down!

1740
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:00,041
[Tewkesbury whimpering]

1741
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:01,583
[gunshot]

1742

[panting]

1743
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,041
[Enola] Run!

1744
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:06,125
[Tewkesbury grunts]

1745
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,125
[rifle cocks]

[panting]

1747
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:10,791
It's locked!

1748
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:12,416
- [gunshot]
- [gasping]

1749
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,208
- [gunshot]
- [Enola screams]

[both panting]

1751
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,083

01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:30,583
It seems if you want a job done,

1822
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,291
you have to do it yourself.

1823
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:35,375
No, Enola.

1824

01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,083
Sherlock Holmes.

1870
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:53,666
- We meet again.
- Please.

1871
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:02,166
You've been building
quite a reputation for yourself,

1872
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,958
despite your best efforts

1873
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,708
- to avoid the press.
- The marquess case.

1874
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:08,041
You need to arrest his grandmother,
the Dowager.

1875
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:10,041
She's trying to kill him,

1876
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:11,833
as she killed his father.

1877
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,250
Two questions.

1878
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,500
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

1879
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:22,208
It's a question of divided loyalty
and succession.

1880
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:26,083
With the boy dead, the uncle would take
the vacant seat in the Lords

1881
01:44:26,166 --> 01:44:29,000
and stand against the reform bill
and the extension of the vote,

1882
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:31,625
just as the Dowager wanted.

1883
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,708
The boy, I deduce, would not,
nor would his father have.

1884
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:38,833
So why would it not be the uncle himself
that did the deed?

1885
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:40,833
To the father or the son?

1886
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:42,791
Father?

1887
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:48,750
His uniform in the press photographs.

1888
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:49,666
Oh.

1889
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:51,833
[Sherlock] The medals on his chest.

1890
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:54,791
He wasn't in the country
when the boy's father was killed,

1891
01:44:55,833 --> 01:44:58,541
- rather serving in the Afghan War.
- [Lestrade chuckles]

1892
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:02,291
It's always there, the truth.

1893
01:45:02,375 --> 01:45:03,208
Yeah.

1894
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:06,375
You just need to look for it.

1895
01:45:07,166 --> 01:45:08,541
[Lestrade] Second question.

1896
01:45:10,958 --> 01:45:13,333
How did your sister get there before ya?

1897
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:16,500
I'm sorry?

1898
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,291
[men chattering indistinctly]

1899
01:45:24,791 --> 01:45:25,625
Ha!

1900
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,458
[Tewkesbury] I look fine.

1901
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,458
[Sir Whimbrel]
Don't fuss over him, Caroline.

1902
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:42,125
- Please, Mother.
- Oh, can I just...

1903
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:44,666
Don't. I'm trying to have
these men's respect.

1904
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,541
It's quite the style, you know.

1905
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:50,458
Yes. I suppose
it sets your face off nicely.

1906
01:45:52,958 --> 01:45:54,791
Your father would be very proud of you.

1907
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:13,250
Congratulations. You finally look
like the nincompoop you were born to be.

1908
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:16,333
- [chuckles]
- [Enola] No.

1909
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:17,833
You look good.

1910
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:19,875
This is... good.

1911
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:23,458
The vote is in an hour. It's, um...
It's quite the thing.

1912
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:27,958
I'm not supposed to bow or anything, am I,
now that you are whatever you are?

1913
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,208
Well, arguably, you always had to bow.

1914
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:32,208
You just... chose not to.

1915
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:33,166
[chuckles]

1916
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,916
So, uh, are you safe? Are you...

1917
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:38,666
Are you... are you comfortable?

1918
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:40,583
You're not still living

1919
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,916
- in that terrible lodgings house, are you?
- No. [chuckles]

1920
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,791
I used the reward money
your mother gave me...

1921
01:46:44,875 --> 01:46:47,500
- Which you reluctantly took.
- And found somewhere new.

1922
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:51,041
Well, Mother has said that there's, um...

1923
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:52,916
there's... there's always room for you
with us.

1924
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Your mother clearly hasn't spent
enough time with me.

1925
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,791
And what if it was I that...

1926
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:01,583
asked you to stay?

1927
01:47:04,583 --> 01:47:05,541
A kind offer,

1928
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:07,166
but one I must refuse.

1929
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:24,041
I...

1930
01:47:24,666 --> 01:47:25,708
How will I... How...

1931
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,083
When will I see you again?

1932
01:47:29,916 --> 01:47:31,166
You're not rid of me <i>yet,</i>

1933
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:33,875
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

1934
01:47:40,833 --> 01:47:41,666
[sighs]

1935
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:58,541
[chuckles]

1936
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:02,666
[sniffles]

1937
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:05,083
Ah.

1938
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:13,250
[man] Thank you.

1939
01:48:14,875 --> 01:48:16,125
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1940
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:18,166
[sighs]

1941
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,041
[Enola] Mother.

1942
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:25,083
May I borrow your pencil?

1943
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:26,625
Thank you.

1944
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:33,541
Numbers turn into letters,

1945
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:36,166
which forms into...

1946
01:48:36,625 --> 01:48:38,875
[Enola] <i>Five, two, five, five,</i>
<i>three, three, one.</i>

1947
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,166
<i>- One, one, one.</i>
- [sighs]

1948
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,291
[continues reading numbers indistinctly]

1949
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:45,791
[sighs]

1950
01:48:45,875 --> 01:48:48,958
"Meet me Royal Academy
five tonight Mother."

1951
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:51,541
Well,

1952
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:53,916
that's unexpected.

1953
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:56,875
Thank you.

1954
01:48:56,958 --> 01:48:59,250
There are three thoughts
that immediately occur.

1955
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:02,333
One is that Mother wouldn't have signed
"Mother," but "Chrysanthemum."

1956
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,583
And two,
the Royal Academy is an institution

1957
01:49:05,666 --> 01:49:08,125
that has consistently neglected
to include women.

1958
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:11,166
Mother wouldn't have suggested it
as a meeting place.

1959
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:14,083
And my final thought
is that I may have revealed my hand

1960
01:49:14,166 --> 01:49:16,125
<i>in front of my brother
when checking the newspaper.</i>

1961
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,083
This is Sherlock Holmes's doing.

1962
01:49:22,833 --> 01:49:26,125
And yet, facts don't distract from hope.

1963
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,875
I'll pay you five pounds
to swap clothes with me.

1964
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:35,916
[Sherlock] Anything?

1965
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:38,333
[Mycroft] Nothing at all.

1966
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:41,208
She beat you once before, little brother,

1967
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,500
and now she may have done so again.

1968
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,666
Oh, I do believe she thought it me,

1969
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:48,458
but I also believe
that she'd be too intrigued

1970
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:50,416
not to be here all the same.

1971
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,208
Unfortunately, you were wrong.

1972
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,250
- [Mycroft chuckles]
- It's possible.

1973
01:49:55,875 --> 01:49:58,250
Nevertheless, if we do find her again,

1974
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,750
I'd like her to be my ward.

1975
01:50:00,416 --> 01:50:01,541
I'll take care of her.

1976
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:05,458
Well... [sighs] on your head be it.

1977
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:07,916
I washed my hands of her.

1978
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:09,375
Very well.

1979
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,125
All the better.

1980
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:15,791
You are a strange fish, little brother.

1981
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:19,083
And you're a cantankerous one,
older brother.

1982
01:50:19,625 --> 01:50:22,375
I assume you're being so delightful
because of the vote?

1983
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:24,000
Passed by one.

1984
01:50:24,083 --> 01:50:27,166
That reemerging little toadstool,
the Marquess of Tewkesbury,

1985
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,916
and his vote proved decisive.

1986
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:32,000
Now, much as I enjoy
standing outside the Royal Academy...

1987
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:34,500
- He's an interesting character, you know?
- [Mycroft] Hmm?

1988
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:36,708
And I suspect he's rather keen
on young Enola.

1989
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:39,500
Then he should marry her.
Maybe it'll tame them both.

1990
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:42,291
Drink at the club to commiserate me?

1991
01:50:43,333 --> 01:50:45,875
Yes, I'll buy you a drink, Mycroft.

1992
01:51:09,333 --> 01:51:10,750
[Mycroft] Come on, Sherlock!

1993
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,583
[cobbler] Here you go, sir.

1994
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:26,125
[coin clatters]

1995
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,291
What on earth were you doing?

1996
01:51:38,583 --> 01:51:39,958
[Sherlock] Thought I saw something.

1997
01:52:11,125 --> 01:52:13,166
- Good afternoon, Enola.
- Good afternoon.

1998
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:14,375
You've got a visitor.

1999
01:52:25,875 --> 01:52:26,750
[inhales sharply]

2000
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:29,458
This is a surprisingly nice room.

2001
01:52:30,875 --> 01:52:32,333
I like the finishing touches.

2002
01:52:38,958 --> 01:52:40,958
[inhales sharply] I can't stay long.

2003
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:43,625
People might be watching.

2004
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:48,291
How on earth did you find that?

2005
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:49,875
Sherlock did.

2006
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:53,791
I thought you had forgotten it.

2007
01:52:55,916 --> 01:52:58,291
You never could leave it alone
as a little girl.

2008
01:52:58,375 --> 01:53:01,083
- You used to drag it around behind you...
- Sherlock said.

2009
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:06,375
- You'd heard Queen Victoria had...
- Sherlock said that too.

2010
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:13,916
Well...

2011
01:53:14,875 --> 01:53:16,708
nice that you two have connected.

2012
01:53:24,916 --> 01:53:25,833
I'm sorry.

2013
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:31,500
I'm sorry.

2014
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:36,500
I wanted to tell you where I was going,

2015
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:38,875
but it wasn't safe.

2016
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,416
Are you safe now?

2017
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:44,833
[shuddering breaths]

2018
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:48,625
I didn't leave you
because I didn't love you.

2019
01:53:51,958 --> 01:53:53,500
I left <i>for </i>you...

2020
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:55,875
because I couldn't bear...

2021
01:53:56,625 --> 01:54:00,875
to have this world be your future.

2022
01:54:03,666 --> 01:54:04,833
So I had to fight.

2023
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,833
You have to make some noise

2024
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:10,500
if you want to be heard.

2025
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:15,916
Oh, it's funny. [chuckles]

2026
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:17,250
I thought...

2027
01:54:18,375 --> 01:54:21,666
I was the one
that was going to change the world.

2028
01:54:24,458 --> 01:54:25,541
The reform bill,

2029
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:29,250
is it true what you did?

2030
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:30,708
[chuckles]

2031
01:54:30,791 --> 01:54:31,625
[sniffles]

2032
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:35,958
What a woman you've become.

2033
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:37,625
[sniffles]

2034
01:54:38,041 --> 01:54:38,958
[Eudoria chuckles]

2035
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:43,875
[breathes deeply]

2036
01:54:44,541 --> 01:54:46,458
[shuddering breaths]

2037
01:54:52,791 --> 01:54:53,708
[Eudoria sniffles]

2038
01:54:58,875 --> 01:54:59,833
[both chuckle]

2039
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:03,541
[Eudoria sniffles]

2040
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:08,875
Thank you for your irises.

2041
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:11,666
Now, if you ever...

2042
01:55:12,416 --> 01:55:13,458
ever need me,

2043
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:15,833
I'll be looking out for them.

2044
01:55:19,333 --> 01:55:21,000
- You have to go.
- Yes, but...

2045
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,833
let's just stay like this for a bit.

2046
01:55:27,083 --> 01:55:28,333
I'd like that too.

2047
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:40,500
[Enola] <i>So, how to conclude?</i>

2048
01:55:43,166 --> 01:55:44,166
My name is Enola,

2049
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,875
which, backwards, spells "alone."

2050
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:49,791
To be a Holmes,
you must find your own path.

2051
01:55:50,666 --> 01:55:51,583
<i>My brothers have,</i>

2052
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,291
<i>my mother has,</i>

2053
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,458
<i>and I must too.</i>

2054
01:55:57,708 --> 01:55:59,250
[both grunting]

2055
01:55:59,333 --> 01:56:02,500
<i>But I now see that being alone
doesn't mean I have to be lonely.</i>

2056
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:04,750
<i>Mother never wanted that.</i>

2057
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,041
She wanted me to find my freedom,

2058
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:09,875
<i>my future,</i>

2059
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:11,958
my purpose.

2060
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:14,583
I am a detective,

2061
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:16,916
I am a decipherer,

2062
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,583
and I am a finder of lost souls.

2063
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:20,833
[Enola laughing]

2064
01:56:20,916 --> 01:56:22,583
[Eudoria laughs]

2065
01:56:22,666 --> 01:56:23,833
My life is my own.

2066
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:29,000
And the future is up to us.

2067
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,750
[upbeat music plays]
