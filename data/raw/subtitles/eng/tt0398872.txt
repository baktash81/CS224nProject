00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,906
That's it?
That's your plan?

184
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,307
Yeah. Pretty good, huh?

185
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,080
Larry, how do you even know
this contest is for real?

186
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,449
It's been everywhere.
Check this out.

187
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,917
What's this?

188
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,118
It's a magazine ad.

189
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,254
The final competition
is in three weeks.

190
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,223
I just know my
animals can pull it off.

191
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,292
Three weeks? Okay.

192
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,493
Three weeks.

193
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,998
After that, the bus, the tent,
everything goes back to me.

194
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,132
Understand?

195
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,970
Thanks, P.T., you're
a real friend.

196
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,171

Man, oh man, oh man, oh man,
have I got news for you!

200
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,135
What's that?

201
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,470
This, my dear Dorothy,
is our destiny.

202
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,373
Huh. Density. Cool.

203
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,010
It's a contest that
we are going to win.

204
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,144
What kind of contest?

205
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:28,548
Oh, a contest for
talented, unique,
amazing animals.

206
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,118
Hey, like, that's us!

207
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,920
I'll bet our show can win it.

208
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,155
We are amazing, aren't we?

209
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,223
Totally.

210
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,992
With our current act, no.

211
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,427
Reality check, guys.

212
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,196
We need to think
outside the cage.

213
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,232
We need something new,

214
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,434
something that people
have never seen before.

215
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,970
Are you with me?
We need something big.

216
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,006
Hey, I need something big,
I need something,
something big.

Please.

I'm just a ferret.
There's no good meat on me.

223
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,204
I don't wanna eat you.

224
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,605
No?

00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,606
Then, what you want?

226
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,141
Just your autograph.

All of yours,
if you don't mind.

You guys are incredible!

230
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,347
There you are.

231
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,482
What's your name?

Clifford.
And this is Cleo and T-Bone.

233
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,520
Love the show. Phenomenal!

00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,223

CLEO: You must all lead
such exciting lives.

236
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:49,596
Well, I don't think
that we particularly...

237
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,498
Of course we do.

238
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,468
Between the shows, the travel,
the crowds of adoring fans,

239
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,370
yeah, it's pretty cool.

240
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,006
ALL: Wow!

241
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,209
How about you guys?
You in the biz?

242
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:05,078
Well, I don't like
to brag or anything,

243
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:10,650
but it's often been
said that I do have,
oh, you know, talent.

244
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,386
Yeah, yeah, I kind of
picked up on that vibe.

245
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,389
So, would you all be
interested in joining
our cast?

246

What!

Have you guys
ever heard of Tummy Yummies?

a talent contest
in three weeks.

and a lifetime
supply of Tummy Yummies.

255

Wow.

256
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,281
I can go grab Larry right now
and sign you up.

257
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,549
It's no problem.

258
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,417
Oh, thank you,
but we could never...

259
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:48,121
Just pass up
an offer like this.

T-Bone, doggy conference,
outside, now please.

261
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,224
We'll be right back.

262
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,066
Guys, I think we
should consider this.

263
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,533
What!

264
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,135
I'd never leave
Emily Elizabeth.

265
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,436
Or Sheriff Lewis.

266
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,272
And what about Mrs. Diller?

267
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,373
You'd really miss her.

268
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,674
Gee.

269
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,509
I hadn't thought about that.

270
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,144
It's just...

271
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,080
It all seems so exciting.

272
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,515
So, is there a problem?

273
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,684
Sorry, guys.
Sounds like fun.

274
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,119
We're sticking around here.

275
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,420
But thanks anyway.

276
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,422
Sure.
Okay.

Hey, man, wait.
Take this little
souvenir with you.

278

And in case you
change your mind,

279
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,597
we'll be with P.T.'s carnival
tomorrow night
on the mainland.

280
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,631
Thanks.

281
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,367
Well, take care, you guys.

you again next year.

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,371

I'll be back
with more.

297

Would you look at the size
of that dog's breakfast.

298

Morning, Mom.
Morning, Dad.

Good morning, Morris.

301
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,642
You know, I just
don't know how you
do it year after year.

302
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,211
Do what?

303
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,379
Feed that dog.

304
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,548
Look at him.
He's got one big appetite.

305
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,550
MR. HOWARD: Big? It's huge.

306
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,386
How much does
he eat a year?

307
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,321
Well...

308
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,455
Clifford eats quite a lot.

309
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,558
I can't imagine
trying to keep up
with that appetite.

310
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,661
I'll bet he eats
more in a week than

311

MR. HOWARD: Well, yes, but...

313
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,601
He's like a
bottomless pit.

314
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,703
Why, he'll eat you
out of house and home.

315
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,770
Well, I wouldn't...

316
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,240

be a big problem.

318
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,443

quite a lot.

must be a big problem.

How can you afford
to feed that dog?
He eats so much.

327

Problem?
Well, we mortgaged the house.

Where's that ad from
Larry's Amazing Animals?

Over there. Why?

336

What do you need that for?

337
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,662
I'm a problem.
Mr. Bleakman said so.

338
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,497
I eat too much
and they can't
afford to feed me.

339

What?

340
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,567
Maybe you misunderstood them.

341
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,802
I'm always
misunderstanding things.

342
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,705
You don't say.

343
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,375
No, T-Bone, I heard
them loud and clear.

344
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:32,412
I'm gonna join Larry's
show and win that
Tummy Yummies contest.

345
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,281
And leave Emily Elizabeth?

346
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,748
Not forever.

347
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,418
Just long enough to win
a lifetime supply of food.

348
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,786
Clifford, are you sure?

349
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,788
I mean, maybe if you waited...

350
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,556
I can't wait, T-Bone.

351
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,925

I'm leaving.

00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,715
We had no other choice!

1073
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,082
Oh, man.

1074
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:15,119
So all Big Red wanted
was to help out his family.

1075
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,957
I messed up, guys. I...

1076
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:24,829
I guess it's not your fault.
You just didn't know.

1077
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,831
But now I do.

1078
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:28,966
Let's go.
Where?

1079
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,837
To see a man about a dog.

1080
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,008
You dognapped Big Red
and I want him back.

GEORGE: Well, that's too bad,

1082
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:43,080
because Clancy just loves
his new life of luxury.

1083
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:44,749
He's a Wolfsbottom now.

What's the matter?

1087
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:01,031
You have owners?

1088
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:14,879

Are you by chance,
the owner of a very large,
very red dog?

1092
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:32,396
Morning.
Howdy.

Who are you here to see, sir?

1094
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:36,300
I'm Larry Gablegobble,
and I'm here to see
Mr. Wolfsbottom.

1095
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,367
What about?

01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,804
Uh. (LAUGHS)

1097
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:43,841
Well, it's about your...
Your lawn.

1098
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,810
You know,
I could make it greener.

1099
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,344
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

1100
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:48,913
But I only need a minute.

1101
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,447
So much for plan A.
Mmm-hmm.

1102
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,316
Then it's time
for plan double-A.
