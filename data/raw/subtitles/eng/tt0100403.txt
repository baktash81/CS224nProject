1
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,474
<i>The heat wave continues.
It's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.</i>

2
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,074
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonising heat,

3
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:48,395
drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

4
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:52,114
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

5
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:06,314
We're in a war zone, Dave: two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire,

6
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:11,114
the police seemingly unable to rescue them
in spite of several desperate, heroic attempts.

7
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:14,074
It's completely out of control down here.

8
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:23,874
My beautiful cantina, everything
I own, they shot it to pieces.

9
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:27,234
My microwave,
my automatic steamer, my grill...

10
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,354
<i>You fucking pendejos!</i>

11
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:03,514
Fuck you!

12
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,834
<i>Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.</i>

13
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,634
It's like Dante's hell:

14
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,794
Smoke, fire, oppressive heat,

15
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:19,514
as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

16
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:23,274
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops? Uh-uh.

17
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:26,195
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

18
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:29,114
Mr Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe,

19
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:32,394
get off your butt, get down
here and declare martial law!

20
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,914
OK, don't keep me in suspense, Danny boy!

21
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:02,194
It has not been a nice day!

22
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:06,834
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

23
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:10,954
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

24
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,354
They're trying to get
in their headquarters.

25
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:17,154
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

26
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:19,914
Fuck! They're dying, man.

27
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,194
Where the hell
is Special Weapons?

28
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:27,034
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

29
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:28,714
They shot down a chopper.

30
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:32,954
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

31
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,114
I'm gonna chat with these assholes.

32
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:38,234
- When I give the signal, give me some cover!
- Got it!

33
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,834
Too small.

34
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,554
Right.

35
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,155
Come on! Come on!

36
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:36,954
Get 'em out of here! Now!

37
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,394
<i>!Vámonos!</i>

38
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,314
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

39
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:07,794
<i>- !Vámonos!
- !Vámonos!</i>

40
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,314
Hey, assholes!

41
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,714
Mike, are you OK?

42
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,354
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.
- We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.

43
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,795
He says surround building and wait.

44
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:00,715
- Wait for what?
- I don't know!

45
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:04,114
Some bullshit special unit.
The feds, the DEA.

46
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:07,594
If we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

47
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:11,955
<i>- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.</i>

48
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:13,514
<i>!Vámonos!Vámonos!</i>

49
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:15,394
<i>!Venga!Aprisa!</i>

50
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,315
<i>!Venga!</i>

51
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,394
<i>!Chingale!Chingale!</i>

52
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:30,714
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

53
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,434
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

54
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,954
Let's go.

55
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,914
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

56
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:52,394
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass! Come on!

57
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,354
Goddamn it. Go with him.

58
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:22,114
Three, two, one...

59
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:23,794
Go!

60
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,794
Get back.

61
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:38,354
Next door over.

62
00:08:54,754 --> 00:08:56,475
Take this room!

63
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,794
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

64
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:23,394
Freeze!

65
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:25,114
I said hold it!

66
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:29,194
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

67
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,834
I said put it down, asshole!

68
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,795
No!

69
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:03,074
- Let's do it now!
- Take it easy.

70
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:08,834
Damn, it's hot.

71
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:35,554
Must be losing it.

72
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,154
<i>Mike!</i>

73
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,714
<i>Spread out. Secure the roof.</i>

74
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:44,674
<i>Just take it easy. I'm right here.</i>

75
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:47,794
All clear. All clear on the site.

76
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:50,114
<i>Oh, Danny boy.</i>

77
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,594
I gotta get down from here.

78
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,994
Shit.

79
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,994
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

80
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,554
Seal it off. No one leaves.

81
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:06,074
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

82
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,274
<i>- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.</i>

83
00:11:22,754 --> 00:11:24,314
Leona.

84
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,714
Oh, shit.

85
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,914
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

86
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,914
What the hell is this?

87
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,594
I don't know.

88
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:09,554
They've been cut to pieces.

89
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:13,674
- Must be the Jamaicans.
- Their style, but where the hell did they go?

90
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:18,074
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

91
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,674
OK, you know the drill.

92
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:48,555
Mike.

93
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,274
Up there.

94
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:01,634
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

95
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:07,634
That's about 35, 40 feet.
No rope, no ladder.

96
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:11,114
The guy weighs about 190, 195 pounds.

97
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,994
<i>You couldn't carry him up there.</i>

98
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,034
Lieutenant?

99
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:20,034
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

100
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:22,034
Son of a bitch.

101
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:25,194
What the fuck is going on?

102
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:28,074
This is not good, Mike. Not good at all.

103
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:35,234
- I want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

104
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,914
Mike.

105
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:42,034
<i>Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?</i>

106
00:13:42,474 --> 00:13:46,034
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

107
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:49,194
I thought we had an understanding.

108
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,554
I put my ass on the line to get you here,

109
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,234
and all I expect is a little cooperation!

110
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,354
You were told this was a federal matter.

111
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:00,994
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

112
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,275
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

113
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,554
<i>Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!</i>

114
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:11,234
<i>I'll push it as far as I can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for our lives here,</i>

115
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:14,835
<i>while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!</i>

116
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:20,114
I don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds,

117
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,394
without a goddamn good explanation!

118
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:48,435
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

119
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,994
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

120
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:04,594
What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?

121
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:09,074
Insubordination. Disregard for direct orders
from a supervising officer.

122
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,434
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

123
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:15,114
- I'll show you insubordination, you son of...
- No!

124
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,955
Where you running to? Come here!

125
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,754
You don't need this, Mike.
It's not worth it.

126
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,554
Relax.

127
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,354
Oh, fuck!

128
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:44,314
<i>I have an update for you.</i>

129
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,634
<i>In a shootout, five members
of one Colombian drug gang</i>

130
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:51,794
<i>were ambushed by their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse,</i>

131
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:56,074
<i>who escaped without a trace -
again making total fools of...</i>

132
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,795
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

133
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:03,154
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

134
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:08,034
- This licence has expired.
- Bullshit! I paid that fee six months ago.

135
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,875
- I'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

136
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:14,114
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

137
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,714
What you lookin' at?

138
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,354
And all you got to do

139
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:25,314
is tee it high and let it fly.

140
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:28,714
Dead solid perfect.

141
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:33,394
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

142
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:36,795
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

143
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,794
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

144
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:41,954
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

145
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,834
Heinemann's already been up my ass so far
I won't be able to sit down for a week.

146
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,674
We're not winning this war.

147
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:50,594
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

148
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:55,634
"Effective immediately, a federal task force
under Special Agent Peter Keyes

149
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:02,194
will investigate criminal activities involving
the trafficking of controlled substances. "

150
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:05,315
<i>And you will extend him
your full cooperation.</i>

151
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:08,314
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

152
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,434
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

153
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,274
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

154
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,594
- It's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

155
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:22,074
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

156
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,795
Heard a lot about you.

157
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:27,994
I'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.

158
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:30,954
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

159
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:36,034
But we want to prevent King Willie's voodoo
gangs from taking over the entire West Coast.

160
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:39,875
I wish I could tell you more.

161
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:43,394
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

162
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:47,474
You know how it is. We all have a job to do.

163
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:52,635
Now, I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation and act responsibly.

164
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:54,954
Well,

165
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:57,155
cooperation

166
00:17:58,554 --> 00:18:00,474
is my middle name.

167
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,794
I'll see you around.

168
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,554
- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat. I'll be right with you.

169
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:22,194
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

170
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:26,674
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

171
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:30,514
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

172
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:33,394
The next minute they're all shish kebab.

173
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,114
Not one bullet wound.

174
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,755
It wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

175
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:42,034
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

176
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:44,314
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

177
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:46,474
More than one, we would have seen them.

178
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:49,674
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute,

179
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,754
and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

180
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,034
And then got by us.

181
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:59,274
Maybe we should give him a job.
Let's put him on the payroll.

182
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:03,154
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

183
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,634
- You gotta hear this.
- What?!

184
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,114
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

185
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,834
See that guy there?

186
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,834
That's Ferris's replacement.

187
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:16,995
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

188
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,794
That's the Lone Ranger?

189
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,674
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

190
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:24,914
I said "Lady, you are under arrest. "
And she said "Why?"

191
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:28,194
I said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him. "

192
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,194
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- No.

193
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:35,795
She said "I stabbed that son of a bitch
plenty of times. He never died on me before. "

194
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:43,434
Looks like he's putting the moves to Leona.

195
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:45,234
His first big mistake.

196
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,354
I have heard about you.

197
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:52,115
Yeah?

198
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:55,395
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

199
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:56,514
Well...

200
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:02,034
You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker,
you can kiss these goodbye.

201
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,074
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

202
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:09,074
Well, well, I see that
the three of you have met.

203
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:12,834
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it,

204
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:17,474
why don't you limp your way in
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

205
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,835
- You're a bad girl.
- I like that.

206
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:27,714
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag or what?

207
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:36,835
This is what I call "the speech", kid.
I only give it once, so pay attention.

208
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:42,074
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

209
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:46,314
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

210
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:48,234
Lieutenant, I've paid my dues.

211
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,674
I had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

212
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,914
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

213
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:55,554
<i>No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.</i>

214
00:20:55,634 --> 00:21:00,275
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. I won't stand for it.

215
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:05,074
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

216
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:07,354
But the team comes first.

217
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,274
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

218
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,954
Remember, the door swings both ways.

219
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,314
That's it.

220
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,714
Hey, kid.

221
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,034
Welcome to the war.

222
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:54,954
OK, guys. This has gone too far now, huh?

223
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,394
Hey, guys.

224
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,794
I know you're trying to scare me, huh?

225
00:22:03,194 --> 00:22:06,714
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.

226
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:08,714
I'm scared now.

227
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,434
Stop it now.

228
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,434
I can pay you.

229
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,275
$2 million, man. In cash.

230
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:19,114
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

231
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,314
This is about power!

232
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:25,274
There's a new king in the streets.

233
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,594
This is a message he has for your people.

234
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:30,594
You are history.

235
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:33,474
<i>Fucking history, goddamn puto.</i>

236
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,075
What the fuck are you doing now, man?

237
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,074
You're crazy!

238
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:49,354
King Willie says

239
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,314
not only do I have to kill you,

240
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:59,954
but I have to take your soul.

241
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,034
Voodoo magic.

242
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:08,594
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

243
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:15,594
But you know what?
I tell you what I believe.

244
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,155
Shit happens.

245
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:37,514
Shoot it!

246
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,034
Fucker!

247
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,274
<i>Shit happens.</i>

248
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:51,194
I'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

249
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:54,394
<i>.. involving as many as 20 people.
It's uncertain who they were.</i>

250
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:57,994
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

251
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:03,074
I go in for my physical and the doctor says
"I need a semen, stool and urine sample. "

252
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:07,035
I say "Gee, doc, I'm in a big hurry.
Can I just leave my underwear?"

253
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,754
Oh, God.

254
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:14,754
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

255
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,474
Oh, man, it's Pope.

256
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:18,514
That parasite must live in his car.

257
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:20,834
I'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

258
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:23,554
Word is they want your ass off the job.

259
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,474
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

260
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:28,155
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

261
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:31,314
- I got a job to do!
- Your job is to root for garbage elsewhere.

262
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:34,475
- Been inside?
- Yeah. We were gonna go in with our guys,

263
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:38,754
but we were told on a radio transmission
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

264
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:43,954
<i>All units, be advised.
Federal officers will handle investigation.</i>

265
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,955
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

266
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:49,434
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

267
00:25:50,274 --> 00:25:52,754
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if I borrow it?

268
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,554
OK.

269
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:13,354
Damn!

270
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,314
Look familiar?

271
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:20,914
Fuck.

272
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:23,194
Oh, God.

273
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:26,714
Ramon Vega, the crack king.

274
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,314
Biggest operator in East LA.
100 keys a week.

275
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:34,275
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

276
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:35,954
That makes no sense.

277
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:39,674
This was a voodoo ritual. I've seen it
before. They took his heart out.

278
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:41,994
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

279
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:44,954
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

280
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:48,194
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

281
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:52,515
King Willie, voodoo priest of the LA posses.

282
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:55,634
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica

283
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,634
till he got too powerful.

284
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:00,634
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

285
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:02,594
So what the fuck happened?

286
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,274
Shit!

287
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:08,194
Hey, we got a survivor!

288
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:18,594
What's she saying?

289
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:21,714
I don't know. She's not making any sense.

290
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:26,154
<i>She keeps saying "El diablo vino
por ellos. " The devil came for them.</i>

291
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:31,514
If it's the Colombians, why'd they leave their
boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor?

292
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:34,394
- It wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armoury.

293
00:27:34,474 --> 00:27:36,514
Right.

294
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:38,514
We got a new player in town.

295
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:41,954
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

296
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:47,914
What is that?

297
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:51,755
Looks like a spear tip or something.

298
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:54,274
This is a restricted area.

299
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,594
I want it cleared immediately.

300
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,594
You're walking on physical evidence.

301
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:01,515
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

302
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:04,994
Lieutenant, I'd like
a word with you in private, please.

303
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:13,074
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

304
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,915
- I know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

305
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:19,394
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

306
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,355
Maybe you can hear this.
The next time you cross me,

307
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,234
you're gonna turn up missing.

308
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,314
- Garber, the man with the camera. Get him.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,635
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

310
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:36,034
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

311
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,034
Hey, wait a minute!
I got my rights! I'm a journalist.

312
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:42,034
- Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

313
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,554
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

314
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:48,034
Take him out of the building. Search him.

315
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:51,715
Now you get the hell out of here.

316
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,354
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

317
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,754
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

318
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:14,114
Wanna make me proud, kid?

319
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:17,674
Take your bag of tricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

320
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:21,434
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

321
00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:24,314
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

322
00:29:24,394 --> 00:29:26,834
OK, then. Just get going.

323
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,234
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

324
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,034
Danny, look here.
We gotta take this real cool.

325
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:38,834
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

326
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:42,434
You stick around, stay out of sight.
I'll meet you at one o'clock.

327
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,834
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

328
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,914
<i>Danny boy, no hero stuff, understand?</i>

329
00:29:55,354 --> 00:29:57,434
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

330
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,394
She never made it.

331
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,474
The feds were waiting.

332
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,794
Hustled her off in a chopper.

333
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:14,754
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

334
00:30:17,474 --> 00:30:21,314
And guess what. Your pal Keyes was
running the whole show. And his butt boys.

335
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:23,634
Son of a bitch.

336
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,594
You done real good, kid.

337
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,874
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.

338
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:31,275
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

339
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:33,274
Who knows? You might just get lucky.

340
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:35,354
Lieutenant!

341
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,915
Luck

342
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:38,914
is my specialty.

343
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,234
Yeah. I bet it is.

344
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:52,474
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,
I got some serious police work to attend to.

345
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,834
Come to Papa.

346
00:30:56,994 --> 00:30:59,554
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

347
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,514
How are yours?

348
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:03,994
- Hey, do you mind? It's my sister.
- Say what?

349
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,794
<i>Oh, you're not my sister.</i>

350
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:12,474
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

351
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:15,434
Time to go to work.

352
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,074
<i>- Shit.
- Danny boy.</i>

353
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:40,515
Mike?

354
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:47,914
Oh, God!

355
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:58,634
Oh, Mother of God!

356
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:12,434
<i>Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan:</i>

357
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:15,954
<i>violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality,</i>

358
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:18,754
<i>a history of excessive physical force</i>

359
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:23,554
<i>throughout his 18 years
as a Los Angeles police officer.</i>

360
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:28,915
<i>Also responsible for the destruction of
11 patrol cars, a city bus...</i>

361
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,154
What about ten commendations for valour

362
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:35,634
and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

363
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:40,794
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have a job.

364
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:46,274
If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with
Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.

365
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:51,034
As it is, he left it in my hands.

366
00:35:52,154 --> 00:35:57,195
Now, this John Wayne attitude and flagrant
disregard for policy is gonna end now.

367
00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:01,514
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force

368
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,514
headed by Agent Keyes.

369
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:05,834
No one.

370
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:13,554
That's it.

371
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,554
Dismissed.

372
00:36:21,794 --> 00:36:25,474
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

373
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:28,595
It's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

374
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:30,874
We'll find Danny's killer.

375
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:33,675
Captain, Danny and I came up together.

376
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:35,834
15 years on the fucking street!

377
00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:39,554
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
I'm gonna finish it.

378
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,794
Hey, come on. What is this?

379
00:36:59,514 --> 00:37:01,515
Listen, shithead.

380
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,994
I don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

381
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:07,634
And he's a dead man.

382
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:10,794
What you're dealing with
is over your head. I'm warning you...

383
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:13,834
<i>You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.</i>

384
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:16,674
<i>And I'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!</i>

385
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,034
- I'll take care of him.
- No.

386
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:33,994
Let him go.

387
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:36,194
We're too close.

388
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:45,034
<i>...claiming as his, turf controlled
by the Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.</i>

389
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:47,594
<i>Watch as we continue our report.</i>

390
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,155
<i>Yes, the word is out: LA is up for grabs,</i>

391
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:54,154
<i>the spoils of our once fine city
going to the ruthless scum</i>

392
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:57,674
<i>who can spread the most
carnage and blood in our streets.</i>

393
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,754
<i>The latest update on the scoreboard:</i>

394
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:02,555
<i>five assorted trash and one good cop,</i>

395
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:04,354
<i>one of the best on our force.</i>

396
00:38:04,434 --> 00:38:07,394
<i>Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...</i>

397
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:09,395
Forget it. It's over.

398
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:14,154
Mike, goddamn it. This ain't your
personal little war, you know.

399
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:15,874
I loved Danny, too.

400
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:19,675
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

401
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:22,114
The door swings both ways. Remember?

402
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,914
All right. We'll do it together.

403
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,474
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

404
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:37,834
- We've been on him for the last three days.
- And they're not looking for drug dealers.

405
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:41,394
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

406
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,914
I used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

407
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:47,354
I had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

408
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:49,554
They had equipment I can't begin to touch.

409
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,714
And then this morning

410
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,834
<i>- I lost 'em.
- We lost them.</i>

411
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,914
- Where?
- Vernon and Industry.

412
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:59,834
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

413
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:03,154
Yeah, and in this heat...
I mean, BO and barbecue!

414
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:06,234
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

415
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,515
Leona, I want to meet with King Willie.

416
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:11,074
Willie and I seem to have the same problem.

417
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:14,874
- In the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

418
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,874
Just do it.

419
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:20,554
Fuck!

420
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:24,114
<i>Omega 1. This is Control.</i>

421
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:25,955
<i>This is Omega 1.</i>

422
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:29,434
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

423
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:33,114
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

424
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:34,914
Start your test now.

425
00:39:34,994 --> 00:39:37,554
Scan track three, two, one,

426
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:38,714
mark.

427
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,474
Number six, power up on the UV banks.

428
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:46,354
We're complete on the lower UV banks.
Ready for testing.

429
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:49,234
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

430
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:51,354
You got two minutes. Now get going.

431
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:57,834
<i>To all units. All units, you have
approximately 20 minutes to finish your task.</i>

432
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:00,034
<i>- Roger.
- Increase this UV.</i>

433
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:02,034
<i>Up 42 per cent.</i>

434
00:40:05,114 --> 00:40:08,794
Your friend died as the result of
an intrusion in the chest cavity

435
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:12,354
by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

436
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:14,434
Death was instantaneous.

437
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:18,594
He was boned like a fish.
I've never seen anything like this.

438
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:21,314
Please, do not touch anything.

439
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:27,914
Doctor, what about the other victims?

440
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:29,794
Anything there?

441
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,714
The federal team brought in
their own forensic examiners.

442
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:36,314
I am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city,

443
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,034
and they've cut me out.

444
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:41,354
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

445
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:45,354
- I mean, they must have run tests.
- It won't be easy.

446
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,434
Doctor,

447
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:51,034
I pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

448
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:54,674
- It has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

449
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:56,474
Let me see.

450
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:03,475
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

451
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:14,234
Astonishing. This material doesn't
correspond to anything on the periodic table.

452
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:18,514
- Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
- Don't know. It's not from a hardware store.

453
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,634
- Military?
- Good guess.

454
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:23,394
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

455
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:26,474
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

456
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:29,314
Hey, no!

457
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,435
Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

458
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:33,434
King Willie will see you now.

459
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:40,594
- It's OK.
- Don't you want me with you?

460
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:42,435
I'll call you later.

461
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:46,034
- You want me to follow you?
- I'll call you later!

462
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:51,314
You want some ganja, man?

463
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:54,474
License plate number.

464
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,994
1-8-8...

465
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:57,754
No, no. 1-8-8-3...

466
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,754
Oh, fuck!

467
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:10,994
<i>The door swings both ways, my ass.</i>

468
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:13,394
<i>This door swings both ways.</i>

469
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,634
Thanks for the ride.

470
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,914
You know,

471
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:36,554
you guys really ought to cut down.

472
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:21,754
They say you want to talk to me.

473
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:26,314
They say you offering me favours.

474
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,914
Tell me why, Babylon.

475
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:34,194
Mr Policeman.

476
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:38,634
- I want some information.
- Information.

477
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:44,474
About the one that's doing all the killing?

478
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:46,514
He killed your people.

479
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:48,514
Now mine.

480
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:51,274
I think you know who he is.

481
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:54,434
I want him.

482
00:43:55,354 --> 00:43:58,394
<i>I don't know who he is.</i>

483
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:02,514
<i>But I know where he is.</i>

484
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:06,954
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:08,674
The spirit world, man.

486
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:11,674
You see,

487
00:44:11,754 --> 00:44:13,674
it's always the same.

488
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:18,314
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

489
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:21,034
No killing what can't be killed.

490
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:23,154
Make sense, man.

491
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:26,954
This thing
that's killing your people and mine

492
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,034
is from the other side.

493
00:44:29,114 --> 00:44:31,914
I can feel him all around.

494
00:44:31,994 --> 00:44:35,314
You can't see the eyes of the demon

495
00:44:36,434 --> 00:44:39,154
until him come calling.

496
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,754
This is dread, man.

497
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:44,754
Truly dread.

498
00:44:51,794 --> 00:44:54,554
Nothing else for you here, policeman.

499
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:56,554
Time to go.

500
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,114
Prepare yourself.

501
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:17,874
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain. "

502
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,514
"Selah. "

503
00:47:08,474 --> 00:47:10,834
<i>This is Tony Pope live from LA,</i>

504
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,155
<i>the city of fear.</i>

505
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:15,074
<i>The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.</i>

506
00:47:15,954 --> 00:47:17,554
<i>Bodies strung out,</i>

507
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,394
<i>bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.</i>

508
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:24,154
<i>And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord,</i>

509
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:27,514
<i>the vicious drug lord found in
an alley just around the corner</i>

510
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:31,434
<i>with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.</i>

511
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:34,194
<i>A fitting demise
to the Prince of Powder.</i>

512
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,274
<i>First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!</i>

513
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:44,594
<i>He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.</i>

514
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:47,314
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes?

515
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:51,554
<i>- Anything there?
- Definitely something slippery about Keyes.</i>

516
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:53,994
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.

517
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,634
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

518
00:47:57,114 --> 00:48:00,834
<i>Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense Institute.</i>

519
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:04,874
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force Intelligence.

520
00:48:04,954 --> 00:48:07,554
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

521
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:12,154
Look, I don't care who's involved. This
guy killed Danny and he's going to fall!

522
00:48:13,354 --> 00:48:16,394
<i>- What about the good doctor?
- I'm here, Lieutenant.</i>

523
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:20,834
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

524
00:48:20,914 --> 00:48:25,394
part of a chemical test
on a fragment of wood from the penthouse.

525
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:27,194
And it contained traces

526
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:31,234
<i>of cattle blood and
heavy traces of steroids.</i>

527
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:36,914
I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

528
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:39,434
<i>That's where I lost Keyes the first time!</i>

529
00:48:39,514 --> 00:48:41,394
That's where we'll find him.

530
00:48:41,474 --> 00:48:44,834
Take the metro. I'll pick you up
at Vernon station in an hour.

531
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:48,474
<i>Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.</i>

532
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:11,034
I just want you to stay in the car. OK?

533
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:14,994
Your mom and I won't be very long. You
sit still. We'll be back in a few minutes.

534
00:49:15,074 --> 00:49:16,994
All right?

535
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,674
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

536
00:49:19,754 --> 00:49:21,674
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

537
00:49:27,114 --> 00:49:29,154
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

538
00:49:52,074 --> 00:49:53,994
Want some candy?

539
00:49:56,114 --> 00:49:58,275
Brian?

540
00:49:58,354 --> 00:50:01,034
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, I saw a ghost.

541
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:04,034
<i>Want some candy?</i>

542
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:23,954
Rest.

543
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:30,674
<i>Want some candy?</i>

544
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:29,594
Danny's necklace.

545
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:34,194
I hate the subway at rush hour.

546
00:51:34,794 --> 00:51:39,674
It's hard enough to find a seat, and if you do,
someone's pissed in it or thrown up over it.

547
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:42,274
This damn heat is killing me, man.

548
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,194
Hey, it's me!

549
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:46,674
- I look great!
- Oh, shut up.

550
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:48,194
No autographs, Pop.

551
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:51,155
- Look. There's two seats right there.
- Don't touch me!

552
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:53,554
Hey! Get off!

553
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:57,234
This shit never ends.

554
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:01,954
- After you.
- Asshole!

555
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:04,914
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

556
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:09,354
<i>Hey, baby. Bésame mucho. Come on!</i>

557
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,314
You look like a sympathetic dude.

558
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,514
My... partner here needs an operation.

559
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:20,874
But we're a little short of cash,
if you know what I mean?

560
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:23,154
No need for that.

561
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:25,514
Money!

562
00:52:25,593 --> 00:52:28,274
Get the hell away from me!
I know how to use this!

563
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,234
- Don't make me use this thing!
- Bet mine's bigger than yours!

564
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:33,714
I'll take that.

565
00:52:35,954 --> 00:52:38,514
- Hold it. Police!
- We're in trouble now.

566
00:52:38,594 --> 00:52:40,954
<i>- Nobody move!
- !Alto, policia, no se muevan!</i>

567
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:44,114
Everybody take a deep breath,
loosen your sphincters.

568
00:52:44,474 --> 00:52:46,834
We don't need any rush-hour Rambos there.

569
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,674
<i>Tú también, motherfucking baby!</i>

570
00:52:48,755 --> 00:52:50,874
<i>Drop it and sit down!Siéntate!</i>

571
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:55,034
What the hell is that?

572
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:02,195
Leona, you OK?

573
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:06,514
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

574
00:53:08,994 --> 00:53:10,914
Jerry!

575
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,314
What's happening?

576
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:35,434
Get down!

577
00:53:36,074 --> 00:53:37,754
Get out of the way!

578
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,714
Jerry!

579
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:41,594
Leona!

580
00:53:41,674 --> 00:53:44,434
Leona, get 'em out! Go!

581
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:50,154
Now!

582
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,834
Jerry!

583
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:16,194
Leona, do it!

584
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:18,195
Now!

585
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:39,754
Hey! Over here!

586
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:43,155
Yeah, that's right. Come and get it.

587
00:54:48,194 --> 00:54:50,114
Come on! Move it!

588
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:51,794
<i>Let's go!Vamos!</i>

589
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:04,074
<i>Move it! Don't panic, just go! Go! Vamos!</i>

590
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:17,315
Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you?

591
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,554
Wait!

592
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:30,954
<i>!Vamos! Come on!</i>

593
00:55:37,195 --> 00:55:39,834
<i>Keep walking! Come on, you too!Vámonos!</i>

594
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:42,354
Come on, motherfucker!

595
00:55:42,434 --> 00:55:44,394
<i>Want some candy?</i>

596
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,354
Let's dance!

597
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,034
Come on, get out of the way!

598
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,915
Come on, out!

599
00:56:15,754 --> 00:56:17,915
Come on, move it!

600
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:21,754
That way! Towards the light!

601
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:23,754
Come on! Get out!

602
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:24,794
Oh, God.

603
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:34,914
Jerry.

604
00:58:03,074 --> 00:58:04,994
God, not again.

605
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:07,994
Move your ass! Move out the way!

606
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:13,314
- Watch out! What's happening?
- It's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.

607
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:18,834
Hey, Jerry!

608
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,274
Leona!

609
00:58:21,354 --> 00:58:23,995
Oh, please. Leona...

610
00:58:24,955 --> 00:58:28,154
- How's she doing?
- Deep shock, but she's alive.

611
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:32,674
I hear foetal heart sounds. She's pregnant.

612
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:34,754
Let's move. LA County. Stat!

613
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:39,355
Stand back.

614
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:41,874
On three. One, two, three. Load up.

615
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:45,874
Out of my way! Move out the way! Move it!

616
00:58:56,394 --> 00:58:58,314
Man!

617
00:59:02,554 --> 00:59:05,434
Wait a minute. Let me see.

618
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:12,914
- Where's Jerry?
- I don't know.

619
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:15,474
We found his badge.

620
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:19,395
Who got hit this time?

621
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:21,274
Five gang members,

622
00:59:21,354 --> 00:59:23,194
bunch of commuters.

623
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:25,194
Doesn't make sense.

624
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:27,674
They were all armed.

625
00:59:28,514 --> 00:59:30,754
- What do you mean?
- It's the chief.

626
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:32,874
Wait here.

627
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:37,194
<i>- What the hell's going on down there?
- It's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.</i>

628
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,435
<i>- All killed?
- Yeah. Just like the others.</i>

629
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:40,914
<i>Damn!</i>

630
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,594
Jerry!

631
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:51,794
Holy shit! What the hell is going on here?

632
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:56,594
Hey, guys, get the camera on!
Get the camera on this right now!

633
01:00:56,674 --> 01:00:58,834
Get that goddamn thing on film!

634
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:01,474
What's going on?

635
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:09,275
Hey, Harrigan!

636
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:11,434
More victims! More mutilations!

637
01:01:12,234 --> 01:01:14,634
<i>- Fuck you!
- Pope!</i>

638
01:01:15,074 --> 01:01:17,875
<i>Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?</i>

639
01:03:11,994 --> 01:03:13,794
Sir, the cop is back.

640
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,794
Goddamn.

641
01:03:18,954 --> 01:03:22,714
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

642
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:27,554
Come here, Lieutenant.
I got something you might find interesting.

643
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,874
What is this?

644
01:03:29,954 --> 01:03:33,834
How many times do I have to tell you?
You don't know what you're dealing with.

645
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:38,994
There's your killer. Wonderful, isn't it?

646
01:03:39,074 --> 01:03:42,354
Pheromone signature left by his body.
Scent molecules.

647
01:03:42,434 --> 01:03:44,514
Punch up three.

648
01:03:44,594 --> 01:03:49,594
Ten years ago one of his kind eliminated an
elite Special Forces crew in Central America.

649
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:51,434
There were two survivors.

650
01:03:51,675 --> 01:03:56,274
They indicated that, when trapped, the
creature activated a self-destruct device

651
01:03:56,354 --> 01:04:00,114
that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

652
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,474
Remarkable weaponry.

653
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:06,314
That's right, Lieutenant.
Other-world life forms.

654
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,915
A fucking alien!

655
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:15,594
Iwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

656
01:04:15,675 --> 01:04:20,394
He's on safari. Lions.
The tigers. The bears.

657
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:21,874
Oh, my!

658
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:25,074
Trophies. That's the game, isn't it, Keyes?

659
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:27,073
You're the lion.

660
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,395
This is his jungle.

661
01:04:29,474 --> 01:04:33,235
- So why can't we see him?
- Defensive adaptations are astounding.

662
01:04:33,314 --> 01:04:36,314
It's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

663
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,314
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does.

664
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:41,114
For what he is.

665
01:04:41,194 --> 01:04:42,874
For what he can give us.

666
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:45,554
A new era of scientific technology.

667
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:49,634
I've waited a lifetime for this,
and I'm not going to miss the chance.

668
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,874
We have something
on the pheromone scanners.

669
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:05,154
- Target one is on the roof.
- It's taken us two weeks to learn his patterns.

670
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,274
He comes here every two days to feed.

671
01:05:07,354 --> 01:05:11,354
- Seems he has a taste for beef.
- I didn't think he was vegetarian.

672
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:14,034
Well, we've prepared a
trap for this predator.

673
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:17,874
We are certain that this being
can see in only one spectrum of light -

674
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:20,514
<i>- ... infrared.
- Infrared?</i>

675
01:05:20,594 --> 01:05:24,434
- He hunts by seeing our heat.
- Block the heat and he's blind.

676
01:05:24,514 --> 01:05:27,594
These suits insulate body heat,
making the team invisible.

677
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:30,074
We've flooded the place
with radioactive dust

678
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:33,754
and installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

679
01:05:33,834 --> 01:05:37,594
<i>The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.</i>

680
01:05:37,675 --> 01:05:41,634
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill him.
You're gonna freeze him.

681
01:05:41,714 --> 01:05:44,754
- We have to capture him.
- He's moving.

682
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:46,594
Finally.

683
01:05:47,274 --> 01:05:49,434
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.

684
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:51,434
This is history.

685
01:06:04,914 --> 01:06:07,354
Capture and isolation is our objective.

686
01:06:07,435 --> 01:06:09,834
Defensive action only on my orders.

687
01:06:11,274 --> 01:06:13,474
Power up. Lights on. Let's get him!

688
01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:28,874
We're in.

689
01:06:28,954 --> 01:06:30,915
Switch to ultraviolet.

690
01:06:30,994 --> 01:06:35,114
<i>- Radio silence. Out.
- Engage ultraviolet units A through J.</i>

691
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:02,634
- What's all this interference?
- Correcting the problem, sir.

692
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,314
They're moving to the second level.

693
01:08:15,394 --> 01:08:19,314
Target's still moving,
heading towards the number two stairwell.

694
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,354
Playing right into it.

695
01:08:36,674 --> 01:08:38,154
Wait a minute.

696
01:08:38,354 --> 01:08:40,114
It's stopped.

697
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:08,274
It's moving back against the wall.

698
01:10:08,354 --> 01:10:10,794
It's backing up. It's moving away from them.

699
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,714
Your boys have been made.

700
01:10:12,794 --> 01:10:17,634
- Sir, it's circling around behind them.
- Get 'em out! They're walking into a trap!

701
01:10:19,034 --> 01:10:22,315
Keyes, he's behind you.
Third floor structure. Right there!

702
01:10:22,395 --> 01:10:24,674
<i>Who is this? Clear the line.</i>

703
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:28,554
He sees the damn lights. Turn 'em off! Shit!

704
01:10:29,114 --> 01:10:30,554
Stop him!

705
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:39,274
- Door. Open it.
- Go fuck yourself.

706
01:10:40,274 --> 01:10:41,354
OK. OK.

707
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,155
The door.

708
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:45,674
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing.

709
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,435
- It's open.
- You'll ruin everything!

710
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:51,274
Fuck yourself!

711
01:10:52,154 --> 01:10:55,554
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

712
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:57,394
Everyone else, rock'n'roll.

713
01:10:57,474 --> 01:10:59,394
<i>This is it.</i>

714
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:11,514
He's moving down from the right.

715
01:11:12,154 --> 01:11:14,954
Garber, where is he? I can't see him.

716
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:17,514
He's right there!

717
01:11:17,834 --> 01:11:21,114
Goddamn it! Where is he?
Well, give me a coordinate! Where is he?

718
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:26,194
<i>- Watch out!
- My God.</i>

719
01:11:26,274 --> 01:11:29,115
Watch your crossfire!

720
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,474
I'm losing my pressure.

721
01:12:04,434 --> 01:12:06,354
Keyes, you all right?

722
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:08,475
<i>Keyes, it's over here!</i>

723
01:12:22,394 --> 01:12:24,394
Come on! Switch over!

724
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:26,395
Shit! I can't see!

725
01:12:30,674 --> 01:12:32,994
They're gone.

726
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:35,274
They're all dead.

727
01:13:24,474 --> 01:13:26,834
<i>You want me? Here I am!</i>

728
01:17:13,314 --> 01:17:15,234
You are one

729
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:17,233
ugly mother...

730
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:21,274
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

731
01:17:58,434 --> 01:18:00,234
Guess who's back.

732
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:04,434
Too late to go home now.

733
01:18:18,554 --> 01:18:21,555
Get out of here, Harrigan.
I'm gonna save your ass.

734
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:24,274
This is between me and him!

735
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:13,234
God...

736
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:08,994
Birds.

737
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,794
Damn birds.

738
01:21:17,475 --> 01:21:19,396
OK, pussyface.

739
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:22,036
It's your move.

740
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:24,876
<i>Shit happens.</i>

741
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:01,995
Oh, God.

742
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,835
That's all I need is birds.

743
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,436
You can do it.

744
01:23:11,836 --> 01:23:14,395
I can do it.

745
01:23:15,676 --> 01:23:17,596
It's like falling off a log.

746
01:23:30,036 --> 01:23:32,436
Like a 30-storey log. Damn!

747
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:52,275
Maybe I'll get lucky and fall.

748
01:24:31,956 --> 01:24:33,876
Damn it.

749
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:52,396
<i>The final Jeopardy answer is this:</i>

750
01:24:52,476 --> 01:24:57,196
<i>Berengaria, who never set foot in England,
was its queen for eight years</i>

751
01:24:57,275 --> 01:25:00,556
<i>after marrying this king on Cyprus.</i>

752
01:25:00,636 --> 01:25:02,516
<i>Good luck.</i>

753
01:25:02,956 --> 01:25:04,676
Herb?

754
01:25:04,755 --> 01:25:07,956
Herb, wake up!
There's somebody in the bathroom.

755
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:34,275
- It's all right. I'm a cop.
- I don't think he gives a shit.

756
01:26:36,795 --> 01:26:38,475
Shit!

757
01:26:38,556 --> 01:26:40,476
Get back inside!

758
01:26:47,795 --> 01:26:50,356
Holy Moses. Not again. Shit!

759
01:26:51,515 --> 01:26:53,436
Son of a bitch.

760
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,195
Oh, God.

761
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:03,516
Why can't this guy stay on the ground?

762
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:08,156
Come on, come on.

763
01:27:08,235 --> 01:27:10,236
Come to Papa.

764
01:27:16,155 --> 01:27:18,955
Stop! Stop the elevator!

765
01:27:19,516 --> 01:27:21,235
Stop it!

766
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:51,555
Now where the hell am I?

767
01:28:08,276 --> 01:28:10,196
Where are you?

768
01:29:02,276 --> 01:29:04,476
Jesus Christ.

769
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:14,595
That's right, asshole!

770
01:31:15,515 --> 01:31:17,315
Shit happens!

771
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:58,195
OK. Who's next?

772
01:33:43,275 --> 01:33:45,195
<i>Take it.</i>

773
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:51,276
"1715."

774
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:40,195
Harrigan!
What the fuck happened in there?

775
01:36:47,796 --> 01:36:49,956
Goddamn it. We came so close!

776
01:36:59,115 --> 01:37:03,436
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
