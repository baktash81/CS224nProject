I'm so sorry.

174
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,736
Uh, Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.

175
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:01,239
And I've been a bit
off stride. Forgive me.

176
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,674
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?

177
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:06,144
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding

178
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,547
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.

179
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,717
The entire loan?

180
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:14,185
Yes. It's all in the contract.

181
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,787
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.

182
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,255
Oh, dear.

183
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,224
You have five days.

184
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,192
If you are unable
to pay in full

185
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:22,928
by Friday at midnight...

186
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,030
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...

187
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,999
and you will have to vacate
the premises.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,036
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.

189
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,771
Not as an accountant,
I presume.

190
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,506
No, as a teller.

191
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:35,707
I took a part-time position
there this past year.

192
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,707
You see,
I'm really an artist.

193
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,209
Yes, be that as it may.

194
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,545
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.

195
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:42,914
Father left us shares
in the bank.

196
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,581
You could use those
to pay off the loan.

197
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,850
I was saving those
for the children.

198
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,119
Shares? In the bank?

199
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,922
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?

200
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,958
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

201
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,859
Ready and charged, sir.

202
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,594
Do you have
the share certificate?

203
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,263
- I'm sorry, the what?
- FRYE: The document...

204
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,266
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.

205
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,168
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.

206
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,303
Yes, I suppose it must.

he's been running

these last few years.

We'll see ourselves out.
Come along, Mr. Frye.

224
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,807
I do hope you find that share
certificate. I really do.

you'd taken out a loan?

to worry you.

I would catch up.

Well, then, we're not
going to let that happen.

But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

237
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,275
so we just have to find
that share certificate.

Father might have kept it?

(STAMMERS) I was just saying
you won't have to worry,

250
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,665
because your father
owns shares in the bank.

Well, I can make more money.

of imagination.

458
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,914
you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young.

- Yes, about your employment...

462
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,621
the truth is,
I simply can't afford...

463
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,023
We can settle on terms later,

464
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,491
although I will want
my old room back.

465
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,392
That's if it's not
a complete disaster...

466
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,393
and I will insist on having
every second Tuesday off.

467
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,730
- No, I'm afraid, I...
- Of course, Mary Poppins.

468
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,031
Good, good.
That's all settled.

469
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,834
Then I'll stay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

themselves into dustbins.

is to see them properly
bathed and dressed.

473
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,043
Jane, have you gone
completely mad?

474
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,779
I can't afford to take
on anyone else.

475
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,913
Mary Poppins
isn't just anyone.

just as much as she does!

483
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:45,460
Very well. She can stay
for the time being, I suppose.

484
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,031
After all, she did fly
all this way on a kite.

nonsense, of course.

They always do.

quite enough of that.

Well, like Topsy said...

1550
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,803

looking at things differently.

at the bank.

Oh, no, please don't worry.
I'm perfectly fine. Really.

Oh, nonsense. The bank's
just around the corner...

1876
01:32:05,992 --> 01:32:08,727
I've heard quite enough.
Come in at once!

1877
01:32:08,728 --> 01:32:09,995
Best to take my leave.
Good night, Mary Poppins.

1878
01:32:09,996 --> 01:32:11,062
Good night, Jack.

1879
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,064
Into the parlor, go on.

1880
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:14,834
Go on.

1881
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:21,405
Don't be too hard
on 'em, sir.

1882
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:23,074
They're only children,
after all.

1883
01:32:23,075 --> 01:32:24,910
I know they're children,
my children,

1884
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:26,644
and I will deal with them
as I see fit.

1885
01:32:26,645 --> 01:32:28,847
- Now leave us to it.
- Yes, sir.

1886
01:32:28,848 --> 01:32:30,315
Not you, Mary Poppins.
In here.

1887
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,417
Very well, sir.

1888
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:43,629
You could have
lost me my job.

1889
01:32:44,797 --> 01:32:46,932
Do you understand that?

1890
01:32:46,933 --> 01:32:49,801
Have you any idea
how difficult it is to find

1891
01:32:49,802 --> 01:32:52,103
a good position like mine
these days?

1892
01:32:52,104 --> 01:32:54,840
But there you all were,
tearing about like a...

1893
01:32:54,841 --> 01:32:56,508
And you, Mary Poppins,

1894
01:32:56,509 --> 01:32:58,810
I thought you were here
to look after these children.

1895
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,780
It wasn't her doing,
it was me.

1896
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:04,016
No, it was us.

1897
01:33:04,017 --> 01:33:06,585
We thought maybe
if we talked to Mr. Frye...

1898
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:08,519
he could give you more time
to save the house.

1899
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,855
We were only
trying to help.

1900
01:33:09,856 --> 01:33:11,057
Well, you didn't help!

1901
01:33:12,124 --> 01:33:13,825
Now...

1902
01:33:13,826 --> 01:33:16,761
I know it's been a hard year
for our family...

1903
01:33:16,762 --> 01:33:18,797
and I've done all I can...

1904
01:33:18,798 --> 01:33:21,132
to keep you all from worrying,
but I can't do this on my own.

1905
01:33:21,133 --> 01:33:23,935
It's too hard. I just...

1906
01:33:23,936 --> 01:33:25,837
I'm barely holding it
together as it is.

1907
01:33:25,838 --> 01:33:27,839
I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...

1908
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,074
and there's no more time,

1909
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:30,675
we're about to lose
our home...

1910
01:33:30,676 --> 01:33:32,511
and I can't lose this house.
I just can't.

1911
01:33:34,147 --> 01:33:35,881
I don't know what to do.

1912

(VOICE BREAKS) I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.

Haven't we lost
enough already?

1915

We haven't lost Mother.

I hope I'm as clever as you

01:35:51,284 --> 01:35:53,119
I never said a word.

It was
all the children's idea.

I've been looking after them,

1942

they've been looking after me.

What was I thinking?

01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:11,604
Some people think
a great deal too much.
