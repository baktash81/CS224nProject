Stuck.in.Love.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY

2
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:42,485
<i>I remember that it hurt.</i>

3
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:47,485
<i>Looking at her hurt.</i>

4
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,256
Your... your... your nose.

5
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:11,256
Oh, oh, it does that sometimes.

6
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:29,941
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,076
I never enjoy anything.

8
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:39,954
I'm always waiting
for whatever's next.

9
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:41,455
I think everyone's like that...

10
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:42,998
living life in fast forward,

11
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,666
never stopping to
enjoy the moment,

12
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,085
too busy trying to rush
through everything,

13
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:50,588
so we can get on with what we're really
supposed to be doing with our lives.

14
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:53,799
I get these flashes of
clarity, brilliant clarity,

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,968
where, for a second,
I stop and I think,

16
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,137
"Wait, this is it.

17
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:00,848
"This is my life. I'd better
slow down and enjoy it,

18
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,809
"because one day, we're all
going to end up in the ground,

19
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,645
"and that will be it.
We'll be gone.

20
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:10,648
So I think we should fuck.

21
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,900
Um... what?

22
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,570
Let's just fast forward through all
the drunken seduction bullshit...

23
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:17,487
we have to look forward to.

24
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,032
You don't look like you'd
be very good at it anyway,

25
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,743
and I don't want to sit here and listen
to you bumblefuck your way through it.

26
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,953
We both want the same thing,

27
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:27,705
to go back to your room, have sex,
and never see each other again.

28
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:28,956
Are you with me?

29
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,416
Is this a trick?

30
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,917
The offer is about to expire.

31
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,377
No, no, I'm in.

32
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:38,378
I'm definitely in.

33
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:41,926
Do you like that book?

34
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,636
No, God, no.

35
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,806
No, it's my idiot brother's
favorite book.

36
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,683
Is it yours?
No, no.

37
00:02:48,684 --> 00:02:51,852
It's my roommate's.

38
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,687
I'm not really much of a reader.

39
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:58,688
Good.

40
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:03,942
Now come here.
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,294
<i>As I stood there staring
through the window</i>

42
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,255
into my ex- wife's new life,

43
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,133
I was overcome by the
oddest sensation.

44
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:13,635
Watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom

45
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:17,889
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger.

46
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,017
The show was the same, but the
thespian who played William Borgens

47
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:24,103
for nearly twenty years was gone.

48
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:27,273
And in his place was a
younger, dumber model.

49
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,820
What was that, boy?

50
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:36,447
Oh, shit.

51
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:44,743
Down! Heel! Fucking dog!

52
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:23,403
Rusty...

53
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:37,374
Oh yeah.

54
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:42,588
There you go.

55
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:49,302
You got that bowl?

56
00:05:56,396 --> 00:06:01,396
<i>Hey!</i>

57
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,418
Just rock it on there.
Get him on there.

58
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,836
Gentle, gentle.
There you go.

59
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,672
Got it?
Don't push that hard.

60
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:25,839
All right.

61
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,839
There we go.
Yeah.

62
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,325
Dad, she's here.

63
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:02,415
Ready?

64
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:07,415
Hi, I'm back.

65
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:12,837
Dad...

66
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:19,926
Smells good.

67
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:24,268
Well, they said that you
have to go back there?

68
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:28,730
They just said that I think you
might have to end up paying for it.

69
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,524
No, but they're going to cancel
the whole thing? The appointment?

70
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:33,776
<i>Yeah, they're canceling it.
It's over, basically...</i>

71
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:38,776
My book is being published!

72
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:42,326
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

73
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,202
Thank you. Thanks, Dad.
Oh, my God.

74
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:46,038
We're so proud of you.

75
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,497
What house is it?
Scribner.

76
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,540
What?
That's King's publisher.

77
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,584
Yeah,no, they're great.
Great.

78
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:54,211
We got to have a toast. We have
to have a toast. Scribner?

79
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,631
Yeah, that's exactly what I was
thinking when I submitted the book.

80
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,925
This will really piss
Rusty off.

81
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:03,261
It's not because they publish books
by Hemingway or Kurt Vonnegut.

82
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,096
David McCullough, Frank McCourt.

83
00:08:05,097 --> 00:08:08,308
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Bob fucking Dylan.

84
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,060
I didn't know you had
dibs on Scribner.

85
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:11,686
I never said I had dibs, Samantha.

86
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,437
I just was...
You're just jealous.

87
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:14,855
Wow.
I'm not jealous.

88
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:16,899
What an accomplishment.

89
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,234
Your sister is having her first
book published, all right?

90
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,944
This is a cause for celebration.

91
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,654
This is what the holidays
are all about.

92
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,197
Okay, cool.

93
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,740
You might want to congratulate her.

94
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,867
Congratulations.
Thank you.

95
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,286
Geez, I didn't have my first
book published until...

96
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:34,082
I don't know.
I was 25 or 26.

97
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,707
I would have been happy
to call those guys.

98
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,167
I know them all over there.

99
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,835
I submitted it under a fake name

100
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:40,629
and didn't tell them whose
daughter I was

101
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,714
until after was accepted.
I wouldn't have minded.

102
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,591
I know. I just... Because you
wanted it to be about your book

103
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,301
and not about being my daughter.

104
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:51,301
Yeah. Okay, well, this
is a toast... psst.

105
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,307
To you and your first novel.

106
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,309
<i>Just Saying Hi.</i>

107
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,603
<i>Oh, it's not Just Saying Hi.</i>

108
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,480
Did they make you
change the title?

109
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,941
No, they're not publishing
Just Saying Hi.

110
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,777
It's a different book.

111
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,321
What?

112
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:10,489
I put that aside for now,

113
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,032
and I wrote a new one.

114
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,367
When?

115
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,993
Over the summer.

116
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,370
What happened
to Just Saying Hi?

117
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,330
You were excited about that.

118
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,290
I was excit... I put a lot of
work and effort into that.

119
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,833
<i>I proofed the manuscript
and I...</i>

120
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:23,584
I know.
I'm sorry. I...

121
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,878
I... I... I thought my opinion
meant something.

122
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,256
It does. Dad.
You know it does.

123
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:30,925
And yet you turn around and
write an entirely new book

124
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:34,803
and don't think
to share it with me?

125
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:39,391
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:44,391
Something's burning.

127
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,316
Congratulations.

128
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,278
Why would you let him set
that place at the table?

129
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,071
I set it.
He asked me to.

130
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:55,864
Yeah, well, she's not coming.

131
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,866
I'm about to head over there.
You should come.

132
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,159
Give Dad a chance to cool off.

133
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,577
I'm not going over there.

134
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:01,911
Fine.
Suit yourself.

135
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,329
I'll tell her you said hi.

136
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,831
You can tell Mom
to drop dead.

137
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:09,831
Whoa...

138
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,980
This food is so good.

139
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,067
<i>Glad you like it.</i>

140
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,195
<i>So how did everything
go over at your Dad's?</i>

141
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:42,072
It was good. Sam's getting
a book published.

142
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:44,158
What?

143
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,076
That was my reaction, too.

144
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,496
That's great.

145
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:51,540
I always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was...

146
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,501
a little strange, but...

147
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,294
sounds like it's paying off.

148
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:58,004
- I can't believe it.
- Why is it's strange?

149
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,339
Rusty, just let that go.

150
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,216
No, why is it strange?

151
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:03,259
I just want to know why you
think it's so strange.

152
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,677
Well, it just seems like
he was forcing you

153
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,346
to be writers...

154
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,389
instead of allowing
you to choose to be.

155
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,266
We don't have to keep the
journals if we don't want to.

156
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,185
You'd have to get
a job if you stopped.

157
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,312
He pays us to do it so we
can focus on our writing

158
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,522
instead of working some
bullshit job at McDonald's.

159
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,941
Rusty...

160
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:20,937
What?

161
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,011
What?

162
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:24,946
Are you stoned?

163
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,073
Are you kidding?
Are you being...

164
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:29,950
I'm not stoned. Rusty, I'd like
to talk to you in the kitchen.

165
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,701
I think you're stoned.

166
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:36,702
Great. Good.
I'm going.

167
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,459
What's gotten into you?

168
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,211
I'm not going to let
that Neanderthal...

169
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:44,338
talk about Dad like that.

170
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,131
He didn't say anything
about your father.

171
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:48,425
It's not what he says.

172
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:51,135
It's how he talks about him like he's
some sort of weirdo or something.

173
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,012
And watching football doesn't
make you a Neanderthal.

174
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,222
Owning his own gym does.

175
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:59,223
Okay,enough.
Enough.

176
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:03,146
Is Sam's book really getting published?

177
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,856
That's what she said.

178
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:09,857
Wow.

179
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,282
It's been over a year
since we spoke.

180
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:17,034
I know.

181
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,745
She said to say hi to you.

182
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:24,166
I don't believe that
for a second, but...

183
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:26,793
it's very sweet of you to say.

184
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,212
Aw, Mom.

185
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:32,299
Please don't ever hate
me the way she hates me.

186
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,050
I don't hate you at all, Mom.

187
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:39,050
Good, but you are stoned,
though, aren't you.

188
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,266
I thought it would make
it easier to eat again.

189
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,977
Pot and nothing else,
ever, you understand me?

190
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,395
You don't have to worry
about me, Mom.

191
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,937
Yeah, I do.

192
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:52,938
It's my job.

193
00:12:57,823 --> 00:13:01,742
I cleared the table
and started the dishes.

194
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,285
Sorry I reacted the way I did.

195
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,953
I was just surprised.

196
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:06,496
I thought you were
happy with the book.

197
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:08,248
I was.

198
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:11,667
It just didn't seem like
my book anymore.

199
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:15,046
It felt like,
someone else's...

200
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:20,047
My editorial hand a little
heavy for you? Yes, Dad.

201
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,846
I was scared of how you'd react,

202
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,850
and I felt guilty because of all the
work you put into Just Saying Hi.

203
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,850
I'm sorry...
Stop apologizing.

204
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,314
It's my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place.

205
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,864
I'm guessing you don't
want to read the new one?

206
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,075
Fuck no.

207
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,244
Never?
No, thank you.

208
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,746
I brought you a hard copy.

209
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,539
Really?
Yeah.

210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,250
I was going to sign it
for you if you wanted,

211
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:59,795
or not... but maybe?

212
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:04,796
Leave it on my desk.

213
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:10,467
Wait... can I ask you a question
without you getting defensive?

214
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:15,142
What?

215
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:20,142
Rusty told me Martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night.

216
00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,982
Dad, you've got to stop doing this
to yourself. It's been two years.

217
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,151
She's coming back. You're
completely delusional.

218
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,153
And what's with setting
a place for her at the table?

219
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,531
That's fucking nuts. You
know they're fighting again?

220
00:14:29,532 --> 00:14:30,740
And where did you see that?

221
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,741
Through their window?

222
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:35,077
Really? People get arrested
for doing things like that.

223
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:36,787
You're a well
respected novelist.

224
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,872
You've won the PEN
Faulkner Award twice.

225
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,416
You can't behave like that.

226
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,209
She's coming back.

227
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,879
Jesus, at least tell me
you've been writing.

228
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,092
Look at what you've let
her do to you, Dad.

229
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:56,092
Seriously.

230
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:11,861
Hey. What are you working on?

231
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:14,947
It's a poem for English class.

232
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,991
Sorry about earlier.
I was being a dick.

233
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,617
It's okay.

234
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,244
Yeah, you were right.
I was just jealous.

235
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:23,371
I really am happy for you.
It's awesome.

236
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,874
You're going to have a book
published one day, too, you know.

237
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,792
Sure, I know.

238
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:33,589
Jason hooked me up
with some weed.

239
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,759
Roof?

240
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,759
Got your eye on any girls this year?

241
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,767
Yeah, there's this girl...

242
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:48,603
Kate, in my English class.

243
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,022
Every time I see her,
I hear that song,

244
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:54,149
the Beatles' song, "I've Just Seen a
Face," playing in my head.

245
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,026
God, you are so pathetic.

246
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:57,778
At least I know I'm pathetic.

247
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,529
Let me give you some advice.

248
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,822
I can't wait to hear your advice.

249
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,282
It's so friggin' awesome.

250
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,868
There are two kinds
of people in this world.

251
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,039
Hopeless romantics and realists.
Right.

252
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,541
A realist just sees that face

253
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,794
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl they've ever seen before.

254
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,172
The hopeless romantic
becomes convinced

255
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:22,967
that God put them on Earth
to be with that one person.

256
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:25,428
But there is no God,

257
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,807
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is.

258
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,559
Guys who get laid
a lot are realists.

259
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,230
You should be listening.

260
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,856
Just avoid love at all costs.

261
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:40,196
That's my motto.

262
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:46,656
You never been in love?

263
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,908
If love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home,

264
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,911
I think I'll pass.

265
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,163
That's fucking depressing, Sam.

266
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:58,333
Making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class

267
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,543
is a sadistic exercise
in public humiliation.

268
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:02,503
You could have already been
done with it by now, Rusty.

269
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,171
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
Just' read it.</i>

270
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:10,803
Um, okay, this is a poem I
wrote over Thanksgiving break.

271
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:14,472
Uh... It's called School.

272
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:17,016
It was written under the
influence of cannabis.

273
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:23,355
Okay, um... In the sea
of... This is so awkward.

274
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,357
Uh...

275
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,193
"In the sea of desks, there's
talk of games and bags

276
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:33,073
"and long pipes that leak dreams
with the strike of a match.

277
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,283
"And there's a loudness
to the whispers I hear.

278
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:38,578
"Whispers shouldn't be
that loud, should they?

279
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,705
"There's a girl over there
who everyone knows

280
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,917
"and men without ears who will
stand by the door for a price.

281
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:48,295
"In long hallways, there are
angry mobs of dwarves and rats

282
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:53,296
"and one single angel. "

283
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:00,264
Hey, Rusty. Hi.

284
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:04,894
Hi. Hi, I, um...
I liked your poem.

285
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:08,564
Yeah?
Yeah, it was really good.

286
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:12,108
Thanks.
Sure.

287
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,527
How was your Thanksgiving?

288
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,238
Oh, it was good.
It was a little weird.

289
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:20,574
My parents are divorced,
sol have two Thanksgivings

290
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:22,284
in one Thanksgiving.

291
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,077
It's just, like, strange.

292
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:25,829
How about you?

293
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,040
It was just boring. Whatever.
That's cool.

294
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,208
Yeah.

295
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,252
Kate.

296
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,212
I have to go.

297
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:39,550
I just wanted to say I
liked your poem, so...

298
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:44,137
Bye.
All right.

299
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,555
Who the fuck is that?

300
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:49,643
Just a guy from class.

301
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:54,644
Fucking asshole.

302
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,115
Hi.

303
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:08,660
I literally have 20 minutes,
so it will have to be quick.

304
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,119
Come on.
Let's go.

305
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Did you stretch?

306
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,545
Come on.

307
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,922
Just a second.

308
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,757
Oh, yeah.

309
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:25,634
Oh, make it rain.

310
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:30,429
Yeah.

311
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,890
Yeah.
To the left.

312
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:37,891
To the...
yeah.

313
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:43,396
Yes!

314
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:52,158
All right, I got to run.

315
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:54,368
Thursday, be ready.

316
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,412
Yes, Sarah.

317
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,797
Hey!

318
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,716
Hey!
Goddamn it!

319
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,384
What are you doing?

320
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:12,719
You scared me.
I caught you.

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,470
You're reading my journal.

322
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,346
You promised you'd never
read our journals.

323
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,015
Sorry. I trusted you, Dad.

324
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,766
I'm sorry. That pisses
me off so much.

325
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,727
I'm sorry. It's an
invasion of privacy.

326
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:23,937
Rusty, I... I... I... Sit down for
a second. Let me explain.

327
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:25,647
No, I'm not going
to sit down.

328
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:27,648
Okay, okay. I wasn't
reading your journal.

329
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,608
I... I flipped it open to check
the dates like I always do

330
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:32,028
and something
jumped out at me

331
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,572
and-and-and grabbed me.
I'm sorry, okay?

332
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:36,449
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,034
What?

334
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:44,035
May I?

335
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:51,420
"I remember that it hurt.

336
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,088
"Looking at her hurt. "

337
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,175
That's it.

338
00:20:56,176 --> 00:21:00,012
If that was the opening line of a book,
you'd have your reader hooked.

339
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:02,555
They would have to keep reading.
I had to keep reading. Sorry.

340
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,599
Flattery is not going
to get you out of this.

341
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,601
No, no, that's coming
to an end right now.

342
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,936
You know Flannery O'Connor?
I know Flannery O'Connor.

343
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,564
She said nothing needed to happen in
a writer's life after they were 20.

344
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,815
By then, they had experienced
more than enough

345
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:16,443
to last their creative life. So?

346
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,652
So what's your point?

347
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,738
My point is...

348
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:24,738
Sit down for a second, please.

349
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,453
Rusty...

350
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,414
I don't think you're
experiencing enough.

351
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:34,585
I mean, the reason that you're comfortable
leaving your goddamn journal on my desk

352
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,629
is because there's nothing you're
trying to hide from me in your life.

353
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,882
And that really worries me, you know?

354
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,094
Sweet, sensitive guys like you, they
spend their entire high school years

355
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,179
frozen in place while...

356
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,055
everybody is running around
going to parties

357
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,058
and getting laid, doing whatever.

358
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,810
I don't want you to look back
years from now

359
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,021
and think about this girl.
Is it Kate? Yeah.

360
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,606
Tell this girl how you feel.

361
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,233
Put your heart on the line.

362
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,068
It's not that easy.

363
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:04,070
It is, too. It is, too.
Look at your sister.

364
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:05,738
You can...
Hey!

365
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:07,198
You can roll your eyes
all you want.

366
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:09,075
Your sister is a great writer.

367
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:11,076
And it's because she's
courageous in her life.

368
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:13,411
She's promiscuous, Dad.
It's not the same thing.

369
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:18,166
Rusty, a writer is the sum
of their experiences.

370
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,001
Go get some.

371
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,961
It will be fun.

372
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:23,879
Come on. This is crazy.
What are we doing here, man?

373
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,506
Everyone hates us.

374
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:30,507
Not tonight, they don't.
Not tonight.

375
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,138
What?

376
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,681
Uh, we're here for the party.

377
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:37,892
What party?

378
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,936
Dude, come on man. I'm, like,
in three classes with you.

379
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:42,897
Fuck off.

380
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:45,357
Okay, but...

381
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:49,069
what are going to do
with all this weed?

382
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,487
I was just playing, man.
Come on.

383
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:55,488
Really? Yeah. Come on in.

384
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:02,832
Hey! Hey, my boys...

385
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,083
Wait.
What's your name?

386
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,544
Rusty.
This is Jason.

387
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:09,838
Hey, my boys Rusty and Jason just
brought us a shitload of weed.

388
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,756
Your name is Rodney, right?

389
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,800
Hey, man, Rodney.
What's up?

390
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,052
You make sure with Jason that
everybody gets some, okay?

391
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,637
Where you going?

392
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,221
I'm going to go find
my friend, Kate.

393
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:23,434
Which chick?
Oh, they still upstairs!

394
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,562
Dude, who are you?

395
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:31,274
I'm a new and improved
Rusty Borgens.

396
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:21,278
This is Sam. Leave me a
message after the beep.

397
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,678
Come on, Glen.

398
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,429
Glen, open the door.

399
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,847
I've been waiting for ten minutes.
Come on.

400
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,808
Could I have a fucking
second please?

401
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,809
No, I can't give you a fucking second.
I'm in pain.

402
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:21,329
Shut the fucking door!

403
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,884
Let's go, Jason.
Let's get out of here.

404
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:33,720
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
Let's go.

405
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,763
I'm not going anywhere.
That plan was genius, dude.

406
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:37,472
It was a joke.
It wasn't a fucking joke.

407
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:40,892
It's not funny.
Get the fuck off me.

408
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,352
Hey, don't walk away from me.

409
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:43,729
Stop.
You're crazy.

410
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,647
Quit following me, Glen.

411
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,774
This is my house. I can go
wherever the fuck I want.

412
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,026
All right, big shot. Listen, I'm
leaving, all right, asshole?

413
00:25:50,027 --> 00:25:51,360
Get the fuck out of here.

414
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:53,029
Hey, asshole.

415
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,620
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

416
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:04,289
Okay, come on.

417
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,292
Let me grab that.

418
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:11,045
Run, run!

419
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:13,797
I'm going to fucking kill you.

420
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,798
Dude, dude, fuck yeah, man!

421
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:22,222
All right.
Later, man.

422
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:26,893
See you, buddy.
Later.

423
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:31,894
Hey, asshole!
Boom!

424
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,695
I can't go home like this.

425
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:43,696
I'm a wreck. My knees are
all banged up and I'm high.

426
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:47,244
Yeah, we should probably
get some ice on those.

427
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:51,540
Can I stay at your house tonight?

428
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:55,669
Okay.

429
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,053
Hello?

430
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,514
Hi. Hi, it's me.

431
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:11,266
Hey, you okay?

432
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:16,063
Um, where are you?

433
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,399
I'm here.
I'm at home.

434
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,817
Oh, I've been ringing the bell.

435
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:25,818
I fell asleep.
Are you here?

436
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,701
All right, we need to put
our heads together.

437
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,371
Okay.
Bill, I can't sleep.

438
00:27:34,372 --> 00:27:37,624
Okay, I'm driving around in my
pajamas in the middle of the night.

439
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:40,585
I'm like a crazy person.
I can't live like this anymore.

440
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,462
I can't either.

441
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:44,713
I've given her space.

442
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:47,383
I accept her hatred towards me as
some phase she's going through,

443
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:49,301
but this isn't a phase.

444
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,512
She has this amazing thing
going on with her life now

445
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:53,764
with this book being published,
and I can't share that with her.

446
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:55,181
She won't return my calls.

447
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:56,724
She won't return my emails.

448
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,476
She's-she's having
a book published.

449
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:00,395
She's busy.
Bullshit.

450
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:02,188
I can't get her to return my calls.
Bullshit.

451
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:04,691
She's petty and she's cruel.

452
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,191
Everyone's parents are divorced.

453
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:07,609
Big fucking deal.
You get over it.

454
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,735
She fights with me, too.

455
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,571
We're not fighting.

456
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,656
That's the thing. I wish
I could fight with her.

457
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,616
Then I'd be an active
participant in her life.

458
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:16,785
She just abandoned me.

459
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,120
No, I don't think... She's abandoned you?
That seems horrible.

460
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:22,123
You are in a constant state
of denial about everything.

461
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:24,584
Bill, she acts like I don't exist.

462
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,627
I haven't spoken to her
in over a year

463
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:28,588
and you're not helping things.

464
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:30,464
Me? I haven't said one thing.
I... I... What did I...

465
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:33,467
You set a place for me
at Thanksgiving. Yeah.

466
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,177
So everytime she comes
home from school,

467
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:37,262
she sees you miserable
and moping

468
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:39,264
and she blames me.
I know she blames me.

469
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,431
I know she does.
I don't mope.

470
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,141
Oh, you mope.

471
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:43,559
You mope.

472
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,311
Say horrible things about me,

473
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:47,271
but don't try to win
her sympathy this way.

474
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,857
Hey, I made a promise to you
and I intend to keep it.

475
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:53,359
Oh, Jesus.
Bill...

476
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,405
That was a lifetime ago.

477
00:28:57,406 --> 00:28:59,949
I release you from your promise.

478
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,869
Please... go on with your life.

479
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,329
Go get laid.
I get laid.

480
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,081
Great! You get laid? Mm-hmm.

481
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:10,292
Well, then, be happy.

482
00:29:10,293 --> 00:29:11,502
I just want you to be happy.

483
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:13,003
I was happy with you.

484
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,712
You were the one
who wasn't happy.

485
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,882
Well, I'm happy now.

486
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,176
You don't look happy to me.

487
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:25,177
When? When you're sneaking
around our house at night?

488
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,310
I see you and Martin fighting.

489
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:35,311
Shut up, Bill.

490
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,199
Oh, hey.
Wait a minute.

491
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,534
Excuse me.

492
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,827
You know I...

493
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,412
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

494
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:54,457
but I wouldn't do that if I were you.

495
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,793
I mean, he sleeps
with a lot of girls.

496
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,379
You're practically guaranteed
to wake up with a rash.

497
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,004
Thanks for the tip.

498
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:02,673
I see you you getting
snared in his web.

499
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,716
You look like a nice girl and all, so.

500
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:06,385
I'm not a nice girl.

501
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,512
Well, in that case, I'm Louis.

502
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:11,306
Everyone calls me Lou.
Nice to meet you.

503
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,015
No? Okay.

504
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:15,101
Look, I don't want
to hurt your feelings,

505
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:16,602
but you're wasting your time.

506
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,437
What, talking is a waste of time?

507
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:20,147
We're not talking.

508
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:21,774
You're flirting with me.

509
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:23,984
And you're also cockblocking
your friend.

510
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,278
Huh?
Bon Jovi over there?

511
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,196
He's not my friend.
He's a dick, actually.

512
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,448
I'm just filling in on bass
for them tonight.

513
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:32,659
You're cute, Lou.

514
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,369
But you reek of romance
and good intentions.

515
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,996
I'm not looking for a nice guy.

516
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,706
I don't do boyfriends,
and I don't date.

517
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:41,625
All I heard was don't,
don't, don't, don't.

518
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:43,711
Well, don't keep people safe.

519
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,212
I'm going to go.

520
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,964
Okay, well, I'll see you in class.

521
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,674
Do we have a class together?

522
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:52,135
Advanced Fiction Writing.

523
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:54,721
I don't remember you.
Well, I remember you.

524
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:58,223
You have a book that's getting published.
Your dad must be thrilled.

525
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,142
You know an awful lot
about me, Lou.

526
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:03,061
We writers are an envious bunch, so...

527
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:06,648
What's his name?

528
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,400
His name is Pete.

529
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,863
Have fun.
I will.

530
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:18,864
Cool. You're awesome.

531
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,873
I didn't know you lived at the beach.
Shh-shh.

532
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:26,458
Keep your voice down.

533
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,335
I just don't want
to wake my dad up.

534
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:33,335
I'm going to go get
some ice for that.

535
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:41,388
There you go.
Thank you.

536
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:43,474
Sure.

537
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:44,974
Rusty?

538
00:31:44,975 --> 00:31:47,644
Hey, Dad, what are you doing up?

539
00:31:47,645 --> 00:31:49,437
Who's this?

540
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:53,107
Uh, Dad, this is Kate.
Kate, this is Dad.

541
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,656
Hi.

542
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:56,955
Hi.

543
00:31:57,695 --> 00:31:59,237
What happened to your knees?

544
00:31:59,238 --> 00:32:01,865
She fell. This asshole pushed me.

545
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,284
Really?
Somebody pushed you?

546
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:07,828
Yeah, but it's okay,
because Rusty punched him.

547
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,998
<i>Oh, good. Nobody should ever push
a girl and gel' away with it.</i>

548
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,458
That's a good start, that ice.

549
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:15,211
We have some peroxide in here.

550
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,171
So, you are Kate.

551
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:18,880
Rusty's fold me a lot about you.

552
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:22,050
He has? Um...

553
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:23,927
We hardly know each other.

554
00:32:23,928 --> 00:32:25,679
I just know he thinks
very highly of you.

555
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,890
Dad?
Sorry, sorry.

556
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:30,349
Are you staying the night?

557
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,727
Uh, yeah, if that's okay.

558
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,730
Okay. Your parents don't mind?

559
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:38,774
No.

560
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:42,735
All right. You take the bed
and she takes the couch...

561
00:32:42,736 --> 00:32:46,364
Or the other way. You take the
couch and she takes the bed.

562
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,700
Whichever one.

563
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:49,992
Nice meeting you, Kate.

564
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:54,621
You, too.
Goodnight.

565
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:58,041
Sorry.

566
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,376
Your dad's nice.

567
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,171
Yeah, he's a good guy.

568
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,422
What does he do?

569
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:07,717
Uh... he's a writer.

570
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,510
Like a real one?

571
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:11,595
Yeah, he wrote a book
called Suit Monkeys.

572
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:14,557
Won some awards, had a bunch
of books published. Thanks.

573
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,726
Whoa, uh...

574
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:20,311
I didn't know you were going
to... I'll turn around.

575
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:23,148
Well, that's cool.

576
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,191
Is that what you want to do?

577
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:27,484
Uh, yeah.
I'm a writer, too.

578
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,361
So is my sister.

579
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:32,322
We write books
and stories and stuff.

580
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:34,533
Poetry?

581
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,410
Yeah.

582
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,911
Where's your sister?

583
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:42,911
She's, you know,
away at college.

584
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,751
Yeah, so I...

585
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:49,213
Wait, can you stay
with me a second?

586
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:50,756
Please?

587
00:33:50,757 --> 00:33:55,757
Yeah, sure.

588
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:06,016
You can come closer.
I don't bite.

589
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:14,194
I have a question.

590
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:19,195
Yeah.

591
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:24,329
Was I the angel in the
poem you wrote?

592
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,329
Yeah.

593
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,849
I think you're going
to be very good for me.

594
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:57,188
Goodnight.

595
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:47,529
I love Christmas.

596
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,531
You strike me as one
of those people.

597
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:53,201
I am. I'm definitely
one of those people.

598
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,370
I love everything about it.

599
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:58,664
I love the lights,
the decorations,

600
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:03,665
how TBS plays A Christmas
Story 24 hours straight.

601
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:07,047
Presents under the tree

602
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,883
and the looks on my kids
faces when they open them.

603
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:14,012
Sitting by the fire with my
husband when they go to bed.

604
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:17,390
I get all depressed
during the holidays.

605
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:22,390
Yeah, well, you're divorced, Bill.
It's depressing.

606
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:26,231
Hey, can I give you
a little bit of advice?

607
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:30,360
Just from one fuck buddy
to another.

608
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,069
Mm-hmm.

609
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,071
You need to remarry.

610
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,573
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

611
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:38,075
You're not getting any younger.

612
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:42,329
And if I were you, I'd be
on every dating website

613
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,041
signing up and just combing the
newspapers for personal ads.

614
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,918
I haven't been on a
date in 25 years.

615
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,628
Yeah, but what is that?

616
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:51,630
Listen, you're handsome,
you're successful.

617
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,506
You have a mild amount of celebrity,

618
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:56,425
which is really all a
writer can ask for.

619
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,469
That's enough to land
one of those

620
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,096
20-something trophy wives.

621
00:37:01,097 --> 00:37:03,599
You've really thought
about this, huh?

622
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,060
Well, I care about you, Bill.

623
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,437
I know you love Erica,

624
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,272
but she married someone else,

625
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:13,524
and you have to start
thinking about your future

626
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:17,361
and whether or not you want
that to be a happy one.

627
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,738
Because I don't want
to jog by in five years

628
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,282
and find you waiting on
that lawn chair for me.

629
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,409
It's a very comfortable lawn chair.

630
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,702
Is it?

631
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:30,702
Just think about it.

632
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,467
Procreation. You give to the
next one down the line.

633
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,052
That's really all we've got.

634
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,429
Society, government,
money, religion,

635
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,015
careers, nuclear families,
monogamy.

636
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,351
These are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions

637
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:56,855
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives.

638
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:58,857
It gives us the illusion of choice.

639
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,569
It makes us feel a little
less like animals.

640
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,029
Animals. What do you mean?
Like evolution?

641
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,031
Yeah, evolution, exactly.

642
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:08,866
I do not believe
in evolution.

643
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:11,703
There's 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way alone,

644
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,705
making the amount of stars
in the entire universe

645
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:16,123
completely mind-boggling.

646
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,000
We are nothing.

647
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,127
If an asteroid hadn't hit Earth
65 million years ago

648
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:21,503
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,

649
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:23,505
we wouldn't be here.

650
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:26,173
Yeah.
I'm going to go.

651
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:31,174
Good. All you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid.

652
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,433
Really.
Ooh, that was awkward.

653
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:37,600
You've really got
to stop stalking me.

654
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:40,562
I can't even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me.

655
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:43,148
Were you hitting on that guy?
It's none of your business.

656
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,691
I think he's a Mormon.

657
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,359
Well, what the hell
is he doing here?

658
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,445
Trying to find other Mormon girls.

659
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:52,239
I'm sure you corrupted him,
ruined his relationship with God.

660
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,741
You want to get out of here?

661
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,993
Do you have brain damage?

662
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:58,037
No. I think I made it pretty clear

663
00:38:58,038 --> 00:39:00,204
that I have absolutely no
interest in going out with you.

664
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,457
No, no, no. You and I
are going to be friends.

665
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,292
But I don't want to be
friends with you.

666
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:06,794
Oh, you don't want to be.

667
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,921
Well, I'm going
to take your jacket

668
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:11,132
and you can follow me. We can
get some coffee if you'd like.

669
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:14,384
I need that...

670
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,927
jacket.

671
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:19,890
What are some of your
favorite books?

672
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,476
Is that really the angle
you're going to play?

673
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:26,228
Really? I thought you'd be
more creative than this.

674
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,024
Well, come on, we're writers, right?
Yeah.

675
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:32,818
Books matter to us. I mean,
come on here, please.

676
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:36,321
Fine, what are some
of your favorite books?

677
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:38,281
No, you can't do that.
I asked you.

678
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:40,366
Because you want to know
something personal about me.

679
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,660
If I tell you what
my favorite books are,

680
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:44,954
you'll say titles that will convince
me that we're soulmates,

681
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,955
or you'll latch onto one
of my favorites

682
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,874
and try to convince me it's
one of your favorites, too.

683
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,334
God, you're so tough.

684
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:51,710
It's why you're obsessed with me.

685
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:53,045
I'm not obsessed with you.

686
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:54,671
I'm like a unicorn to you.

687
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,507
You'll do or say anything
to possess me.

688
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,800
I'm not like that and
you're not like a unicorn.

689
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:00,760
Okay, well, then books.

690
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,970
<i>But please, at least
attempt to be interesting.</i>

691
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,473
<i>No Catcher in the Rye or
Portnoy's Complaint, okay?</i>

692
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:09,810
Well, I write mysteries, so...

693
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:12,813
I love Elmore Leonard,
James Lee Burke,

694
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:14,481
Ed Brubaker.

695
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:16,942
Who's Ed Brubaker.

696
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:20,820
He writes an incredible, hard-boiled
crime comic called Criminal.

697
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:23,114
Telling me that you
read comic books

698
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,783
isn't exactly sweeping
me off my feet.

699
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:27,827
What's your favorite book?

700
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,913
Just say the first thing
that pops into your head.

701
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:34,666
Dear Mr. Henshaw by Beverly Cleary.

702
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,918
Been my favorite
since I was a kid.

703
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:38,753
Read it, like, 100 times.

704
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:42,966
It's actually what made me
want to be a writer.

705
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:43,966
Hey, is something wrong?

706
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,968
I have to go.

707
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:47,803
Well, what... what do you mean?
Did I do something?

708
00:40:47,804 --> 00:40:49,304
I have to go.

709
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:52,766
Samantha.

710
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:55,017
Samantha, wait. Come on. What?

711
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,727
What do you want from me?

712
00:40:56,728 --> 00:40:58,271
What do you mean what
do I want from you?

713
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,856
I like you.

714
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,607
I want to get to know you better.
No.

715
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:03,526
Why do you keep running away?
Because this...

716
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,570
whatever this is between us,
it can't go any further.

717
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,363
I won't let it. We're not
even in the same species.

718
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:11,158
Is Dear Mr. Henshaw
your favorite book, too?

719
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,826
I don't do this, Lou.

720
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,327
No.
No, of course not.

721
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,163
You just give yourself away

722
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:21,163
to assholes with infinitely
lower IQs than yours.

723
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:26,005
Fuck.

724
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,094
Hi.
Hi.

725
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:35,054
Is your dad here?

726
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,556
Uh, no...

727
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:39,184
Well, when is he
going to be back?

728
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:42,728
I don't know. Maybe
a couple of hours.

729
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,396
Why?

730
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:49,397
I want to give you
your Christmas present.

731
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:56,612
Um, okay.

732
00:42:04,123 --> 00:42:05,248
Merry Christmas.

733
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,709
Oh... awesome.

734
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,961
Come with me.

735
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,379
Where are we going?

736
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,048
To the closet.

737
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,633
Wait, why the closet?
Why not on the bed?

738
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,927
Can we open it?

739
00:42:17,928 --> 00:42:22,928
Because you've
never had sex,

740
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:28,102
and I've never had sex
in a closet.

741
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:32,649
You'll remember me and
you'll remember this moment

742
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,650
and that makes me
very, very happy.

743
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:28,946
Oh, fuck.

744
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:36,623
Hi.

745
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:38,208
How's she feeling?

746
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:43,209
She's okay.
You should go see her.

747
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:03,273
How you feeling?

748
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,066
Not too bad.

749
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:06,651
Don't bullshit me.

750
00:44:06,652 --> 00:44:08,737
I'm like a no bullshit detector here.

751
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:11,613
I'm fine.

752
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:16,614
Shut up and read to me.
Okay.

753
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:29,422
"Dalie Hallie couldn't tell
if she felt huge or small.

754
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:31,924
<i>"She wondered whether
her head</i>

755
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:35,469
"were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe...

756
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,138
"or if the universe were so
little that it would fit

757
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:40,766
"within the compass
of her human head. "

758
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:43,477
Lou?

759
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:46,187
Do you see that angel by the door

760
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:51,188
or am I the only one seeing her?

761
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:59,570
Oh, that... that's definitely
not an angel, Mom.

762
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:07,332
Hi.
Hi.

763
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,792
Hi. What are you doing here?

764
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,503
Oh, same thing
you're doing, I hope.

765
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:14,088
Don't be suspicious.

766
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,924
I'm getting a laptop for Samantha.

767
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,884
In fact, I got to pick out a color.
Why don't you come?

768
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,719
I don't know.
Excuse me.

769
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,138
Huh?
What don't you know?

770
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,183
I don't know if it's
a good idea, Bill.

771
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:30,061
It will take ten minutes.

772
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,395
I'd love to.
Yeah.

773
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,814
Yeah?
Yeah, I love to.

774
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,441
I'm glad I bumped into you.

775
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,944
I'm sure that's
what all stalkers say.

776
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:42,405
No, really.

777
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,740
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

778
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,826
Really?
Mm-hmm.

779
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,120
Somebody else said
the same thing recently.

780
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:53,873
Someone else asked you to stop
hanging around their house at night?

781
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:57,877
About moving on with my life.

782
00:45:57,878 --> 00:45:59,879
Who was that?

783
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,673
Tricia Wolcott.

784
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:03,508
Lives about a mile and
a half down the beach.

785
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:05,384
Yeah, I remember her.
Yeah.

786
00:46:05,385 --> 00:46:08,429
Yeah.
Yeah.

787
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,348
I always suspected
you had a crush on her.

788
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,225
Yeah, she's very pretty.

789
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:18,187
She's very married, as I recall.

790
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:19,981
You're seeing her?

791
00:46:19,982 --> 00:46:21,816
I think I'm a good way
for her to kill an hour

792
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:25,027
after she drops her
kids off at school.

793
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:26,237
An hour?

794
00:46:26,238 --> 00:46:28,238
An hour.

795
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,451
So she thinks you need to
stop moping around, too, huh?

796
00:46:32,452 --> 00:46:35,078
Something like that.

797
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,498
Here's a confession.

798
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:42,084
I'm not a great writer.

799
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:44,670
I'm a great re-writer.

800
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,798
I think about us.

801
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:49,508
Our story and...

802
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,676
and all the things that
went wrong with us

803
00:46:51,677 --> 00:46:56,677
and I... I could do it so
much better this time.

804
00:46:58,893 --> 00:47:01,186
I haven't written anything
since you left.

805
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:03,187
Bill...

806
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,272
you've had two books published.

807
00:47:05,273 --> 00:47:08,275
Well, they were books that I
started when we were married.

808
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:10,235
I finished them, but I haven't
written anything new.

809
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:12,488
You are a great writer.

810
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:17,488
Don't waste all your
imagination on me.

811
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:22,997
Which way are you...

812
00:47:22,998 --> 00:47:24,999
I'm over here.

813
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,083
I'm the other way.

814
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:29,920
It was great running into you.

815
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:32,589
You, too.

816
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,589
Bill...

817
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:43,011
I have... I have days when I'm not
sure if I made the right decision.

818
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:48,474
I have bad days, too.

819
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:51,439
I don't know why I'm saying this.

820
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,526
I guess I just don't want you to
think that I don't think about us,

821
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:57,195
you know, and...

822
00:47:57,196 --> 00:47:58,655
all those years
we spent together,

823
00:47:58,656 --> 00:47:59,738
because I do...

824
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:02,115
think about...

825
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:06,787
everything that I gave up.

826
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:10,666
I wonder if it was worth it.

827
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:15,666
Was it?

828
00:48:18,423 --> 00:48:20,800
I got to go.

829
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,360
Merry Christmas.

830
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:26,734
Merry Christmas.

831
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,143
It was so nice to meet you.

832
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:34,562
Oh, you, too, Samantha.

833
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:37,064
I hope you come back
and see me again soon.

834
00:48:37,065 --> 00:48:38,732
I will.
Okay, you two.

835
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,150
I'm going to walk
Sam to her car.

836
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,236
I'll be right back, Mom.

837
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:44,405
Not so fast.
I made hot chocolate.

838
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:47,282
It's in the kitchen.

839
00:48:47,283 --> 00:48:52,203
What's wrong with your mom?

840
00:48:52,204 --> 00:48:56,291
She, um...
She has a brain tumor.

841
00:48:56,292 --> 00:49:01,291
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

842
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:05,507
I can't believe how much of
a bitch I've been to you.

843
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:07,509
Yeah, I know, right?

844
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,219
Okay, yeah.

845
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:15,141
I don't... I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

846
00:49:15,142 --> 00:49:18,644
Really, I...

847
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:21,938
I've enjoyed all of our back
and forth, you know, sparring.

848
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,858
It's really... it's helped me
take my mind off of all this.

849
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:29,859
Well, I'm glad I could help out.

850
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:32,072
You going home for Christmas?

851
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:36,619
Yeah, I'm headed
back there tomorrow.

852
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Well, I'm willing to forget about
this whole stalking incident,

853
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,626
if you will allow me to take you out

854
00:49:44,627 --> 00:49:46,586
on a proper date when you get back.

855
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:49,547
Okay.

856
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:50,965
Really?
That easy? Yeah?

857
00:49:50,966 --> 00:49:53,343
I'm not going to say it again.

858
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:55,010
Okay.

859
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:58,096
Oh, I actually...

860
00:49:58,097 --> 00:50:03,097
brought you an ARC
of my new book.

861
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:06,854
Oh,wow. Stalking and a present.

862
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:11,855
Under the Pink by Samantha Borgens.
Look at that.

863
00:50:12,194 --> 00:50:17,194
Well, I will... I will
read this over break.

864
00:50:18,908 --> 00:50:20,950
Probably aloud.

865
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,578
My mom and I have been tearing
through some books lately.

866
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,789
No, you can't read it to her.

867
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,208
It's filled with sex
and profanity.

868
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:32,961
Oh, no, she loves sex.

869
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,172
You added too much water.

870
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,800
<i>It's not like you're
Martha Stewart in here.</i>

871
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:42,261
Says the guy who puts
sprinkles on burn.

872
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:44,055
Hey, guys.
Hey.

873
00:50:44,056 --> 00:50:45,390
Look at you!

874
00:50:45,391 --> 00:50:46,808
Why are you all dressed up?

875
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:48,393
I'm going over to Kate's.

876
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:50,061
Why does it smell
so horrible in here?

877
00:50:50,062 --> 00:50:52,104
No, no, no. These are our cookies.
Smell.

878
00:50:52,105 --> 00:50:53,980
Yeah, we burned the first batch.

879
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,857
Actually, this is the second.

880
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:58,026
No, no, no, no, no!

881
00:50:58,027 --> 00:51:01,029
Sorry!

882
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:03,073
Oh, my God, Dad!
What?

883
00:51:03,074 --> 00:51:04,615
This is ridiculous!

884
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:06,242
We burned them again!

885
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,493
Oh, God. Okay...

886
00:51:07,494 --> 00:51:09,787
Yeah, no laughing, Rusty.

887
00:51:09,788 --> 00:51:11,914
When am I going
to meet this girl?

888
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:13,874
I don't know. Try not
to burn the house down.

889
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:14,916
Yeah, drive careful.

890
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,961
I will.

891
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:20,046
How serious is this thing?

892
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:22,215
Uh, they're having sex.

893
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:25,427
What?
How do you know?

894
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:28,971
Yeah.
Wow, go Rusty!

895
00:51:28,972 --> 00:51:30,681
She has more experience than him.

896
00:51:30,682 --> 00:51:32,683
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

897
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:36,395
He seems really happy.

898
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,146
At least someone
in this house is.

899
00:51:38,147 --> 00:51:41,023
Do you see a frown on my face?

900
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:44,068
You do seem unusually
chipper today.

901
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:45,903
Have you discovered
anti-depressants?

902
00:51:45,904 --> 00:51:50,198
Actually, no. I'm just
moving on with my life.

903
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:51,908
I'm done with the whole thing
with your mom,

904
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,869
and I'm moving forward.

905
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,580
Seriously?

906
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:58,498
New Year's resolution.

907
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:00,417
How about that?
Moving on.

908
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,084
Dad?
Yeah.

909
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,419
That's huge!

910
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,588
That's so...
Oh, flour hug.

911
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,883
No, no, no!

912
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:10,217
Not on my white shirt.

913
00:52:10,218 --> 00:52:12,093
Ta-da!

914
00:52:12,094 --> 00:52:14,095
I thought you already gave
me my Christmas present.

915
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,264
Shut up and open it.
Come on.

916
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:20,602
All right, here we go.

917
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:22,103
This isn't just a CD.

918
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:23,604
It isn't?
No.

919
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:28,150
It's a roadmap to my soul.

920
00:52:28,151 --> 00:52:29,902
It's like if you gave
me a favorite book.

921
00:52:29,903 --> 00:52:32,863
Yeah, speaking of that.

922
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:34,198
Boom.

923
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:39,198
Oh, my gosh.

924
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:43,372
Wow, this is the biggest
book I've ever seen.

925
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:44,916
I know it looks formidable,

926
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,000
but honestly,
it's going to be, like,

927
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,586
one of the most satisfying reading
experiences of your life.

928
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:51,338
Is it scary?

929
00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:53,298
Yeah, sure, but it's
not just a scary book.

930
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:55,050
It's like Moby Dick.
It's about everything.

931
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:57,052
You're going to be
so wrapped up in it,

932
00:52:57,053 --> 00:52:59,303
you're going to be crying at
the end of it. You cried.

933
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:00,888
Oh, you'll cry, too, okay?

934
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:05,059
I might have cried.

935
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:10,059
You're really cute when you
get worked up about books.

936
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,277
Do I have you
worked up about me?

937
00:53:16,278 --> 00:53:18,613
Yeah.
Good.

938
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:21,824
Because I've got to
have you right now.

939
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,700
What about your parents?
Won't they come in?

940
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,203
They don't come in here.

941
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:31,204
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Come here.

942
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,335
How was your Christmas?

943
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,003
It was good.

944
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:41,004
Filled with family. You know, loud.
Yeah.

945
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,719
So you haven't
mentioned my book.

946
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,806
Mm. Yeah, um...

947
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,057
So you didn't like it?

948
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,559
No, no, that's not it.

949
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,893
I liked it a lot.

950
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,271
It's incredibly well written.

951
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:58,190
The characters are vibrant and alive.

952
00:53:58,191 --> 00:53:59,692
But?

953
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:01,735
I mean, I knew you were cynical,

954
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:06,736
but is that really how you
feel about love and marriage?

955
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:10,451
I don't know.
Sometimes.

956
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:15,452
Oh, thank you.

957
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:18,625
How much of that
really happened?

958
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:21,503
I made most of it up.

959
00:54:21,504 --> 00:54:23,547
I didn't draw that much
from my parents' divorce,

960
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:25,424
other than the little
girl seeing her mother

961
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:27,718
having sex with the
man on the beach.

962
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,053
Holy shit, that really happened?
Yeah.

963
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:34,515
I mean, I wasn't a little girl.
I was in high school.

964
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:38,227
My parents were having a party,
and I was up on the roof.

965
00:54:38,228 --> 00:54:40,271
It was late, and my mom

966
00:54:40,272 --> 00:54:43,523
came staggering out of the
back of the house with Martin.

967
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:46,276
And she was all over him.

968
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:47,819
And I remember Martin saying,

969
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,572
"What about Bill?
What if Bill sees?"

970
00:54:50,573 --> 00:54:53,240
And my mom replying,

971
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:54,762
"I don't care. "

972
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:58,152
"I don't care. "

973
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:07,791
Hey,Lou?
Mm-hmm.

974
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:12,634
You make me feel less cynical.

975
00:55:12,635 --> 00:55:15,094
My turn?
My turn. Uh...

976
00:55:15,095 --> 00:55:17,679
Favorite TV show.

977
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,681
The Wonder Years. Oh, all right.
that's nice.

978
00:55:19,682 --> 00:55:23,602
I'm still in love
with Winnie Cooper.

979
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:26,521
Okay, favorite song.

980
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:29,106
Beatles.
"Polythene Pam. "

981
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:32,526
Great choice.
Thank you. Yours?

982
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:37,527
"Between the Bars"
by Elliot Smith.

983
00:55:37,574 --> 00:55:39,866
Play it for me.

984
00:55:39,867 --> 00:55:43,203
I actually do have it here.

985
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:44,955
You're in luck.

986
00:55:44,956 --> 00:55:48,625
Although this is...
This is really no way to...

987
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:52,461
to hear a song.
Just play it.

988
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:54,338
<i>Will you at least
close your eyes,</i>

989
00:55:54,339 --> 00:55:56,173
because you got to block
out all this other stuff.

990
00:55:56,174 --> 00:56:01,174
It's really distracting.
Okay. You're funny.

991
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:08,142
# Drink up baby,
stay up all night

992
00:56:08,143 --> 00:56:13,142
# With the things you could do
you won't but you might

993
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:18,523
# The potential you'll be
That you'll never see

994
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:23,448
# The promises
you'll only make

995
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:26,200
# Drink up with me now

996
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:31,201
# And forget all about
the pressure of days

997
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:36,998
# Do what I say
and I'll make you okay

998
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,879
# And drive them away

999
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,715
I'm so scared right now.

1000
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:44,300
# The images stuck
in your head

1001
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,511
I know. I know.

1002
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:50,180
# The people
you've been before

1003
00:56:50,181 --> 00:56:55,102
# That you don't want
around anymore

1004
00:56:55,103 --> 00:56:57,980
I don't want to get hurt.

1005
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:02,817
I'm not going to hurt you.

1006
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:07,113
# I'll keep them still

1007
00:57:07,114 --> 00:57:11,450
# Drink up baby,
look at the stars

1008
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:16,451
# I'll kiss you again
between the bars

1009
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:21,664
# Where I'm seeing you there
with your hands in the air

1010
00:57:22,836 --> 00:57:27,836
# Waiting to finally be caught

1011
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:32,720
# The people you've been before

1012
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:37,720
- # That you don't want
around anymore # - Come on!

1013
00:57:38,392 --> 00:57:43,392
# That push and shove
and won't bend to your will

1014
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:49,359
# I'll keep them still #

1015
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,362
And that's the picture that
you want to have up there?

1016
00:57:52,363 --> 00:57:54,406
I'm going to trump that
though, real quick,

1017
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:58,284
because you look
like a serial killer.

1018
00:57:58,285 --> 00:57:59,994
Let's take another one.

1019
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:01,913
Let me show you
a test picture.

1020
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,539
Let me show you
how it's done, okay?

1021
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,333
If I were on this website, I'd say,

1022
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:10,333
"Oh, I'd love to go on
a date with you. Yeah?"

1023
00:58:10,546 --> 00:58:13,548
Did you actually pay for that?

1024
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:18,220
No?
No.

1025
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,929
Can I ask you
a serious question?

1026
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,930
Are you color blind?

1027
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,646
Fuck, no.

1028
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:31,064
Professional.
You do not... no.

1029
00:58:31,065 --> 00:58:32,732
You know what?

1030
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:34,317
You do not look ready to party.
I think...

1031
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,194
Let me just take a look.

1032
00:58:36,195 --> 00:58:39,364
Are you being serious with this?

1033
00:58:39,365 --> 00:58:40,865
<i>We're not in Cancun.</i>

1034
00:58:40,866 --> 00:58:44,952
Eh, no.

1035
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:46,495
That's my favorite shirt.

1036
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:49,248
Don't ever do it.

1037
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:53,710
Okay, good.
Right? Ok.

1038
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,837
Come get in this right now.

1039
00:58:55,838 --> 00:59:00,838
Let's do it.
Oh...

1040
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:04,470
Hubba, hubba.

1041
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,596
Have you had this the whole time?
Yeah.

1042
00:59:06,597 --> 00:59:09,891
Why on Earth... you are
endlessly frustrating.

1043
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:13,228
Oh, I would definitely
fuck you in this outfit.

1044
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:15,605
How do you feel?
Good.

1045
00:59:15,606 --> 00:59:19,066
Oh, right?

1046
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:24,067
Okay, come on.

1047
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:22,191
Hey, Mom!
Hey!

1048
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:24,319
You made it. Hi.
Hi.

1049
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,737
I'm Kate.
I'm Erica.

1050
01:02:25,738 --> 01:02:30,738
Nice to meet you.

1051
01:03:15,116 --> 01:03:17,867
Hey, can I help you
find something?

1052
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:21,621
I was looking for some aspirin.
I have a headache.

1053
01:03:21,622 --> 01:03:26,622
Oh, should be in there.

1054
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:32,001
I got it.
Thank you.

1055
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,729
William.
Hey.

1056
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,314
It's so good to see you again.
How are you?

1057
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:52,273
Great to see
you, too, Leslie.

1058
01:03:52,274 --> 01:03:54,317
This is my son, Rusty...
Hi.

1059
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:55,652
And his girlfriend, Kate.
Hello.

1060
01:03:55,653 --> 01:03:57,737
Nice to meet you.

1061
01:03:57,738 --> 01:03:59,697
This was so nice of you to do
this for Samantha, really.

1062
01:03:59,698 --> 01:04:01,366
This is great.

1063
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,660
I'd have done the
same thing for you

1064
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:06,161
if you'd published Suit Monkeys
under my watch. Yeah, well...

1065
01:04:06,162 --> 01:04:09,415
I would like you to meet your
daughter, Samantha Borgens.

1066
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:11,917
You might think you've
met Samantha before,

1067
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:15,795
but this Samantha just received a
starred review from Publisher's Weekly.

1068
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:18,297
And life will never
be the same again.

1069
01:04:18,298 --> 01:04:21,342
Hi, Dad.
Congratulations.

1070
01:04:21,343 --> 01:04:23,594
Thank you so much.

1071
01:04:23,595 --> 01:04:25,930
And this is my boyfriend, Lou.
Hi.

1072
01:04:25,931 --> 01:04:27,931
Nice to meet you. Very nice
to finally meet you, yeah.

1073
01:04:27,932 --> 01:04:29,808
Mr. Murphy is a talented
writer as well.

1074
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,726
He's my Patricia Highsmith.
I don't know.

1075
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:34,020
Samantha, can I steal
your father for a little bit?

1076
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:36,106
There's so many young
writers around here

1077
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,941
who are just dying to meet him.

1078
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:39,275
He's all yours.

1079
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,277
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1080
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:45,281
Hey, Sis. Congratulations.
Thank you so much for coming.

1081
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,741
It's so nice to finally meet you.

1082
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:49,659
Sam tells me you're a
huge Stephen King fan.

1083
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:52,370
I'm like the biggest Stephen
King fan in the world.

1084
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:54,164
I love The Sand.
It's my favorite one.

1085
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:55,874
What?
Since when?

1086
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,500
What do you mean?

1087
01:04:57,501 --> 01:04:58,918
Who doesn't like Stephen King?

1088
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:00,378
She doesn't like Stephen King.

1089
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,087
I don't not...
let's leave them.

1090
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:03,755
Let's get... She calls
herself a novelist.

1091
01:05:03,756 --> 01:05:07,426
You guys continue this.
We're going to go.

1092
01:05:07,427 --> 01:05:09,428
Girls.
Yeah.

1093
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:12,139
Two champagnes, please.

1094
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,806
How old is she?

1095
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:15,641
21.

1096
01:05:15,642 --> 01:05:17,602
I wouldn't believe you
if you told me she was 18

1097
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:19,061
much less 21.

1098
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:20,146
How old are you?

1099
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,273
This is my party.

1100
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:24,524
Stop acting like a pussy.
Nobody's going to tell on you.

1101
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:27,319
And I haven't even told you about
the big tip I'm going to leave you.

1102
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,238
As far as I know, you ordered
these drinks for yourself.

1103
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,574
I didn't even see her here.

1104
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:36,160
And here's the drinks
you ordered, Miss. Enjoy.

1105
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:41,161
I will...

1106
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,795
Thank you.

1107
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:49,047
Samantha!

1108
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:50,965
Oh, sorry...

1109
01:05:50,966 --> 01:05:55,966
Don't worry about it. It's your night.
Go have fun.

1110
01:05:56,055 --> 01:05:59,264
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have your kind attention, please.

1111
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:01,850
You may come forward if you wish.

1112
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:06,396
<i>I have been trying to get William Borgens
up here to speak to my class for years.</i>

1113
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:10,066
He's never said no, but he's
never said yes, either.

1114
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:14,111
Tonight, I have him at a
certain disadvantage.

1115
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:16,656
My entire class is here, Bill.

1116
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:19,200
<i>And I insist you come up
here and say a few words.</i>

1117
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:24,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Borgens.

1118
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:32,462
Your professor, while a very nice
man, is a sneaky son of a bitch.

1119
01:06:35,048 --> 01:06:38,842
The reason Leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing

1120
01:06:38,843 --> 01:06:42,930
is I'm not sure I have much to say
about it that could benefit you.

1121
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:46,266
I still find it all very mysterious,

1122
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:48,560
years after I wrote my first book.

1123
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:51,229
And I'm not sure what it
is that compels a person

1124
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,732
to continue to play make believe

1125
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:58,193
even after they're an adult.

1126
01:06:58,194 --> 01:07:02,239
My favorite book is a collection
of short stories by Raymond Carver

1127
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,576
called What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love.

1128
01:07:05,577 --> 01:07:10,576
And in the closing lines of the
title story, Carver says...

1129
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:14,625
"I could hear
my heart beating.

1130
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:18,337
"I could hear everyone's heart.

1131
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:23,337
"I could hear the human
noise we sat there making.

1132
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:27,178
"Not one of us moved.

1133
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:30,347
"Not even when
the room went dark. "

1134
01:07:30,348 --> 01:07:33,267
And I think that
that's what writing is.

1135
01:07:33,268 --> 01:07:35,978
It's listening for that beating heart,

1136
01:07:35,979 --> 01:07:38,731
and when we hear it,

1137
01:07:38,732 --> 01:07:43,731
it's our job to decipher it
to the best of our abilities.

1138
01:07:51,035 --> 01:07:54,911
I'm here because my daughter
Samantha's book is being published

1139
01:07:54,912 --> 01:07:56,955
in case you haven't heard.

1140
01:07:56,956 --> 01:07:59,875
This is her success.

1141
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:01,835
I love you, Dad.

1142
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:06,835
I love you, too.

1143
01:08:10,135 --> 01:08:15,135
This seat taken?

1144
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,350
Louis invited me.

1145
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:21,519
Well, that was a calculated risk.

1146
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,313
How long you been here?

1147
01:08:23,314 --> 01:08:27,525
Mm, I was waiting in my
car for about an hour

1148
01:08:27,526 --> 01:08:32,154
trying to build up
the courage to come in.

1149
01:08:32,155 --> 01:08:34,198
So that's what 19 looks like.

1150
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:38,911
She's all grown up now.
No.

1151
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:41,120
She's still just a baby.

1152
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,497
You going to talk to her?

1153
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:44,207
I don't know.

1154
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,376
I'm scared.

1155
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:50,712
Yeah, she's scary.

1156
01:08:50,713 --> 01:08:52,297
She's all I've done with my life,

1157
01:08:52,298 --> 01:08:57,298
and she doesn't want me.

1158
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:04,266
Hey...

1159
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:07,937
you want some courage?

1160
01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:11,232
Free of charge.

1161
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:14,526
Yes, please.

1162
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:16,569
Your favorite book...

1163
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,281
John Cheever's
The World of Apples.

1164
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:25,281
I got you that signed first edition.
Yeah.

1165
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:34,420
That's your favorite book, right?

1166
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:38,548
Um, well, I really liked it.
Oh, Jesus.

1167
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,467
I even told you what to read.

1168
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:46,468
Sometimes.

1169
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:51,472
I'm sorry.

1170
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:58,108
Anyway, she swiped it
from my library.

1171
01:09:58,109 --> 01:09:59,567
She did?

1172
01:09:59,568 --> 01:10:01,736
Yeah.

1173
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:05,364
It could only have been her.

1174
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:07,158
She thought that it
was your favorite book.

1175
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:10,494
That's what I had told her, and...

1176
01:10:10,495 --> 01:10:15,494
I think she was hoping to
find some piece of you in it.

1177
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:25,462
Go talk to your daughter.

1178
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:49,817
Yeah.

1179
01:10:50,406 --> 01:10:55,406
Hi.

1180
01:10:56,496 --> 01:11:00,498
Would you sign this for me?

1181
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:02,416
Uh, what's your name?

1182
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:05,085
Sam, I don't want to cause a scene.
Really? I...

1183
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:07,004
I'm Louis, by the way.

1184
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:09,047
I believe we met over the phone.

1185
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:10,548
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1186
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:11,633
Nice to meet you, too.

1187
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:15,178
Yeah.
Name?

1188
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:18,973
Come on, Sam, don't do this.
It's okay, Louis.

1189
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,641
No name, no problem.

1190
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:22,142
Guess we'll go with a signature

1191
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:24,895
and no personalized note. Sam.

1192
01:11:24,896 --> 01:11:28,148
I just wanted to tell you that...

1193
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,858
I love you.

1194
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:32,485
I love you so much.

1195
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:34,862
I'm so proud of you.

1196
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:37,156
Thank you.

1197
01:11:37,157 --> 01:11:42,157
Hope you enjoy it.

1198
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:50,001
Kate? Kate?

1199
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:53,171
No, it's just me.

1200
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:56,632
Mom, I didn't know
you were coming.

1201
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:59,260
You Okay?

1202
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,137
You looking for Kate?

1203
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:03,931
Yeah, I've been looking
everywhere for her.

1204
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:06,641
I can't find her.

1205
01:12:06,642 --> 01:12:08,393
Are you worried?

1206
01:12:08,394 --> 01:12:13,189
Yeah.

1207
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,483
I'm going to go
check in the house.

1208
01:12:15,484 --> 01:12:18,110
Okay, have you guys seen Kate?
I've been looking for her everywhere.

1209
01:12:18,111 --> 01:12:19,987
I can't find her.
I'm freaking out.

1210
01:12:19,988 --> 01:12:21,780
Yeah, the last time I saw
her, we were at the bar.

1211
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:23,615
I got her a champagne,
but that was ages ago.

1212
01:12:23,616 --> 01:12:25,284
You what?
You got her champagne?

1213
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,703
She's underage.
It's no big deal.

1214
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:29,620
No, it is a big deal, okay,

1215
01:12:29,621 --> 01:12:31,539
because she has a history
and she has a drug problem,

1216
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,748
so she can't drink.

1217
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:33,958
She has a drug problem?

1218
01:12:33,959 --> 01:12:36,752
She had a drug problem.

1219
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:41,631
Come with me.
She has a drug problem.

1220
01:12:41,632 --> 01:12:43,383
Did you give that girl another one?

1221
01:12:43,384 --> 01:12:46,386
What girl?

1222
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,179
She said they were for you.

1223
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,890
Did you see where she went?
Have you seen her?

1224
01:12:49,891 --> 01:12:51,349
I don't know. She
left with some guy.

1225
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,309
Jesus.
Calm down.

1226
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,686
I don't want to calm down.
She's 16 and she's fucked up.

1227
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:57,187
<i>Take it easy.
We'll find her, okay.</i>

1228
01:12:57,188 --> 01:12:58,689
Did you look at the guy's ID?

1229
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,232
Do you remember his name?

1230
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:02,484
I look at dates, not names.

1231
01:13:02,485 --> 01:13:04,235
She left with Gus.

1232
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:05,862
Who the fuck is Gus?

1233
01:13:05,863 --> 01:13:08,031
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

1234
01:13:08,032 --> 01:13:09,449
You had no right.

1235
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,409
I didn't think that your Mom

1236
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:13,620
wanted to miss the most
important night in your life.

1237
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,370
We are not having this
conversation right now,

1238
01:13:15,371 --> 01:13:16,914
and just stop following me.

1239
01:13:16,915 --> 01:13:18,957
Would you just shut up?
Just shut up!

1240
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,667
I'll call you later.
Just please answer.

1241
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:22,920
Jesus, Dad,
this isn't a family vacation.

1242
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:25,130
<i>Hey, shut' up, get in the car.
You're acting like a child.</i>

1243
01:13:25,131 --> 01:13:30,130
Come on, guys.

1244
01:13:35,515 --> 01:13:40,101
It's number 608.

1245
01:13:40,102 --> 01:13:45,102
There it is right there.

1246
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,442
You guys wait here.

1247
01:13:47,443 --> 01:13:48,777
No, Dad,
I'm getting out.

1248
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,527
Samantha, you restrain him.

1249
01:13:50,528 --> 01:13:52,029
Don't let him out of the car.
I'm getting out.

1250
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,447
Stay in the car, Rusty.

1251
01:13:53,448 --> 01:13:55,991
Get back in the fucking car!

1252
01:13:55,992 --> 01:14:00,991
G. Unit G.

1253
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:11,798
<i>Who is it?</i>

1254
01:14:11,799 --> 01:14:13,340
Is Kate there?

1255
01:14:13,341 --> 01:14:15,634
Who wants to know?

1256
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:20,430
She's a minor, asshole.
She's a minor.

1257
01:14:20,431 --> 01:14:24,308
Okay, where is she?
In the bedroom.

1258
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,483
Bill...

1259
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:34,860
Help me.
She won't wake up.

1260
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:36,319
Jesus, what did you give her?

1261
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,154
She was drunk
Fucking liar!

1262
01:14:38,155 --> 01:14:40,240
Oh, fuck! We did a little coke.
That was it.

1263
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:41,992
She'll be fine.
I got her.

1264
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:44,119
You're expelled.
She's just passed out.

1265
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:49,119
You've be lucky if that's all that happens.
You can't do that.

1266
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,333
Is she all right?
Is she okay?

1267
01:14:51,334 --> 01:14:56,088
Get in the car.

1268
01:14:56,089 --> 01:14:57,798
Do you have her parents number?

1269
01:14:57,799 --> 01:14:59,257
Yeah, where's my phone?

1270
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:04,258
Okay.
What's going on?

1271
01:16:15,244 --> 01:16:20,243
How's Louis?
Who's Louis?

1272
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:32,258
Why don't you see if
your brother is up yet?

1273
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:37,259
You don't need to send me
away to talk to Mrs. Wolcott.

1274
01:16:37,515 --> 01:16:40,517
I know you two
are sleeping together.

1275
01:16:40,518 --> 01:16:42,559
You don't know shit.

1276
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,312
I know you fuck Tricia Wolcott.

1277
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:50,313
Hey... go wake up your brother.

1278
01:16:58,408 --> 01:17:01,994
Rusty, wake up.

1279
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:03,913
Rusty?

1280
01:17:15,258 --> 01:17:20,257
Oh, my God.

1281
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:11,012
<i>Dear Rusty, I know you probably
never wan! to see me again.</i>

1282
01:18:11,184 --> 01:18:13,225
I did a terrible thing to you.

1283
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:15,811
My Dad fold me you
called to see how I was.

1284
01:18:15,812 --> 01:18:17,730
As I'm sure he fold you,
I'm in rehab.

1285
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:20,191
My biggest mistake
other than hurting you

1286
01:18:20,192 --> 01:18:22,193
was thinking you could fix me.

1287
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:24,944
<i>Only I can fix me.</i>

1288
01:18:24,945 --> 01:18:27,989
<i>I'd like to become a person who actually
deserves to be with someone like you.</i>

1289
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,951
<i>I don't know how long that' will take, but
I hope you're around when it' happens.</i>

1290
01:18:31,952 --> 01:18:36,330
In the meantime, just know I'm truly
sorry for everything I put you through.

1291
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:38,332
Love, Kate.

1292
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:41,460
Oh, P. S. You were
right about that book.

1293
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:46,461
<i>I cried a! the end.
Big time.</i>

1294
01:18:55,682 --> 01:18:59,935
I know it's been a
rough couple months...

1295
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:02,103
but you coming home drunk...

1296
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,231
or stoned...

1297
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:07,234
every night?
Now you've been in a fight?

1298
01:19:07,235 --> 01:19:12,234
It was payback for something that
happened last fall. I don't care.

1299
01:19:15,575 --> 01:19:18,410
I know it's your first heartbreak.

1300
01:19:18,411 --> 01:19:20,621
I know it hurts.

1301
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,664
Nothing hurts like the first one,

1302
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:26,292
but you've got to channel
this into your work.

1303
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:27,961
Make something
positive out of it.

1304
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:31,506
Is that what you did
when Mom left?

1305
01:19:31,507 --> 01:19:33,424
What?

1306
01:19:33,425 --> 01:19:38,424
Is that what you did when Mom left?
You turned it...

1307
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:44,268
You're grounded.

1308
01:19:44,269 --> 01:19:46,560
You kidding me, Dad?

1309
01:19:46,561 --> 01:19:49,272
Would you just chill out? You can't
round me. Yeah, I just did, okay?

1310
01:19:49,273 --> 01:19:50,648
I just did.

1311
01:19:50,649 --> 01:19:52,066
You're the one who told me...

1312
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,110
No journal, nothing.

1313
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,528
You're the one who told me to
go out and get experiences.

1314
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:59,197
You can't make me write, Dad.

1315
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:04,198
<i>I don't have to! You're a writer.
You'll do it yourself.</i>

1316
01:20:13,586 --> 01:20:15,170
When you were little,
you used to run down

1317
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:16,630
to the edge of the water like that

1318
01:20:16,631 --> 01:20:18,924
when the tide was pulling out.

1319
01:20:18,925 --> 01:20:21,050
And you would turn around
screaming when it came...

1320
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:23,678
I'm letting the ocean
get me, Daddy!

1321
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,679
I'm letting the ocean get me!

1322
01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:31,476
Your mom used to watch
you like a hawk.

1323
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:34,438
She was terrified that the
ocean was going to grab you

1324
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:36,440
and pull you out to sea.

1325
01:20:36,441 --> 01:20:38,108
Why are we talking about her?

1326
01:20:38,109 --> 01:20:39,943
What are we doing down here?

1327
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:42,403
Your mom loves you.

1328
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,238
She never did anything to you.

1329
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,159
It's pointless. I know
what you're going to say.

1330
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,910
No, you don't.

1331
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,496
Those things she did to me,

1332
01:20:52,497 --> 01:20:55,081
the things you've been
holding over her,

1333
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:58,084
I had already done
to her years ago.

1334
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:03,085
What are you talking about?

1335
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:05,050
I fell in love with somebody,

1336
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:06,592
and and got lost, left.

1337
01:21:06,593 --> 01:21:08,510
Bullshit. You were just a baby,

1338
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:10,554
and your mother waited for me.
Shut up, Dad.

1339
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:12,848
She waited six months, Samantha.

1340
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:15,559
And when I realized what a selfish
shit I'd been... Shut up, Dad!

1341
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,310
She took me back.
It's the truth.

1342
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:20,021
You couldn't tell me, Dad?
Really?

1343
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:22,315
You just made me hate her!

1344
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:25,610
She made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as I had

1345
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:27,820
she hoped I'd have the
decency to wait for her,

1346
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:29,321
so I am.

1347
01:21:29,322 --> 01:21:31,823
I should have told you, Samantha.

1348
01:21:31,824 --> 01:21:36,824
I'm sorry.

1349
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:06,935
I'm sorry.

1350
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:14,025
She waited six months, Dad.
You've been waiting three years.

1351
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:16,406
I think you made good
on your promise.

1352
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:19,617
It's okay to stop waiting.

1353
01:22:19,618 --> 01:22:24,618
Yeah...
She's coming back.

1354
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:29,126
What makes you so sure?

1355
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:31,253
Because she waited.

1356
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:36,254
And your mother is a far better
person than I'll ever be.

1357
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,666
Hello?
Sam?

1358
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:18,546
I'm here.

1359
01:23:18,547 --> 01:23:22,216
She's dead.

1360
01:23:22,217 --> 01:23:26,761
My mom is dead.

1361
01:23:26,762 --> 01:23:29,806
I don't know what to do.

1362
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:34,806
Mom's dead.

1363
01:23:44,488 --> 01:23:49,487
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1364
01:26:02,655 --> 01:26:06,574
Hello?
Hello? Is Rusty there?

1365
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:08,534
This is Rusty.

1366
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:13,080
Rusty, this is Stephen King.

1367
01:26:13,081 --> 01:26:14,373
<i>Hello?</i>

1368
01:26:14,374 --> 01:26:16,249
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm here.

1369
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,792
Your sister sent me your story,

1370
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:19,711
I've Just Seen a Face.

1371
01:26:19,712 --> 01:26:21,421
<i>I read it, and I
think it's damn good.</i>

1372
01:26:21,422 --> 01:26:24,466
<i>I've loved it.
My sister sent it to you?</i>

1373
01:26:24,467 --> 01:26:26,468
<i>Yep, I took the liberty
of sending it.</i>

1374
01:26:26,469 --> 01:26:29,094
to the Magazine of Fantasy
and Science Fiction.

1375
01:26:29,095 --> 01:26:31,096
They've published some of
my stories over the years,

1376
01:26:31,097 --> 01:26:34,141
<i>and I thought' they might
be a good fit for yours.</i>

1377
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:36,268
Uh, wow, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1378
01:26:36,269 --> 01:26:38,353
You're welcome.

1379
01:26:38,354 --> 01:26:40,396
I think you've got a bright
future ahead of you.

1380
01:26:40,397 --> 01:26:42,315
Hey, tell your dad I said hello.

1381
01:26:42,316 --> 01:26:44,150
I'm a big fan of Suit Monkeys.

1382
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:46,110
It's a classic.

1383
01:26:46,111 --> 01:26:47,779
Keep up the good work.

1384
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:51,073
Wait!
Mr. King, don't go.

1385
01:26:51,074 --> 01:26:52,407
I'm still here.

1386
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:55,118
Okay, I just want to...

1387
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,912
I just want to tell you how
much your books mean to me,

1388
01:26:56,913 --> 01:26:59,998
but I don't even...
I don't even want to try.

1389
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:05,920
It's kind of like what you said
in the opening of The Body.

1390
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:09,340
The most important things
are the hardest to say.

1391
01:27:09,341 --> 01:27:12,510
Right, right.

1392
01:27:12,511 --> 01:27:14,511
I can't believe you
actually read my story

1393
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:16,596
and you liked it.
I just...

1394
01:27:16,597 --> 01:27:19,182
<i>I didn't say I liked it.
I said I loved it.</i>

1395
01:27:19,183 --> 01:27:22,435
Oh, my God Oh, shit.

1396
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:24,228
<i>It was great talking
to you, Rusty.</i>

1397
01:27:24,229 --> 01:27:29,229
Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah,
I'll see you, Stephen.

1398
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:40,576
You're going to kill yourself.

1399
01:27:40,577 --> 01:27:42,912
Do you know how to do that?

1400
01:27:42,913 --> 01:27:47,582
Yeah, Dad, I'm doing it.

1401
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,379
Hi.
Hi.

1402
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,672
We're here.

1403
01:28:39,673 --> 01:28:43,009
Good to see you.

1404
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,302
They're laughing at your work.

1405
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:46,803
It's not funny.

1406
01:28:46,804 --> 01:28:48,180
It's pretty interesting.

1407
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:50,223
It's really a short story.

1408
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:51,850
No, no, it's great.

1409
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:54,978
It's about a detective
with Alzheimer's.

1410
01:28:54,979 --> 01:28:56,771
You're kidding me.
No, I'm not.

1411
01:28:58,648 --> 01:29:02,401
I'll get it. I invited Kate.
She might come.

1412
01:29:02,402 --> 01:29:07,402
It should be entertaining.

1413
01:29:09,366 --> 01:29:11,534
Mom?

1414
01:29:11,535 --> 01:29:16,535
Hi... Um.

1415
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:21,752
I kind of pictured your
dad opening the door.

1416
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:26,753
Could you shut it
and go get him?

1417
01:29:48,027 --> 01:29:49,244
Hi.

1418
01:29:51,299 --> 01:29:52,566
Hi.

1419
01:29:55,867 --> 01:30:00,663
What are you doing here?

1420
01:30:00,664 --> 01:30:04,999
I got a little lost.

1421
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,960
I was just...

1422
01:30:06,961 --> 01:30:10,213
I was wondering if there's
still a place for me here.

1423
01:30:10,214 --> 01:30:12,006
I completely understand
if there isn't,

1424
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:15,301
because I know that
I really... every...

1425
01:30:15,302 --> 01:30:16,885
I really don't deserve it.

1426
01:30:16,886 --> 01:30:21,886
It's okay.
I'm so sorry.

1427
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,854
We got food in here?

1428
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:31,854
You do?
Yeah. Come on in.

1429
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:37,955
Hi.

1430
01:30:40,428 --> 01:30:41,647
Hi.

1431
01:30:43,452 --> 01:30:45,287
Rusty, why don't you make
a place for your mom?

1432
01:30:45,288 --> 01:30:47,747
<i>No, no, I got it.
Thanks.</i>

1433
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:50,916
I'll move this over.

1434
01:30:50,917 --> 01:30:53,127
Yeah.
Move her?

1435
01:30:53,128 --> 01:30:58,128
No, here.

1436
01:30:58,758 --> 01:31:03,177
Thank you.

1437
01:31:03,178 --> 01:31:08,178
Oh, wine glass.

1438
01:31:13,272 --> 01:31:18,271
Thanks.

1439
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:25,694
Thanks.

1440
01:31:26,074 --> 01:31:31,074
Good, well...

1441
01:31:40,588 --> 01:31:44,007
I sold my first story.

1442
01:31:44,008 --> 01:31:48,177
Rusty, that's wonderful.

1443
01:31:48,178 --> 01:31:49,553
That's great.

1444
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:50,888
Uh, it was actually all Sam.

1445
01:31:50,889 --> 01:31:52,806
You wrote it.

1446
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,558
I just sent it to the only
person I could think of

1447
01:31:54,559 --> 01:31:59,559
who would actually like it.

1448
01:32:00,981 --> 01:32:05,981
A toast.

1449
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:08,443
To Rusty.

1450
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:10,447
To Rusty.

1451
01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:12,449
And Happy Thanksgiving.

1452
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:13,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

1453
01:32:15,774 --> 01:32:17,563
Happy Thanksgiving.

1454
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:28,214
<i>I could hear
my heart beating.</i>

1455
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:32,802
<i>I could hear
everyone's heart.</i>

1456
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:37,514
<i>I could hear the human noise
we sat' there making.</i>

1457
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:39,766
<i>Not one of us moving,</i>

1458
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:44,767
<i>not even when the room
went dark.</i>
