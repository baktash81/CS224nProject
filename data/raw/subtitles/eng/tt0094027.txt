00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,300
AND WON'T BE ABLE
TO COUNT TO 10.

182
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
WE'VE SEENVATOS
LIKE YOU BEFORE.

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,700
YOU'LL BE
HURTING SOON.

184
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,200
PONTE TRUCHA, 多多HUH?

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,700
I WAS SO WORRIED

186
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
THAT THE KIDS WOULD
KNOW MORE THAN ME

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
THAT I'D WAKE UP
AT 5 A.M.,

188
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
DOWN MY COFFEE,
AND DO MATH TESTS.

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,700
I FINALLY LEARNED
EVERY CHAPTER,

190
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
AND THEN THEY
CHANGE THE BOOK.

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
MATH YOU EITHER
LOVE OR HATE.

192
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,700
YOU GET SOME PROBLEMS,
COME SEE ME AFTER SCHOOL.

193
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,200
THANKS, JAIME.
SEE YOU LATER.

194
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Girl: LEAVE THE TICKETS
AT THE DOOR, OK?

195
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,700
CAN I HAVE
MY SHADES?

196
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,600
YOU'RE IN LOVE, HUH?

197
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
WHICH ONE, HUH?
LET ME KNOW.

198
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

199
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,700
COME ON, JOHNNY.
DON'T BE AFRAID.

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
I'M NOT JOHNNY, MAN.

201
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
I KNOW, TITO.

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
TITOGRANDE.

203
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
COME ON!

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
[SHOUTING]

205
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,000
ANGEL!

206
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
ANGEL, HELP US!

207
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
STAY OUT OF IT!

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
ANGEL!

209
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
GO GET A TEACHER.

210
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,900
IT'S FRANK GAR-CIA.

211
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
WHEN I SAYGARCIA,
YOU ANSWER, OK?

212
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
ARE YOUR FRIENDS
AUDITING?

213
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
I AUDITED THEM
TO COME WITH ME.

214
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,300
I'MEL CYCLONE
FROM BOLIVIA.

215
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,800
ONE-MAN GANG.

216
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,300
THIS IS MY DOMAIN.

217
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
DON'T GIVE ME NO GAS.

218
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,800
I'LL JUMP ON YOUR FACE,
TATTOO YOUR CHROMOSOMES.

219
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,300
THIS IS BASIC MATH,

220
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,800
BUT BASIC MATH
IS TOO EASY FOR YOU,

221
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
SO I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU
ALGEBRA BECAUSE I'M THE CHAMP.

222
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,800
AND IF ALL YOU CAN DO
IS ADD AND SUBTRACT,

223
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
YOU'RE PREPARED
TO DO ONE THING--PUMP GAS.

224
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
RIPPING OFF
A GAS STATION

225
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,300
IS BETTER
THAN WORKING IN ONE.

226
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
ORALE.I'M A TOUGH GUY.
TOUGH GUYS DON'T DO MATH.

227
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,800
TOUGH GUYS DEEP-FRY CHICKEN
FOR A LIVING.

228
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,800
WANT A WING OR A LEG, MAN?

229
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
WHO EVER HEARD OF NEGATIVE
AND POSITIVE NUMBERS?

230
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,800
NEGATIVE NUMBERS
ARE LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT.

231
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
10 MILLION PEOPLE
OUT OF WORK.

232
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
THAT'S
A NEGATIVE NUMBER.

233
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,300
WE'LL NEED
LOTS OF KLEENEX.

234
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
THERE'S GOING TO BE
LOTS OF BLOODSHED.

235
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,300
EVER BEEN TO THE BEACH?

236
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,300
YEAH.

237
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,300
YOU EVER
PLAY WITH THE SAND?

238
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
YEAH.

239
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
FINGER MAN.

240
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,800
COME ON, FINGER MAN.

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
YOU EVER DIG A HOLE?

242
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
THE SAND THAT COMES
OUT OF THE HOLE,

243
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,700
THAT'S A POSITIVE.

244
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
THE HOLE IS A NEGATIVE.

245
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
THAT'S IT. SIMPLE.

246
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.

247
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,700
-2 + 2 = ...

248
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
NET HEAD.

249
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
ORALE.ANSWER IT.

250
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,200
COME ON.
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

251
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,700
-2 + 2.
FILL THE HOLE.

252
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,200
IF I HAD
THAT ON MY HANDS,

253
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I WOULDN'T
RAISE IT EITHER.

254
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,200
ORALE.
A NEGATIVE 2 + 2 = ...

255
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,700
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.

256
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,200
FILL THE HOLE.

257
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,700
-2 + 2 = ...

258
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
COME ON.
JUST FILL THE HOLE.

259
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,200
YOU CAN DO IT.

260
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,200
YOU GOING TO LET
THESEBURROSLAUGH AT YOU?

261
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
-2 + 2 = ...

262
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,200
I'LL BREAK YOUR NECK
LIKE A TOOTHPICK.

263
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,700
ORALE.

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,700
ZERO.

265
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,200
ZERO. YOU'RE RIGHT.

266
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
SIMPLE. THAT'S IT.

267
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
-2 + 2 = 0.

268
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,200
HE JUST FILLED THE HOLE.

269
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
DID YOU KNOW NEITHER
THE GREEKS NOR THE ROMANS

270
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,300
WERE CAPABLE OF USING
THE CONCEPT OF ZERO?

271
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
IT WAS YOUR ANCESTORS,
THE MAYAS,

272
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
WHO FIRST
CONTEMPLATED THE ZERO--

273
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
THE ABSENCE OF VALUE.

274
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
TRUE STORY.

275
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
YOUBURROSHAVE MATH
IN YOUR BLOOD.

276
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
HEY, KEMO SABE TODO.

277
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,800
THE MAN
KNOWS EVERYTHING.

278
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
KEMO SABE.

279
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,300
ORALE.OK.

280
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
PARENTHESES
MEANS MULTIPLY.

281
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
EVERY TIME YOU SEE THIS,
YOU MULTIPLY.

282
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

283
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

284
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

285
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,800
SAY IT.

286
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

287
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

288
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

289
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,800
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

290
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,300
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE.

291
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,800
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE!

292
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,200
A NEGATIVE x A NEGATIVE
= A POSITIVE!

293
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
WHY?

294
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
MRS. ORTEGA, I DON'T
WANT TO BE THE PRINCIPAL

295
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
OF THE FIRST SCHOOL
IN LOS ANGELES HISTORY

296
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
TO LOSE
ITS ACCREDITATION.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Raquel: I'M NOT SAYING

298
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,000
THIS MATH DEPARTMENT
COULDN'T IMPROVE,

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
BUT IF YOU WANT
HIGHER TEST SCORES,

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
START BY CHANGING
THE ECONOMIC LEVEL

301
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,000
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

302
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
THE PURPOSE
OF THIS MEETING

303
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
IS TO REVIEW
THE RECOMMENDATIONS

304
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
FOR ACCREDITATION.

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

306
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,000
ANYBODY?

307
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
YEAH. I DON'T THINK

308
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I SHOULD
BE TEACHING MATH.

309
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,000
I WAS HIRED TO BE
A PHYS-ED INSTRUCTOR.

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,500
AS I SAID BEFORE,
WE LACK THE RESOURCES

311
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,000
TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES
THE DISTRICT DEMANDS.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
MR. SANZAKI,
YOU MUST HAVE A COMMENT.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
THIS MAY NOT BE
THE RIGHT TIME, BUT...

314
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I'M SORRY, BUT I WON'T BE
COMING BACK AFTER CHRISTMAS.

315
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I GOT A JOB WITH AEROSPACE.

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,500
HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU'LL BE MAKING?

317
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,900
LOOK, WE HAVE
THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR

318
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,400
BEFORE WE'RE
PUT ON PROBATION.

319
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,900
NOW, IF WE FAIL, WE'LL
LOSE OUR ACCREDITATION.

320
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,400
WEFAIL?

321
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,900
YOU CAN'T TEACH LOGARITHMS
TO ILLITERATES.

322
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,500
KIDS COME TO US WITH BARELY
A SEVENTH GRADE EDUCATION.

323
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
THERE ISN'T A TEACHER HERE

324
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
WHO ISN'T DOING
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.

325
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
I'M NOT.
I COULD TEACH MORE.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,500
I'M SURE MR. ESCALANTE
HAS GOOD INTENTIONS,

327
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,000
BUT HE'S ONLY
BEEN HERE A FEW MONTHS.

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
STUDENTS WILL RISE
TO THE LEVEL

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
OF EXPECTATIONS,
SENOR MOLINA.

330
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,000
WHAT DO YOU NEED,
MR. ESCALANTE?

331
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
GANAS.

332
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
THAT'S ALL WE NEED
ISGANAS.

333
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,000
WHAT'SGANAS?

334
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,000
WE WILL BEGIN EACH CLASS
WITH A QUIZ.

335
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,000
AW!
AW!

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
THERE WILL BE...

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
THERE WILL
BE NO FREE RIDES,

338
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
NO EXCUSES.

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,500
YOU ALREADY HAVE
2 STRIKES AGAINST YOU.

340
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,000
THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD

341
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
WHO ASSUME THAT
YOU KNOW LESS THAN YOU DO

342
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,500
BECAUSE OF YOUR NAME
AND YOUR COMPLEXION.

343
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
BUT MATH
IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
WHEN YOU GO FOR A JOB,
THE PERSON GIVING YOU THAT JOB

345
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
WILL NOT WANT TO HEAR
YOUR PROBLEMS,

346
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
AND NEITHER DO I.

347
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,000
YOU'LL WORK HARDER THAN
YOU'VE EVER WORKED BEFORE.

348
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
AND THE ONLY THING
I ASK FROM YOU ISGANAS.

349
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
DESIRE. A HAIRCUT.

350
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
IF YOU DON'T HAVEGANAS,
I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU

351
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
BECAUSE I AM AN EXPERT.

352
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,000
TODAY IS MONDAY.
TOMORROW'S WEDNESDAY.

353
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
FRIDAY IS PAYDAY--
THE WEEKLY TEST.

354
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
THERE WILL BE
NO DIAGONAL VISION.

355
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,400
YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES
TO FINISH THE QUIZ.

356

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
HER SISTERS,
HER BROTHERS.

538
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
THIS IS
A FAMILY BUSINESS.

539
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,000
SHE'S NEEDED.

540
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,500
SHE COULD HELP
THE FAMILY MORE

541
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,000
BY GETTING
AN EDUCATION.

542
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,500
AH, PROBABLY GET PREGNANT,
WOULDN'T FINISH COLLEGE.

543
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
ANITA, GO HELP YOUR MOM
IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

544
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,000
SHE TALKS ABOUT GOING
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

545
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
NO.

546
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,000
I DON'T THINK SO.

547
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
SHE SHOULD MAKE 
HER OWN CHOICES.

548
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,000
UN MOMENTO.

549
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,100
YO SOY EL PADRE
DE LA NINA, NO USTED.

550
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
SHE'LL JUST GET FAT.

551
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
SHE'LL WASTE HER LIFE
AWAY IN A RESTAURANT.

552
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,600
SHE'S TOP KID!

553
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,100
I STARTED WASHING DISHES
FOR A NICKEL AN HOUR.

554
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,600
NOW I OWN THIS PLACE.

555
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
DID I WASTE MY LIFE?

556
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I WASHED DISHES, TOO,
WHEN I CAME TO AMERICA.

557
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
GOOD!

558
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,100
PUT ON AN APRON,
GIVE US A HAND.

559
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,100
YOUR HUSBAND COMES
INTO MY RESTAURANT, EATS,

560
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,100
THEN HE INSULTS ME.

561
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,600
EXCUSE MY HUSBAND,
MR. DELGADO.

562
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,100
HE JUST WANTS
WHAT'S BEST FOR ANA.

563
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
SHE COULD GO TO COLLEGE,
COME BACK,

564
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
AND TEACH YOU
HOW TO RUN THE PLACE.

565
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
PROFESSOR...

566
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,000
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY,

567
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
AND I DON'T NEED
YOUR BUSINESS.

568
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
SKIP IT.

569
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
TIP.

570
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,500
HE PUTS HOTCHILESIN HIS DIP
TO SELL EXTRA BEER.

571
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
iORA! iORA! iORA!

572
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,600
KAWASAKI!

573
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
KAWASAKI!

574
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,600
YEOW!

575
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
DOG, DOG, DOG, DOG.

576
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
DOG, DOG, DOG, DOG.

577
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
OK...

578
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,600
EVERYBODY,
LOOK AT THE BOARD.

579
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,100
WILL SOMEONE
PLEASE READ FOR ME

580
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,600
WHAT'S ON THE BOARD?
ANYBODY.

581
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,600
"JUAN HAS 5 TIMES AS MANY
GIRLFRIENDS AS PEDRO.

582
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,600
"CARLOS HAS ONE
GIRLFRIEND LESS THAN PEDRO.

583
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,600
"THE TOTAL NUMBER
OF GIRLFRIENDS BETWEEN THEM

584
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
"IS 20.

585
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,100
HOW MANY DOES
EACH GIGOLO HAVE?"

586
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
LATE!

587
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,100
LATE!

588
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,100
LATE! LATE! LATE!

589
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,100
OK, OK, OK.

590
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,600
OK, OK, OK, OK.

591
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,100
HOW MANY
GIRLFRIENDS

592
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
DOES EACH GIGOLO
HAVE? ANYBODY.

593
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,600
YOU GOT IT,
EINSTEIN?

594
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
YOU THINK
YOU'LL DO IT?

595
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,100
JUAN IS X. CARLOS IS Y.

596
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
PEDRO IS X + Y.

597
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,600
IS PEDRO BISEXUAL,
OR WHAT?

598
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I HAVE A TERRIBLE
FEELING ABOUT YOU.

599
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,600
KEMO,
5X = JUAN'S GIRLFRIENDS?

600
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,100
YOU'RE GOOD NOW,

601
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,100
BUT YOU'LL END UP
BAREFOOT, PREGNANT,

602
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,600
AND IN THE KITCHEN.

603
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
CAN YOU GET
NEGATIVE GIRLFRIENDS?

604
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,100
NO, JUST
NEGATIVE BOYFRIENDS.

605
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,600
PLEASE FORGIVE THEM

606
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,100
FOR THEY KNOW NOT
WHAT THEY DO.

607
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,100
CARLOS HAS X-5
GIRLFRIENDS.多多QUE NO?

608
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,600
多多QUE NO?IS RIGHT.
QUE NO.

609
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,600
THE ANSWER
TO MY PRAYERS!

610
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,100
MAY I GO
TO THE RESTROOM, PLEASE?

611
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
IN 10 MINUTES. HOLD IT.

612
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,100
SENOR MAYA. HIT IT.

613
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
IT'S A TRICK PROBLEM,
MR. KEMO.

614
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
YOU CAN'T SOLVE IT
UNLESS YOU KNOW

615
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,100
HOW MANY GIRLFRIENDS
THEY HAVE IN COMMON.

616
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
IT'S NOT
THAT THEY'RE STUPID,

617
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,600
IT'S JUST THEY DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

618
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,100
I'M WRONG?

619
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,100
X = PEDRO'S GIRLFRIENDS,

620
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,000
5X = JUAN'S GIRLFRIENDS.

621
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,500
X - 1 =
CARLOS' GIRLFRIENDS.

622
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,000
X + 5X + X - 1 = 20.

623
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,500
SO X = 3.

624
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,000
[APPLAUSE]

625
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,500
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

626
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,000
THIS STUFF
DON'T MAKE SENSE.

627
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
HOW DOES IT WORK
IN THE REAL WORLD?

628
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,500
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE
TO GET SOME GIGOLOS

629
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,600
FOR A PRACTICAL
DEMONSTRATION?

630
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,100
NO, NO, NO, STOP.

631
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,500
JUST KIDDING,
JUST KIDDING.

632
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
WOW!

633
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,800
CHECK IT OUT!

634
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
GET OUT OF HERE.

635
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
PLEASE!

636
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,700
WHAT KIND OF MATH
IS THIS?

637
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
THIS PARTICULAR ONE

638
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,200
THAT'S UP RIGHT NOW 
IS CALCULUS.

639
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,200
YOU'LL GET IT
IN COLLEGE.

640
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,200
MY DAUGHTER USES THIS
PROGRAM IN HER HIGH SCHOOL.

641
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,700
I WANT TO TEACH CALCULUS
NEXT YEAR.

642
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,700
BOY, THAT'S A JUMP.

643
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

644
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,100
THEY HAVEN'T HAD TRIG
OR MATH ANALYSIS.

645
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,200
THEY'LL TAKE THEM
THIS SUMMER.

646
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
OUR BEST STUDENTS
ATTEND SUMMER SCHOOL?

647
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,200
FROM 7:00 TO 12:00
EVERY DAY,

648
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
INCLUDING SATURDAYS.

649
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
YEP. THAT'LL DO IT.

650
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,700
OUR SUMMER CLASSROOMS ARE
RESERVED FOR REMEDIAL COURSES.

651
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,700
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE,
START FROM THE TOP.

652
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,200
MR. ESCALANTE,
DON'T LECTURE US.

653
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,700
OUR KIDS CAN'T
HANDLE CALCULUS.

654
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,200
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE THE BOOKS.

655
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,100
IF THEY PASS
THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT TEST,

656
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
THEY GET COLLEGE CREDIT.

657
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
THERE ARE TEACHERS
IN THIS ROOM

658
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,100
WHO'D HAVE TROUBLE

659
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,600
PASSING THE ADVANCED
PLACEMENT TEST.

660
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,000
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN MAKE THIS FLY?

661
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,500
I TEACH
CALCULUS OR...

662
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

663
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WELL, IF THIS MAN
CAN WALK IN HERE AND...

664
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
DICTATE HIS OWN TERMS
OVER MY OBJECTIONS...

665
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,500
I SEE NO REASON

666
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,600
FOR ME TO CONTINUE
AS DEPARTMENT CHAIR.

667
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
RAQUEL, DON'T TAKE
THIS PERSONALLY.

668
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,100
I'M THINKING
ABOUT THOSE KIDS.

669
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,600
IF THEY TRY
AND DON'T SUCCEED,

670
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
YOU'LL SHATTER WHAT LITTLE
SELF-CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE.

671
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,100
THESE AREN'T THE TYPES
THAT, UH, BOUNCE BACK.

672
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

673
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
THANKS, MAN.

674
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
KEMO, IT STINKS
LIKE LAST YEAR IN HERE.

675
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,300
SOMEBODY GIVE CLAUDIA
AN ORANGE.

676
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
OK, OK, OK. SIT DOWN.

677
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,800
YOU THINK
I WANT TO DO THIS?

678
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,800
THE JAPANESE PAY ME
TO DO THIS.

679
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
THEY'RE TIRED
OF MAKING EVERYTHING.

680
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,300
THEY WANT YOU GUYS
TO PULL YOUR OWN WEIGHT

681
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,800
SO THEY CAN TAKE VACATIONS
ON MOUNT FUJI.

682
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
KEMO, I THOUGHT
THIS ROOM

683
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AIR-CONDITIONED, MAN.

684
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
YOU SHOULD THINK...

685
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
COOL.

686
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,800
THINK...

687
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
COOL.
COOL.

688
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
THINK...

689
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,300
COOL.
COOL.

690
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
COOL.
COOL.

691
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,800
COOL.
COOL.

692
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
COOL.

693
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,300
COOL.
COOL.

694
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
OUT OF THE BLUE,

695
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,200
I GET A LETTER
SAYING I WAS FIRED

696
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,700
BECAUSE
OF PROPOSITION 13.

697
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
I'M DOWN TO $936.

698
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,200
I INVEST 100
IN RESUMES,

699
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,200
AND I BOUGHT
THIS SUIT.

700
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,300
I HIT EVERY
INSURANCE COMPANY.

701
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,300
MY WIFE WANTS US TO MOVE
IN WITH HER PARENTS.

702
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,300
2 WEEKS LATER
I GET ANOTHER LETTER

703
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
TELLING ME
TO REPORT TO WORK.

704
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
LIKE THE SUIT?

705
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,300
FABULOUS.

706
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,300
HOW ABOUT THE COLOR?

707
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,300
WELCOME BACK,PELON.

708
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,200
YOU OK?

709
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,700
YEAH, I'M OK.

710
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
YOU SURE?

711
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,200
YES. I SAID I WAS FINE.

712
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
[RIP]

713
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
UH-OH.

714

CALCULUS IS MATH
SIR ISAAC NEWTON INVENTED

746
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,700
SO HE COULD FIGURE OUT
PLANET ORBITS,

747
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,700
BUT HE NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL ANYBODY

748
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,700
UNTIL THIS OTHER
SCIENTIST GUY

749
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
TOLD EVERYBODYHE
HAD INVENTED CALCULUS.

BUT THE STUPID GUY
GOT IT ALL WRONG,

751
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,200
AND SO NEWTON
HAD TO GO PUBLIC

752
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,700
AND CORRECT
HIS MISTAKES.

753
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
ISN'T THAT NEAT?

754
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
FOR A GENIUS,
NEWTON WAS AN IDIOT.

DON'T WORRY, MOM.

756
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,200
IF I INVENT SOMETHING,
I'LL BE SURE TO GET PAID.

757
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,300
I HOPE THIS IS NOT
AN EXCUSE

758
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300

01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,700
NOTHING HAPPENED.

1243
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,700
DON'T LIE TO ME.

1244
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,700
NOTHING HAPPENED!

1245
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,700
JUST
LEAVE HER ALONE.

1246
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,700
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

1247
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,200
THEN TELL US WHO DID.

1248
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,200
WE'RE NOT COPS.

1249
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,200
WE'RE NOT HERE TO
PUT ANYBODY BEHIND BARS.

1250
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,700
IF YOU CHEATED,

1251
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:24,200
LET US KNOW
SO YOU CAN GO HOME

1252
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,200
AND ENJOY
THE REST OF YOUR SUMMER.

1253
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,200
PERMISO.

1254
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,300
I COME FROM
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

1255
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,300
YO VENGO
DE ESTE BARRIO,

1256
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:53,300
AND I KNOW THAT
SOMETIMES WE'RE TEMPTED

1257
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,800
TO TAKE SHORT CUTS.

1258
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,800
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

1259
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
DIME LA VERDAD.

1260
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
OK.

1261
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,200
WE'RE BUSTED.
WHY DON'T WE JUST ADMIT IT?

1262
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,200
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

1263
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,700
I GOT THE TEST
AHEAD OF TIME

1264
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,700
AND PASSED IT OUT
TO EVERYONE.

1265
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,700
HOW DID YOU
GET IT?

1266
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,200
THE MAILMAN.

1267
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,700
I STRANGLED HIM.

1268
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,700
HIS BODY'S DECOMPOSING
IN MY LOCKER.

1269
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,800
THERE'S NO SENSE
IN CONTINUING

1270
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,800
IF THEY
WON'T COOPERATE.

1271
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS
GOT IN MY BOX?

1272
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,900
A LETTER
OF RESIGNATION.

1273
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,400
ANONYMOUS.

1274
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,400
MY GUESS IS IT COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

1275
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,400
WITH THE MESS
THIS SCHOOL IS IN.

1276
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,400
YOU THINK
THEY CHEATED?

1277
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,400
MR. ESCALANTE,
YOU PUT THESE KIDS

1278
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,900
UNDER AN AWFUL LOT
OF PRESSURE.

1279
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:43,000
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO
ANY LENGTHS TO PLEASE YOU.

1280
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,500
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

1281
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
ALL RIGHT.

1282
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
WELL...

1283
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,500
EVERY NIGHT
WHEN I GO TO BED

1284
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
I WATCH
THE TELEVISION NEWS.

1285
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,500
I SEE LOTS OF PEOPLE
GO ON TRIAL.

1286
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,000
THEY DENY EVERYTHING,

1287
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,500
OR THEIR LAWYERS SAY
THEY WERE INSANE AT THE TIME.

1288
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,000
A LOT OF THEM GET OFF.

1289
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,000
BUT I BELIEVE
THAT MOST PEOPLE

1290
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,500
WHO GET CAUGHT
TODAY ARE GUILTY.

1291
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,900

WHAT YOU MEAN.

SEEN MY CAR?

NO.

1296
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,100
DO YOU NEED 
A RIDE HOME?

1297
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,100

MADE A MISTAKE

1305

TRYING TO TEACH
THEM CALCULUS.

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

1307
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,700
THEY PASSED THAT TEST
OR NOT, JAIME,

1308
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,700
THEY LEARNED.

1309
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,300
YEAH, THEY LEARNED

1310
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:49,800
IF YOU TRY REAL HARD,
NOTHING CHANGES.

1311
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,300
QUIT.

1312
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,800

HAVE LEFT TO TEACH...

YOU KNOW, WHAT KILLS ME

1315
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,800
IS THAT THEY LOST
THE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM

1316
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,300
THAT THEY'RE NOW FINALLY
QUALIFIED TO BE A PART OF.

I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M
LOSING SLEEP OVER THIS.

I DON'T NEED IT.

1319
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,800

TREAT ME WITH RESPECT.

THE RIGHT TO KNOW

WHY YOU THINK
MY STUDENTS CHEATED.

1345
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,100
MR. ESCALANTE,

1346
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,100
I'M SORRY YOU DROVE OUT HERE,
BUT WE'RE NOT AT LIBERTY

1347
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,600
TO DISCUSS
THE CONTROVERSY WITH YOU.

1348
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,600
I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE
THE TEST, THAT'S ALL.

1349
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,600
MR. ESCALANTE,

1350
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,100
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH HERE.

1351
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,500
BUT I REPEAT,

1352
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,500
THE PROBLEM'S BETWEEN
THE E.T.S. AND THE STUDENTS.

1353
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:34,000
I'D JUST LIKE TO SEE
WHAT MISTAKES WERE MADE.

1354
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000

I KNOW MY KIDS.

1355
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
MR. ESCALANTE,
HAVE A SEAT.

1356
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,000
NO. NO, THANK YOU.

1357
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
THERE WERE
SOME UNORTHODOX,

1358
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
EVEN ILLOGICAL
COMPUTATIONS

1359
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
FOR STUDENTS
OF THIS CALIBER.

1360
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,500
MISTAKES
IN SIMPLE MATH.

1361
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,000
MAYBE THEY MADE
THE SAME MISTAKES

1362
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,500
BECAUSE THEY HAD
THE SAME INSTRUCTION.

1363
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,000
I TAUGHT THEM
STEP BY STEP,

1364
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,500
ALL THE SAME WAY.

1365
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,500
LOOK. YOUR STUDENTS AVERAGED
FEWER THAN 4 WRONG

1366
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
ON THE MULTIPLE CHOICE,

1367
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
WHERE OTHER SCHOOLS
AVERAGE WHAT...

1368
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,000
14 TO 18
INCORRECT ANSWERS?

1369
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,000
AND MOST OF YOUR KIDS
FINISHED WITH TIME TO SPARE.

1370
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED,
NOT PUNISHED.

1371
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,500
MR. ESCALANTE,
THE EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE

1372
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,500
DOES NOT ACT CAPRICIOUSLY.

1373
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,500
EVERY MAJOR UNIVERSITY
IN THE UNITED STATES

1374
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,000
SUBSCRIBES
TO OUR SERVICE.

1375
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,500
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
PROOF OF WRONGDOING.

1376
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,500
I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE THE TESTS.

1377
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,500
LET ME REITERATE.

1378
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,500
THERE'S NO PROOF
OF WRONGDOING,

1379
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,000
ONLY A SUSPICION
OF CHEATING.

1380
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,500
ONE IS INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY,

1381
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,500
NOT THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.

1382
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,000
IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT

1383
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,500
OF YOUR STUDENT'S
ABILITIES,

1384
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
ENCOURAGE THEM
TO RETEST.

1385
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,500
WHY SHOULD I?

1386
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
IF THEY DON'T, EVERYONE
WILL ASSUME THEY CHEATED.

1387
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,600
EVERYONE WILL ASSUME
THEY CHEATED IF THEY DO.

1388
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,100
I WANT TO SEE
THE TESTS, PLEASE.

1389
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,600
MR. ESCALANTE,
WE'RE PSYCHOMETRICIANS,

1390
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,100
THOROUGH TO THE POINT
OF BORING.

1391
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,100
WE'RE NOT OUT
TO GET ANYBODY HERE.

1392
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,600
HOLD ON. IF THIS WAS
2 STUDENTS CHEATING,

1393
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,100
THAT'S ONE THING.

1394
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,100
BUT BY MAKING
A BLANKET ACCUSATION,

1395
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,600
YOU'RE SAYING
THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY.

1396
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
EVERY CONSPIRACY
HAS A LEADER.

1397
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,100
WHO BETTER TO LEAD IT
THAN THE TEACHER?

1398
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,100
NOBODY'S ACCUSING YOU
OF ANYTHING.

1399
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,600
NOT ONLY ME.

1400
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,100
THE SCHOOL, PARENTS,
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

1401
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,600
SCORES THIS HIGH
WOULD BE QUESTIONED

1402
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
REGARDLESS
OF THE SCHOOL.

1403
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,600
IF THIS WAS BEVERLY
HILLS HIGH SCHOOL,

1404
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,100
YOU TWO WOULDN'T
BE INVESTIGATING.

1405
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,100
MR. ESCALANTE,

1406
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,100
I HOPE YOU'RE
NOT INSINUATING

1407
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,100
THAT WE HAVEN'T EARNED
OUR POSITION HERE,

1408
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,100
'CAUSE NO ONE'S
GIVEN ME A DAMN THING.

1409
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:51,100

GET THE BEST OF YOU.

1410
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,100
IF NO ONE'S GIVEN YOU
A DAMN THING,

1411
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,600

AWAY FROM MY KIDS!

1412
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,000
THE IDENTITY OF

1413
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
UNTIL IT
WAS DETERMINED

1414
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,500
THAT IRREGULARITIES
EXISTED.

1415
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,500
THOSE SCORES ARE
ONLY BEING QUESTIONED

1416
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,900
BECAUSE MY KIDS
HAVE SPANISH SURNAMES

1417
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,400
AND COME
FROM BARRIO SCHOOLS!

1418
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,400
YOU KNOW THAT!

1419
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,900
WE'VE BEEN PATIENTLY
EXPLAINING OUR POSITION

1420
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
AND LISTENING
TO YOUR COMPLAINTS.

1421
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,800
NOW OUR CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

1422
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE

1423
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,300
THAT NOBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT,

1424
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,300
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS!

1425
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,800
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO ACCUSE ME OF RACISM.

1426
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,300
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO ACCUSE ME OF RACISM!

1427
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,300
I KNOW WELL HOW TO SPELL
DISCRIMINATION!

1428
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
I THOUGHT THIS WAS OVER
A LONG TIME AGO.

1429
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,800
ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO MY KIDS?

1430
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:44,300
THERE ARE
2 KINDS OF RACISM--

1431
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,300
SINGLING OUT MEMBERS
OF A MINORITY GROUP

1432
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,300
ANDNOT
SINGLING OUT MEMBERS

1433
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,800
OF A MINORITY GROUP.

1434
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,400
MY KIDS COULD TEACH
YOU A THING OR TWO.

1435
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,900
I'M CALLING SECURITY

1436
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,900
IF YOU CAN'T
CONTROL YOURSELF.

1437
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,400
GO AHEAD.

1438
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,400
YOU DIDN'T
SHOW ME THE TEST.

1439
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,900
YOU DIDN'T
PROVE ANYTHING.

1440
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,400
THEY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

1441
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,400
I'LL PROVE
YOU GUYS WRONG.

1442
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,900
I HOPE YOU DO,

1443
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,900
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

1444
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,900
MAYBE NOT,

1445
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,900
BUT IF I CATCH
YOU ON THE STREET,

1446
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:19,400
I'LL KICK THE SHIT
OUT OF YOU.

1447
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,400
YEAH, THIS IS
GUADALUPE ESCOBAR.

1448
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,400
I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE
THE TEST AGAIN.

1449
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,400
YOU'RE KIDDING.

1450
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,400
KEMO, WE ONLY HAVE
ONE DAY TO STUDY.

1451
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,900
OK. 8 A.M.
ON TUESDAY. THANK YOU.

1452
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,000
WHY DIDN'T YOU
LET ME TALK TO THEM?

1453
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
CALL COLLECT. STICK
THEM WITH A BIG BILL.

1454
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:54,000
I THOUGHT I'D SEEN THIS PLACE
FOR THE LAST TIME.

1455
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,500
WE'LL HAVE TO REVIEW

1456
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,000
THE ENTIRE COURSE
IN ONE SHOT.

1457
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
YOU MEAN
IN ONE DAY?

1458
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
CAN'T DO IT IN LESS.

1459
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
IT'LL BE THE SAME TEST?

1460
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,500
MM-MMM. IT'LL BE HARDER.

1461
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,000
DON'T COUNT ON THAT.

1462
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,500
JUST GO STEP BY STEP
AND PLAY DEFENSE.

1463
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,000
DON'T BRING ANYTHING.

1464
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
NO PENCILS,
NO ERASERS, NOTHING.

1465
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
DON'T WEAR CLOTHES
WITH TOO MANY POCKETS.

1466
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
DON'T LET
YOUR EYES WANDER.

1467
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
NO SPACING OUT.

1468
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
DON'T GIVE THEM
ANY OPPORTUNITY

1469
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,500
TO CALL YOU CHEATERS.

1470
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,500
YOU ARE
THE TRUE DREAMERS,

1471
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,400
AND DREAMS ACCOMPLISH
WONDERFUL THINGS.

1472
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,400
YOU'RE THE BEST.

1473
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,400
TOMORROW YOU'LL PROVE
THAT YOU'RE THE CHAMPS.

1474
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,400
START WITH CHAPTER ONE.

1475
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,400
KEMO, WHAT YOU
MAKING OVER THERE?

1476
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,900
YOU LIKE BRAINS?

1477
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,400
GOOD. I WAS AFRAID

1478
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,400
YOU GUYS WOULDN'T
APPRECIATE IT.

1479
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,400
THIS FOOD LASTS
FOR 24 HOURS.

1480
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,400
YOU'RE AFRAID WE'LL SCREW UP
ROYALLY TOMORROW, AREN'T YOU?

1481
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,900
TOMORROW'S JUST
ANOTHER DAY, HONEY.

1482
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,900
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL SCREW UP
THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.

1483
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,500
I'M FRIED.

1484
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,500
I DON'T CARE
IF I DON'T PASS.

1485
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,500
SIT DOWN. WE GOT
WORK TO DO.

1486
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,400
I'M GOING HOME.

1487
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,900
SIT DOWN.

1488
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,400
I'M TIRED, AND
I'M GOING HOME.

1489
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,400
OK?

1490
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,400
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

1491
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,900
I'M GOING HOME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

1492
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,400
THIS STUFF'S READY.
WHO'D LIKE SOME?

1493
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,900
KEMO, LET'S
ORDER OUT, MAN.

1494
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,400
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

1495
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,800
HEY, I HAD
TO SEE YOU.

1496
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,800
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND

1497
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,800
AT YOUR CONVENIENCE.

1498
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,800
I'M AN ASSHOLE.

1499
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,300
SORRY.

1500
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,900

01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,900
WRONG ANSWERS WILL BE

1507

FINISHED?

1517
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,500
I CANNOT
FINISH THE TEST.

1518
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:24,000
I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT AT USC.

1519
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
IT'S RELATED
TO MY SCHOLARSHIP.

1520
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,500
CAN'T THAT WAIT?

1521
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
NO, IT CAN'T.

1522
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,500
OK. DID YOU FILL OUT
YOUR I.D. CARD?

1523
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,500

1524
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,500

01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,700
MR. ESCALANTE,

01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,200
WE GOT

01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,700
YEP. THAT'LL DO IT.

1570
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:30,000
?? GOTTA ASK MYSELF
IF IT'S ALL DECEPTION ??

1571
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,500
