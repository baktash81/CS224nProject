1
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,307
Max!

2
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,396
Come on!

3
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,233
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.

4
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,406
This is Frey.

5
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,452
She's new here as well.

6
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,125
Can you read?

7
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,926
It's a giraffe. They were from Africa.

8
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,262
- You can read?
- Yes.

9
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,147
"There are many robot servants,
and they serve you all day.

10
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,443
If you live there,
you never get sick or old."

11
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,613
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?

12
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,115
Yeah, I promise.

13
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,617
Frey and...

14
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,871
...Max...

15
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,331
...forever.

16
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,378
Max, have you been
stealing things again?

17
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,718
It breaks my heart. Why do you do this?

18
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,304
So you can save up?

19
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,640
One day buy a ticket up to that place?

20
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,281
That place is not for you, or for me.

21
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,367
But it's not fair, Sister.

22
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,161
Why can't I go there?

23
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,330
Sometimes in life
we don't understand...

24
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,999
...why things are the way they are.

25
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,461
But I know one thing.

26
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,172
I know you are special.

27
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,343
You will do something
very important one day.

28
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,803
Something you were born for.

29
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,182
My little Max.

30
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,939
Off to work, huh?
Gotta get up early to work that line.

31
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,233
Make the world a better place.

32
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,819
That's real funny, I have a job.

33
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,451
Come on. You think I got money?
Do I look like I have money?

34
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,662
Come on.

35
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,747
How about you?
You got a little money?

36
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,917
Come on. What have you got in there?
What have you got?

37
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,335
Oh, wait a minute.

38
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,878
Wait a minute.

39
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:43,175
Oh, it's 5 bucks. Hey, wait a minute,
I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.

40
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,679
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.

41
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,431
All right.

42
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,111
Please form an orderly queue.
Your bus has arrived.

43
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,328
Leave me alone!

44
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,998
Checked. Move on.

45
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,001
Your bags may be searched.

46
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,841
Good morning, officer.

47
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,138
Extensive criminal history.
Multiple felonies. What's in the bag?

48
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,224
Hair products, mostly.

49
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,643
I'm just fucking with--
Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,229
I'm just going to work man.
Nothing's in the fucking bag.

51
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,481
Come on, I--

52
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,649
Misdemeanor: citizen disobedience.

53
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,152
I'm just going to work, man. Come on.

54
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,327
- Checked.
- Nothing in there, is there?

55
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,704
Zero tolerance policy
applies to all citizens.

56
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,122
No shit.

57
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,087
You must report immediately to
your parole officer. Thank you, citizen.

58
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,505
No, thank you.

59
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,353
- Frey, fracture, Bed 2.
- Just let us work, okay? Let us work.

60
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,401
Max?

61
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,447
Frey. I thought you were...

62
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,366
When did you get back?

63
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,035
Been back for a while.
I see things haven't changed.

64
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,080
- No, this wasn't even my fault.
- Of course not.

65
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,291
- Let me have a look. Pretty bad break.
- It isn't pleasant.

66
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,045
So you're a nurse, huh? You did it.

67
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,548
Yeah.

68
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,092
That's great.

69
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,553
You still stealing cars?

70
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,056
No. God, no. I don't do any
of that stupid shit anymore.

71
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,558
I work at Armadyne.

72
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,436
- On the line, you know working my way up.
- Frey they need you on the third floor.

73
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,729
Be right there.

74
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,898
So, you know, now that you're back--

75
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,068
Just a second, Max. 2 seconds.

76
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,654
Dominica. Can you take over here?

77
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,907
Hey, listen. Now, you know,
because you're back and everything--

78
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,742
Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

79
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,162
It's good to see you.
Stay out of trouble.

80
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,415
I do.

81
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,840
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.

82
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,260
- Out of the way, sir.
- Look, I get it.

83
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,804
I know why you left the neighborhood.
I understand.

84
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,685
If I was as smart as you, I would have
left too. Have dinner with me. Just...

85
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,646
All right. Look, I'll settle for a coffee.

86
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,316
- No.
- Oh, Jesus.

87
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,610
I gotta break my other arm
to get attention?

88
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,612
- Stop. Stop.
- Because I will do that.

89
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,865
My life is complicated, Max.

90
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,994
I just-- I-- I-- I miss you.

91
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,208
- My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay?
- Yeah. All right.

92
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,335
- Coffee.
- Yeah, coffee. Right.

93
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,670
Get out of here.

94
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,717
All parolees must pass
weapons inspection.

95
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,225
Hello.

96
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,810
Before we start I'd just like to explain--

97
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,190
Max Da Costa. Violation of Penal Code
2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.

98
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,651
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted
to talk to you about.

99
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,486
You see, I believe there is a misunderstanding.

100
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,780
Immediate extension of parole
by further 8 months.

101
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,824
Wait, what? No, no, no.
I can explain what happened.

102
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,993
I just made a joke, and, you know--

103
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,414
Stop talking. Police officers noted
violent and antisocial behavior.

104
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,667
We regretfully must extend parole.

105
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,546
Elevation in heart rate detected.
Would you like a pill?

106
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,217
No. Thank you.

107
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,302
- Well I'd like to explain--
- Stop talking.

108
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,847
Personality matrix suggests
a 78.3 percent chance of regression...

109
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,225
...to old behavior patterns:
Grand theft auto.

110
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,560
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Resisting arrest.

111
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,440
- Would you like to talk to a human?
- No, I am okay, thank you.

112
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,694
- Are you being sarcastic and or abusive?
- Negative.

113
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,321
It is a federal offense
to abuse a parole officer.

114
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,489
Understood.

115
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,120
Safety is our priority.

116
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,373
- Hey. Da Costa.
- No weapons detected.

117
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,709
- You're late for your shift.
- Yeah man I had a little thing--

118
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,044
No, you can't work with that.
You're out.

119
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,048
No, no, no. I'm good, man. I can work. I can work
This coming off later today. I'm fine.

120
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,383
- You're good?
- I'm good.

121
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,468
Okay. I'm docking you half a day.

122
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,221
- Yeah, all right.
- You know you're lucky to have this job.

123
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,266
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.

124
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,229
--The restroom more than once per shift.
Please keep your workstation tidy.

125
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,941
A tidy workstation
is an efficient workstation.

126
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,831
Check it out, man. I think he likes you.

127
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,250
Think he got his face peel today?
He looks good.

128
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,337
Attention. All workers
must reach weekly quotas.

129
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,506
Please report any unsafe activity
to your supervisor.

130
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,092
If we don't have a clear path to upside...

131
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,512
...our investors are going to start
losing a lot of confidence.

132
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,890
What do you think I've been doing
down here on Earth?

133
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,601
- You think I enjoy breathing this air?
- No, of course--

134
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,938
I am doing everything possible
to restore profitability to this company.

135
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,982
The company that I built.

136
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,525
Now, if you will excuse me...

137
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,528
...I have to not speak to you people
any longer. Thank you.

138
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,458
Closing 34.

139
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,671
Fire in 34.

140
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,779
Burn her ID!

141
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Let's go. Let's go.
We don't have much time.

142
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,672
We hacked 3 transponder codes, Spider.

143
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,382
Okay. Pull them up on-screen.

144
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,426
Codes have been accepted.

145
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,011
Fire up the shuttles!

146
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,973
We are going up!

147
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,550
- Welcome.
- Hello, madam.

148
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,052
- Take a look at the garden.
- We will. Thank you.

149
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,388
Yes, I understand...

150
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,309
My, how you've grown!

151
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,811
Are the children here?

152
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,313
Yes, with Dominica.

153
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,857
I have a present for you.

154
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,860
Go and get it with your mother.

155
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,904
It's next to the couch.

156
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,032
Ma'am, would you care
for a refreshment?

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,325
Command: Cancel.

158
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,471
Sorry for disturbing you, ma'am.

159
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,932
We have a number of
undocumented ships inbound.

160
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,939
Good afternoon,
Defense Secretary Delacourt.

161
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,485
3 undocumented ships
are approaching Elysium airspace.

162
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:25,280
Emergency orders 6 and 7
are now in effect.

163
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,953
Protocol 22 B-39 in progress.

164
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,502
Attention, incoming vessels.

165
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,131
You have made unauthorized entry
into Elysium airspace.

166
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,177
Return to Earth or we will be forced
to take immediate action.

167
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,222
You are in violation
of Elysium airspace.

168
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,057
The standard warning didn't work.

169
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,436
15,000 kilometers and closing.

170
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,690
- What do you want us to do, ma'am?
- Activate Kruger.

171
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,235
Ma'am, according to
Executive Order 355...

172
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,737
...we are unauthorized
to use our assets on Earth.

173
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,990
I am authorizing you.

174
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,534
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,845
Agent 32 Alpha,
we are sending a packet. Over.

176
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,941
Welcome, Agent Kruger.

177
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,530
10,000 kilometers and closing.

178
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,240
Sending coordinates to asset.

179
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,034
Syncing target data.

180
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,704
Shoot them down.

181
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,123
Green light, 21 B. Green light.

182
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,255
Missiles away.

183
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:52,260
2 ships destroyed.
46 total casualties.

184
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,929
Impact in 5...

185
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,355
- The last missile was a miss.
- Ridiculous.

186
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,691
Only one made it.

187
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,862
Maam the ship has breached
our atmosphere.

188
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,462
First undocumented ship
just touched down.

189
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,716
I want everyone coming out
of that vehicle apprehended.

190
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,329
Identification confirmed.

191
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,499
Scanning.

192
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,920
Reconstruction process initiated.

193
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,010
No.

194
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,557
We have 32 arrests, 13 casualties
and 2 illegals still at large, ma'am.

195
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,602
Reconstruction complete.

196
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,242
You are under arrest
under the 68-C immigration Act.

197
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,831
- All illegals are now in custody, ma'am.
- Yes.

198
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,043
Send them to Deportation.
Get them off this habitat.

199
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,226
Secretary Delacourt, please report
to President Patel immediately.

200
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,813
Secretary Delacourt,
report to President Patel.

201
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,589
What up, man?

202
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,216
What happened?

203
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,593
- The police.
- You okay?

204
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,095
Don't worry about it.

205
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,056
Max, I gotta talk to you.
Okay, you know--

206
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,891
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

207
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,270
- You didn't hear what I was gonna say.
- All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.

208
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,565
Okay. You know the house of Los Zetas,
up on the hill?

209
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,318
- Yeah, the one with all the guns.
- Yeah. They have 5 cars. New ones.

210
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,446
It's gonna be 3 of us.
Tomorrow at lunch.

211
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,074
- Lunch time. That's the plan?
- Yeah.

212
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,285
- Jesus Christ.
- What? You have a better plan?

213
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,372
Yeah. We just take one guy,
go before the sun comes up.

214
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,959
You take the 2 fastest cars,
you torch the batteries on the other one so--

215
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,794
Fuck you, fuck you.

216
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,590
I got you. Please, man, you're the best.
Give me one year.

217
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,842
- Just one year.
- I'm not going back to prison man.

218
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,510
One year, please.

219
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,638
Look at you. You used to be a legend,
and now what?

220
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,694
The time is 5:50 a.m.

221
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,583
No weapons detected.
You are clear for entry.

222
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,424
Closing 34.

223
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,904
Hey. You're holding up the line.

224
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,906
No. No, no. I got a jam.

225
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,368
Attention. Workers may not visit
the restroom more than once per shift.

226
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,537
- What have you done, Da Costa?
- No, I'm just trying to reset.

227
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,040
Let me look. Let me look.

228
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,085
- The pallet's pinched.
- Yeah, it moved.

229
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,462
- Just go in there.
- No. I mean...

230
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,257
Look, either you go in there right now
or I'll find someone who will...

231
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,677
- ...and you can clean out your locker.
- Come on man.

232
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,680
No. That's the deal, okay? In you go.

233
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,894
Let's go, people. Back to work.

234
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,481
Fuck.

235
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,923
No, no. No, no, no!

236
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,300
No. No, no! No, stop. No, no!

237
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,719
Hey! Hey! Hey!

238
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,940
Hey.

239
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,322
Hey, come on, you guys.

240
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,118
It's too late. It's too late, come on.

241
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,661
Come on.

242
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,039
Extraction!

243
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,112
They started the fight, Sister.

244
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,365
I just want to live there.

245
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,204
You see how beautiful it looks to us
from here?

246
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,998
Yes.

247
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,168
Well...

248
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,713
Now look how beautiful we look
from there.

249
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,300
Keep it.

250
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,844
This is yours now.

251
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,349
To never forget about
where you come from.

252
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,701
What happened?

253
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,372
You have been exposed
to a lethal dose of radiation.

254
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,375
You will experience
catastrophic organ failure.

255
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,461
In 5 days time, you will die.

256
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,766
What is going on?
Why has production stopped?

257
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,353
- He's been exposed.
- Don't breathe on me. Cover your mouth.

258
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,563
I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,908
Does his skin fall off or something?

260
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,494
I don't want to replace the bedding on there.
Just get him out.

261
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,080
- Yes, sir.
- Great. Thank you.

262
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,584
Mr. Carlyle,
your shuttle is ready for departure.

263
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,551
Please sign this to receive medication.

264
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:24,898
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you
functioning normally until your death.

265
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:30,278
Please take one pill with each meal.
Thank you for your service.

266
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:46,961
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down
2 shuttles, killing 46 civilians.

267
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,631
Your mandate is to deal
with illegals quietly.

268
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,382
I am aware of that.

269
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,635
And then there's the use of this...

270
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,805
...agent, a Mr. M. Kruger.

271
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:02,477
15 human rights violations.
Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.

272
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,647
The man's been diagnosed
with serious psychological issues.

273
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,815
We made it explicitly clear to you...

274
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,360
...that we are no longer using
sleeper agents.

275
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,321
Tell me something, President Patel.

276
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,740
Do you have children?

277
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,661
I am not the one being reviewed here.

278
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,373
Then I will assume you do not.

279
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,294
Perhaps if you did have children,
then you would behave in a manner...

280
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:32,215
...that is more conducive
to the longevity of this habitat.

281
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:37,095
I understand that it is not the fashion
to think and to act as I do.

282
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,014
I understand that perfectly.

283
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:44,686
But when they come for your house,
for the house you built for your children...

284
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,854
...and your children's children...

285
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:52,610
...it won't be PR and campaign promises
that keep them out. It will be me.

286
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,530
I've heard enough.
This is your final warning.

287
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:59,534
Any further unauthorized actions,
and you will be removed from office.

288
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:03,955
And let's discharge
this Agent Kruger permanently.

289
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,623
All in favor?

290
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,043
Good. Effective immediately.

291
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,857
You want some beer?

292
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,744
You have been discharged from CCB.

293
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,788
Please return all weapons
to the local embassy.

294
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,585
Fuck your politics, man! Fuck you!

295
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:12,440
Max.

296
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,487
What happened? Jesus.
Let me help you.

297
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,863
Let's go in, come on.

298
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,284
Max, what happened? Jesus.

299
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,911
Max. What happened?

300
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,663
- I shouldn't have gone in, man.
- Go in where?

301
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,416
Jesus.

302
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,464
I took a full dose, man.

303
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,883
I got a full dose.

304
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,262
You're gonna be okay. Let me help.

305
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,516
You're gonna be okay, Max.

306
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,894
They gave me Miporol, man.

307
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,355
They gave me fucking...

308
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,650
...Miporol.

309
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,279
5 fucking days, man.
I only got 5 days.

310
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,448
You have to take this.

311
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,079
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.
- I know.

312
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,039
I'm gonna go see Spider.

313
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,167
Max. Max, take the pill.

314
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,674
There you go.

315
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,510
To see Spider, you need money.

316
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,889
I'll give you everything I have,
but it's not enough for a ticket.

317
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
He's gonna give me a ticket.

318
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,855
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

319
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,610
Frey, you know we've done everything we could
to help your daughter.

320
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,739
But I have a meeting today with the board and they
recommend we send her home with you.

321
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,200
How can I work here
and leave her at home?

322
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,453
You know it can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.

323
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,039
I know. If she has another seizure,
of course bring her back to the ward.

324
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,541
Of course.

325
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,418
But until then, she's discharged.

326
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,213
This isn't Elysium.
We can't just heal her.

327
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,758
Max.

328
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,135
It's been a while, my brother.

329
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,471
How's life at the factory?

330
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,307
I need to ask you a favor.

331
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,351
What? I can't hear you. What?

332
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,437
I need a ticket up there.

333
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,274
- And an ID.
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,819
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

335
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,448
Absolutely.
Do you prefer aisle or window?

336
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,035
I'm being fucking serious, man.

337
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,497
Listen. I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna come back and work for you.

338
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,627
Anything you need, man.
I'll fucking pay it back.

339
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,295
You know what?

340
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:32,056
This is priceless.

341
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,642
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.

342
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,272
Do you have any idea
how many idiots come in here...

343
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,816
...saying the same kind of bullshit?

344
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,528
I got little kids coming in here
every day.

345
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,114
Max, if I were you...

346
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,158
...I'd get the fuck out of here right now.

347
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,495
Max, don't. Hey, Max, don't.

348
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,332
I did 3 years for you. After everything
I did for you, you'll gonna get me up there.

349
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,501
- Can you feel this?
- Go ahead and shoot.

350
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,380
I got so much radiation in my body right now,
you're probably getting a little sick yourself.

351
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,717
- You're really dying?
- I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

352
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:12,054
See this? It's over. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!

353
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,307
Put the gun down! Get out of here!

354
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,851
Okay?

355
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,063
Listen. I've been looking for someone
to take a job for me.

356
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,026
But no one here had the balls!

357
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,362
You said you'd do anything, right?

358
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,531
Max.

359
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,626
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

360
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,884
All right, here we go.

361
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,307
This...

362
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,894
...my friend...

363
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,981
This can be your ticket up there.

364
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,987
One last job for me,
you earn your way up.

365
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,868
- What is it?
- Take an Elysian asshole, right?

366
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,578
A billionaire.

367
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,539
He's down on Earth for some business.

368
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,668
He's here for whatever. We hijack him.

369
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,586
- Fuck that.
- Okay, relax.

370
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,090
It gets, like, much worse.

371
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,677
Forget his watch. Forget his ride.
Forget all that shit.

372
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,263
This is what you take.

373
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,936
Organic information,
right out of his head.

374
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:46,899
Now, I'm talking about bank codes,
passwords, log-in data.

375
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,443
Access to billions.

376
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,114
All you have to do
is plug into his brain...

377
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,075
...download the data into yours
with this baby...

378
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,202
...and bring it to me.

379
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,704
This is crazy, Max. Come on.

380
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:05,334
Once we verify the data, I'll give you
a one-way ride, all expenses paid.

381
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,295
Even throw in some snacks
and a drink.

382
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:12,591
All you have to do is walk
into a house and use the med bay...

383
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,801
...and you're cured.

384
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,430
Sandro will do the surgery.
You know him?

385
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,682
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

386
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,142
I'm good.

387
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,397
Actually, you seem
all weak and fucked up.

388
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,651
So you know what? I'll have them...

389
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,739
This is crazy. Let's get out of here,
please. Listen to me.

390
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,867
- What the fuck am I gonna do?
- I'll have them install...

391
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,121
...this. A third-generation exo-suit.

392
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,333
We hook this into your nervous system,
it'll make you as strong as a droid.

393
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,669
You're already under the knife, right?

394
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,588
Let's get out of here. Please.

395
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,007
I want a 4-man team, but I pick them.

396
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,843
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

397
00:34:56,011 --> 00:35:00,055
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough.
- Okay.

398
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,768
But I'm taking Julio.
He gets a ticket up there, same as me.

399
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,146
Yeah, sure.
Okay. I'll go get the boys ready.

400
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,023
Wait.

401
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,526
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

402
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,281
The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?

403
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,034
That's the mark.

404
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,335
Secretary Delacourt,
Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

405
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:34,924
You are here to persuade me
to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

406
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,467
Astute as always.

407
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,428
Come with me.

408
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,814
I'm not interested in your little ideas.

409
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,108
I'm interested in something
much larger.

410
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,611
This habitat is dying.

411
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,239
There is a political sickness
inside of it.

412
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,158
A tumor that needs to be removed.

413
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,829
You and your company
are in need of revenue...

414
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,580
...that is drying up.

415
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,251
So you built the torus.

416
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:15,798
Can you override the servers
and place a new president in power?

417
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,761
A coup?

418
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,597
Are you suggesting a coup?

419
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,975
Is it possible?

420
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:31,730
I could write a reboot sequence
and shut down the entire system.

421
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,607
And at that point...

422
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,444
...you could encode
a new president, yes.

423
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,488
Then that is what you will do.

424
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:43,784
And you will have your contract secured
for the next 200 years.

425
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,036
Missile defense batteries, droids.

426
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,164
Everything we need
to protect our liberty.

427
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:54,336
All guaranteed, of course,
by your new president.

428
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,763
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.

429
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,810
This is the guy.

430
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,814
- This is the guy?
- This is him.

431
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,566
Sit down.

432
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,445
We're gonna cut you a good one.

433
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,531
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.

434
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,117
Let's get him an ID first.

435
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,828
Get the chief
one of them identification codes.

436
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,246
Get that ready.

437
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,081
Arm up.

438
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:41,508
That'll merge with the DNA
and you'll fit in like you were born there.

439
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,763
Now it's time for the real fun.

440
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,021
Okay. What we got?

441
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,575
Hey, man.

442
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,038
Yo. Is this gonna hurt?

443
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,460
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt.
It's gonna hurt good.

444
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,880
When we're done with you,
you're gonna be a favela ninja.

445
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,968
Marianna, hey,
bring down the bone saw.

446
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,516
- Bring the bone saw!
- This ain't gonna kill me.

447
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,686
You're gonna be all right, my brother.

448
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,647
Max.

449
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,899
I'm here.

450
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,737
We got this, man. We got this.

451
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,908
Yeah.

452
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,963
Hey!

453
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,381
He's awake!

454
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,303
You made it, huh? Surprise.

455
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,018
You can still jack off.

456
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,646
- How's everything going?
- He's ready to kick ass.

457
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,446
What the fuck did you do to me?

458
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,158
Gave you a way out.

459
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,460
Damn.

460
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,634
What's up, partner?
How's that suit working out for you, man?

461
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,596
That shit is tight.

462
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,390
Show me.

463
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,147
Hold that.

464
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,984
What's this, a family heirloom?

465
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,610
Wait for it.

466
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,324
Air-bursting ammunition.
Designate your enemy...

467
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,078
...and any round you fire will explode
around them, 5-meter kill radius.

468
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,247
And...

469
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,668
...synced detonation rounds
for this bad boy.

470
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,503
That'll work.

471
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,172
Move out.

472
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,683
Sir?

473
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,852
Shuttle is ready.

474
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,372
Do you read me?

475
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:31,131
Alright here's the deal. We'll wait outside
the factory until we see his shuttle leave.

476
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,052
One of you puts an explosive round in it,
goes to the crash site, and gets the data.

477
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,804
Okay. Copy that.

478
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,312
Camera's live, boys.
You getting this, Spider?

479
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,314
I got it. Let's go. Let's play ball.

480
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,651
- Move out of the way.
- Coming through.

481
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,660
- You nervous?
- No.

482
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,994
No?

483
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,374
I'm shitting my pants.

484
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,340
- We're not gonna fucking die here.
- Yeah.

485
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,238
Go, go, go.

486
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,465
Acceleration to supersonic speeds
in 15 seconds.

487
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,020
Come on, come on, come on.

488
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,739
Critical engine failure.

489
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,119
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen
on Earth in danger.

490
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,746
Data coming up now.

491
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,584
Citizen identified. John Carlyle.
N8321P...

492
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,546
I see you, motherfucker.

493
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,260
I have a situation here.

494
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,179
Kruger, do you read me?

495
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,974
Miss Delacourt,
how lovely to hear your voice.

496
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:49,394
There is a citizen carrying
sensitive brain data out of the city right now.

497
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,439
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it.
- What's in it?

498
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,774
That's classified.

499
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,777
You don't call
a recently deactivated agent...

500
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,696
...to retrieve classified
fucking information, man.

501
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,990
The government doesn't know
about this, do they?

502
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,618
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?

503
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,707
Please brace for impact.

504
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,134
Please remain calm.
You have sustained zero injuries.

505
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,803
Oh, that's a real comfort.

506
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,770
I got one condition.
I do this, I get reinstated.

507
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:36,358
Fine. I've recommissioned
2 of your preferred agents...

508
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,360
...completely confidentially, of course.

509
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,862
They should be at your position
any second.

510
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,823
Send me the mission data.

511
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,426
Let's go, guys. Out of the cars.

512
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:13,603
Droids, there appears to be
some type of wheeled vehicle with one...

513
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,023
2 occupants...

514
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,110
...and they are armed
and I'd like them dead.

515
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,865
Droid!

516
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,789
It's jammed! It's jammed!

517
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:40,255
- No!
- Identified. Max Da Costa.

518
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:45,760
Federal parole number 61492-8-557.

519
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,220
Come on.

520
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,396
It's jammed, man!

521
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,149
Got it.

522
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,653
He's reloading!

523
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,050
- You all right?
- We gotta go faster. I got the door.

524
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,219
Go, go! I got you covered!

525
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,596
Go, go, go.

526
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,442
Don't fucking move.

527
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,449
- Bring it!
- There's another one.

528
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,870
Die, motherfucker!

529
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,125
Don't hit the mark!

530
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,639
No, no, no! No, no!
He got hit, he got hit!

531
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,101
Citizen has sustained
a cardiothoracic trauma.

532
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,936
Blood pressure is dropping.

533
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,188
It's not in the head. it's in the chest.

534
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,358
We're fucking good, man.
Hold his head. Hold his head.

535
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,194
Plug this into you.
Come on, get that shit in.

536
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,740
- Come on, baby.
- It's in.

537
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,575
- Yes.
- Is it working?

538
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,201
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.

539
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,414
You have no idea what you're doing.

540
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,377
1 minute to target, sir.

541
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,092
All right. All right, we're synced.
Come on, baby, here we go.

542
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,221
It's gonna work. We got it.
It's gonna work.

543
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,308
It's a data heist, ma'am.
They're downloading now.

544
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,814
Guys, we got incoming.

545
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,983
Oh, fuck me.

546
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,779
Come on, guys, hurry up.

547
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,739
That's a Raven. That's military.

548
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,325
That's all right, we got this.
97, 98.

549
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,369
- Hurry up! They're coming!
- Almost there.

550
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,580
99! Ding, here we go!

551
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,835
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.

552
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,172
- What the fuck? What does that mean?
- Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

553
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,548
I can't read the data.

554
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,468
- It's scrambled. I can't read the data.
- What?

555
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,930
Come on, guys, we gotta move!

556
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,599
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean?
- Fuck this.

557
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,686
No, no, no. We have to run it again!
Run it another time, man!

558
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,605
Fucking get off me, man.
I'm fucking bailing.

559
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,774
Please run it again.

560
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,610
- I can't. Get the fuck off me.
- Let's get out of here.

561
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,445
Where the fuck
are you going, Sandro?

562
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,618
- Let's get out of here!
- Goddamn it!

563
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,294
Come on, Max.

564
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,296
Get out of there! Let's go!

565
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:54,008
We gotta go! Come on, Max. Come on.

566
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,304
Hey, boss. We got a runner.

567
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,640
Locked on.

568
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,475
Fire!

569
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:15,780
Shit, man.

570
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,248
That's what I'm talking about!

571
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,833
Fuck, man!

572
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,877
Targets moving south-southwest.

573
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,379
Move, Max. It's coming.

574
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,178
We got another one.

575
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,596
Okay.

576
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,183
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.

577
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,485
Going into a holding pattern, sir.

578
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,071
Where do you think you're going?

579
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,449
Come on!

580
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,438
Fuck! Fucker!

581
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,611
Come on.

582
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,572
No!

583
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,529
No. No.

584
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,573
No.

585
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:14,584
Get up!

586
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,594
No!

587
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:46,532
We've got one assailant
leaving on foot, ma'am.

588
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,743
They have the data. Repeat:

589
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,914
The thieves have the data.
Apprehend the target at all costs.

590
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,208
Do not damage his brain.

591
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:58,044
Let's go! We got a runner, boys!

592
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:07,136
Citizen has suffered catastrophic
blood loss leading to cardiac arrest.

593
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,974
Time of death: 1745.

594
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:58,688
Come on, where are you hiding?
What's that?

595
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,783
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.

596
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,120
Fuck you, man! Find him!

597
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,956
Take us back to the crash site.
See what they left behind.

598
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,124
Roger that.

599
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,998
Hey, boss.
I think you'd better come look at this.

600
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,627
This is a record of what we picked up...

601
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,254
...in transfer between Carlyle
and the criminal, sir.

602
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,257
That's why she wants it so badly.

603
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:11,844
He's got the keys to the kingdom
in his fucking head.

604
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,806
Now we just need to find him.

605
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,726
I'm gonna let the girls out.

606
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,029
Searching grids three through 11 .

607
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,408
I'm authorizing a full containment order.

608
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,036
Issue a no-fly zone for Los Angeles.

609
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,289
- All of Los Angeles?
- The murderer is still out there.

610
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,876
Until we apprehend him,
no one leaves the surface of that city.

611
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,053
What the...?

612
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,892
Max.

613
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,770
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

614
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,772
We can go home.

615
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,233
Am I better?

616
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,238
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

617
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,451
Be right back.

618
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,625
Frey...

619
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:08,961
Max.

620
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,508
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

621
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,347
- Shit. Let me get the medics.
- No. No.

622
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,557
I can't go in there.

623
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,477
- Max, listen to me. You need a doctor.
- I can't go in there.

624
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,771
People are looking for me.
They'll kill me.

625
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,940
- I came for you. I need your help.
- Max.

626
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,651
You've got to go through the system
to get treatment.

627
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,905
Please help me. I don't wanna die.

628
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,869
Max.

629
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,164
Stay awake.

630
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,758
I wanna see the man.

631
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,887
Mommy's gonna help him, okay?
Try and sleep.

632
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,685
Don't sleep.

633
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,607
Come on.

634
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,110
Max, you can do it, come on.

635
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,613
Stay awake.

636
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,781
Let's turn you over.

637
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,706
Max. Max, wait.

638
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,794
Thank you.

639
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,254
Who did this to you?

640
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,549
Oh, no, I got...
I got hurt at work, and I had to...

641
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:23,721
I had to take a job from Spider
to try to get up there and get healed.

642
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,264
It went bad.

643
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,475
- I'm in trouble.
- Mommy?

644
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,189
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

645
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,613
Who's that man?

646
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,451
His name is Max. Mommy knew him
when he was your age.

647
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:47,119
This is Matilda.

648
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,622
Hi.

649
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:54,585
You can go watch cartoons, okay?
I'll be right there.

650
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,631
I didn't-- I didn't know you had...

651
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,967
- I'm so sorry. I need to go.
- Wait, Max. Wait.

652
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,345
- Don't leave. Wait.
- I shouldn't have come here.

653
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:08,641
Max. She's dying.
She's in the final stages of leukemia.

654
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,477
I told you my life was complicated.

655
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:15,940
I need you to help me.
I have no idea how to do this.

656
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,150
- How to do what?
- Get her to Elysium.

657
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,237
- I can't help her. I would...
- Max.

658
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,157
- I would if I could.
- What about this? Fake citizenship.

659
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,327
If you took her there,
could you heal her with this?

660
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:31,330
It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me.

661
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,998
It's locked to my DNA.

662
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,000
These people
who are looking for me--

663
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,711
You don't understand
who these people are.

664
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,172
If they find me here,
they will kill all of us.

665
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,342
The only thing I can do to help you
is leave, I promise you.

666
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,846
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.

667
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,687
You have bandages.

668
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:58,774
Yeah, I got bandages.

669
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,782
- What are you doing?
- I don't want you to be sick.

670
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,369
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- No--

671
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,707
There once was a meerkat
who lived in the jungle.

672
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,877
He was hungry, but he was small.

673
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:23,132
So small. And the other big animals
had all the food...

674
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,718
...because they could reach the fruits.

675
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,888
So he made friends
with a hippopotamus to--

676
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,306
Okay, stop.

677
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,602
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

678
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:40,900
Yes, it does, because he can stand
on the hippopotamus's back...

679
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,320
...to get all the fruits that he wants.

680
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,113
What's in it for the hippo?

681
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,407
The hippo wants a friend.

682
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,926
I'm sorry.

683
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,298
Hey, boss.

684
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,636
I think we got him.

685
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,977
Land this fucking craft.

686
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,006
- Mommy, is everything okay?
- It's okay, sweetie.

687
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,808
Clear.

688
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:41,729
It's okay, sweetie.

689
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,648
Afternoon.

690
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,192
Sorry to come bursting into your home.

691
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,863
I didn't mean to traumatize
your young daughter.

692
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,532
Me and the boys here...

693
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,618
...we're looking
for a young gentleman...

694
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,078
...who was in this very house
a moment ago.

695
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,415
We're hoping you can tell us
where he went.

696
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:05,628
No. I...

697
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,048
I don't know where he is.

698
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:14,470
I don't believe in committing violent acts
in front of kids...

699
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,056
...so I just need you to
close your eyes, sweetheart.

700
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,183
It's okay, sweetie. it's okay.

701
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:22,144
I really need you to tell me.

702
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,980
Where is he? You remember now?

703
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,565
- Mommy.
- Close your eyes.

704
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,193
Keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep your eyes closed.

705
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:30,903
Please, I don't know where he is.

706
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:34,948
He was wounded.
I helped him and he left.

707
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,408
Please.

708
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:39,745
Do you fucking hate that?
No loyalty nowadays, eh?

709
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,124
It's okay, sweetie.

710
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:48,087
And what's this here? This a hospital
you running here? What's going on?

711
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,173
- She's sick.
- She's sick?

712
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,342
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.

713
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:57,763
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct there, eh?

714
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:59,181
I said don't touch her!

715
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:03,435
I'm trying to get a word with your child.
If you give me a second. Bring her. Come.

716
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,146
- Where are you taking us?
- I've got something you want.

717
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,398
- It's okay.
- Mommy.

718
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,274
It's okay, sweetie. it's okay.

719
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,693
Sit down. Shut up.

720
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,000
Stop.

721
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,129
Hey, hey, hey.

722
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,132
No, no, no.
Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.

723
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,175
Put the guns down. Let him come.

724
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,971
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?

725
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,808
That's why they shut down the sky.
Come on. What is it? Wire transfers?

726
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,102
Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big.

727
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,562
I fucking got nothing, man.

728
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:50,149
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me.

729
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,317
- Let's go fucking now!
- We can't!

730
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,737
The flight system is jammed!

731
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,655
Nobody is going up there.

732
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,327
- Till when?
- Till I don't fucking know.

733
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:06,373
- I gotta get up there, man. I gotta fucking get up there
- Oh, everyone needs to get up there.

734
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:09,042
My guys are working to see
if we have a hope in hell...

735
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,337
...which I personally think we do not,
of ever getting back online.

736
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,174
But for now...

737
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:18,010
...let's just take a look
at that head of yours.

738
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,346
- Get away from me, man.
- Just look at me.

739
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:27,352
If they shut down the whole fucking sky
for what's in your head...

740
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:32,191
...maybe the key to opening it
could be in there too, right?

741
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,235
Come on.

742
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,742
All right.

743
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:54,713
They will hunt you
to the edge of the Earth for this.

744
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,298
What is it?

745
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,051
It's a reboot program for Elysium.

746
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:03,931
Whoever has this has the power
to override their whole system.

747
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,809
Open the borders.

748
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,979
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.

749
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:17,361
This can save your life.

750
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,739
We can save everyone.

751
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,074
When can I go?

752
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,827
They're trying to hack through
the signal jam, but soon.

753
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,414
- Don't bullshit me. When can we go?
- I don't know. 5 days.

754
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:32,084
Fuck you. I don't have 5 days.

755
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,169
- I got hours.
- My guys are working on it.

756
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:37,673
You're always working on it man.
You can't get me up there.

757
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,926
I don't even know why try sending people up there man?
They just get fucking shot down.

758
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,595
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about.

759
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,015
We would control the system here.
We would be in charge.

760
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,601
We can change the course
of fucking history here.

761
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,103
Back up, then.

762
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:55,524
What I have in my head
is worth a lot to them, right?

763
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,527
Don't do this.

764
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:02,364
If that falls into the wrong hands,
they could shut us out for good.

765
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,450
Listen, man,
I'm going up there right now.

766
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:10,122
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed,
you can have all of this.

767
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,208
- But I'm not fucking dying.
- This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.

768
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,682
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

769
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:37,024
It's okay. it's okay.

770
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,905
I always wanted a wife.

771
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,202
I just couldn't quite settle down,
you know.

772
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,122
Too much temptation.

773
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,127
But you...

774
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,635
You make me ready to settle down.

775
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,262
You really make me wanna
settle down, baby.

776
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,276
Holy shit, sir.

777
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,071
- You better take a look at this.
- What? What is it?

778
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,531
Check this fucking oke.

779
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:30,786
Turn us around.

780
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,479
- Drakey?
- Yes?

781
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,939
Open the door.

782
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,744
Stop right there!

783
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:17,249
You're gonna do exactly what I say
or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off!

784
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,794
- You understand?
- Yeah.

785
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,255
You can have everything in my head!

786
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,758
Just take me up there
and get me in a med bay!

787
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,428
What I have is very valuable!

788
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,805
We can fix you up.

789
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,058
Put you in a med bay,
sort all this kak up.

790
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:39,021
Let's go. We'll take you up there.

791
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,190
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.

792
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,651
Lekker, you'll dig it.

793
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,529
Don't you fucking try anything.

794
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,658
Step aboard. Come meet the boys.
Come, boet.

795
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:54,286
Don't be shy. They won't bite.

796
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,997
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey.

797
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,499
- This is Max.
- How is it, butch?

798
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,626
Close up, Drakey.

799
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,587
Copy that.

800
01:13:10,178 --> 01:13:11,970
Crowe, let's go.

801
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:19,061
Yes, ma'am.
We apprehended the subject.

802
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,229
Open the skies, we're coming home.

803
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,482
I'll expect you in 19 minutes.

804
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,164
Cancel the no-fly zone.

805
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,999
Yes, ma'am.

806
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,461
What?

807
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,631
What is that? What is that?
Are we back?

808
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:51,176
- What the fuck is that? Are we back?
- We're back online, Spider.

809
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,564
Frey.

810
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:08,777
I'm sorry. I'm gonna make this right.

811
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,040
We've got him.

812
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,416
All right. Where is he?

813
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:27,087
He's leaving Earth,
heading to Elysium.

814
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:37,514
Manuel, Rico.
Get weapons. Let's get up there.

815
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,315
Echo Leader 234
requesting landing in Sector 22.

816
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,569
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234.
You are cleared for entry.

817
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,963
- I see you got the G-19.
- Hey, back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.

818
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,340
- Or what?
- I'll let it go.

819
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,966
What you gonna do, huh?

820
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,469
I want what's in your head, boykie.

821
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,888
Come on. Come on.

822
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,848
Legs! Grab his legs!

823
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,025
Grab the grenade!

824
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,693
Hold on!

825
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,533
Get down!

826
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,368
- What do you want us to do maam?
- I want everyone...

827
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:06,496
...coming out of that vehicle
apprehended by Homeland Security.

828
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:10,041
Evacuate everyone under Level 5
clearance out of the building now.

829
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,883
Matilda!

830
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,593
I warned you of this.

831
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:24,055
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed,
potentially threatening the torus.

832
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:28,351
All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.

833
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,731
- Get your hands off of me.
- This is an act of war.

834
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,775
That puts the CCB under my control.

835
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,236
Now, if you'd let me do my job...

836
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,906
...I'm sure you have
a fundraiser to attend.

837
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,575
Let's go, sir.

838
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,958
Why are you not answering me?

839
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,630
Max.

840
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:01,968
- Take me out of here, Max!
- Yeah. I'm trying!

841
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,347
Air quality reaching toxic levels.

842
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,937
Get me out of here.

843
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,524
It is recommended
you exit the craft immediately.

844
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,121
- Run!
- Come here, you fucker.

845
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,848
Two illegals heading northeast
in Zone 3.

846
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:00,318
You deal with those two.
I'll handle this poes.

847
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,906
Welcome to this spectacular property,
sprawling over...

848
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,294
Error.

849
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:22,424
- No.
- No citizen detected.

850
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:29,347
Please. She's sick. Help us.
She's gone into a coma. Please.

851
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,709
Shouldn't we remove this thing?

852
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:02,172
Can't, till we get all the data.
It's wired into him neurologically.

853
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,007
The data is intact, yes?

854
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:06,426
Data looks intact.

855
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,094
Warning.

856
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,972
We can still pull the data out of him,
which will kill him.

857
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:15,602
Oh, that's fine. How long before you can
download and turn the system online?

858
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,061
Not long, ma'am.

859
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:20,732
Keep everything in a restricted cloud.
Lock down all access.

860
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,066
Starting prep right now.

861
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,572
And get these two out of here.

862
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,407
Roger that.

863
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,410
Crowe, you wanna go get
the boss's chicks?

864
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,412
Yeah, boet.

865
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:02,941
Give them the run around.
Keep them busy.

866
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:07,904
Got him.

867
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,447
Let's go.

868
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:12,867
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy.
You ready?

869
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,912
What are you taking out of him?

870
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,290
Hey. What are you doing to him?

871
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:21,501
What's gonna happen to him? Hey.

872
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,462
Rise and shine.

873
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:26,631
- Get up.
- Max.

874
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,217
Max. Max!

875
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,135
Max!

876
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,651
Get in there.

877
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,324
Away.

878
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,580
Boss got fucked up, eh?

879
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,873
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?

880
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:08,047
His brain is fine, but he's gonna
be pissed when he wakes up, eh?

881
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:11,509
Remember the kak that happened
in India when he lost his legs.

882
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:36,618
Kruger.

883
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,747
Hey, boss.

884
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,167
It's Crowe.

885
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,255
Where is he?

886
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,841
All right. We're all set.

887
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:54,177
Okay. Let's re-sedate him.

888
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,097
Got the needle prepped.
Here, you wanna grab this and then--

889
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,892
Grab the needle! Grab the needle!
Stick him with it!

890
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,581
- Where did they take the girls?
- The armory.

891
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,960
- Where the fuck is that?
- Level 3.

892
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,720
Lethal radiation poisoning detected.

893
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,848
You require urgent medical attention.

894
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:51,526
You idiot.
Do you realize what you've done?

895
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:56,197
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle
into a suburban area.

896
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:01,452
Your orders were to keep this covert.

897
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,831
Do you even remember
what that means?

898
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,794
Have you completely lost your mind?

899
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,462
You're useless to me.

900
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,465
If the administration realized
what we're doing...

901
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,926
...they'd hang us both for treason.

902
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,973
For God's sake, Kruger,
are you listening to me?

903
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,476
Yes.

904
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,646
Yes, ma'am...

905
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:30,648
...I'm listening.

906
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:37,488
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle
and ruined someone's lawn.

907
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,241
But nobody is gonna hang us
for treason.

908
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,493
We do the hanging.

909
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:48,541
Put your hand on it.
Keep pressure on it.

910
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,294
Not so chirpy now, eh?

911
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:55,840
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about
to get its first proper president.

912
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,889
She needs some medical attention.

913
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,022
I was gonna heal your daughter.

914
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,567
But now I will make sure
that she is never healed.

915
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,362
Drakey, don't trust
any of these politicians.

916
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:22,450
- You clear out this whole building.
- Thank you, boss.

917
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:26,037
I'm gonna find that little gangster
and I'm gonna take what's in his head.

918
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,581
This place is mine now.

919
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:32,043
You wanna come to my fucking house
and play? Let's play.

920
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,421
I'm going to annihilate
that little motherfucker.

921
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,049
I'm going to pulverize that little one.

922
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,055
Hey!

923
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:53,648
What the hell was that?

924
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:59,570
All members of CCB,
please go to the nearest exit...

925
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:02,240
...and proceed calmly to ground level.

926
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,289
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go!

927
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,876
No.

928
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:16,504
No more.

929
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,928
Citizen deceased.

930
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:39,944
Please exercise caution.
Illegals detected in multiple locations.

931
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:45,658
Emergency systems are now online.
Please follow indicated procedures.

932
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,787
Spider. Do you read me, Spider?

933
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,122
Max, where are you?

934
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,458
The thing in my head, it can make
everyone a citizen here, right?

935
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:58,963
- Yeah.
- You know how to get it out, right?

936
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,882
- Yes.
- You're sure?

937
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,800
Yeah, I'm sure.

938
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,176
Okay, listen to me carefully.

939
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,061
Armory selected.

940
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,076
Set.

941
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,207
Turn me on.

942
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,380
Okay.

943
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:47,261
- Crowe, get rid of those two.
- My pleasure, boss. My pleasure.

944
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:49,597
Where are you, boykie?
Where are you?

945
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,451
How is it, girl?

946
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,579
- Let's play.
- No.

947
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,457
- Come on. I'll be nice, I'll be gentle, I promise.
- No, please.

948
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,417
- Come on.
- Get off me.

949
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,002
- Want me to hurt the girl?
- No.

950
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,629
- Then come here.
- Please.

951
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,244
Oh, fuck!

952
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,125
You fucker!

953
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,341
The only way out of here
is through me.

954
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,452
- Is she alive?
- For now.

955
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,203
Stay behind me.

956
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,124
I'm gonna get you out of here.

957
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,001
I have a plan.

958
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:50,301
You hear that sound?
That's the sound of me coming for you.

959
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,805
I will find you! I will hunt you down!

960
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,226
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up.
- What?

961
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:02,188
Listen. You're gonna go to
the surface, okay? Take this.

962
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,690
All right. Find a house.
Get her to a med bay.

963
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,734
- It won't work.
- Don't stop for anybody.

964
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:12,031
- She doesn't have an ID. it doesn't work.
- It will this time. I know how to fix it.

965
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:13,699
- Surface selected.
- Go.

966
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,368
- Come with me.
- I'm right behind you.

967
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,662
- No.
- I promise.

968
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:42,186
Okay. A mother and a daughter
just went up in that elevator right there.

969
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,688
They're going to the surface,
they're headed for a med bay.

970
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:48,734
Send one of your guys, make sure
they get there, and we have our deal.

971
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:49,944
All right.

972
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,905
Right to a med bay, man.

973
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:55,908
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

974
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,249
- Go, go, go.
- This way. Come on.

975
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,709
- Come on. This way.
- Hurry up, man.

976
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:09,547
Emergency lockdown initiated.

977
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:12,883
Almost there. Almost there.

978
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:22,101
Pull it out! it's just a flesh wound, boet.

979
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,405
That's what I'm talking about.

980
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,454
- Fire has been detected. All affected...
- Open the door. Open the door.

981
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,665
...areas will be shut down.

982
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,544
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Go, go, go.

983
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,423
Let's go.

984
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,929
Fucking door, come on. Go.
You first, come on.

985
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,973
Emergency lockdown initiated.

986
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:03,601
- Please stand clear of all exits.
- Come on.

987
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,443
Get up. Get up.
Come on, let's go. Stand up.

988
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,529
Come on. Stand up.
Stand up. Come on.

989
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,701
Come on. Stand up.

990
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:22,494
Hey.

991
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:32,129
You little fucker.

992
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,299
I'm gonna take your fucking head off.

993
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:37,384
You should definitely stand up now!

994
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,035
Stay there.

995
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,875
Fuck.

996
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:17,591
Okay.

997
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:39,530
- You think you can get through me?
- Come on, Max! Come on!

998
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:41,240
I'm just getting started.

999
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,145
Come on.

1000
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,565
Don't give up now. Get up. Come.

1001
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,985
Come on, you've got
more than that. I know you.

1002
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:20,404
You look a little bit dizzy, eh?

1003
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:26,410
Did I get you? Are you bleeding?
You must get that looked at.

1004
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:27,995
Eh, boykie?

1005
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:43,260
You wanna heal that little girl?

1006
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:46,055
You just need to come through me.

1007
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,821
You've got some fire in you, boykie.

1008
01:35:21,091 --> 01:35:22,883
You almost had me.

1009
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:25,177
We die together, boykie.

1010
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:37,981
Okay. Okay.

1011
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,651
Okay. Come on, man. Let's go.

1012
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,912
Let's go, man. Let's do it. Come on.

1013
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,839
Okay. Let's go.

1014
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:07,428
Get the door!

1015
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:14,685
Come on.

1016
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,188
All right. Let's do it.

1017
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,710
All right.

1018
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:47,134
Okay, we're good. We're good.
We're good.

1019
01:36:47,886 --> 01:36:48,927
What?

1020
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,183
Max?

1021
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,393
It's okay. I know.

1022
01:36:57,604 --> 01:36:59,396
There's no coming back from this.

1023
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,982
No med bay can heal you.

1024
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:17,831
All right. Give it to me.

1025
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,127
Take it.

1026
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:27,758
Okay. You just have to
press that button.

1027
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,263
Frey.

1028
01:37:34,724 --> 01:37:37,017
Max? Max, where are you?

1029
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,520
I'm gonna have to break my promise.

1030
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,356
I can't make it back up there.

1031
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,859
You remember what I said
when we were kids?

1032
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,110
Yes.

1033
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,781
- I'll take us there one day.
- Really?

1034
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,157
Yeah, I promise.

1035
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,795
You wouldn't believe
what I'm looking at right now.

1036
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,556
Tell Matilda I really liked her story.

1037
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,099
And I...

1038
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:21,687
I figured out why the hippo did it.

1039
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,216
Come on.

1040
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,177
You first. Come on.

1041
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,347
Everyone has one special thing, Max.

1042
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,517
One thing that they are destined to do.

1043
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:03,729
One thing they were born for.

1044
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,570
- Neutralize him.
- Fuck you!

1045
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:21,371
Let go of me.

1046
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,553
Come on.

1047
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:00,911
Hey, chiquita.

1048
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:08,752
Hey.

1049
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,424
Stand down, officers.

1050
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,936
- Arrest him!
- I cannot arrest a citizen of Elysium.

1051
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:30,315
- What?
- You did a great job.

1052
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:34,111
Guess who Elysium belongs to now.

1053
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:32,544
You see how beautiful it looks to us
from here?

1054
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:36,214
Now look how beautiful
we look from there.

1055
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:38,216
This is yours now.

1056
01:41:39,135 --> 01:41:42,846
To never forget about
where you come from.

1057
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:56,902
My little Max.
