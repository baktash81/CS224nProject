<i>The latest ceasefire came too late
to save these villages ...</i>

3
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,660
<i>Today President Clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo ...</i>

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,300
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,
why do I hate all the Tutsi,</i>

5
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,140
<i>I say, "Read our history."</i>

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,020
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.</i>

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,940
<i>They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.</i>

8
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,980
<i>Now they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.</i>

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,180
<i>They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.</i>

10
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,660
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.
We are the majority.</i>

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,140
<i>They are a minority of traitors
and invaders.</i>

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,780
<i>We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

Watch your neighbours.</i>

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,220
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

16
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,940
Thank you.

17
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,300
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

18
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,260
Wonderful. Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello.

19
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,380
Good to see you gentlemen.

20
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,420
Ah, that is a fine cigar, sir.

21
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,700
This is a Cohiba cigar.

22
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,580
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?!

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,780
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,420
What do you mean, sir?

25
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,940
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

26
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,780
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

27
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,380
straight from Havana, Cuba ...
Hey, that is style, Dube.

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,140
Style.

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,580
Cohiba ... a fantastic cigar.

30
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,700
The best, eh?

31
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,300
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

32
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,060
I will try my best, George,

33
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,580
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

34
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,900
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

35
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,300
And money.

36
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,500
It's time for you
to join your people.

37
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,260
Thank you, George.

38
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,980
But time is also money.

39
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,980
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,820
along with the regular order.

41
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,380
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

42
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,420
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,940
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

45
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,580
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

46
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,300
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra.

47
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,340
Thank you.

48
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,060
A bargain buy from China ...
ten cents each.

49
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,380
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

50
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,260
At least.

51
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,820
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

52
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,620
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

53
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,940
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

54
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,180
Their time is soon over.

55
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,140
Anyway, this is business.

56
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,340
- Oh, no. It's the Interahamwe.
- Do as they say. Pull over.

57
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

58
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,660
Smile, Dube. Don't attract
attention to yourself.

59
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,500
Some of these men are my neighbours.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

60
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,980
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

61
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,980
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,340
What are you doing here?

63
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,940
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power, Hutu power!

64
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,980
Okay. Yes!

65
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,380
Get out of here.

66
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,260
There's water coming from the box.

67
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,420
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

68
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,860
Gregoire, please help with this water.

69
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,260
Gregoire!

70
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,900
Deal with this right away.

71
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,740
Dube, this is the lobby.

73
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,340
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

74
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,140
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

75
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

76
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,060
All right.

77
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,740
But save the shells.

78
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,220
Fill them with ...

79
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,180
... a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

80
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,860
- Cassava?
- And ... the fish.

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,020
- And tipali.
- Yes.

82
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,740
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

83
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
Dube.

84
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
Style, sir.

85
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,620
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,260
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,340
that the Interahamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

88
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,820
Colonel, the U.N. need not worry
about the Interahamwe.

89
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,060
We will control them.

90
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,220
- General.
- Aah, Paul.

91
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
This scotch is exceptional.

92
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,980
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

93
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,820
Colonel Oliver,
it is a pleasure to see you, sir.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,820
Good to see you, Paul.

95
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,260
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

96
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,220
It is spectacular ...
straight off the plane.

97
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,060
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

98
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,100
Thank you.

99
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,940
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

100
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,340
Excuse me, gentlemen.

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,580
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

102
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

103
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,980
Good afternoon, ladies.

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,500
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

105
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,820
Yes, sir.

Hello, Mr. Paul.

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,860
Hello, Jeremiah.

115
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,420
Hello, sir.

116
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,620
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

117
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,660
See you soon.

118
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,580
So your brother
and the girls are here.

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,820
Yes.

120
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,940
One, two, three ...

121
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,820
Oh, Carine!

122
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,340
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

123
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,780
One, two, three ...

124
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,540
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

125
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,300
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

126
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,460
Hey, Papa, watch this.

127
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,660
Oh, my goodness. Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

128
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,340
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

129
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,380
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

130
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,460
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

131
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,740
Let's go in.

132
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,780
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

133
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,900
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

134
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,620
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

135
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,140
- What?
- There are soldiers.

136
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,660
- Where?
- On the street.

137
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,300
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

138
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,900
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

139
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,300
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

140
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,980
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

141
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,980
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any ...

142
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,180
- What is it?
- Shut up!

143
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,820
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

144
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,740
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

145
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,580
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, Captain.

146
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,100
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

147
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,500
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi fuckers.

148
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,020
No! No!

149
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,380
We must do something.

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,060
- Do what?
- Call someone.

151
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm not going. I'm not going.

152
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
No!

153
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,820
Get him in the truck. Now!

154
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,540
We must do something.

155
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,580
Please help him!

156
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,980
Oh, Victor!

157
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,460
Victor!

158
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,340
There is nothing we can do.

159
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,060
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

160
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,660
No!

161
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,380
Why would they arrest Victor?

162
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,340
He has no politics.

163
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,780
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

164
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,020
Who knows?

165
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,820
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

166
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,780
Happens all the time now.

167
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,460
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

168
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,660
It wouldn't help.

169
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,900
You could ask as a favour.

170
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,060
No, I could not.

171
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,940
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

172
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,700
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favours

173
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,300
<i>so if there is a time
when we need help,</i>

174
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,340
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

175
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,660
But Victor was a good neighbor.

176
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,860
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

177
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,500
Please, please,
leave these things to my good judgment.

178
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,860
This assignment is bullshit.

179
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,860
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

180
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,300
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Mille Collines.

181
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,500
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

182
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,340
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,500
Anything that you need,
please find me.

184
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,900
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

185
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,060
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

186
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,340
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

187
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,260
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

188
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,740
How?

189
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,020
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

190
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,060
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

191
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,580
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

192
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,860
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

193
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,140
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

194
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,340
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

195
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,140
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

196
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,420
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

197
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,580
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

198
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,540
So what are you, Paul?

199
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
I am Hutu.

200
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,260
Gentlemen.

201
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,660
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

202
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,980
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

203
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,260
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

204
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,020
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

205
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,940
They could be twins.

206
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,500
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

207
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,540
Okay.

208
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,580
I'm in room 22. I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

209
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,260
<i>Senior U.N. Officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

210
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,460
<i>and arming the Hutu militia
called the Interahamwe.</i>

211
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,820
<i>I put this claim to the head
of the armed forces, Gereral Bizimungu.</i>

212
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,420
<i>No. No, we have not been
training the militia.</i>

213
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,380
<i>The U.N. are mistaken
in this accusation.</i>

214
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,940
<i>Do you support your president's
agreement to make peace with the rebels?</i>

215
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,340
<i>The president has
the full support of the army.</i>

216
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,300
<i>That peace agreement will
be signed today in Tanzania</i>

217
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,580
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyanimara.</i>

218
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,340
This is a great day for Rwanda

219
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,260
and for all of Africa.

220
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,860
Negotiation has replaced confrontation ...

221
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,340
Paul, have a drink.

222
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,140
Friendship has replaced fear.

223
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

224
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,260
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

225
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,620
To our president.
May he find peace.

226
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,260
May we all find peace.

227
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,780
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

228
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,060
To peace!

229
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,220
Peace!

230
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,580
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

231
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,100
I am planning on returning there as ...
Forgive me.

232
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

233
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
- Hello, Fedens.
- Paul.

234
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,260
Well, this is a surprise.

235
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,660
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

236
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,380
Yes, what's wrong?

237
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,180
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

238
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,300
Who?

239
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
Thank you, Sullivan.

240
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,540
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man.

241
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,540
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

242
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,020
Give me this man's name.

243
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,540
Please, Paul, even though
he is Interahamwe, he's a friend.

244
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,340
He wants your job, Thomas.

245
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,340
He said that
there is a signal.

246
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,860
It is "Cut the tall trees."

247
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,540
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

248
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,380
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,340
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

250
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,260
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

251
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,100
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

252
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,780
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

253
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,300
The world press are watching.

254
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,100
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work ...

255
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,660
What was that?

256
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,020
Power cuts.

257
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,380
We are running on generators.

258
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,180
Fedens ...

259
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,820
Please, don't worry.

260
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,500
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

261
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,820
All right?

262
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,300
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

263
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,860
Shit!

264
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,300
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

265
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,380
Everybody stay in your house!

266
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,900
Tatiana?

267
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,660
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

268
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,780
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

269
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,540
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

270
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,780
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

271
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,580
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

272
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,900
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

273
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,740
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

274
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,660
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

275
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,500
Odette, please.

276
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,700
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes. I told them to go home.

277
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,100
- Go and call them, Tatsi.
- I've tried. Our phones, they do not work.

278
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,100
- Why do the neighbours run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

279
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,700
You are a Tutsi.

280
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,900
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

281
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,700
These are probably rumours
started by agitators.

282
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,500
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

283
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,380
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

284
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,620
Gone? Gone where?

285
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,180
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.
- Where has he gone, Elys?

286
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,380
He went next door.

287
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,020
Wait. Paul!

288
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,980
Tatiana, no. You have to
stay here with the children.

289
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,860
- Stay in the house. No!
- Please.

290
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,780
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

291
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,660
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

293
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,900
Paul?

294
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,540
Oh, Tatsi.

295
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,700
Odette, Odette!

296
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,740
Oh, no.

297
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,180
I'm okay.

298
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,580
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

299
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,780
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

300
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,140
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

301
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,740
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

302
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,300
Where is he hurt?

303
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Look here, Odette, look here.

304
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,420
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

305
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,700
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

306
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,100
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

307
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,260
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

308
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,660
Roger, you're okay.

309
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,380
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

310
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,780
This is not his blood, Paul.

311
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,340
You are not hurt.

312
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,660
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

313
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,580
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

314
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,620
Come here, Elys.

315
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,060
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

316
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,780
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

317
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,460
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

318
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,140
It's okay.

319
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,300
I love you so much.
I love you.

320
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,580
Oh, son.

321
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,260
Paul.

322
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,620
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.
Terrible news ...</i>

323
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,580
<i>- It is true.
- Horrible news ...</i>

324
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,140
<i>Our great president
is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

325
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,140
Oh, my God!

326
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,900
<i>They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.</i>

327
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,500
<i>Then they shot his plane
from the sky.</i>

328
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,620
<i>It is time to clean the brush,
good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

329
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,780
<i>Cut the tall trees now!</i>

330
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,260
The soldiers are here!

331
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,180
<i>- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.
- No, no.</i>

332
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,660
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

333
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,060
<i>Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.</i>

334
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,540
Split up.
Everybody out.

335
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,900
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

336
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,860
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

337
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,780
I better go have a word with them.

338
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,660
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

339
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,700
Yes, sir!

340
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,340
Who's in charge here?

341
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,540
You.

342
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,020
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

343
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,860
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

344
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,900
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

345
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,020
Get out!

346
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
Get out of here!

347
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,660
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

348
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,180
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

349
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,380
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

350
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,780
I used to work at the Diplomat.

351
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,460
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

352
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,860
You must open it.
Let's go.

353
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,340
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

354
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,940
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

355
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,180
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

356
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,820
I cannot take all these people.

357
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,780
No, no, sir,
you do not have to.

358
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,540
We have our car
and our van.

359
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,220
<i>- Captain Kaliso, come on.
- Roger.</i>

360
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,540
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

361
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,820
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

362
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,420
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

363
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,700
Oh, Jesus, no!

364
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,060
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

365
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,140
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
Don't look, Tatiana.

366
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,700
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

367
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,940
Look at this. Beer.

368
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,620
I've got them.

369
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,260
Get down, all of you!

370
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,780
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

371
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,020
Traitor!

372
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,940
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

373
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,900
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

374
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,220
Shoot them.

375
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,700
Shoot them.

376
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,900
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

377
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,940
It's easy.

378
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,940
Shoot them, or you die first.

379
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,340
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

380
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,180
You wanna pay me?

381
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,540
Why not?
Look at them.

382
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,340
These are not rebels.

383
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,620
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

384
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,220
- How much?
- You name a price.

385
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,420
10,000 francs for each.

386
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,820
- Sir, I don't have that much.
- Okay.

387
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,780
Wait, wait! Here.

388
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,140
It's 1,000 U.S.
And here.

389
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,540
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

390
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,740
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

391
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,100
Go, go, go.

392
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,980
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

393
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,180
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

394
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,700
Sir, I have more money actually.

395
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,780
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

396
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,940
All right?

397
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,500
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

398
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,340
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

399
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,300
Here you are. See?

400
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,020
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

401
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,700
Sir ...

402
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,980
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

403
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,780
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

404
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,740
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

405
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,140
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U.N.

406
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,700
Sir, I swear.
100,000 francs.

407
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,140
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

408
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,700
Please, sir. Please.

409
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,500
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

410
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,300
Come on now. Hurry.

411
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,180
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

412
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,260
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

413
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,540
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you ...

414
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,700
Here's the money.

415
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,140
100,000 francs as promised.

416
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,100
Now please, let them go, sir.

417
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,300
Take the money.
We will get them later.

418
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,140
- You can go.
- Thank you.

419
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,180
Traitor.

420
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,820
Thank you, Paul.

421
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,860
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

422
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,180
- You must tell him when he comes ...
- Here he is, sir.

423
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,540
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

424
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,420
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

425
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,580
It's okay, it's okay.

426
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,260
<i>There were no survivors in last night's
plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

427
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,060
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

428
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,380
Come, Tatsi.

429
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,780
Andre, I need two suites.

430
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,060
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

431
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,140
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

432
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,980
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbours?

433
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,580
What will they do?

434
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,300
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

435
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,100
Please ... put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

436
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,580
Right away, sir.

437
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,900
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

438
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,220
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

439
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,060
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

440
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,380
This mess is unacceptable.

441
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,420
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

442
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,580
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

443
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,540
Operator, I need a line.

444
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,380
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

445
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,060
You did not reach them?

446
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,180
<i>It is a very terse situation,
and I just want to assure the families</i>

447
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,260
<i>of those who are there that we are
doing everything we possibly can</i>

448
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,780
<i>to try to ensure
the safety of our citizens there.</i>

449
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,020
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

450
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,660
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

451
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,140
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

452
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,060
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

453
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,380
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

454
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,500
Dube, where is Gregoire?

455
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,100
Sir, he has moved
into the Presidential Suite.

456
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,300
Mr. Manager.

457
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,100
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

458
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,500
Who is it?

459
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,620
It's okay, darling.

460
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,660
What do you want?

461
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,100
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

462
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,300
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

463
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,460
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

464
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,660
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

465
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,020
If I were to leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

466
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,140
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

467
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,940
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

468
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,020
Are you used to the smell?

469
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,780
Well, not me.

470
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,980
I need a clean room
to escape it.

471
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,620
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

472
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,900
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

473
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,500
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

474
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,660
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

475
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,420
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.

476
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,020
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

477
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,540
There are eight of us.

478
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,060
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

479
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,260
Yes, Madame Archer.

480
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,140
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

481
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,300
Okay, come on, let's go.

482
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,660
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

483
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
Come.

484
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,660
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

485
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,540
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly.

486
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,420
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

487
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,740
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

488
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,060
Madame Archer.

489
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,820
I have a favour to ask of you.

490
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,260
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St. Francis.

491
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
On O'Clare, 20.

492
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,300
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

493
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,300
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

494
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,860
Please, keep moving!

495
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,020
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

496
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,860
Please move into the hotel!

497
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,500
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

498
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,180
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

499
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,140
Has he spoken to you yet?

500
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,140
No.

501
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,300
Is your face still hurting?

502
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,420
It's all right.

503
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,300
The neighbours asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

504
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,900
I shouldn't have brought them here.

505
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,020
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

506
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,820
was to never, never lower
the tone of the hotel.

507
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,940
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul."

508
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,460
Soon all of this will be over.

509
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,940
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

510
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Oh, my God!

511
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,980
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

512
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,140
Take care of them.

513
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,460
How, sir?

514
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,140
Bathe them, feed them.

515
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,780
Put them to bed.

516
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,340
I will send you some help.

517
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,660
Okay, babies.

518
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,140
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

519
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,620
Will the U.N. intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

520
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,660
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

521
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,300
My orders are
not to intervene.

522
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,060
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

523
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,780
Here. Over here.

524
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,820
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

525
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,100
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

526
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,420
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

527
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

528
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,620
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

529
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,460
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

530
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,300
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

531
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,740
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

532
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,380
Let's go.

533
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,980
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

534
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,780
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

535
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
This is not a refugee camp.

536
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,340
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

537
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,580
No, I can't do that, Paul.
I'm sorry.

538
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,060
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

539
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,620
I'm under attack, constant attack.

540
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,420
As soon as we can stabilise
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

541
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,740
<i>... and stop the Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.</i>

542
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,140
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge
called Makesa is hiding at 4 ...</i>

543
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,860
<i>... Kabulla and his cockroaches ...
- Turn that radio off.</i>

544
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,180
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

545
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,300
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

546
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,020
I am your boss!

547
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,700
<i>Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines
in Rwanda on line one.</i>

548
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,180
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

549
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,340
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

550
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,420
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr. Tillens.

551
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,140
Ah, yes. Paul, I remember.

552
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,900
How are things there?

553
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,140
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

554
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,460
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

555
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,500
until this unrest is over.

556
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,060
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?</i>

557
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,500
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

558
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,660
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

559
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,860
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

560
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,900
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

561
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,140
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

562
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,980
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

563
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,220
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

564
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,140
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

565
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,900
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

566
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

567
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,620
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

568
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,340
for you to perform your duties?

569
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,620
In fact, forget this letter.

570
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,580
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

571
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,060
Please, everyone, back to work.

572
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,580
Paul, thank you for coming.

573
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,020
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

574
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,900
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

575
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,980
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

576
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,340
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

577
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,820
Thank you, Paul.

578
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,220
You're an oasis in the desert.

579
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,660
<i>... the elements of
the government and army</i>

580
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,300
<i>are following the example of what
happened to the Americans in Somalia.</i>

581
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:30,020
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,
try to attack us, and ...</i>

582
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,540
<i>hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.</i>

583
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,940
<i>- Do you think they'll succeed?
- No, they won't.</i>

584
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,340
<i>The U.N.'s here to stay.</i>

585
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,980
<i>What about
the outbreak of violence</i>

586
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,940
<i>since the shooting down
of the president's plane?</i>

587
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,700
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

588
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,660
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

589
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,420
What is this?

590
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,020
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

591
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,300
Fred, it's David.

592
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,100
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

593
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,700
Dead bodies, machetes.

594
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,820
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

595
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,780
Yeah.

596
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,500
You have to lead with this.

597
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
I point at you, you do a shot.

598
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,580
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking ...

599
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,580
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

600
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,260
Listen, sorry about earlier.

601
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,820
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have ...

602
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,540
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

603
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,540
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

604
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,860
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

605
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,340
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

606
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,580
I think if people see this footage ...

607
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,140
... they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

608
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,980
and then go on
eating their dinners.

609
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,540
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

610
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,140
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

611
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,380
Please enjoy your evening,
Mr. Daglish.

612
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,060
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

613
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,060
We've got trouble at the gate.

614
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,220
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

615
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,340
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

616
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,580
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

617
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,540
Benedict, what is happening?

618
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,460
They're killing everyone.
The lady ...

619
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,140
The Interahamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

620
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,340
Come on!

621
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,780
Cover the road. Now.

622
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,100
Stand your ground.

623
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Hold the line.

624
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,300
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

625
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,300
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

626
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,620
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

627
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,660
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers.

628
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,060
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

629
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,140
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

630
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,940
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

631
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,460
They'll be here in a few days.

632
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,060
I understand that, Colonel, but there is
simply no place for me to put all of them.

633
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,460
What can I do?

634
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,700
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants.

635
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,900
- All right.
- All right.

636
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,700
I understand. Thank you.

637
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,300
Madame Archer.

638
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,580
Hello.

639
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,660
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

640
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,140
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

641
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,860
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

642
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,340
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

643
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,620
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

644
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,540
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

645
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,100
Okay.

646
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,860
But ...

647
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,180
My brother and his wife ...
did the old lady know of them?

648
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,020
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

649
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,460
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

650
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,820
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

651
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,500
I can't. There are
Interahamwe roadblocks everywhere.

652
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,980
When I reached the orphanage ...

653
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,100
... the Interahamwe were there.

654
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,740
They'd already started
killing children.

655
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,020
They made me watch.

656
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,700
There was one girl,

657
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,340
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

658
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,060
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me.

659
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,340
"Please don't let them kill me.

660
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,140
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

661
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,860
Please, I can't.

662
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,940
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

663
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,020
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

664
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,340
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

665
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,420
We will get the orphans out then.

666
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,100
They're here!

667
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,460
They're here! We are safe!

668
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,820
Soldiers have arrived!

669
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,940
- Wow, look, it's the French!
- Yes!

670
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,780
Thank goodness!

671
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,060
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

672
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,260
Well done.

673
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,980
About time, gentlemen.

674
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,060
Thank you for saving our lives.

675
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,380
It's okay, Roger.

676
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,220
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

677
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,980
Yes, finally!

678
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,500
See, it's okay.

679
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,900
We can do nothing
from our side.

680
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,540
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

681
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,300
See? I told you. Yeah.

682
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,340
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

683
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,580
Something strong.

684
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,540
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

685
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,340
Congratulations, Colonel.

686
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,580
You have performed a minor miracle.

687
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,300
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

688
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,500
You should spit in my face.

689
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,780
Excuse me, Colonel?

690
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,580
You're dirt.

691
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,540
We think you're dirt, Paul.

692
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,420
Who is "we"?

693
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,620
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

694
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,780
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

695
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,260
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

696
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,540
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

697
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,260
You're the smartest man here.

698
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,140
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

699
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,940
You could own this freakin' hotel,
except for one thing ...

700
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,300
you're black.

701
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,660
You're not even a nigger.

702
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,460
You're an African.

703
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,620
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

704
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,460
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

705
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,940
Please.

706
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,620
Got it.

707
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

708
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,420
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

709
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,660
What is it?

710
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,540
All the whites are leaving.

711
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,260
They are being evacuated.

712
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,060
But ... what about us?

713
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,580
We have been abandoned.

714
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,500
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

715
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,940
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

716
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,100
I said all the whites are leaving ...
the French, the Italians,

717
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,620
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

718
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,140
Who is left?

719
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,300
I don't know.

720
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,900
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country.

721
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,780
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

722
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,100
And they are not allowed to shoot.

723
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,460
I am a fool.

724
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,620
No. No, no.

725
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,180
They told me
I was one of them, and I ...

726
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,140
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style ...
I swallowed it.

727
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,420
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

728
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,660
And they handed me their shit.

729
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,780
I have no history.
I have no memory.

730
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,180
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

731
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,780
You are no fool.

732
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,220
I know who you are.

733
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,420
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

734
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,060
<i>A United Nations source reports
that the U.S. And British representatives</i>

735
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,660
<i>on the Security Council
will lobby for the removal</i>

736
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,220
<i>of all U.N. Peacekeepers
from Rwanda.</i>

737
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,780
Please, Jack.
Please don't go.

738
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,660
Wait, he's British.
Take out your passport.

739
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,340
Jack, please don't leave me.

740
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,300
Can we talk?
Just one second.

741
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,060
Please, Jack. Please.

742
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,620
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

743
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,060
Here. Now just take ...

744
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,220
- Take this.
- No, no ...

745
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,420
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

746
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,980
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

747
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,620
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

748
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,660
Paul.

749
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,020
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

750
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,980
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

751
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,300
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

752
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,220
We have to let him go.

753
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,980
Don't do that, please.

754
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,940
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

755
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,540
Wait! Wait!

756
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,820
Hold the buses!

757
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,060
Peter!

758
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,780
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

759
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
- No Rwandans.
- What?

760
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,580
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

761
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,100
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

762
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,620
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

763
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,460
Father, it is of no use.

764
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,660
These men are not here ...
They are not here to help us.

765
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,340
Please, there is nothing we can do.

766
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,500
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

767
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,500
It is of no use, Father.
Please, hurry.

768
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,660
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

769
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,340
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

770
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,260
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

771
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,860
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

772
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,300
Go inside.

773
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,260
Go inside the hotel,
all of you.

774
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,580
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

775
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,380
Go into the hotel.

776
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,620
No!

777
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,300
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

778
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,460
Excuse me. Excuse me.

779
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,740
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

780
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,660
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

781
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,620
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

782
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,100
Paul.

783
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,620
I want you to go.

784
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,300
Go where?

785
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,820
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

786
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,980
- Your card says Hutu ...
- What are you saying?

787
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,300
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

788
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,180
I want you to go.

789
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,860
No, Tatiana, no.

790
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,780
I will never leave you.

791
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,260
I will never leave you.

792
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,940
Oh, Tatsi.

793
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,820
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

794
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,340
Get up. Get up.

795
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,100
Get up, get up, get up.

796
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:04,500
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

797
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,060
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

798
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,180
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

799
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,540
It's an order.

800
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,820
I need some time ...
20, 30 minutes ... to take a shower.

801
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,300
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

802
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,100
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

803
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,140
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

804
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,060
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

805
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,140
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

806
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,140
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

807
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,340
Under the bed.

808
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,020
Roger. It's Papa.

809
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,900
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

810
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,140
Come, come. Come on.

811
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,460
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

812
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,700
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

813
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,180
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.
- The roof?

814
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,340
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now.

815
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,620
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

816
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,460
He is where?

817
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,500
No, that is unacceptable.

818
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,180
Who would order such a thing?

819
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,420
Yes, did you find the general?

820
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,060
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

821
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,620
Get me the guest list.

822
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,020
Yes, sir.

823
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,620
Yes?

824
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,460
<i>Sorry, sir, but i have a call
from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.</i>

825
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,380
Paul, are you all right?

826
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,020
What?

827
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,140
The Hutu army have come.

828
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,660
They've ordered us ...
all of us ... out of the hotel.

829
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,420
Why are they doing this?

830
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,820
I think they will kill us all.

831
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,860
Kill?

832
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,980
What do you mean ... all?
How many?

833
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,700
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

834
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,700
<i>- 800?!
- Yes, sir.</i>

835
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,820
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.</i>

836
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,380
I do not have much time left, sir.

837
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,780
I want to thank you

838
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,060
<i>for everything that you
have done for me and my family,</i>

839
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,100
<i>and please thank all
of my friends at Sabera.</i>

840
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,060
Paul, wait.

841
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,260
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

842
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,020
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

843
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,260
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

844
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,660
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

845
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,140
Did you need something, sir?

846
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,420
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

847
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,580
Okay.

848
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,460
Paul, are you there?

849
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,180
Yes, sir.

850
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,940
Who can I call to stop this?

851
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,340
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

852
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,260
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

853
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,460
What are you doing, Dube?

854
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:07,380
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

855
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,380
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

856
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,740
Thank you.

857
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,780
Come with me, please.

858
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,300
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

859
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,820
Here you are, sir.

860
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,820
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier ...

861
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,620
What is this?

862
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,860
It is the guest list, sir.

863
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,820
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

864
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,820
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

865
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,220
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

866
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,460
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

867
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,140
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

868
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,660
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

869
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,500
then I'll kill everyone in there.

870
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,340
Starting with you.

871
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,580
Leave.

872
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,900
Yes, sir.

873
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,980
Yes, sir.

874
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,740
Who did you call?

875
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,100
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

876
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,340
What is your name?

877
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,660
Rusesabagina.

878
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,540
Paul Rusesabagina.

879
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,820
I'll remember you.

880
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,340
I'll remember you.

881
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,900
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

882
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:06,980
They've gone.

883
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,540
Paul. Paul.

884
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,020
I was afraid for you.

885
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,820
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

886
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,980
I must talk with this man.

887
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,180
<i>- Mr. Tillens.
- Paul, what's going on?</i>

888
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,500
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

889
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,500
I got through to the French
president's office.

890
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,900
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

891
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,140
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

892
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,580
<i>I am afraid this is not
going to happen.</i>

893
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,580
They're cowards, Paul.

894
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,020
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

895
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,180
The French, the British,
the Americans.

896
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,820
I am sorry, Paul.

897
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,060
Thank you.

898
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,140
There will be no rescue ...

899
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,420
... no intervention for us.

900
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,140
We can only save ourselves.

901
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,380
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

902
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,820
You must call these people.

903
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,860
Please, fax this
to this number. Thank you.

904
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,540
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

905
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,580
Say good-bye.

906
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,100
But when you say good-bye,

907
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:45,100
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

908
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,580
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand ...

909
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,020
... you will die.

910
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:58,820
We must shame them
into sending help.

911
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,900
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

912
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,900
The Interahamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

913
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,540
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

914
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,460
Have you printed the bills?

915
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,300
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

916
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,260
- Erase it?
- Yes. I want no names to appear there.

917
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,820
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

918
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,500
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

919
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,540
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

920
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,620
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

921
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,180
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

922
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,580
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

923
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,900
<i>Does the State Department
have a view</i>

924
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,980
<i>as to whether on not
what is happening could be genocide?</i>

925
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,340
<i>We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.</i>

926
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,940
<i>How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?</i>

927
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,900
<i>Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.</i>

928
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,340
<i>Is it true that you
have specific guidance</i>

929
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,820
<i>not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation,</i>

930
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,420
<i>but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?</i>

931
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,700
<i>I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.</i>

932
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,340
<i>I have ...</i>

933
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,700
<i>There are formulations
that we are using</i>

934
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,660
<i>that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of ...</i>

935
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,900
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

936
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,540
As long as it is scotch.

937
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,340
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

938
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,580
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

939
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,820
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

940
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,620
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

941
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,900
To protect us, sir.

942
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,820
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

943
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,020
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

944
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,340
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

945
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,860
would be well rewarded.

946
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,100
I will see what I can do.

947
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,820
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

948
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,180
Where has all our beer gone?

949
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,780
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

950
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,780
How much beer?

951
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,700
Many.

952
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,780
... come down to the reception.
And then he says to me,

953
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,420
"How do you want the girls?"

954
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,140
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

955
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,740
General ...

956
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,060
I'm glad you came by.

957
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,140
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

958
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,340
What did you overhear?

959
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,540
It was a discussion between a U.N. colonel
and an American Embassy official.

960
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,980
And what did they say?

961
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,740
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

962
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,300
How? They have gone, Paul.

963
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,340
With their spies. Satellites.

964
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,540
Americans.

965
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,420
Oh, Gregoire!

966
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,820
You know, I admire you, General.

967
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,260
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

968
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,900
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

969
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,100
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

970
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,700
He won't work,
listens to no one.

971
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,260
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

972
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,300
Yes.

973
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,620
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

974
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,340
Satellites?

975
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,820
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

976
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,060
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

977
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:05,900
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

978
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,980
No. No, no.

979
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,820
I have to, Tatiana.

980
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,420
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

981
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,060
You cannot go alone.

982
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,420
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

983
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,580
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

984
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,140
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

985
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,660
We have a job this morning.

986
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,020
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

987
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,340
Please get the van.

988
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,700
Show me your I.D.

989
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,180
<i>Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down</i>

990
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,140
<i>their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.</i>

991
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,620
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

992
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,900
<i>I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.</i>

993
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,340
<i>Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.</i>

994
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,060
<i>Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.</i>

995
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,220
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

996
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,260
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

997
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,460
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

998
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,820
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

999
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,940
Yes. I need rice, beans,

1000
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,260
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey.

1001
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:26,740
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

1002
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:28,260
You have no whiskey?

1003
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,980
No whiskey, no spirits.

1004
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,540
Your ... rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

1005
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,460
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now.

1006
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,020
What are you saying, George?

1007
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:47,460
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,
their money is no good to them anymore.

1008
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,380
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

1009
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:56,020
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

1010
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,700
And why not?

1011
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,780
Why not?

1012
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,260
We are halfway there already.

1013
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,700
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

1014
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,300
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

1015
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,820
Yes, sir, right away.

1016
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:21,900
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

1017
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,340
Yes.

1018
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,660
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

1019
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,700
And put those in the van. You.

1020
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,140
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

1021
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,860
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

1022
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,020
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here."

1023
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,180
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

1024
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,380
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

1025
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,260
Let's go.

1026
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,980
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

1027
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,820
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

1028
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,220
Now, if we were to get them,

1029
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,900
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

1030
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,100
Do you understand?

1031
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:22,780
It is almost dawn, George.

1032
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,860
We really must be going.

1033
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,620
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

1034
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,900
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

1035
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,140
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

1036
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,900
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

1037
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,580
Back up the car, Gregoire.

1038
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,540
Listen to me.

1039
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,180
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

1040
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,540
No one, Gregoire.

1041
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:49,060
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

1042
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,300
Oh, dear.

1043
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,300
Oh, God!

1044
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,620
Oh, God!

1045
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,020
- Sir.
- Dube!

1046
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,820
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

1047
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,780
I'll be out in a minute.

1048
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,740
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

1049
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,340
Don't come in. I'll be out.

1050
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,420
Hundreds.

1051
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,060
It was too many to count.

1052
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,860
Why are people so cruel?

1053
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,780
Hatred.

1054
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,940
Insanity. I don't know.

1055
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,380
There you go.

1056
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,660
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1057
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,540
Oh, yes.

1058
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,060
... to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

1059
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,460
I remember ...

1060
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,220
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

1061
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,900
- Hello.
- Come with me.

1062
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,700
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

1063
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,100
It's beautiful.

1064
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,260
You like it?

1065
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,660
I hear we must pay for everything.

1066
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,100
Yes, this is true.

1067
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,740
So ... how much for this?

1068
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,100
A kiss.

1069
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,100
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina.

1070
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,660
I have a confession.

1071
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,500
When you worked as the nurse ...

1072
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:51,700
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

1073
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,700
When we first met ...

1074
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,620
I had you transferred to Kigali.

1075
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,140
What?

1076
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,340
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

1077
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,700
- Why?
- To be closer.

1078
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,740
So that I could marry you.

1079
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,380
What was the bribe?

1080
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,140
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

1081
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,940
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

1082
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,700
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1083
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,500
I want to know.

1084
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,540
A Volkswagen.

1085
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,660
I hope it was a new one.

1086
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,780
We have had a good life,
you and I. Yes.

1087
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,020
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

1088
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:29,540
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

1089
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,180
Our children cannot
see us die first.

1090
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,540
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

1091
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,180
- Please, I don't want to ...
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

1092
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,060
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

1093
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,060
If I do not make it,

1094
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:49,860
you must take all of our children
by the hand ...

1095
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,820
... and you must jump.

1096
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,020
- What are you saying? I could never ...
- You have to, Tatiana.

1097
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,740
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

1098
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,980
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

1099
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,700
I cannot do ...

1100
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,380
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

1101
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,020
Promise me you will do it.

1102
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,260
Please, Tatiana.

1103
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,340
Yes.

1104
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,780
I'm sorry. I love you.

1105
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,700
I love you.

1106
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,700
I'm gonna get you!

1107
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,980
Diane, Elys, you know better.

1108
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,460
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

1109
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,780
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

1110
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,700
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

1111
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:52,380
Paul, I've got good news.

1112
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,900
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

1113
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:02,540
I have exit visas
for the following families.

1114
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,740
Abukesu, Tanzania.

1115
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,660
Bidori, Kenya.

1116
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:12,460
Gituaranga, Zambia.

1117
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,260
Hallelujah!

1118
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,940
Khalesa, Belgium.

1119
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,060
Oh, thank you!

1120
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,540
Dakuzi ...

1121
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,780
Masambo, Zambia.

1122
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,220
Zinguru, Ghana.

1123
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,180
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

1124
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,860
All right, that's it.

1125
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,140
So remember,
families be ready at 7 a.m.

1126
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,380
Let's go.

1127
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,460
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

1128
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,580
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

1129
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,380
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

1130
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,980
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

1131
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,980
Excuse me.

1132
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,340
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

1133
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,300
Yeah.

1134
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,700
The girls ...
Paul, I will not leave without them.

1135
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,540
What have you brought us?

1136
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,860
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

1137
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,300
Thank you.

1138
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,820
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

1139
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,500
Are you on the list?

1140
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:31,380
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

1141
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,460
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1142
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,420
and bring the girls
back here to us?

1143
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,300
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

1144
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,500
They're probably dead.

1145
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,660
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

1146
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,700
I'll try.

1147
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,820
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

1148
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,260
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

1149
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:03,900
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

1150
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,780
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

1151
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,380
I will find someone.
I promise you.

1152
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,620
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1153
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,100
Come on, take my hand.

1154
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,940
<i>News Service Africa.
Today a Red Cross representative</i>

1155
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,420
<i>claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict</i>

1156
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,940
<i>may have climbed to as many
as 500,000 victims.</i>

1157
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,260
<i>One report stated
that 40,000 bodies</i>

1158
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,500
<i>had beer removed
from Lake Victoria.</i>

1159
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,300
Where is she?

1160
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:48,980
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

1161
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:51,340
If she is not back
with the girls by then ...

1162
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,100
... she may not be coming.

1163
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,740
Thank you.

1164
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,980
Please, take these letters.

1165
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:02,180
Yes, I will take your letters.

1166
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,580
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

1167
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,820
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

1168
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,020
Thank you very much.

1169
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,740
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

1170
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,700
God be with you.

1171
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,060
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

1172
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,860
Come. Come, children.

1173
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,580
Tatsi, come.

1174
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,660
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

1175
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,580
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

1176
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:35,660
There you go.

1177
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,500
Let's move out!

1178
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:42,340
Good luck, sir.

1179
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:57,700
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

1180
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,060
Paul. Paul!

1181
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,500
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

1182
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:10,820
Papa!

1183
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,780
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

1184
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,420
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1185
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,860
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

1186
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:20,900
Papa!

1187
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:24,580
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

1188
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,020
It's okay.

1189
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:53,740
<i>I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches</i>

1190
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,020
<i>are the same as cockroaches.</i>

1191
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,900
<i>- They are all the same.
- This is crazy.</i>

1192
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:03,860
<i>Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.</i>

1193
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,420
<i>The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.</i>

1194
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,980
<i>Come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.</i>

1195
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,820
<i>- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station.</i>

1196
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,980
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

1197
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:36,260
<i>Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.</i>

1198
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:40,380
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

1199
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:43,300
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

1200
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,780
<i>We have received reports
of very important cockroaches</i>

1201
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,460
<i>and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille Collires Hotel.</i>

1202
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,060
<i>Gather up your weapons.</i>

1203
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,100
<i>Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.</i>

1204
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,300
<i>- They are being smuggled away ...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?</i>

1205
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:02,500
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

1206
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,100
Please, sir,
I will give you whatever I have.

1207
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:16,580
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

1208
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,740
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush.

1209
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,420
Slow down.

1210
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,780
Stay calm.

1211
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:48,180
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

1212
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:52,380
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

1213
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,740
No, no. I've got
U.N. personnel in these trucks.

1214
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,940
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

1215
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,180
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

1216
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:03,820
- I am.
- Cover me.

1217
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,020
Go to the back.

1218
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:21,260
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

1219
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:32,460
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

1220
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,420
Get back! Move back!

1221
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:38,340
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

1222
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:41,980
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. sanction.

1223
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:49,380
<i>News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army</i>

1224
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,540
<i>who will not let us punish them.</i>

1225
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,540
No!

1226
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,460
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

1227
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,940
No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

1228
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,940
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

1229
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,780
Stop him!

1230
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,340
You bastard!

1231
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:16,900
What's your name?

1232
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,260
- What's your name?
- I can't think ...

1233
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,900
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1234
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,660
What's your name?
What's your name?

1235
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,460
Let's move! Drive!

1236
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,260
Move! Get out!

1237
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,780
Out, or I'll shoot!

1238
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,820
Get out!

1239
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,980
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1240
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,820
Help us get out of here.

1241
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,540
Clear the street!

1242
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,340
<i>I am receiving more news,
good Hutus.</i>

1243
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:00,100
<i>I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagira's cockroaches</i>

1244
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,500
<i>are on a truck.</i>

1245
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,740
<i>10,000 francs for their heads!</i>

1246
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,420
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

1247
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:19,540
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

1248
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,500
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

1249
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:26,180
Please, please.

1250
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,980
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

1251
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,740
Come, hurry, hurry.

1252
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,820
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

1253
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,100
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

1254
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,180
Get him inside!

1255
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,060
Tatiana. Tatiana.

1256
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,740
You left me.
You left me.

1257
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,820
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1258
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,540
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

1259
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1260
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:03,500
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

1261
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:06,380
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

1262
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,300
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you.

1263
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,740
That was not
your decision to make.

1264
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:24,100
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

1265
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:25,780
You're right.

1266
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:27,820
You're right.

1267
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:30,660
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

1268
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,020
I'm sorry.

1269
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:33,500
Come on, put some more water.

1270
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,060
What are they doing?

1271
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,620
Dube.

1272
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,860
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

1273
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,740
General.

1274
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:51,220
Where are my supplies?

1275
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,860
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

1276
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:58,780
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1277
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:01,060
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1278
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,340
Sir, I have money from the guests.

1279
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:05,260
Rwandan francs!

1280
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,260
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

1281
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,820
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

1282
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,420
No more police,
no more protection.

1283
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,500
Let the U.N. take care of you.

1284
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:22,980
Drive. Go!

1285
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,300
What would Sabena make of this?

1286
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:39,900
Watch out!

1287
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,060
Get down, get down!

1288
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,620
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

1289
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:56,100
Please stay still.
There's glass here. I will get it out.

1290
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,860
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

1291
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,980
Lots of cuts and bruises.

1292
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,980
Thank God it was a storeroom.

1293
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:12,660
<i>And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report</i>

1294
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,140
<i>that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army</i>

1295
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:18,900
<i>has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.</i>

1296
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:21,060
<i>One aid worker described it</i>

1297
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,020
<i>as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.</i>

1298
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,740
The rebels have taken half the city,

1299
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,820
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

1300
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:33,540
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

1301
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,380
and you people,
all of you,

1302
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:38,700
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

1303
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,780
The Interahamwe, what about them?

1304
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:44,020
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

1305
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,380
They will kill us all if we stay here.

1306
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,700
We have to take the chance.

1307
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,460
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1308
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,380
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

1309
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,700
Two days?

1310
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,140
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

1311
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,940
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

1312
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,260
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

1313
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,980
Diane ... let your mother rest.

1314
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:34,260
You rest too, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.

1315
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:43,980
Diplomat.

1316
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,900
What?

1317
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,620
I have to go to the Diplomat.

1318
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,260
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

1319
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:04,780
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

1320
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,500
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1321
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:11,340
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

1322
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,420
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

1323
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,980
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,020
Hurry!

1325
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,420
Come on, show me.

1326
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,980
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

1327
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:08,980
And here you are.

1328
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,020
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

1329
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,260
The rebels can have this graveyard.

1330
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,540
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

1331
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,300
Here.

1332
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,540
Have a drink.

1333
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:37,980
You know what
the Scottish call it?

1334
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:39,420
No.

1335
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:44,460
<i>Uisge beatha ... Water of life.</i>

1336
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:56,180
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

1337
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:59,820
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

1338
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,340
Wonderful country.

1339
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,540
Wonderful golf.

1340
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:08,740
I wonder, will I ever go back?

1341
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,460
What do you think?

1342
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:13,940
No.

1343
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:18,340
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

1344
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:21,300
Can we go now,
please, sir?

1345
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:25,500
I am going to do you
a great favour, Paul.

1346
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,460
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

1347
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,580
Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.

1348
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:35,700
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

1349
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,420
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

1350
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,060
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

1351
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,900
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

1352
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:48,100
Sir ... General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

1353
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:51,220
Trust me,
we are better off here.

1354
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,980
General, these are difficult times.

1355
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,740
We need to help one another.

1356
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:00,980
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

1357
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:04,340
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

1358
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:08,100
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

1359
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,980
Paul, I am sick and tired
of your lies.

1360
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,740
Are you stupid, General?

1361
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,940
How do you think
these people operate?

1362
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:20,260
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

1363
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,820
Fine.

1364
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,940
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

1365
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:34,740
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

1366
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:37,620
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

1367
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:40,780
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

1368
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,260
I led no massacres!

1369
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,180
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1370
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,740
You will tell them the truth!

1371
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,940
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

1372
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,020
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1373
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,260
Shoot me.

1374
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,900
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

1375
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:01,140
I will pay you to shoot my family.

1376
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,380
You cannot hurt me.

1377
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:06,900
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

1378
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,260
We are leaving.
Right now.

1379
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:22,660
Get out!

1380
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,860
Get these people
away from the gate!

1381
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,380
Stop it! Stop it!

1382
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,340
Clear the hotel.

1383
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,140
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

1384
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,540
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

1385
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,500
Get out!

1386
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,300
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1387
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:09,140
Oh, no, no!

1388
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,660
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

1389
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,860
That's him. That's him!

1390
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,020
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

1391
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:21,220
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

1392
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:33,980
Stay where you are!

1393
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,820
Tatiana!

1394
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:54,740
Tatiana!

1395
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,660
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

1396
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,060
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

1397
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:08,380
Tatiana!

1398
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,340
Tatiana!

1399
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,740
They've gone. They've gone.

1400
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:43,940
They've gone.

1401
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:50,500
What were you
going to do with this?

1402
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,740
I thought you had ...

1403
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,460
I thought you had jumped.

1404
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,260
Everyone on the trucks, please.

1405
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,980
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

1406
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:22,820
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can, everyone. Please.

1407
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,220
There's enough room for everyone.

1408
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,180
I hope someday we will come back.

1409
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,460
Let's move out.

1410
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:44,100
What is wrong with her?

1411
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,820
She has a very high fever.

1412
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:56,660
Where are we going, Daddy?

1413
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,260
Someplace safe.

1414
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,900
What's happening?

1415
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:44,780
Come on, let's go. Children on the ground.
Bring the children this way.

1416
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,980
Pass them back, pass them back.

1417
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:55,860
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

1418
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,140
Get down!

1419
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:12,780
Stay down!

1420
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:36,780
What's happening there?

1421
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:43,460
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

1422
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:47,060
It's okay. We're safe.

1423
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,260
It's okay.

1424
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:50,180
It's okay, you are safe here.
You are safe.

1425
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:53,780
It's okay now.
Sit back down.

1426
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,580
Hello.

1427
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,820
Get some more water.

1428
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:31,900
The doctor says he is
very dehydrated.

1429
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:34,340
We made it.
Come on, let's get down.

1430
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:37,380
- Come on.
- It is okay.

1431
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,140
- She is sick.
- Okay.

1432
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,460
Yeah, she's very sick.
Take her.

1433
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:47,980
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

1434
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,340
They'll take you to Tanzania.

1435
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,020
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

1436
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,340
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1437
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,540
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1438
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,340
- Thank God.
- We made it.

1439
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:04,900
Please, please.
We are here, yeah?

1440
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,460
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

1441
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,460
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

1442
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:09,900
Mr. Manager.

1443
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:12,260
- I just want to thank you.
- Of course, Steven.

1444
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:13,380
Constance!

1445
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,940
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

1446
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,380
Have you seen my brother
and his wife?

1447
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:20,540
None of them.

1448
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,740
Has anyone seen these people?
You don't recog--

1449
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,020
Mama, come see quick.

1450
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:28,420
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Can you see them anywhere?

1451
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,940
Here, Mama, look.

1452
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,220
Please.

1453
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:37,900
Do you see them, Mama?
Is that them?

1454
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,260
Is that them, Mama?

1455
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,620
Do you recognise these people?

1456
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,700
This little girl, she's Anais,
and this is Carine.

1457
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,180
Do you recognise them?

1458
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:53,380
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

1459
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,500
Have any of you seen these girls?

1460
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,420
Anais. And that's my brother.

1461
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,420
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1462
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,780
Can you feel anything
when I touch here?

1463
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,820
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1464
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:17,340
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

1465
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:20,580
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- Okay.

1466
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,980
Boussey?

1467
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,300
It's you.

1468
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,700
Where'd you find this child?

1469
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:34,020
They just arrived
on trucks from the Mille Collines.

1470
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:39,900
<i>All Mille Collines evacuees
to the buses now, please.</i>

1471
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,860
- Oh, no.
- We need to hurry up, please.

1472
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:50,180
Come on, get some sleep.

1473
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,420
Wait!

1474
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:03,460
Hold it, please!

1475
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,780
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

1476
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:10,180
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

1477
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,900
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

1478
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:14,020
Come. Come, come.

1479
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,500
Please, wait for us.

1480
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:19,300
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought ...

1481
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,340
It's wonderful to see you.

1482
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,820
Come quickly.

1483
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:33,220
- Carine?
- Anais?

1484
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:34,420
Anais?

1485
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,060
Just wait. It's gonna be
just a minute now.

1486
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:41,260
Anais? Carine?

1487
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,260
Oh, my God!

1488
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,420
Oh, my God!

1489
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,340
Come, come, come!

1490
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:09,540
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

1491
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:13,380
Do you see your cousins?

1492
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:23,140
They said there wasn't any room.

1493
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,860
There's always room.
