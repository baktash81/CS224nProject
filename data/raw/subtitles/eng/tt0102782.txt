1
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:35,223
Small boat adrift! Starboard bow!

2
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,415
Look! Off starboard!

3
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,823
Up into the wind!
Get out the small boat!

4
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:00,098
-Pull away!
-Pull away!

5
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,824
Easy!

6
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:04,220
Get that genny out!

7
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,895
-Anyone aboard?
-l can`t tell!

8
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:33,820
Get that painter!
Pull that line, Kearney!

9
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,619
Come on, get that boat in!

10
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,504
Watch the sides!

11
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,020
There`s a man and a woman, sir!

12
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:45,456
-Dead or alive?
-Dead, sir!

13
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:49,217
-A child, sir!
-A what?

14
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:50,933
Alive!

15
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:01,414
-l`ll take him.
-Thank you, ma`am.

16
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,214
There. There, now.

17
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:25,503
``We commit their bodies to the waters
to be turned into corruption...

18
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:29,897
...looking for resurrection,
when the sea shall give up her dead...

19
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:36,214
...and the life of the world to come,
through our lord, Jesus Christ. Amen.``

20
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:02,224
Captain.

21
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,822
The surgeon would like
to speak with you, sir.

22
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:09,620
There`s sickness in the crew.

23
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,942
Five more were taken down
since mid-watch.

24
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,823
Fever. Canker sores.

25
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,778
Your cabinet has bromide.
Leech it out.

26
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,703
lt`s beyond bleeding.

27
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:24,013
Mr. Penfield,
l look to your medical knowledge.

28
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:27,820
After we left Moorea,
you thought it was scurvy.

29
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:30,533
Then you said it was breakbone fever.

30
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:33,942
The symptoms weren`t for certain.
Now, l know.

31
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,222
Fever. Withered skin.

32
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,820
Black bile.

33
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:45,821
Cholera.

34
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:59,424
-Can`t we turn back?
-There`s no port for a plague ship.

35
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,221
-Drop anchor at the first island.
-This is all open sea.

36
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:09,021
With due respect, captain, that small
boat put off from somewheres.

37
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:15,419
This is a French naval chart.
There`s nothing but warnings.

38
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,697
There`s reefs. Atolls.

39
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:26,534
This is a cruel turn for Mrs. Hargraves.
Left widowed with an infant.

40
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:29,219
Cast them adrift.

41
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:35,494
-A woman alone with two children?
-Put a man with them.

42
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,616
Kearney`s strong and able.

43
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,339
At least that`ll give them a chance.

44
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:42,623
Kearney?

45
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:47,019
Best of a poor lot.

46
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:51,217
But keep it from the rest of the crew.

47
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:54,019
-Wait till mid-watch.
-Aye, sir.

48
00:07:56,865 --> 00:08:01,302
Putting us off into the peril
of the sea because some men are ill?

49
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,417
-This is madness!
-lt`s for your own good.

50
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:08,584
l`ve spent the last three years
in a climate of awful heat...

51
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,663
...with insects as big as rats,
rats as big as cats!

52
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,904
l can certainly deal with some
deck hands down with fever!

53
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:21,613
We`re carrying cholera.
lf you stay aboard, you`ll die.

54
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:26,819
You can`t take your sea chest, missus.
Only things you really need.

55
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:30,774
But everything we have
will be in this chest.

56
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,816
Mrs. Hargraves will be taking
her belongings.

57
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,822
Aye, sir.

58
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,978
Cholera?

59
00:09:56,225 --> 00:10:00,776
Mr. Kearney?
Mr. Kearney, a cup of water, please.

60
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,976
-There`s only so much, missus.
-They`re in sore need, Mr. Kearney.

61
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:10,613
Look, the boy ain`t yours,
so he don`t matter too much.

62
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:12,941
Your infant knows what to do.

63
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:17,856
l`d say you`re fresh. Let her suckle.

64
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:17,820
l tell you, l`m sick and tired
of them two squalling.

65
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,300
Then give them water.

66
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:23,738
l`m a practical man, missus.

67
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:27,864
lf l was alone, by myself,
this could last a good while.

68
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:33,056
Sharing four ways makes no sense.

69
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,983
lt`s best to put them out
of their misery.

70
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:40,178
You won`t touch them.

71
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:44,940
You either shut them up,
or they`re going overboard!

72
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,221
Hush, Lilli!

73
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:04,734
That`s it. Look the other way
if you don`t want to see.

74
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:16,857
Richard, come quickly. Jump up.

75
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,902
You can help Mama.

76
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:10,177
Yeah, that`s my girl.

77
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,023
Yes.

78
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,816
Come on. Come on, Lilli.

79
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:13,022
Richard, you stay here.

80
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,815
lt`s fresh.

81
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,658
Look! Bananas!

82
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:36,098
And pompons! And roots!
Roots are good eating!

83
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:43,821
This is taro root!
We ate it at the mission.

84
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,222
And bananas.
Richard, here`s some bananas!

85
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:51,418
Yes, lots of bananas!

86
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,454
Boat.

87
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,225
Here, do you want some?

88
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,061
The boat is coming.

89
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,817
Boat!

90
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:11,222
Look! How pretty.

91
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:16,260
There.

92
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:20,375
Oh, Lilli.

93
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,739
We can`t stay here.

94
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,658
We`re too exposed on this side.

95
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:05,180
We`ve got to find a safe haven out
of the weather. Come on.

96
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:09,424
Come, Richard.
Let`s go for a little walk.

97
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,821
Here we go.

98
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:09,620
Look! How beautiful!

99
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:15,622
House.

100
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:24,383
Good heavens! Richard!

101
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,822
Mama!

102
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,220
Mama! Mama!

103
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,424
She`s gone.

104
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,459
l know she`s gone. Your mama`s gone.

105
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:27,542
lt`s all right. lt`s all right.
Come here, l`ve got you.

106
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:32,455
-Mommy gone!
-l know. lt`s all right.

107
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:38,817
Your mama`s not here, but l am.
l`ll be your mama from now on.

108
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:49,340
Any passing ship will see this
when it`s ablaze.

109
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:53,021
lt won`t be long before one finds us.

110
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,621
Go to sleep now. Close your eyes.

111
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,014
l`ll be right back.

112
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:44,937
l know this is your favourite dessert,
but eat slower.

113
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:50,213
And hold the spoon this way,
as l`ve showed you.

114
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:57,213
Someday, you`ll find yourself seated
at a fancy table in San Francisco...

115
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:00,940
...and be expected
to show proper table manners.

116
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:05,220
Richard! Don`t do that!

117
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:19,864
We may be away from civilization,
but we won`t behave uncivilized!

118
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:36,343
Full moon!

119
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:52,614
They come every three months
when the moon is full.

120
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,422
Off to bed, children. Quickly!

121
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,061
Richard, come!

122
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:07,813
lt`ll be all right. Tonight
you`ll get your lullaby in the dark.

123
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,815
The mother!

124
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,183
Put it down!

125
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:13,298
-Why do you wear clothes when bathing?
-lt`s proper.

126
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:18,016
-Why don`t Richard and l wear clothes?
-l gave up on you long ago.

127
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:21,695
l put your clothes on
and you`d just take them off.

128
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:24,743
-l wish l looked like him down there.
-Why?

129
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:29,775
-He can aim when he goes:
-l can hit a mango leaf dead centre.

130
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:35,213
Why does he have one he can aim
and we don`t?

131
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:39,618
God, in his infinite wisdom,
decided....

132
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:45,418
Well, nature gave us different parts.

133
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:49,624
-You see, a female has a--
-A cowrie shell.

134
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:53,704
-What?
-Lilli looks like a cowrie shell there.

135
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,301
So that`s what you call mine,
a cowrie shell.

136
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:02,016
-And we call Richard`s a--
-No, no, no! Never mind.

137
00:29:02,225 --> 00:29:07,140
l should have explained certain
of life`s facts to you years ago.

138
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:13,420
-Explain certain of life`s facts now.
-No, l need to think about it first.

139
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:17,220
l`ll explain it after your
spelling lesson tonight.

140
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,814
-Let`s rinse off.
-Tonight?

141
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,822
All right? Everybody.

142
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:31,019
Why do people get married?

143
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:34,934
God commanded that when a man
and woman love each other...

144
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:38,615
...they take vows.
Vows are like promises.

145
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:42,818
They make promises to each other
in the eyes of God.

146
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:46,301
And that`s called
the marriage ceremony.

147
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:49,303
Here`s the ceremony
your father used to say...

148
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:53,020
...when he performed marriages
at the mission.

149
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,816
What about the life facts?

150
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:08,823
When a girl becomes a woman,
and a boy becomes a man--

151
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:12,904
-When`s that?
-Well, it`s different for everyone...

152
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:17,024
-...but you`ll know when it happens.
-How?

153
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:23,017
Lilli, your body will become rounder.
You`ll grow breasts like mine.

154
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:26,023
And you`ll bleed a bit
from between your legs.

155
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,819
l don`t wanna bleed.

156
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,302
lt only lasts a few days.

157
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:36,414
And it`s a great blessing
because it means you can have a baby.

158
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:43,096
-Do l have to bleed?
-No. But your body will change too.

159
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:46,775
Your voice gets deeper.
Hair will grow on your face.

160
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:51,615
You`d look handsome with a beard.
Unless you want to scrape it off.

161
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:56,216
-l want the baby now.
-You can`t. You`re not ready yet.

162
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:59,940
Also, you need the man
to make the baby inside you.

163
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:02,215
lnside me?

164
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:05,542
Yes. There`s a special place
inside a woman...

165
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:09,539
...where the baby stays nice
and warm and safe...

166
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,221
...until it`s ready
to be born into the world.

167
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:15,814
How does the baby get in there?

168
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,822
Well...

169
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:24,224
...after they`re married,
the man and woman lie very...

170
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:29,294
-...very close together and---
-l know. lt`s like the iguanas, Lilli.

171
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:33,783
You know, when they get so close
you can`t tell them apart.

172
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,976
-That`s it.
-That`s it?

173
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:39,422
Yes. lguanas have
their babies soon after.

174
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:44,615
-That`s it, Mother?
-Well, that`s most of it.

175
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:49,421
That`s what l`ve been waiting
to hear all day?

176
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:54,939
-That`s not gonna help.
-Look what you did to my spear. Go away.

177
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,461
That was my fish.
Go back out where you belong.

178
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:02,340
Richard, look.
Now what are we gonna do?

179
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:05,577
What are we gonna do now, Richard?

180
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:10,735
-What are we gonna do?
-Will you be quiet and let me think?

181
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,860
Lilli!

182
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,054
Richard!

183
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:44,377
We`re out past sunset.
Mother`s gonna be angry.

184
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:50,658
-What are you doing?
-l`ve got an idea.

185
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:28,015
He`s coming. Come on!

186
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:18,697
Where have you been?
Do you realize how late it is?

187
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:24,656
But there was this old shark in the
channel. He took Richard`s spear.

188
00:36:24,825 --> 00:36:27,976
l told you to keep away from sharks.

189
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:31,258
-Boat drifted loose.
-What are the rules?

190
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:33,734
-Be home by sunset always.
-And?

191
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:38,660
-Never to the north side of the island.
-Do you see that? A full moon!

192
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:43,893
We are going straight home and this is
never happening again. Do you hear me?

193
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:30,378
Oh! Lilli, Richard.
Go get some thatch.

194
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,783
Get back inside.

195
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:54,541
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

196
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:58,857
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

197
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:03,735
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses as we...

198
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:09,622
...forgive those who trespass against
us. Lead us not into temptation...

199
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:16,179
...but deliver us from evil. For thine is
the kingdom, power and glory forever.

200
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:27,658
l can feel that the sickness has moved
into my lungs now.

201
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:31,613
And that means l might not get well.

202
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:34,854
What`s going to happen?

203
00:39:35,825 --> 00:39:38,976
You may have to be here without me.

204
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:40,903
lf God wants...

205
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:47,061
...l`ll be with your father and we`ll
be guardian angels watching over you.

206
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:52,298
This is my special place.

207
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:56,663
lt`s quiet here,
and l can see the house.

208
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:05,620
Hollow out this ground about so deep.

209
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:09,494
And line it with thatch and moss.

210
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:12,463
Then fill it in...

211
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,742
...and smooth it over with earth.

212
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:20,736
l`ll write out a prayer for you to say.

213
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:24,944
We`ll carve a marker and it will say:

214
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,417
`` Here lies Sarah Hargraves.

215
00:40:28,585 --> 00:40:34,217
Wife of William, mother of Lillian....``

216
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,177
And l know l`m not your
real mother, Richard.

217
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:43,218
But l would like to have it said:

218
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:46,934
``And mother of Richard.``

219
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:13,736
We pray the Lord to grant
this last abiding wish.

220
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:18,933
That Lilli and Richard love each other,
take care of each other...

221
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:22,734
...and keep up with their lessons...

222
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:28,099
...and be prepared for the
ship when it comes. Amen.

223
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:07,016
-Breakfast looks extra good today.
-Thank you.

224
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:12,384
-Don`t forget, you cook tomorrow.
-You`re the one who always forgets.

225
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:17,665
-What? What do l forget?
-To colour your eggs for the hunt.

226
00:43:17,865 --> 00:43:21,778
l didn`t forget. l don`t think
we should do it this year.

227
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,096
But we do it every Easter.

228
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:28,895
The calendar marks say tomorrow`s
Easter, so we must have the hunt.

229
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:31,179
Why?

230
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:34,781
How else do we know who finds
the most eggs and wins?

231
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:38,295
-Wins what, Richard?
-l don`t know.

232
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:41,582
Nothing. Just wins.

233
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:47,024
lt seems silly to me. l don`t
understand why we have to do it.

234
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,940
Because Mother would want us to.

235
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:04,057
l`ve got an idea. Whoever finds
the most eggs this year wins a prize.

236
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,863
What kind of a prize?

237
00:44:06,025 --> 00:44:09,017
lf you win,
l`ve gotta give you something.

238
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:12,461
And if l win,
you`ve gotta give me something.

239
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:18,264
lt`s a wonderful idea.

240
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:22,140
l hid ten eggs between
the beach and the berry patch.

241
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:24,978
l hid ten between the rocks
and the fern glade.

242
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:29,343
-Ready?
-Ready. Get set. Go!

243
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:13,778
l found nine. Beat that.

244
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:18,737
-l only found eight.
-The winner`s me. Where`s my prize?

245
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:09,462
You were down so long.
What were you doing?

246
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,297
You`ll see.

247
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:37,901
Your prize!

248
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:48,064
l`m gonna keep this forever.

249
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:54,695
My prize. The white bead.

250
00:47:55,905 --> 00:48:00,535
l think it looks nice in my hair.

251
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:02,024
Do you?

252
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:06,500
l don`t care what you do with it...

253
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:09,259
...or how you wear it.

254
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:12,701
You can hang it from your nose
for all l care.

255
00:49:23,105 --> 00:49:25,619
Back and forth.

256
00:49:25,945 --> 00:49:30,223
Round and round.
You think this whole reef is yours.

257
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:33,980
You think you can swallow
anything that swims.

258
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:36,705
You`d like to catch me, wouldn`t you?

259
00:49:36,865 --> 00:49:42,497
But l was too fast, stupid sea slug.
l can beat you every time.

260
00:49:42,665 --> 00:49:47,500
And if you don`t believe me,
l`ll prove it!

261
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:17,618
Master of the reef!

262
00:50:23,985 --> 00:50:28,775
The first time, he almost got me.
But l was too fast for him.

263
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:32,614
This time, he was lying in wait.

264
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:35,618
So l dive in,
and l can see down his mouth.

265
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:39,334
There`s about 500 teeth.
There`s fish around his gills.

266
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:41,655
And he comes at me.

267
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:45,901
He misses me. Stupid sea slug!

268
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:52,899
-lt seems silly to me.
-Silly? lt`s not silly. lt`s dangerous.

269
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:58,338
Exactly. That`s why it`s silly.
l don`t understand why you do it.

270
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:01,224
-l like the way it makes me feel
-What?

271
00:51:01,385 --> 00:51:07,779
lnside here. lt feels all alive when
l know l`m the master of the reef.

272
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:11,182
``The master of the reef.
The master of the reef.``

273
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:14,496
Hey, don`t you ever make fun of me.

274
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:17,334
l`m sorry.

275
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:24,703
Besides, you`re the silly one. Always
touching and looking at yourself.

276
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:28,777
-l don`t touch myself.
-Yes, you do.

277
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:32,734
You`re always touching those
when you look in the mirror.

278
00:51:32,905 --> 00:51:35,624
l`m just measuring
how much they`ve grown.

279
00:51:35,785 --> 00:51:39,664
-You shouldn`t look when l`m naked.
-Why not?

280
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:43,135
-l always used to see you naked.
-lt`s different now.

281
00:51:43,305 --> 00:51:45,660
-Why?
-l don`t know.

282
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:48,897
l don`t know why it`s different,
but it is.

283
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,054
Lilli?

284
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,862
l wish things could be
the way they used to be.

285
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:03,698
When we had fun.

286
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:08,218
Remember the seesaw she made us?

287
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,935
The games we used to play?

288
00:52:15,985 --> 00:52:18,624
Ring around the rosy?

289
00:52:58,305 --> 00:53:00,182
Richard?

290
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,536
Yes?

291
00:53:05,585 --> 00:53:11,899
You wouldn`t mind if l moved my bed
to another part of the house?

292
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:16,541
No.

293
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:20,498
lf you weren`t gonna do it, l was.

294
00:55:13,465 --> 00:55:15,535
How long have you been there?

295
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:18,378
l saw the blood on the quilt.

296
00:55:20,145 --> 00:55:22,056
Are you all right?

297
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:29,175
Do you remember?

298
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:34,144
What Mother said would happen
when l became a woman?

299
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,334
Yes.

300
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,376
Well...

301
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:41,815
...l`ve become one.

302
00:55:58,065 --> 00:55:59,817
Richard, wake up!

303
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:02,495
Richard?

304
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:06,619
Richard! Richard, wake up.

305
00:56:06,785 --> 00:56:10,061
l can`t sleep with my bed
facing the wrong way.

306
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,534
-Soon as l`m awake.
-You are. Come--

307
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:16,220
No, l`m not. Stop it.
Let go, l`m not dressed.

308
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:19,502
Wrap the quilt around you.

309
00:56:21,785 --> 00:56:24,174
Come on!

310
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:31,778
-What`s wrong? You`re humped over.
-Just give me a minute.

311
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:35,654
-What happened to it?
-lt gets that way all the time now.

312
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,339
-Well, does it hurt?
-No.

313
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,141
Well, can you walk?

314
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:45,463
l can walk just fine.
l can make it go away if l want to.

315
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,616
-How?
-None of your business.

316
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:50,538
lf we keep secrets,
nothing will be the--

317
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:55,620
Nothing`s the same around here anyway.
Nothing`s the way it used to be!

318
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,096
Come on, let`s move your stupid bed.

319
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:15,016
Mother.

320
00:57:15,745 --> 00:57:18,418
l don`t know what to do.

321
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:22,974
He`s changed, l`ve changed.

322
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:27,182
Everything`s so confusing.

323
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:33,301
-l`m tired of you snooping. Go!
-l`m sick of you telling me to go away.

324
00:57:33,465 --> 00:57:34,864
Go away! l mean it.

325
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:38,859
l`ll go where l`ve always wanted to go,
to the north side.

326
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:41,141
No! We`re in a full moon.

327
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:44,422
-l can do what l want.
-You can`t. lt`s a rule!

328
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:48,982
lt`s not my rule! lt was her rule!
She wasn`t even my real mother!

329
00:57:49,185 --> 00:57:52,382
-She loved you like a real mother.
-l don`t care.

330
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:57,460
l`m sick of the rules. From now on,
l can do whatever l want to do.

331
00:57:57,625 --> 00:58:01,300
l`m old enough. l can go
wherever l wanna go...

332
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:03,899
...and come home when l want to.

333
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:56,654
Richard? Richard?

334
01:02:56,825 --> 01:02:59,703
What happened? What have you done?

335
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:02,220
l had to hide.

336
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:05,741
These heathens danced around me.
They didn`t see me.

337
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:08,499
lf they had, l would`ve been dead.

338
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:24,740
There was this one heathen...

339
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:27,624
...and at first, l wanted to kill him.

340
01:03:27,785 --> 01:03:32,700
And then, l didn`t want to kill him.
And then, l couldn`t kill him.

341
01:03:32,865 --> 01:03:36,096
-Then he saw you. He`ll tell the others!
-No.

342
01:03:36,265 --> 01:03:39,575
l let him go. Peace.

343
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,903
l hope you`re right.
l`m glad you`re okay.

344
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:48,378
l thought l`d never see you again.
l never want us to fight again, ever.

345
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,704
Me neither.

346
01:03:55,785 --> 01:03:57,696
-Lilli?
-Yes?

347
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:01,984
-Friends?
-Oh, yes. Always.

348
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,979
l feel like crying.

349
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:40,858
So do l.

350
01:04:43,265 --> 01:04:47,053
-l want us to be husband and wife.
-Yes.

351
01:04:57,905 --> 01:05:00,260
With this ring...

352
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:02,976
...l thee wed.

353
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:10,340
With this ring,
l thee wed you, Richard.

354
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:12,938
-Amen.
-Amen.

355
01:05:16,865 --> 01:05:19,937
-And now we`re....
-One.

356
01:05:20,945 --> 01:05:22,424
Forever.

357
01:07:08,985 --> 01:07:10,464
Look.

358
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:17,302
Lilli, hurry! The signal fire!

359
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,856
What if they`re heathens?
l`m frightened.

360
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:51,221
Maybe we shouldn`t light the fire.
Let`s see who they are first.

361
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:23,096
Eight people.

362
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:31,178
The one in the light covering
may be a woman.

363
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:33,217
Woman?

364
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:59,383
Watch them.
They may not be civilized.

365
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:04,255
Civilized.
C-l-V-l-L-l-Z-l-D.

366
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:10,177
Remember what Mother said
about a firm handshake.

367
01:10:11,825 --> 01:10:13,144
My name is Richard.

368
01:10:13,345 --> 01:10:16,496
We`ve been waiting for you
for a long time.

369
01:10:17,145 --> 01:10:21,024
l`m Lilli, and l`m ready
to go back to civilization.

370
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:23,978
What?

371
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:27,973
l am Captain Jacob Hilliard,
master of the Tradewind.

372
01:10:28,985 --> 01:10:31,374
And we--
ls this your land?

373
01:10:31,585 --> 01:10:34,019
Yes. My house is there.

374
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:37,695
We`re in need of fresh water.
Our casks are fouled.

375
01:10:39,105 --> 01:10:43,303
Will you grant us permission
to come ashore?

376
01:10:43,545 --> 01:10:47,220
Yes. You are welcome here.

377
01:10:48,065 --> 01:10:50,784
Cover yourself,
and l`ll get my daughter.

378
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:55,218
-Does that binding choke you?
-No, certainly not.

379
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:58,058
Well, yes, sometimes.

380
01:10:58,265 --> 01:11:01,098
l`d appreciate it if you`d....

381
01:11:08,225 --> 01:11:10,864
How do you catch fish with that spear?

382
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:13,454
lt`s not a spear, mate.

383
01:11:13,705 --> 01:11:16,094
-What is it?
-lt`s a rifle.

384
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,775
Blow a man`s head right off.

385
01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:21,295
Castaways! How exciting!

386
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:24,901
They`re an odd mixture of
knowledge and ignorance.

387
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:29,775
Oh, and their attire
is a little bit....

388
01:11:30,025 --> 01:11:32,744
Well, it`s quite sparse.

389
01:11:45,865 --> 01:11:47,662
ls anything wrong?

390
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,378
The colour. lt`s the same as the sky.

391
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,456
Pure silk.

392
01:11:57,745 --> 01:11:59,497
With my compliments.

393
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,578
And for your brother.

394
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:08,181
Oh, he`s not my brother.
He`s my husband.

395
01:12:08,385 --> 01:12:09,784
Your husband?

396
01:12:17,465 --> 01:12:19,820
Mother died six years ago.

397
01:12:20,385 --> 01:12:23,218
-How do you follow the years?
-She taught us.

398
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:27,022
We know that 1 2 full moons
are one year.

399
01:12:27,225 --> 01:12:30,535
We have Christmas, Thanksgiving
and Easter.

400
01:12:30,745 --> 01:12:33,543
We`re not sure they`re
on the right days.

401
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:36,465
lt`s amazing, the two of you...

402
01:12:36,705 --> 01:12:40,061
...in this remote, godforsaken place.

403
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:43,218
Not godforsaken, Captain Hilliard.

404
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:45,421
Not godforsaken at all.

405
01:12:46,105 --> 01:12:50,974
You do set an excellent table.
My compliments to the chef.

406
01:12:51,225 --> 01:12:53,819
They`ve made their own dinnerware.

407
01:12:54,225 --> 01:12:58,537
Cups, soup spoons. lngenious.

408
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:06,820
-Won`t Mr. Quinlan be joining us?
-He`s a seafarer...

409
01:13:07,065 --> 01:13:09,818
...and prefers to be by himself.

410
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:12,977
l see why you`ve been lost
for so long.

411
01:13:13,225 --> 01:13:18,015
-The charts don`t show this island.
-lt`s a wonder we found you.

412
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:23,464
Heathens come to the north side
at certain times.

413
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:26,700
There`s a burial ground there.

414
01:13:29,025 --> 01:13:33,621
This is ever so tasty. A great treat
from the slop we eat on the ship.

415
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,180
What is it?

416
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:37,017
Eel broth.

417
01:13:38,025 --> 01:13:39,617
Eel?

418
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:42,095
Well, only the broth is eel.

419
01:13:42,345 --> 01:13:45,542
The little white chunks
are sea urchin.

420
01:13:45,785 --> 01:13:49,983
We appreciate your hospitality
and hope we can repay you.

421
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,658
You can.

422
01:13:52,225 --> 01:13:54,659
You can take us back to civilization.

423
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:58,261
l should think.
lt must be awfully boring here.

424
01:13:59,665 --> 01:14:02,020
What is the meaning of `` boring``?

425
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:07,784
Well, boring is when you have
nothing whatever to do.

426
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:12,018
So you`re bored.
Like you must be here.

427
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:19,781
No. We`re never bored.

428
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,344
Boots and a shirt...

429
01:14:25,825 --> 01:14:28,293
...and a coat and trousers.

430
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:33,736
l`ll let Sylvia explain
the female garments.

431
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:36,779
Well, carry on.

432
01:14:42,425 --> 01:14:43,858
Buttons!

433
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:48,377
l remember buttons on Mother`s dress.

434
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:50,576
lt`s lrish lace.

435
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:55,655
Richard, turn your head.
l`m showing her a foundation garment.

436
01:14:56,865 --> 01:14:59,857
Although there isn`t much
you haven`t seen.

437
01:15:10,145 --> 01:15:14,536
-What does it do?
-lt goes around the waist, like this.

438
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:17,414
And then cinch the drawstring.

439
01:15:19,105 --> 01:15:23,542
Don`t look yet, Richard.
l`m showing Lillian my secrets.

440
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:29,578
Look.

441
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:34,298
This is velvet plush.
And these are silver.

442
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:36,739
So smooth.

443
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:47,535
Hairbrush and combs. Powder puff.

444
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,940
Rouge and powder.

445
01:15:53,825 --> 01:15:55,622
Lavender water.

446
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:59,415
Musk-rose perfume.

447
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:02,263
And a hand mirror.

448
01:16:06,705 --> 01:16:09,583
You`re pretty,
except for the hue of your skin.

449
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:11,622
But we can fix that.

450
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:14,181
What`s wrong with my skin?

451
01:16:14,385 --> 01:16:18,219
lt`s tainted brown.
We`ll lighten it with lemon juice.

452
01:16:18,465 --> 01:16:20,057
Why?

453
01:16:20,945 --> 01:16:25,780
You don`t want people to think
you`re a field hand, do you?

454
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,456
No.

455
01:16:38,105 --> 01:16:41,620
-Worse than fish fat.
-lt`s quite costly.

456
01:16:44,145 --> 01:16:45,863
Well, look at you.

457
01:16:46,105 --> 01:16:49,734
You do look handsome
in your boulevard suit.

458
01:16:51,585 --> 01:16:53,815
So handsome.

459
01:18:48,065 --> 01:18:51,341
Do you think l`ve applied
too much rouge?

460
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:54,737
No. l think it`s beautiful.

461
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,537
Well, thank you, kind sir.

462
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:02,298
Well....

463
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:05,778
All powder and paint
with nothing to do.

464
01:19:06,025 --> 01:19:11,497
-We could go outside and count stars.
-ls that what you do here at night?

465
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:13,701
Sometimes we count stars.

466
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:16,015
Sometimes we sing.

467
01:19:16,425 --> 01:19:19,462
-Sometimes we mate, sometimes we sleep.
-Mate?!

468
01:19:20,145 --> 01:19:22,978
-Yes.
-Do you mate often?

469
01:19:23,345 --> 01:19:25,700
Whenever we want to.

470
01:19:28,265 --> 01:19:31,541
-Just like that?
-Well, yes. Yes.

471
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:34,419
Sometimes we dance.
l love to dance.

472
01:19:34,905 --> 01:19:37,100
Let`s show Sylvia how we dance.

473
01:19:48,265 --> 01:19:49,778
Come on, you try it.

474
01:19:50,025 --> 01:19:55,145
l don`t call that a dance.
lt`s childish and simple-minded.

475
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:59,704
-What do you mean?
-Grown people don`t dance like that.

476
01:20:01,665 --> 01:20:04,463
Maybe we should learn
a grown-up dance.

477
01:20:04,705 --> 01:20:07,777
-l shall teach you.
-Oh, will you?

478
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:09,813
lt`s like this.

479
01:20:10,065 --> 01:20:12,738
lt`s naughty.
lt`s the Spanish polka.

480
01:20:17,745 --> 01:20:22,455
Spirit`s willing, flesh is weak
Kiss me, darling, on the cheek

481
01:20:25,945 --> 01:20:28,140
Now do it slow.

482
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:34,984
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

483
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:39,338
You`re a beautiful dancer, Richard.

484
01:20:42,025 --> 01:20:43,981
She must mind her manners.

485
01:20:44,185 --> 01:20:47,382
lt`s not polite to leave a guest
during a lesson.

486
01:20:47,585 --> 01:20:51,942
Well, we`re sorry, but she`ll just
have to wait her turn.

487
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,783
She`s gonna teach me how to mazurka.

488
01:21:06,225 --> 01:21:09,023
As soon as l get it right,
l`ll show you.

489
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,699
You lied to me.

490
01:21:11,985 --> 01:21:14,101
When did l lie to you?

491
01:21:14,945 --> 01:21:18,017
You told me once
that you`d never hurt me.

492
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,217
How did l hurt you?

493
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:25,181
When you always stare at her,
it hurts me.

494
01:21:25,425 --> 01:21:27,097
l`m sorry.

495
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:31,377
lt`s just that she`s so different.

496
01:21:33,065 --> 01:21:34,054
ln what way?

497
01:21:34,865 --> 01:21:38,574
Well, just look at her.
The way she`s all covered up.

498
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:42,613
You said you found her clothes
stupid and unnecessary.

499
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:43,980
l do.

500
01:21:45,185 --> 01:21:46,903
lt`s just....

501
01:21:48,065 --> 01:21:51,853
l wonder what she looks like
underneath all of them.

502
01:21:52,065 --> 01:21:55,774
You mean you want to look at her...

503
01:21:55,985 --> 01:21:58,374
...because you can`t see her?

504
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:00,624
Yes.

505
01:22:00,865 --> 01:22:06,861
You remember when l wanted to go to the
north side, just because l couldn`t.

506
01:22:08,945 --> 01:22:10,822
Yes, l do.

507
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:16,813
l also remember what almost happened
to you when you did go.

508
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,181
Good night, Richard.

509
01:23:19,945 --> 01:23:23,620
-What have you done to yourself?
-Don`t you like it?

510
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:28,220
No. Wash it off.

511
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:34,504
You don`t like it on me,
but you love it on Sylvia.

512
01:23:34,745 --> 01:23:39,296
Please, Lilli, let`s not fight.
We promised we`d never fight.

513
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:45,141
You never eat breakfast anymore.
Are you sick?

514
01:23:46,305 --> 01:23:49,138
Richard, l`m ready for my lesson now!

515
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:52,817
l promised to teach her how to fish.

516
01:24:36,265 --> 01:24:38,176
Here we are together.

517
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:41,661
Out in the middle of
a beautiful fishpond.

518
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:44,500
ln plain view of everyone.

519
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:46,622
So respectable.

520
01:24:47,025 --> 01:24:50,097
But look at this, kind sir.

521
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:54,740
All we have to do
is lower our heads...

522
01:24:57,105 --> 01:25:00,461
...and we`re completely hidden
from prying eyes.

523
01:25:15,185 --> 01:25:17,824
So we can do whatever we want.

524
01:25:53,385 --> 01:25:55,853
-Lovely.
-Get out of here!

525
01:25:58,105 --> 01:26:00,221
Come on, don`t be like that.

526
01:26:00,465 --> 01:26:03,582
-Richard?
-Richard!

527
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:05,218
He`ll never hear you.

528
01:26:05,465 --> 01:26:09,060
He`ll be out playing games
with Miss Sylvia for hours.

529
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:22,978
-You`re missing something. The pearl.
-What do you mean?

530
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:26,940
-The little bead in your hair.
-lt`s at the house.

531
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:31,302
Lilli.

532
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:34,942
lt`s no time to be thinking
about Lilli.

533
01:26:35,465 --> 01:26:38,104
l told her l`d never hurt her.

534
01:26:40,425 --> 01:26:44,100
Don`t feel sorry for her.
She`s had you all to herself.

535
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:48,054
-You`re not hers. You`re not married.
-We are.

536
01:26:48,305 --> 01:26:49,294
But not really.

537
01:26:49,545 --> 01:26:52,696
Made-up words in the middle of a
jungle doesn`t count.

538
01:26:52,945 --> 01:26:54,936
lt does to me.

539
01:26:59,585 --> 01:27:03,464
Why don`t you just follow your heart?

540
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:07,814
She is my heart.

541
01:27:13,785 --> 01:27:14,774
Where is it?

542
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:17,980
You can`t just leave me here!

543
01:27:18,345 --> 01:27:23,339
Very rude behaviour!
You`ll never fit in civilized society!

544
01:27:23,985 --> 01:27:25,464
Richard?

545
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:46,583
Get away from her!

546
01:28:05,465 --> 01:28:08,855
-Came from the house.
-Get the other rifle.

547
01:28:31,185 --> 01:28:32,698
No!

548
01:28:35,865 --> 01:28:37,298
Get him!

549
01:28:43,265 --> 01:28:44,618
Look out!

550
01:28:46,425 --> 01:28:47,619
No!

551
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:02,100
Help us!

552
01:29:02,345 --> 01:29:06,418
-Quinlan, hold off! You`ll kill him!
-All right, that`s enough.

553
01:29:06,665 --> 01:29:08,860
You heard me. l said, enough.

554
01:29:09,425 --> 01:29:10,778
Break it up.

555
01:29:10,985 --> 01:29:12,134
Quinlan!

556
01:29:12,665 --> 01:29:15,782
-Get off him.
-l`ll take his bloody head off!

557
01:29:16,025 --> 01:29:18,061
-Get off him!
-Put that down.

558
01:29:19,425 --> 01:29:22,895
-Bugger off!
-Drop it, or you`ll answer to mutiny!

559
01:29:29,185 --> 01:29:32,222
-l said, put it down.
-No, Richard!

560
01:29:32,465 --> 01:29:34,820
-Quinlan!
-Run!

561
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,060
Richard!

562
01:31:40,785 --> 01:31:42,582
Are you all right?

563
01:31:43,385 --> 01:31:45,137
l`m fine.

564
01:31:46,705 --> 01:31:49,663
l always weather a storm well.

565
01:31:50,665 --> 01:31:52,383
l get that from Mother.

566
01:31:52,585 --> 01:31:55,099
Yes, you do.

567
01:31:57,785 --> 01:32:00,936
Captain Hilliard wants
to set sail at dawn.

568
01:32:02,465 --> 01:32:06,504
l guess that means his daughter
wants to set sail at dawn.

569
01:32:06,745 --> 01:32:11,614
l don`t care what she wants.
l don`t care about her at all.

570
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:15,257
You`re the most important thing
in the world.

571
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:20,423
Well, you can set sail at dawn...

572
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:24,341
...but we`re not going.

573
01:32:25,185 --> 01:32:26,903
You`re not making sense.

574
01:32:28,985 --> 01:32:30,941
Do you remember...

575
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:34,862
...that lullaby she used to sing to us?

576
01:32:44,185 --> 01:32:45,618
Yes.

577
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:50,663
Will you teach me to play it on this?

578
01:32:55,465 --> 01:32:56,818
Why?

579
01:32:57,665 --> 01:33:00,737
l`m going to have use for it.

580
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:06,061
There`s a baby growing inside of me.

581
01:33:07,425 --> 01:33:09,177
How do you know?

582
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:14,663
A woman knows these
kind of things, that`s how.

583
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:16,338
Lilli!

584
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:24,224
But l won`t let it
be born in civilization.

585
01:33:24,385 --> 01:33:26,615
l want it to be born right here.

586
01:33:26,785 --> 01:33:31,336
Where there`s no evil,
and no lies, and no guns.

587
01:33:33,745 --> 01:33:35,337
You`re right.

588
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,702
We`ll stay here.

589
01:33:40,345 --> 01:33:42,540
Just the three of us.

590
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:45,341
l love you, Lilli.

591
