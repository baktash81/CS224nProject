1
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,363
Caitlyn, this is a process, okay?

2
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,490
But it's important
for you to remember

3
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:37,078
that the only person
who can save us is ourselves.

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,788
He's a monster.

5
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,831
A goddamn fucking monster.

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,751
That's what he is.

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,629
But I can't seem
to get away from him.

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,007
Do you remember what drew you
to Mitch in the first place?

9
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,261
We met at work, and...

10
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,476
he was charming
and mysterious.

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,814
He wined and dined me
and took me traveling,

12
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,399
and...

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,611
he told me it was me and him
against the world.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,031
He made me feel important.

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,449
Hello.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,994
My name is
Robert Montague Renfield.

17
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,246
And just like
all these decent folks,

18
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,083
I am in
a destructive relationship.

19
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was a lot.

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,929
Maybe we should just back up
to the beginning.

21
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:42,935
Mr. Renfield, I bid you welcome.

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,187
I am...

23
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,772
Dracula.

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,774
When I met him,
I was a real estate lawyer

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,319
hoping to make a deal
that would change my life

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,195
and my family's lives forever.

27
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,697
Oh, and it most certainly did.

28
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:59,785
You will make a very good
assistant, Mr. Renfield.

29
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,371
I understand how Caitlyn feels.

30
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,665
I never drink wine.

31
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,500
He also wined and dined me.

32
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,169
He made me feel important.

33
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,006
He introduced me
into high society.

34
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,800
We went to the theater.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,304
We traveled to exotic places.

36
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,640
And then he made me
his familiar.

37
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,228
Which means that I take care
of Master's every need.

38
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,646
Including staff changes

39
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,150
and arranging his special
dietary requirements.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,404
Look, I didn't just jump into
serving the Prince of Darkness.

41
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,823
We had some great times.

42
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,325
But just like all great times...

43
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,660
- Servant.
- they come to an end.

44
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,539
The hunters have returned.

45
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,499
Ah, yes.

46
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,334
The bugs. This comes up a lot.

47
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,504
Dracula's powers come from
consuming human life.

48
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,297
Mine come from eating bugs.

49
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,176
Make sense? Great.
Now, where were we?

50
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,813
I'm coming, Master!

51
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,273
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

52
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,609
Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fuck.

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,702
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shit.

54
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,206
This is a protection circle,
Renfield.

55
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,083
Mm.

56
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,376
He cannot escape.

57
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,962
Let us rid this world
of his evil,

58
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,463
and you can finally be free!

59
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,007
Free?

60
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,803
The moment I'm gone,

61
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,516
they will lock you away
for what you've done for me.

62
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,312
I am your only salvation.

63
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,903
I am your only friend.

64
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,242
I am the only one

65
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,661
who cares for you.

66
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,372
I actually remember thinking,

67
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,418
"He really, really means it
this time."

68
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,090
Renfield!

69
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,676
We are the last of our kind.

70
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,346
From now on, every drop of blood
Dracula spills

71
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,433
will be on your hands.

72
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,942
Fuck. I was not expecting that.

73
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
Or that.

74
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,219
Master, you okay?

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,930
No.

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,015
Yeah.

77
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,975
This is a fairly typical result.

78
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,311
At the peak of his powers,
Dracula goes on

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,355
a full-tilt
blood-sucking bender,

80
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,982
the good guys show up
and do their thing,

81
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,693
and then it's up to me
to clean up the mess.

82
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,239
It's what
I call our transitional period.

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,909
So I take him to a new city,
nurse him back to full power,

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,078
find a decent place
to ride it out

85
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,289
until the whole cycle starts
all over again.

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,999
Uh, excuse me. H-Hi.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,627
May I borrow a pen, please?

88
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,713
Thank... you.

89
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
Which brings us back here.

90
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,679
In the meantime, I come here
and listen to these poor souls

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,056
talk about their monsters.

92
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,849
You were just talking
about Mitch, what...

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,353
I know this is, like,
way down the list of bad stuff,

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,022
but he's also really into ska.

95
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,483
- The kind of music?
- Yes.

96
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,695
Fishbone, Mustard Plug,
Voodoo Glow Skulls.

97
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,614
I fucking hate that shit!

98
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,075
I'm so sorry, Caitlyn. I'm so...

99
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,661
- Mark, I am... I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

100
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,372
Is that the one
that's 99% horns?

101
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,665
Yeah, see,
that's what I was thinking.

102
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,792
No.
That's a huge oversimplification

103
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,461
of ska's innovative contribution
to music.

104
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,756
Oh, my God, who am I?

105
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,594
- Renfield?
- Hmm?

106
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,848
Sorry, no, I swallowed a bug.

107
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,891
Unintentionally.

108
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,435
What-what other way
is there to...

109
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,021
Would you like
to share your story?

110
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,898
No. Thank-thank you.
I don't think you'd understand.

111
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,651
I know it's scary.

112
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,946
And you think things
are never gonna change,

113
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,324
but I promise you,
one day you're gonna realize

114
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,577
that you can have
the life that you want.

115
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,122
But in the meantime, I just hope

116
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,792
that you get something
out of coming here.

117
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,963
I am.

118
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,923
That's great.

119
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,134
Oh, yes, I'm getting something

120
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,386
out of coming here: victims.

121
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,888
But not these victims.

122
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,557
Let's do our affirmations.

123
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,394
I am enough, and I have enough.

124
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,521
I deserve happiness.

125
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,732
I am grateful for all that I am,

126
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,526
and I take full charge
of my life today.

127
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,028
They can repeat these

128
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,905
affirmations all they want.

129
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,742
It'll never make
their problems go away.

130
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,786
But I can.

131
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,288
Now, no one's ever gonna
call me a hero,

132
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,583
but I've come up with
a mutually beneficial solution

133
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,710
for people like Caitlyn:

134
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:47,050
get rid of their monsters
by giving mine what he needs.

135
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,305
Hey, Doug. What are you doing
over there, buddy?

136
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,848
There's somebody
out there, Mitch.

137
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,017
Oh, my God, there's no one
out there, Doug!

138
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,311
Bro, do you think
the Lobo family is gonna

139
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,437
let us get away with this?

140
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,356
We stole
their fucking drugs, man.

141
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,359
I don't want to hear it, Doug!

142
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,319
Goddamn it.

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
- What the fuck?
- Oh, fuck.

144
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,530
That was the best part.

145
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,031
What the fuck, man?

146
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,325
This is exactly why
you never set your picnic up

147
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
next to a pile of dog...

148
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,453
Shit! Okay.

149
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,080
Hello, Mitch.

150
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,082
Uh, look.

151
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,543
Wait, wait, wait!

152
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,003
Okay, hold on. I'm-I'm sorry.

153
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,588
Okay? I'm sorry.

154
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,881
It's too late for sorrys.

155
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,717
You took something
you can never give back.

156
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,594
Well, we can give it back.
That's not a problem.

157
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,972
We'll just give it all
back to you. There it is.

158
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,056
Go ahead.

159
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,392
- Have it. No problem.
- Uh...

160
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,852
- what is this?
- It's the, um...

161
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,521
th-the drugs we stole
from your boss, sir.

162
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,189
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,858
Uh, who do you think I am?

164
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,194
A-A hit man sent to kill us.

165
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,075
I am something much,

166
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,996
much worse.

167
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm a friend of Caitlyn.

168
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,755
Oh, my God.

169
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,008
Get the fuck out of here.
No, no!

170
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,665
Wait. What did you say about
a hit man sent to kill you?

171
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,127
Oh.

172
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,545
Who are you?

173
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,006
A friend of Caitlyn's.

174
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,592
Uh, more of an acquaintance.

175
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,184
You were smaller
from back there.

176
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,352
Funny.

177
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,271
Oh!

178
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,779
Looks like you're out of knives.

179
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,950
I was wrong.

180
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,627
Ah.

181
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,962
Yeah, of course
the hit is going well.

182
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,213
I got Apache Joe on it.

183
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,298
The man cuts out
people's tongues

184
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,716
with a hunting knife.

185
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,344
You tell him his name is racist.

186
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,098
Come on!

187
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,667
Oh, shit.

188
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,294
Oh, shit.

189
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,672
Shit.

190
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
What the fuck?!

191
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,137
What the fuck?!

192
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,528
You, uh, been drinking
tonight, sir?

193
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,738
No.

194
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,781
Why? You interested?

195
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,701
All right,
get the hell out of here.

196
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,536
Everything okay over here,
partner?

197
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,871
Yes.

198
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,706
Just frustrating
being on this shit detail

199
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,374
when there's real crimes
happening out there.

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,543
Drunk driving isn't real crime?

201
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,378
You know what I mean, Chris.

202
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,424
We got a stack of missing person
reports to follow up on.

203
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,301
Come on!

204
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,969
- Holy shit, it's Teddy Lobo.
- What the fuck? Come on!

205
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,096
- Are you sure?
- You know who I am?

206
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,932
I'm Teddy fucking Lobo!

207
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,433
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

208
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,268
Don't do anything crazy,
Rebecca.

209
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,728
I'm just doing my job.

210
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,229
You do your job
in a very crazy way,

211
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,191
especially when it comes
to the Lobos.

212
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,027
Fuck.

213
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,446
Oh, fuck.

214
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,906
Fuck it!

215
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,492
Look out, Chris!

216
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,454
Fuck a dick! Shit!

217
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,123
Don't move! Hands on the wheel!

218
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,584
I got a prescription
for this shit!

219
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,294
Shit.

220
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,880
What did I fucking do?

221
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,423
- Is he throwing drugs at us?
- Yes!

222
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,968
I didn't do anything wrong.

223
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,803
Fuck. Cocaine!

224
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,429
You can't fucking catch...

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,599
Are you fucking serious?

226
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,150
You're under arrest, bitch.

227
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,861
Fuck.

228
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,115
After decades of being

229
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,826
chased away
from every corner of the globe,

230
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:10,455
our options and bank account
have become a little limited.

231
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,290
It's not exactly a castle,

232
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,835
but it is exactly
the kind of place

233
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,631
no one tends to notice
a convalescing monster.

234
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,218
Master?

235
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,763
Master.

236
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,436
Oh, dear Jesus.

237
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,312
Master.

238
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,814
There you are.

239
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,483
You're looking...

240
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,030
much better?

241
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,573
Fetch me the hand.

242
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,991
Yes. Right away.

243
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,326
There you go.
A little amuse-bouche.

244
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,494
Palate cleanser.

245
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,080
Ugh.

246
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,500
Is that good?

247
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,051
What is this?

248
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,343
Uh, that...

249
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,597
Uh, that is, uh...
that's Doug, I believe.

250
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,058
Doug is trash!

251
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,809
You're feeding me trash!

252
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,061
I'm sorry, Master.

253
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,896
This one doesn't even
have a head.

254
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,355
Oh, no, he did have a head.

255
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,524
You know, I don't ask
for much, Renfield.

256
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,611
Just the blood
of a few dozen innocent people.

257
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,987
I know. I'm sorry, Master.

258
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,405
Let's-let's get you sat down,
and then...

259
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,158
I want happy couples,
unsuspecting tourists,

260
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,163
a handful of nuns, a-a...
a busload of cheerleaders.

261
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,582
A busload of cheerleaders?

262
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,125
A busload of cheerleaders

263
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,212
will get me back to full power
like that.

264
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,214
Do you mean female cheerleaders?

265
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,634
Don't make it a sexual thing.

266
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,719
No, no. I did not say it was.

267
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,389
You know it's not the gender
I'm concerned with.

268
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,851
You know, I-I'll eat boys,
I'll eat girls.

269
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,394
It's the purity.

270
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,898
It alone will bring me
back to...

271
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,567
Full power.

272
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,568
I get it, Master.

273
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,863
You deserve better.

274
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,700
But the modern world
is a dangerous place.

275
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,453
Maybe if we were just
a little bit more careful,

276
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,082
we could, you know,
stop running.

277
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,169
You know, settle down,
and I could have...

278
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,174
We could have a life again.

279
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,183
It must be difficult

280
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,480
to be caught between
their rules and mine.

281
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,904
Their rules offer
a confusing tangle of morality,

282
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,657
whereas mine are very simple.

283
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,785
You can kill and eat

284
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,746
whatever you want and never die.

285
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,082
And it truly is a gift.

286
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,543
And yet, you seem to think
it makes you

287
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,045
some sort of a monster.

288
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,299
Do you have any idea
how inconsiderate that is?

289
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,509
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,306
My needs are the only thing
that matters, servant.

291
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,308
And what exactly are my needs?

292
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,644
Um, your needs, your needs
were the, uh...

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:25,025
uh, happy couples,
u-unsuspecting tourists, uh...

294
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,320
nuns, nuns
and a-a busload of cheerleaders.

295
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,823
Indeed.

296
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,659
I suppose this is what
you'd call my health-care plan.

297
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,371
His blood has the power
to heal the injured.

298
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,165
And there's not even a copay.

299
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,375
Unless you consider my soul.

300
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,673
You will get me
exactly what I want.

301
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,133
I cannot go to jail.

302
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,218
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

303
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,094
What do you want to know?

304
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,720
Murders! Murders.

305
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,514
We fucking murdered so many
fucking people in cold blood.

306
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,142
Like last night, for example,
we murdered these people

307
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,353
for trying to steal our drugs.

308
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,980
That's a twofer, my man.
That is a fucking twofer.

309
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,691
Nobody's been in the room yet,
and he's already confessing.

310
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,193
You see that?

311
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,195
I'm gonna take down
the entire fucking Lobo empire

312
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,947
off of one traffic stop.

313
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,698
Put her there, partner.

314
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,824
- Let's go.
- What?

315
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,034
- Let's go.
- I'm out?

316
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,744
- No. No!
- Let's go.

317
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,163
I didn't say a fucking thing, by the way.
-What the f...

318
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,539
- I'm out, baby!
- What the fuck is this?

319
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,792
Excuse me, everybody.
Guess what.

320
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,043
Fuck you!

321
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,420
Fuck you and you.

322
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,381
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What is this?

323
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,132
He was about to give up
everything.

324
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,759
He was ready to say anything

325
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,719
because of the trauma
you put him through.

326
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,429
He was already traumatized
when I found him.

327
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,223
For crying out loud, Quincy.

328
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,557
Your job is
to bust drunk drivers,

329
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,142
not single-handedly
bring down the mob.

330
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,560
He was running
from something, sir.

331
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,729
And then he crashed
into a DUI checkpoint,

332
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
committed ten felonies,

333
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,275
and not to mention eff-you-ing
a room full of cops.

334
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,152
- You eff-you me all the time.
- Fuck you, Kyle!

335
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,072
Look, Quincy.

336
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,158
Your father was
one of the most honest

337
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,744
and incorruptible cops I knew.

338
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,746
And you're a lot like him.

339
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,957
And before he passed,
I promised your father that

340
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,667
I would do my best
to take care of you.

341
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,920
But sometimes, you got to know
when to play ball.

342
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,214
This ain't your stepping stone.

343
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,800
It's your rock bottom.

344
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,437
What the fuck are you guys
looking at, huh?

345
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,493
Shit.

346
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,372
What'd you do this time?

347
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,125
What I do every time.

348
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,127
Catch Teddy Lobo
committing a crime, and then:

349
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,713
What? Oh, surprise,
he got away with it again.

350
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,632
And what about your-your little
FBI, uh, task force up there?

351
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
You guys been back
for four months.

352
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,094
What have you done
about the Lobos?

353
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,971
Oh, oh, oh, a-a wiretap?

354
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,389
Subpoena?
A fucking parking ticket?

355
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,017
A hard stare across a diner?

356
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,312
I am just as mad about
what they did to Dad as you are.

357
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,856
I want revenge
just as bad as you do.

358
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,484
But every day, I force myself
to swallow that anger

359
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,819
so I don't fuck up
my investigation.

360
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,157
And if you cannot learn
to let that go...

361
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,535
you're never gonna get
the justice that you want.

362
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,458

Teddy.

00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,454
You said you want...
You said you wanted to see me?

380
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,916
Take a seat, please.

381
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,216
Do you even know why we became

382
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,262
the most powerful crime family
in this city?

383
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,223
We're not the biggest.
We're not the richest.

384
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,727
However, we are the most feared.

385
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,314
Our reputation for
ruthlessness and violence

386
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,901
is something I have worked
very hard to cultivate.

387
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,904
But lately,
our enemies don't seem to be

388
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,531
as afraid as they used to be.

389
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,741
They're fucking scared, Mom.

390
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:48,289
Not the two-bit punks
stealing our drugs.

391
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,584
Not the five families.

392
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,628
And not
that fucking traffic cop.

393
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,340
This family is an empire, Teddy.

394
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:04,263
I built an empire.

395
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,309
And I need to know
its future is secure.

396
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,856
I need to know
whose hands it belongs in.

397
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:20,278
And I need to know those hands
can get a little dirty.

398
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,656
I know Teddy's up to something.

399
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,618
I'm gonna find the evidence
to make it stick.

400
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,038
Got a lot of orange paint.

401
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,628
What is that?
Some kind of warning?

402
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,715
I think it's lyrics
to a ska song.

403
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,635

00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,054

You think
you'll get answers here?

412
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,131
I think we'll get dinner.

413
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,343
Maybe answers for dessert.

414
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,511
There she is.

415
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,513
You sure you want
to do this, Teddy?

416
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,557
Yes, I am sure
I want to do this.

417
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,643

who runs this town.

418
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,502

00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,215
Not a good look at all.
Abort. Abort.

422
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,050
Can you order me a number three?

423
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,596
The toilet just ordered
a number two.

424
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,690
Sorry.

425
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,323
Who the fuck are these guys?

426
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,462
Move, and I'll blow
your fucking head off.

427
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,715
Take that, tourist!

428
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,094
Get down!

429
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,429
Hey, do me a favor.

430
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,681
Just remain calm,

431
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,061
and almost nobody will get hurt.

432
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,479
Thank you, Teddy.

433
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,272
I came here to connect you
to a crime scene,

434
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,858
and you go and turn it into one.

435
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,071
What you trying to do?

436
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,615
Holy shit, were you trying
to imitate your dad?

437
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,452
What do you think,
your dad died some brave hero?

438
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,621
We beat the shit
out of your father.

439
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,457
And while he was lying there
on the floor,

440
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,501
he begged for his life.

441
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,336
Your dad was a coward.

442
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,464
But you know what? I want to
save you that embarrassment.

443
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,009
I'm gonna give you
the chance to live.

444
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,055
All you have to do
is admit to everybody here

445
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,599
that we own you, too.

446
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,184
So, what's it gonna be?

447
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,185
Shoot me.

448
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,311
What?

449
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,813
You heard me, asshole.

450
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,855
Shoot me.

451
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,982
Shoot me like you shot my dad.

452
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,276
Or was that not you?

453
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,653
Were you waiting in the car

454
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,656
while one of your boys
did it for you?

455
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,491
I'm more than happy
to do it, Teddy.

456
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,868
Shut the fuck up.

457
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,912
Have you ever shot
someone before?

458
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,747
I've shot
a million fucking people.

459
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,582
Then add me to the list.

460
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,000
Come on, tough guy. Shoot me.

461
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,627
If you think
this is a fucking game,

462
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,212
I will shoot you
in your fucking face.

463
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,674
Yeah? Dare you.

464
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:14,011
You want to be
a fucking hero right now?

465
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,555
Okay, fine.

466
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,683
Here we go.

467
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
Congratulations.

468
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,565
You're better than your father.

469
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,254
Fuck! Shit!

470
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,903
Oh.

471
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,323
Are you okay?

472
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,574
Yeah. Yeah. Oh...

473
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,159
That was amazing.
You were amazing.

474
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,786
What you did.

475
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,914
You stood up to him.

476
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,582
How did you do that?

477
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,917
What kind of life would I lead

478
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,627
under the thumb
of one of those assholes?

479
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,214
A very... a very sad one.

480
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,465
Yeah.

481
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,133
Did I watch you
cut a guy's arms off

482
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,635
with a decorative
serving platter?

483
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,179
Oh, uh, y-yeah.

484
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,430
That was adrenaline.

485
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,642
Uh, it was awesome.

486
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,979
Um, I-I'm-I'm Rebecca Quincy.

487
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,605
Officer... Officer Quincy.

488
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,441

489
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,610
Oh, uh, Montague. Cool.

490
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,320
Are you from around here or...

491
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,489
Oh, no. I'm...

492
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,324
Uh, everywhere.

493
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,909
Ah, military.

494
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,203
That-that would explain
all the moves.

495
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,707
Yeah, but forever ago...
The Great War.

496
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,917
Uh... Iraq.

497
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,335
Maybe not great, uh, you know,

498
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,462
but overall pretty good...
Three out of five stars.

499
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,839
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,676
I don't mean to interrupt
whatever this is,

501
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,469
but...

502
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,430
can we get up now?

503
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,181
Uh, yeah.

504
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,058
If I could have everyone
please, uh,

505
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,144
just line up for me
for witness statements.

506
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,646
And if we could all thank
Mr. Renfield

507
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,649
for his brave, uh,
efforts today.

508
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,276
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

509
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,194
You are the man, Mr. Renfield.

510
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,323
And, um, thank you.

511
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,408
Y-You... you saved my life.

512
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,702
I...

513
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,914
saved a life?

514
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,833
You saved all our lives.

515
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,544
You must really not be
from around here,

516
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,672
'cause we certainly don't see
your kind very often.

517
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,591
I'm sorry, what kind is that?

518
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,844
Heroes.

519
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
Hmm.

520
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,897
Wow. That was amazing.

521
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,901
She is amazing.

522
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,235
And she saw me.

523
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,696
She really saw me.

524
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,282
That hasn't happened in ages.

525
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,326
I'd forgotten
what it feels like.

526
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,453
- Maybe there is hope.
- Oh, God bless you.

527
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,746
Maybe she can...

528
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,456
Renfield.

529
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,668
What are you doing?

530
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,087
Get here now.

531
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,922
Ah, fuck.

532
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,050
Do you think it's too late
to grab one of those nuns?

533
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,138
What did we talk about
yesterday?

534
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,264
U-Um...

535
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,935
I've been up all day
thinking about it.

536
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,562
Oh. What's this?

537
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,023
Ah. My plan.

538
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,608
Your plan?

539
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,569
But your plan has always been
to just drink blood.

540
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,029
Exactly.

541
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,532
What have I been doing
all these years?

542
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,952
I mean, look at me,
lurking in the shadows and filth

543
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,037
like some kind
of a diseased animal.

544
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,081
You said it yourself...
I deserve better.

545
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:57,504
So, why am I not embracing
what I truly am?

546
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,798
Which is?

547
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,010
A god, Renfield.

548
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,805
An immortal, insatiable...

549
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,392
Whoo!... all-powerful being.

550
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,311
Everything you said about
the modern world is true.

551
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,232
- It is a dangerous place.
- Hmm.

552
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,484
Only not for us.

553
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:25,197
For them, it's a dangerous,
sad, broken place

554
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,700
full of fear and desperation.

555
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,201
It's weak.

556
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,747
Longing for a powerful force
to guide it,

557
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:37,710
control it, dominate it.

558
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,545
- Like you.
- Hmm.

559
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,008
I mean, this entire society
was designed by Renfields,

560
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,843
for Renfields.

561
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,805
So, why should I
have to adapt to it?

562
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,893
It should have to adapt to me.

563
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,353
- I owe it all to you, servant.
- Oh, no.

564
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,230
I think you actually might have
read between the lines

565
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,690
- a little bit there.
- Indeed.

566
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,817
We're in this together,

567
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,945
Dracula and Renfield.

568
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,573
From now on, humanity
will no longer be divided

569
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,034
by the good and the evil,

570
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,205
only by followers...

571
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,625
and food.

572
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,799
You and I forever,
until the end of time.

573
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,927
Bloody hell.

574
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,387
How is my life?

575
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,556
My life is like a...

576
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:37,103
never-ending hallway
of fun house mirrors, but...

577
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,396
all the clowns are me.

578
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,898
Uh, hey, everyone.

579
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,900
I need your help.

580
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,068
Are you okay?

581
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,904
No.

582
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,740
I need to get out
of a toxic relationship.

583
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,661
Okay. Well, well, well, well,
take a seat and let her rip.

584
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,246
Okay, thanks.

585
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,248
Okay, yeah. Fuck Carol, I guess.

586
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,707
It's...

587
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,251
I hate her, too.

588
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,169
Why don't you start
by telling us

589
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,088
what brought you here
in the first place.

590
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,006
I was on the job.

591
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,633
Uh, for my boss.

592
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,844
Uh, well, and I was
actually following Bob,

593
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,887
because I thought
that Bob would make

594
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,932
a very good, um, uh...

595
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,018
Friend?

596
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,728
Yes. Thank you, Bob.

597
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
Thank you, Renfield.

598
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,649
And then, you know,
I started to hear

599
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,529
all of your stories and...

600
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,286
I mean, they were all so sad.

601
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,246
That's us.

602
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:42,168
And, you know,
for the first time in years,

603
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,171
I felt like I wasn't alone.

604
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,381
You realized you're a codependent.
-Mm-hmm.

605
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,633
I need to change. I can see
that I-I need to change,

606
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,303
and, uh, I want to, but my boss,

607
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,054
he's pretty delusional, I think.

608
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,682
Uh, he thinks
he can take over the world.

609
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,268
He's a narcissist, Renfield.

610
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,644
We all know exactly
how you feel.

611
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,770
- Yes.
- Exactly.

612
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,355
No, he's different.

613
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,357
You can't get him out of your head.
-No.

614
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,859
Ooh, and you feel like
he could kill you

615
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,235
with the snap of his fingers.

616
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,112
Yes. Wouldn't even need to snap.
-Oh.

617
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,656
He controls rats with his mind.

618
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,033
Uh...

619
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,201
It's okay, it's okay.
He's on medication.

620
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,246
Renfield, this is
codependency 101.

621
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,248
A narcissist will take
full advantage

622
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,292
of a codependent's
low self-esteem,

623
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:27,838
but you're the one
with the real power.

624
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,175
And all you got to do
is take it back.

625
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,676
How do I do that?

626
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,262
Focus on your needs.

627
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,140
I mean, I just haven't
thought about

628
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,934
any of my needs in years.

629
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,811
But if you were to stop focusing
on his needs, what would happen?

630
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,855
If I don't...

631
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,856
Yeah, what would happen?

632
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,066
Stop focusing on his needs.

633
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,651
What would happen?

634
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,319
He won't grow to full power.

635
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,696
Exactly.
He won't grow to full power.

636
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,240
What? That's so weird.

637
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,033
Why would you phrase it
like that?

638
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,118
But yes, he's right.

639
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,828
He's absolutely right.

640
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,580
He won't grow to full power.

641
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,416
You can take all that energy
you've spent on him

642
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,335
and put it toward yourself.

643
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:11,757
And then you will be the one
who grows to full power.

644
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,259
- Yes.
- Full power.

645
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,969
Me grow...
I-I'm gonna grow to full power?

646
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,971
I want to hear you say it.

647
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,139
Say, "I'm gonna grow
to full power."

648
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,225
I-I-I'm gonna grow
to full power.

649
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,644
I heard you say it,
but I didn't believe you.

650
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,604
- Nope.
- Let me hear you say it again.

651
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,731
- I'm gonna grow to full power.
- Yes!

652
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,566
I see a smile there
because you like it.

653
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,902
Now, say it like
the world needs to hear it.

654
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,571
I'm gonna grow to full power.

655
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,572
There you go!

656
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,701
- Yes!
- That guy who walks

657
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,412
in here every single week,
say goodbye to him.

658
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,748

685

in front of a bunch of witnesses

687
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,603
at a restaurant would be enough
to put Teddy Lobo behind bars.

688
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,564
You guys don't think I know
what's going on here, huh?

689
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,149
I don't know
how many of you assholes

690
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,650
are on the Lobos' payroll,

691
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,819
but there's only so much
evidence you can tamper with

692
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,821
and so many witnesses
you can intimidate.

693
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,365
All right? Because eventually,

694
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,575
someone brave enough
is going to step forward,

695
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,994
and they're going to help me
take down the Lobos

696
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,871
and all of you motherfuckers!

697
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,999
Permanently! Permanently!

698
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,253
Mr. Renfield?

699
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:18,675
Robert Montague Renfield,
yes, at your service.

700
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,220
You look different.

701
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,263
- Oh.
- Good different.

702
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,848
I really like your sweater.

703
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,266
Oh, thank you.

704
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,435
- I went to Macy's.
- Oh.

705
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,854
Um, I'm here to give
my witness statement.

706
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,316
You always bring flowers
to give a witness statement?

707
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,403
Yeah, uh, well,
th-they're for everyone.

708
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,530
- They're for everyone.
- Everyone.

709
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,450
Do you, um...
Probably put it in some water.

710
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,869
And the rest are for you.

711
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,205
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Pleasure.

712
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,040
Rebecca, is this your boyfriend?

713
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,334
Shut the fuck up, Kyle!

714
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,213
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Renfield.

715
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,007
It really means a lot.

716
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,177
Yeah, it means a lot
that I can actually

717
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,721
do the right thing, for once.

718
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,725
Well, if I could just stress
how appreciative I am

719
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,188
that you're here, uh,
because without you,

720
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,982
- I think I'd be a bit lost.
- No.

721
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,652
You stood up for everyone
who's ever lived in fear

722
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,822
of the powerful forces
shaping their lives.

723
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,408
Okay? And you need
to keep doing that,

724
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,910
because when
people like you stop

725
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,621
standing up to people like them,

726
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,916
that's when
the monsters take over.

727
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,378
So...

728
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,882
You are not lost.

729
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,801
You're an inspiration.

730
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,637
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

731
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,222
It's Robert.

732
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,183
Robert.

733
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,393
This is the same prick

734
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,979
who took out everyone
in the restaurant.

735
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,606
Who does he work for?

736
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,275
- The five fucking families?
- I-I don't know.

737
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,235
But we've hacked into
the NSA's Eye in the Sky,

738
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,778
and we can track him

739
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,447
using all these other cameras
throughout the city.

740
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,073
Yes, I can get you access
to whatever you want.

741
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,617
Yeah, and then we enhance.

742
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,327
- We got a trace on him.
- Boom!

743
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,747
We did it.
Now we can track his every move.

744
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,291
His last known location
is at the old charity hospital.

745
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,002
You have until the end of the
day to find him and kill him.

746
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,297
Give me ten minutes.

747
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,633
I'll take the end of the day.

748
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,928
Can you run the DNA on this pen
through the Bureau's database?

749
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,554
And Interpol.

750
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,017
I can't trust this with anyone
who works in my department.

751
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,353
This pen was found
near a location

752
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,022
where these three guys
went missing.

753
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,399
Teddy Lobo was fleeing
from the same location

754
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,984
when I arrested him.

755
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,319
Huh.

756
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,988
Word on the street is
these are the three guys

757
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,824
who allegedly stole drugs
from the Lobos.

758
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,701
Right.

759
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,911
And the DNA evidence on this pen

760
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,790
just might connect Teddy Lobo
to that crime scene.

761
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,961
Maybe it's a long shot,
but I got to try.

762
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:04,007
Look, I know I-I haven't
handled anything well

763
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,386
since Dad, um...

764
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,806
but I really need your help.

765
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,058
Can you run this pen?

766
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,019
Please.

767
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,666
Let's go. Come on.

768
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,398
What the fuck?

769
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:34,014
Holy fucking shit.

770
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,932
Ronnie, call my mom!

771
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,017
I'm on it.

772
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,103
Ronnie, call my fucking mom!

773
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,902
Hello, Ronnie?

774
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,613
Ronnie, is this
another butt dial?

775
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,282
Did you guys fucking bail?
Hello?

776
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,284
- Guys?
- Teddy.

777
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,286
- What the fuck? Mom.
- Teddy.

778
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,789
Mom?

779
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,831
Teddy?

780
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,291
Do you know who the fuck I am?

781
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,878
- Teddy?
- I'm Teddy fucking Lobo.

782
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,964
I am Count Dracula.

783
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,008
You win.

784
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,803
Who are you?

785
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,971
You were sent by the church?

786
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,056
Church? No.

787
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,307
What are you fucking
talking about?

788
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,600
I'm a criminal.

789
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,311
My whole organization
is about evil.

790
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,022
Evil. Oh, fuck.

791
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,315
Dude.

792
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,608
Why are you here?

793
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,651
I'm here because
I want to find this guy!

794
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,985
I'm trying to find this guy.

795
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,154
He stuck his nose
in our family business

796
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,073
and killed some of our guys

797
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,075
trying to save
a bunch of innocent people.

798
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,661
So, what is he,
like, your fucking roommate?

799
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,080
He's my servant.

800
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,500
He doesn't seem
to be serving you very well.

801
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,006
You've reached Officer Quincy.

802
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,008
Please state your emergency
at the sound of the beep.

803
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,927
Uh, hi, Rebecca.

804
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,096
It's not an emergency.
It-it's me, Robert.

805
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,808
What, uh, I was trying
to ask was, um,

806
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,436
maybe you'd like
to get a bite to eat...

807
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,813
Hello, Renfield.

808
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,690
I've been expecting you.

809
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,525
Please, come in.

810
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,236
Close the door.

811
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,533
Shit.

812
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,036
Marvelous attire.

813
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,830
Very colorful.

814
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,834
You look like the sort of boy
who has to fight 'em off.

815
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,963
So, I suppose that's a no

816
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,258
as to you bringing me
my dinner tonight, hmm?

817
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,718
- A no? No.
- No?

818
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,344
No, not a no.

819
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,431
- No, not no?
- Uh, yes.

820
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,433
Big yes to dinner.

821
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,977
Ooh. Um, a feast.
A full feast, Master.

822
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,729
In fact,
I'm so glad you're here.

823
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,399
Um, I was actually, um...
I was on my way to see you.

824
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,901
Oh, you were on your way.

825
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,112
Yes, but I had, um,
too many bodies.

826
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,239
- Oh, you-you have bodies, huh?
- Yeah, too... too many.

827
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,867
Well, uh, so many bodies, um,
that I couldn't carry them all.

828
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,410
- Uh, you should have seen it.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

829
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,954
The problem is my back
has really been playing up.

830
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,457
Anyway, the-the plan is
to rent a U-Haul, and that way,

831
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,417
I'll be able to get all the bodies...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

832
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,003
You know what? It's so silly,
but you don't have to worry,

833
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,173
um, and I-I won't bother you
with my-my problems.

834
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,841
No, no.

835
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,762
Please, tell me
all about your problems.

836
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:23,600
Tell me all about
the gun-wielding criminals

837
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,477
who came after you
for killing their men

838
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:31,025
because you were protecting
so-called innocent people.

839
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,985
I'm-I'm sorry.

840
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,613
I'm sorry, Master.
I never meant to hurt you.

841
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,282
Hurt me?

842
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,284
Are you actually suggesting

843
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,330
that anything you could do
would hurt...

844
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,957
me?!

845
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,708
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, Master, I'm sorry.

846
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,126
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

847
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,419
No, no, it's-it's all right.
It's all right.

848
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,754
- Really?
- No, it's... Yeah.

849
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,130
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

850
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,925
- Okay.
- I was wrong about you.

851
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,470
I should've realized
what you were capable of

852
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,848
when you were so eager
to join me.

853
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,683
I-I don't think I was eager.

854
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,059
I think that you caught me
at a low moment

855
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,644
and you maybe manipulated me, too.
-No, no, no,

856
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,437
no, no... -And you just
caught me at a low moment

857
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,481
- and used some of your power...
- no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

858
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,568
I use my power
for a lot of things,

859
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,528
but I didn't need
to use it on you.

860
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,905
You were a lawyer
who wanted to get rich

861
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,949
off a real estate deal.

862
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,826
You're the one who used me!

863
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,830
You used my power
because you're a husk.

864
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,125
An empty void
that nothing can fill.

865
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:34,838
The only thing that gave your
life any meaning was my power.

866
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,966
The power you used
to bring me victims

867
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,428
while you pretended
to be one yourself.

868
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,181
However,
I'm the real victim here!

869
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,936
I'm the one
you swore to protect!

870
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,355
And you...

871
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,150
abandoned me!

872
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,568
No.

873
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,361
That's not true.

874
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,740
Just like you abandoned

875
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,411
your wife and your daughter.

876
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,497
That's not... I didn't...

877
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,041
I didn't abandon them.

878
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,753
Look into your own eyes,
Renfield.

879
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:19,091
You're the monster, Renfield,
not me.

880
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,722
It's you.

881
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,849
No. No.

882
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,312
That's enough. That's enough.

883
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,526
What?

884
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,408
I will no longer tolerate abuse.

885
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,744
Stop laughing.

886
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,246
I deserve love.

887
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,665
I deserve happiness.

888
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,960
You deserve only suffering.

889
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,421
Um, oh. I know being undead,
it's a painful existence...

890
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,924
It is... and I empathize
with your pain.

891
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,550
Oh, please. Illuminate me.

892
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,927
Let me learn from you.

893
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,597
I will find everyone
you have ever loved,

894
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,933
and I will drain them.

895
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,311
- I will reduce this... this...
- S-Studio apartment?

896
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,731
Studio apartment
until it's ash!

897
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,527
Uh... uh...

898
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,321
Affirmations, affirmations.

899
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,866
Uh, I'm enough, and, um,
I deserve some happiness.

900
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,244
There is some other stuff
that I have to say.

901
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,289
Who put these ideas
in your head?

902
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,214
Of course.

903
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,429
What?

904
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,811
Shit.

905
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,690
You think Doug was murdered?

906
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,192
I can't say for sure, but I...

907
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,154
I hope he was fucking murdered.

908
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:08,283
I hope he was torn to
itty-bitty pieces and then...

909
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,995
I shouldn't be saying that
to a cop, right?

910
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,414
Karla, margaritas are ready!

911
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,583
Caitlyn! Oh, God. This...

912
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:17,751
Try this.

913
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,877
Are you Caitlyn Berggren?

914
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,503
I can be anybody I want now.

915
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
That's right. Yes, you can.

916
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,050
Did you file a missing persons
report for Mitch Flaherty?

917
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,968
- Maybe.
- Are you Caitlyn?

918
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,553
H-How do you two
know each other?

919
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,347
Um, from this support group
thing. -

920
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,060
Uh, for people addicted
to assholes.

921
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,562
Assholes Anonymous.

922
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,023
At the Livespring Church.

923
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:44,194
I realized that
I can identify healthy love.

924
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,447
I just don't think I deserve it.

925
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,657
Um, and that's partially
the shame talking,

926
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,867
but also the rash...

927
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,243
Renfield?

928
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,788
Can I get through
one fucking share, please?

929
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,498
Is, uh... is everyone okay?

930
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,166
If that's what you want to call it.
- We're all fine.

931
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,001
What's going on? What's going on?
-We, uh...

932
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,419
We need to leave. Now.

933
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,254
I mean, where's the rule
that says we have to talk

934
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,048
about our feelings in a gym?
Come on, please.

935
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,342
Up. Up. Let's go somewhere safe
till morning.

936
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,885
Come on, up.
Everybody, move. Come on.

937
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,220
Renfield,
just take a deep breath.

938
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,222
We are all fine. I promise...

939
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,099
Mark, we need to leave now.

940
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,893
All right...

941
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,649
Hi. Uh, are you here
for the meeting?

942
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,983
Well, come on in.

943
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,445
No! No! No!

944
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:49,468
You can leave your top hat
and cane by the door.

945
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,929
Renfield.

946
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:57,142
I'm...

947
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,603
feeling much better.

948
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,649
Don't.

949
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,112
Would you like to introduce
yourself to the group?

950
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,158
I'm the prince of Wallachia.

951
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:20,332
Some call me the Dark One.

952
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,628
Others, the Lord of Death.

953
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:33,887
However, to most,

954
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,348
I am known simply as...

955
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,643
Renfield's boss!

956
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,241
I am Dracula.

957
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,243
Okay.
Obviously, we're dealing with

958
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,329
a little bit more than
just narcissism here.

959
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,747
Master.

960
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,040
Please.

961
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,210
I should never
have forsaken you.

962
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,092
You could've had everything.

963
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,220
I gave you the choice between

964
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,264
the power of a god

965
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,519
and the pathetic desperation
of humanity.

966
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,189
Why?

967
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,525
Why would you choose this?

968
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,570
Because...

969
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,783
that's what I am.

970
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,079
Master, please.

971
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,789
These are good people.

972
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,336
Good. You've finally brought me
what I've been asking for.

973
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,004
Let's eat.

974
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,757
Please. Please. No.

975
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,884
No!

976
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,554
Please, Dracula!

977
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,417
No.

978
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,130
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

979
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,760
There are some experiences

980
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,472
worse than death, Renfield.

981
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,935
Such as spending
the remaining years

982
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,105
of your miserable life

983
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,066
knowing all the depravity

984
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,402
you've witnessed
in the last century

985
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:58,614
will be nothing
compared to the suffering

986
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,619
I'm going to unleash
on this world.

987
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,457
The world you chose over mine.

988
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,419
When I'm finished,
the entire human race,

989
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:15,132
everyone you care about,
will suffer.

990
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,470
Because you betrayed me.

991
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,579
- Holy shit.
- Hands in the air.

992
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,798
I destroyed everything.

993
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,341
I'll call it in.

994
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,177
I thought
I could save these people

995
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,180
by bringing Dracula
all of their monsters,

996
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,765
but what I've really done is

997
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,811
deliver my monster
right to them.

998
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,939
Did you call it in?

999
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,508
What the fuck?

1001
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,888
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

1002
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,190
It's okay.

1003
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,401
This is not about you,
Miss Quincy.

1004
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,820
It's about him.

1005
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,656
I need to find out
what happened to Teddy

1006
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,992
and punish those responsible.

1007
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,537
You, of all people,
should understand that.

1008
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,456
Well, I was gonna
take him to jail.

1009
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,915
You all should come, too.

1010
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,543
Look, Quincy,
this is a big arrest you made.

1011
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,628
I want to offer you
a full promotion.

1012
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:21,048
Right? Better hours, better pay,

1013
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:23,968
better parking space...
In fact, Kyle's parking space.

1014
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,429
- Uh, hey.
- Fuck you, Kyle!

1015
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,889
Congratulations.

1016
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,517
I know this is not exactly
what you were hoping for,

1017
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:37,274
but success really is
the best revenge.

1018
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,293
Okay.

1019
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,930
Fuck!

1020
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,648
I want the whole city activated.

1021
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,982
Find them.

1022
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,068
Attention, all officers.

1023
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,071
Officer Rebecca Quincy
is now a wanted fugitive.

1024
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:28,282
She and her male accomplice are
armed and extremely dangerous.

1025
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,659
Officer Rebecca Quincy

1026
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,035
and one unknown assailant.

1027
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,996
Proceed with deadly force.

1028
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,837
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1029
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,589
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1030
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,008
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1031
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,679
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

1032
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,391
This crime family of yours,

1033
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,018
would it enjoy witnessing

1034
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,605
the beheading of its enemies

1035
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:04,945
and the impalement
of all who oppose it?

1036
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,863
That's-that's...
that's, like, our...

1037
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,408
that's, like,
our whole thing, man.

1038
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:13,035
And can the family
raise me soldiers?

1039
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,955
We can... I can make
a couple calls, yeah.

1040
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:20,376
Whatever pain
Renfield caused you,

1041
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,797
I will return 10,000-fold.

1042
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:29,093
I will unleash an army of death

1043
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,263
whilst warming my skin

1044
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:37,144
next to mountains
of burning corpses.

1045
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,567
How does that sound to you?

1046
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,825
It sounds like
you got to meet my mom.

1047
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,087
Are you happy,
or are you gonna fuck me up?

1048
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,518
How are you feeling?

1049
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,687
Hope you're hungry.

1050
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,814
It's okay.

1051
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,943
It's okay, your gun and phone
are on the side right there.

1052
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,863
I'm just gonna... gonna
set these down right here.

1053
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,281
There we go.

1054
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,116
- Where am I?
- My place.

1055
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,785
It's not an abduction.

1056
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,039
In fact, uh, you know, I'm very
much still in your custody.

1057
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,917
Mind if I sit?

1058
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,510
Snickerdoodle?

1059
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,304
I don't want
your murder cookies.

1060
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,556
They're just regular cookies.

1061
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,141
Well, I don't know what
"regular cookies" means

1062
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,476
to a murderer.

1063
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,978
Um, I don't really
know that, either.

1064
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,397
Ooh. Careful.

1065
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,981
- You should just rest up.
- Oh. Okay.

1066
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,149
- You okay?
- Yes.

1067
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,901
Give me the...
give me the murder cookie.

1068
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,945
Oh, yeah. -Just not the one
that looks like shit.

1069
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,155
I don't know which one
you think looks like shit.

1070
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,117
Thank you.

1071
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,203
Listen, I feel like I should
give you an explanation.

1072
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,996
No explanation necessary.

1073
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:25,000
I don't want you to think of me
as some kind of... murderer,

1074
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,130
when it's really
much more nuanced than that.

1075
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,048
You know, if you just
hear me out for a second,

1076
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,634
then you'll understand I'm...
I'm not such a bad guy.

1077
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,469
I don't give a shit
what kind of guy you are.

1078
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,179
Okay, there's no need
to be mean.

1079
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,556
Excuse me?

1080
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,141
I saved your life. Twice.

1081
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,934
I'm not saying we need
to be friends, but you're in

1082
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,061
a lot of shit right now,
and there's a very good chance

1083
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,938
I might be the only person
you can actually trust.

1084
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,942
The fact that you are
the only person that I can trust

1085
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,737
just proves that I am
monumentally fucked.

1086
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,405
Well, maybe you're fucked
because of

1087
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,282
- your unresolved anger.
- What?!

1088
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,826
I'm no psychologist, but I've
been to a couple of meetings...

1089
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,536
Oh, you've-you've been
to some meetings? Yeah?

1090
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,621
Where the people come in,
they're like, "Oh, hi.

1091
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,749
How you doing?"
Drink some coffee,

1092
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,417
then get brutally
fucking murdered?

1093
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,626
Those meetings?

1094
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,713
Uh, yes. Those meetings.

1095
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,214
You know what?

1096
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,674
I am angry.

1097
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,801
I graduated top of my class,

1098
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,429
and I'm still working
DUI checkpoints

1099
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,223
in a town with
daiquiri drive-throughs.

1100
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,560
I bust my ass
for a city that is corrupt

1101
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,562
and lets the people
that killed my father

1102
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,230
get away with anything
they want to do.

1103
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,233
But unlike you,
I can't go and take out my anger

1104
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,654
by killing every asshole on the
street who I think deserves it.

1105
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,073
I'm sorry. That sounds...

1106
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,868
painful and, um...

1107
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,207
I'm not taking out my anger,
if you'd let me explain.

1108
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,583
Please.

1109
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,127
Okay.

1110
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,756
By all means.

1111
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,595
I work for Dracula.

1112
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,305
What?

1113
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:02,891
Dracula.

1114
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:04,768
Dracula?

1115
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:07,520
- Dracula.
- Count Dracula?

1116
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,814
No, no. President Dracula.

1117
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,774
Yes, of co... Yes. Sorry.

1118
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,776
Count Dracula.
I'm... I'm his familiar.

1119
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,444
I-I... you know,
I tend to his needs,

1120
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,155
including care, feeding,
uh, you know,

1121
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,908
anything especially during
the daylight hours.

1122
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,869
Like, you get Dracula
people to eat?

1123
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,205
I do other stuff, too.

1124
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,374
Like what? Wash his cape?

1125
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,750
No.

1126
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,336
It's dry-clean only.

1127
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,797
My God.

1128
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,010
I cannot believe
I bought into your bullshit.

1129
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,470
You're not a hero.

1130
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,097
You're not even a villain.

1131
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:46,351
You're just a guy
that kills random people.

1132
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,815
What?

1133
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,733
Rebecca, you were right.

1134
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,777
I ran that pen through Interpol.

1135
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,696
This is beyond the Lobos.

1136
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,906
Whoever's responsible
for those disappearances

1137
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,825
has been linked to cases
all over the world

1138
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,952
going back decades.

1139
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:08,706
If this is the same guy,
he's probably 70 or 80 years old

1140
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:11,333
and he might be
the most prolific serial killer

1141
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,877
the world has ever known.

1142
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,295
So, where are you?

1143
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,131
Where am I? Um...

1144
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,841
I'm-I'm at his...
I'm at his place.

1145
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,509
But-but it's-it's okay
because he's-he's in...

1146
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,635
- he's in my custody.
- What?

1147
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,846
And he made me some cookies.

1148
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,347
You didn't eat the cookies,
did you?

1149
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,976
No. I don't eat the cookies
of strange men.

1150
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,811
Okay. Well, I'm gonna head
over there with my team.

1151
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,771
No, no, no. Don't.
I need to get him to you.

1152
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,064
The Lobos are after him, too.

1153
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,608
I don't know who we can trust.

1154
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,276
Meet me at Café Du Monde
in 20 minutes.

1155
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,864
Okay, just...
please be careful, Rebecca.

1156
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,700
You, too.

1157
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,894
Oh, shit.

1158
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,313
Go, go.

1159
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,235
All units,
you have a green light.

1160
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,321
Commence attack.

1161
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,960
We need to find a bug. Now.

1162
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,712
Why?

1163
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,130
Their life force gives me power.

1164
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,757
Their life force
gives you power?

1165
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,175
Yes. It's confusing,
but trust me, it works.

1166
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,052
Any second now,
a shit ton of guys

1167
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,346
are coming up those stairs,
and if you want me to do

1168
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,974
what I did at the restaurant,
we need to find a bug now.

1169
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,936
- You two, with me.
- Go, go, go.

1170
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,397
Come on.
A juicy spider, anything.

1171
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,440
Yes!

1172
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,402
Give me that!

1173
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:08,535
You're a bad man, Mr. Renfield!

1174
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,329
Yeah, well...

1175
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,916

and someone's like,

1213
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,967
"I'm so sorry
you had to see that"?

1214
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,760
- Mm.
- And the other person's like,

1215
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,762
"It's okay,
I've seen way worse"?

1216
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,431
Yeah.

01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,899
He's a freaking idiot.

1221
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,485
I'm sorry, Bella, but I'm out.

1222
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,945
Get the fuck out my way.

1223
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,156
This whole family
is fucking nuts.

1224
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,950
Oh, hey.
I was just talking about...

1225
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,209
Looks like he's back in.

1226
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,544
Son.

1227
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,754
Oh, Mom.

1228
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,256
Where have you been?

1229
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,466
Oh, I've been getting my hands
real fucking dirty.

1230
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,595
Come here.
I got to show you someone.

1231
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,730
Right there.
Put it down right there.

1232
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,025
Right in front of the head.

1233
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,000
It's fucking Dracula!

1234
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,753
It's the real fucking Dracula!

1235
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,546
Fuck, man!

1236
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,924
He wants to take over
the world with us.

1237
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:55,010
Hello, Mr. Dracula.

1238
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,513
Or should I say Prince Dracula?

1239
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,057
Enchantée.

1240
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,727
The pleasure is all mine.

1241
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,855
We have much to discuss.

1242
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,690
Oh.

1243
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,235
Okay.

1244
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,028
God, I hope
my sister gets here soon.

1245
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,780
There's a lot of heat on us.

1246
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,366
I took my family
to a place like this in London

1247
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,701
the morning I left
for Dracula's castle.

1248
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,370
You had a family?

1249
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,871
I did.

1250
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,209
Um, it was a... a long time ago.

1251
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,378
A really long time ago.

1252
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,380
Yeah, I'm older than I look.

1253
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,215
That's Lilian.
She was five then.

1254
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,008
I thought going to Europe

1255
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,510
to make some big deal
with a count

1256
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,222
would give us
the life we deserved.

1257
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,100
Or, um...

1258
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,061
what I thought I deserved.

1259
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,525
I let them down in so many ways.

1260
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,574
You know,
that's his greatest power.

1261
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,411
He looks into your eyes
and finds

1262
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:06,290
what you think you need
to make your life whole.

1263
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,251
Your... your dreams
and your desires

1264
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:13,756
and your... greed.

1265
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,425
Your shame.

1266
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:21,888
I blamed him for forcing me
to abandon my family,

1267
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,433
but that... that's not true.

1268
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,601
I...

1269
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:30,647
I wanted all those things,
and I chose to follow him.

1270
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,940
I'm not a victim. I'm...

1271
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,777
I made all those mistakes
on my own.

1272
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,324
Look, I don't think
you're such a bad guy.

1273
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,409
Life throws
a lot of shit at you,

1274
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,453
but sometimes
you fall under the thrall

1275
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,455
of a vampire for a few decades,

1276
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:50,334
and sometimes you call
your sister an unbearable twat

1277
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,004
at Grandma's birthday party.

1278
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,966
You should make things right
with your sister while you can.

1279
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,302
Hmm?

1280
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,805
Speaking of.

1281
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,310
I'm gonna call her.

1282
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,522
Renfield. It's so wonderful

1283
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,483
that you have finally
found someone

1284
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:19,071
who does inspire you
to grow as a person.

1285
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,530
Hey, where are you?

1286
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,199
I have found some people

1287
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,326
who will unleash my potential
as well.

1288
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,453
They understand this world

1289
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,748
for what it is
and what it needs.

1290
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,210
Hello, Rebecca.

1291
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,836
Looking for someone?

1292
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,296
Where's my sister?

1293
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,341
I offered you so much, Rebecca,

1294
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:43,345
but you put your faith
in such fragile institutions

1295
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:47,015
instead of something
far more enduring.

1296
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,850
We've got your sister.

1297
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,187
She doesn't have much time.

1298
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,398
Rebecca, where are you going?

1299
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,525
- To get my sister.
- Rebecca, you don't understand.

1300
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,777
It's not just the Lobos. It's...

1301
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,362
Dracula is with them.

1302
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,864
- Fine. I'll go myself.
- Look, please.

1303
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,449
I tried to stand up to him,

1304
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,537
and he killed people
I cared about.

1305
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,872
I can't let that happen again.

1306
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,250
You want to be a hero, Renfield?

1307
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,210
You have to risk everything.

1308
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,879
And as someone
that cares about you,

1309
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,841
you're never really gonna
be free until you face him.

1310
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,467
You care about me?

1311
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,261
Is that what it takes
to get you in the car?

1312
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,054
All right,
if we're gonna do this,

1313
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,057
we need to prepare, and
we need to do it before sunset.

1314
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,684
I'm ready to do it before lunch.

1315
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,394
Okay.

1316
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,563
Let's face it,
they know we're coming,

1317
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,566
so let's go in style.

1318
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,528
Yeah, just guns won't be enough.

1319
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,074
I'm gonna need bugs...
Lots of bugs...

1320
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,742
Wooden stakes,

1321
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,744
uh, crucifixes,

1322
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,330
and, uh,
maybe a protection circle.

1323
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,665
What the fuck is
a protection circle?

1324
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,500
It's a circle
made of powder that...

1325
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,752
It-it traps demons
if you say the right,

1326
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,172
- uh, Latin stuff.
- Forget it.

1327
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,966
♪ Na, na-na-na, na-na-na,
na-na, na-na ♪

1328

♪ Na, na-na-na, na-na-na... ♪

1329
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,264
Oh, once it's dark,
it'll be too late.

1330
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,768
Can you maybe
save that for later?

1331
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,437
Oh, sorry.

1332
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,814
- It's all in...
- Is it in my teeth?

1333
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,691
It is in every tooth.

1334
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:22,444

1338
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,997
No matter what happens
in there, ju...

1339
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,668
Make sure you save your sister.

1340
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,639
Must be nice...

1341
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,850
not needing to be invited in.

1342
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,436
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Don't I know you?

1343
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,898
Because you look so...

1344
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,572
familiar.

1345
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,665
Afternoon, Officer.

1346
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,042
Shit. I'm out.

1347
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,087
You think I need guns
to fuck you up?

1348
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,048
Let's do this. What the fuck?

1349
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,106
Fuck!

1350
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,113
You should've taken my offer
when you had the chance.

1351
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,906
Now the only choice
you're gonna get

1352
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,744
is which one of your limbs
I'm gonna tear off first!

1353
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,912
Go!

1354
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,665
No!

1355
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:49,841
Oh, this must drive you crazy...
Him choosing me over you.

1356
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,885
I don't really have
strong feelings about it.

1357
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,220
I'm clearly the yin
to your yang.

1358
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,639
We've barely met twice.

1359
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,433
You patronizing piece of shit!

1360
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,146
Oh, my goodness.

1361
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,148
You almost scared me.

1362
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,358
Where's my sister?

1363
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,692
Oh, that.

1364
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,277
One moment, please.

1365
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,656
I need to set the mood first.

1366
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,047
Hello, Rebecca.

1367
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,299
Don't worry.

1368
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,218
I won't hurt you.

1369
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,638
It's nice to finally meet you.

1370
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:42,060
I can only imagine what
you might have heard about me

1371
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,187
from poor Renfield.

1372
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,982
Besides making him bring you
people to eat?

1373
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:53,989
Well, we did have
a complicated relationship.

1374
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,576
However, when I saw you
through his eyes,

1375
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,996
I knew I had
to make things right.

1376
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,499
Having Dracula powers
is fucking amazing.

1377
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,086
Stop saying "Dracula powers."

1378
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,171
Fine. What do you call it?

1379
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,674
It's a curse.

1380
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,886
God, you're such
a fucking drama queen.

1381
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,431
Would you please listen?

1382
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,182
They come with a cost, okay?

1383
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,726
You'll become his slave.

1384
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,021
See, that's where you're wrong,
because Master told me...

1385
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,398
Shit.

1386
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,942
Mm-hmm.

1387
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:36,072
For half a millennium,
I've seen only weakness

1388
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,534
in the hearts of men.

1389
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:45,207
And then I looked into yours.

1390
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:54,966
Renfield used only
the smallest taste of my power

1391
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,218
to do what he thought was good.

1392
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,973
Imagine what I could do,
Rebecca, with you by my side.

1393
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,684
We could bring
the justice you seek

1394
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,271
to those who've escaped it
for too long.

1395
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,242
And I can heal your sister.

1396
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:27,708
My blood will bring her back.

1397
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,918
No.

1398
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,003
Say the word, Rebecca,

1399
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,799
and I will undo
what the Lobos have done.

1400
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,385
All I ask in exchange...

1401
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,974
is for you

1402
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,185
to join me.

1403
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,520
No, don't listen to him.

1404
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:51,148
He said the same shit to me.

1405
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,617
Can you save her?

1406
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,036
Yes.

1407
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,459
What did he call you again?

1408
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,710
An empty fucking husk?

1409
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,629
See, that... that is why

1410
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,589
Dracula and I work
so well together.

1411
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,299
I'm a full husk,

1412
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,218
full of everything you're not.

1413
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,639
Strength, power, loyalty!

1414
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,529
Her time is running out.

1415
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:40,655
Oh, join me.

1416
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,032
Don't.

1417
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,412
I told you,
this is what he does.

1418
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,873
So what?

1419
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,583
I lost my dad.

1420
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,252
I can't lose my sister.

1421
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:59,884
And if he can give her
back to me...

1422
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,888
I don't care
if I lose myself.

1423
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,848
You were wrong about him.

1424
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,808
He's not a monster.

1425
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,854
He wants to be better, like you.

1426
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,356
Maybe I can help.

1427
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,944
In all the darkness,
I can find the light.

1428
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,295
Shit.

1429
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,986
That was impressive.

1430
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,699
I can see what Renfield saw...

1431
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,618
in you.

1432
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:57,167
Now he'll see it go into me.

1433
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,889
Congratulations.

1434
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,725
You shot my foot.

1435
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:17,521
Your foot still bleeds.

1436
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,322
Die!

1437
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,498
No! Oh, no!

1438
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:47,593
You can't take my teeth.

1439
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,222
You see, there will always
be people like you.

1440
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:56,517
There are far more Renfields
in this world

1441
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,186
than there are Rebeccas.

1442
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,771
He's right.

1443
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,856
There are millions
of people like me.

1444
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:02,899
I am enough...

1445
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,692
And they're all

1446
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,194
trying to figure out

1447
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:08,446
how to overcome
their destructive relationships.

1448
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,200
Always remember, you're the one
with the real power.

1449
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,160
Millions of codependent people.

1450
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:18,289
I am the dark poetry
in the hearts of all mankind.

1451
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,708
Millions of people

1452
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,711
just like me.

1453
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,089
All you got to do
is take it back.

1454
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,800
Do you know what you are?

1455
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:32,221
Yes, I do.

1456
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,892
I'm Robert...

1457
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,978
Montague Renfield,

1458
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,440
and I'm a codependent.

1459
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,905
You're right. You didn't
have to use your power

1460
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,824
to make me your servant,

1461
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:55,618
because I gave
all my power to you.

1462
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,829
And I can take it back.

1463
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,748
I am enough!

1464
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,876
And I have enough!

1465
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:07,464
And I am capable of change!

1466
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,216
Because I love myself.

1467
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:12,009
I'm taking...

1468
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:17,098
full charge of my life today!

1469
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,810
Look into my eyes, Dracula.

1470
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:24,439
Full power, motherfucker.

1471
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,208
Holy shit, it worked.

1472
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,335
Is that a protection circle?

1473
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:48,796
I got the instructions
off a Wiccan Tumblr.

1474
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,215
Oh. And-and that?

1475
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,217
- Cocaine.
- Really?

1476
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,469
Yeah.
I guess any kind of powder works

1477
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,890
as long as you say
the right magic words.

1478
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,143
Wow.
Thank you, Wiccan Tumblr.

1479
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:11,153
So, um, what do we do now?

1480
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,375
♪ I wake up each morning ♪

1481
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:29,045
♪ With your sweet kiss
on my mind ♪

1482
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,257
♪ The early morning sun
shining through ♪

1483
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,010
Any last wishes?

1484
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:41,515
I wish to spend
a season in hell,

1485
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,270
where all
the amusing people are.

1486
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:52,069

1487
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:55,571
♪ I see your face in every... ♪

1488
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:58,366
Yes, I know this looks extreme,

1489
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,034
and maybe a little fun,

1490
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,535
but to our defense,
there is so much

1491
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,704
folklore out there about
how to actually kill a vampire,

1492
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,248
it gets confusing.

1493
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,916
You know, I've personally
seen him come back

1494
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:09,877
from some crazy shit,
so why not try everything?

1495
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,421
You know, I'm not even
100% sure this will kill him,

1496
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:17,009
but I do know it will take him
a long, long time

1497
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,220
to come back from.

1498
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:23,016

tomorrow and today. ♪

1499
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:27,144

Touché, ma chérie.

1502
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,359
Au revoir, bitch.

1503
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,570
Hey. You okay?

1504
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:39,156
Renfield said
you guys gave me some...

1505
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,992
Dracula blood?

1506
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,661
Oh, no, no.
It's a euphemism for, uh...

1507
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,746
it's an... it's an...
like, an herbal remedy.

1508
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:49,041
Okay. So, do you think
they carry it at GNC?

1509
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,546
Yeah. Yeah, I th-think so.

1510
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:59,469
I love you, Kate.

1511
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,559
So...

1512
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,021
There's only one thing
left to do.

1513
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:12,273
You know...

1514
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,400
I've got to pay
for what I've done.

1515
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,446
I don't want you to go somewhere
just to punish yourself.

1516
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:19,780
You belong out in the world.

1517
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:23,159
People have a lot to learn
from a person like you.

1518
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,161
Like what?

1519
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:28,372
It's never too late
to be a hero.

1520
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,749
Hmm.

1521
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,460
I was lost
in a world of darkness

1522
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,794
for a very long time,

1523
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,797
but with all of your help,

1524
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,924
I, um...

1525
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,468
I found a way out.

1526
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:44,598
Without you, I would never
have learned that...

1527
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,142
I could save myself.

1528
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,355
And thank you
for using Dracula blood

1529
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,565
to bring us all back to life.

1530
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,525
You know, if it...

1531
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:58,527
if it wasn't for you,
uh, none of us

1532
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:00,363
would have learned
what it's like

1533
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,907
to come back
from the other side,

1534
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,992
having seen things

1535
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,244
that you can't unsee.

1536
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,081
And know things

1537
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:13,210
that you can't unknow.

1538
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,128
Okay.

1539
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,506
Fantastic meeting today, guys.

1540
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,842
Truly.

1541
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,471
I hope he's okay.

1542
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,264
- He'll be all right.
- Hmm.

1543
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:30,434
My name is
Robert Montague Renfield,

1544
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,186
and I'm a codependent.

1545
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,355
But I no longer feel
like a victim,

1546
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,816
because I've finally
faced my demons.

1547
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,859
You might also say
I chopped my demons up

1548
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,570
into tiny little pieces,
encased them in concrete

1549
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,447
and flushed them down the drain.

1550
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,866
And if I can find the power
to do that,

1551
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,327
then maybe everyone can.

1552
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,872
