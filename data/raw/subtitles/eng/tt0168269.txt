15
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,683
This is a very old fairy tale

16
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,165
that was first told many centuries ago

17
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:41,844
and still lives,

18
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:45,714
and everybody tells it in a different way.

19
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:19,869
People of the Fairy Kingdom, hey, people of the Fairy Kingdom!

20
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,491
The Royal Herald is speaking to you

21
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,721
Can you hear me?

22
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:35,860
O, what a pleasing message have I to deliver to you!

23
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:42,175
Everything is prepared for the ball in the Royal Palace.

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,197
Dear invitees to the ball, o, dear invitees to the ball!

25
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:50,628
Do not forget that you are invited!

26
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:56,786
Something miraculous will certainly happen at the ball.

27
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,520
It is not without a reason that our land is called the Fairy Kingdom.

28
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:04,685
Do come, do not forget, on my word of honour, you won’t regret it.

29
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,298
The King got up at 5 in the morning

30
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:13,050
he personally dusted the grand staircase,

31
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:19,012
Then he paid a visit to the kitchen, had a row with the chef,

32
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,652
enraged, he relinquished the Crown, but after all tempered justice with mercy

33
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,928
and now he is running along the Royal road checking that everything is fine.

34
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,472
There! Can you see him?

35
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:14,084
- Good day, Mr Forester.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

36
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:16,977
Forester, I wanted to ask you,

37
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:21,692
why do you shiver and look back all the time in these latter days?

38
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:26,622
Maybe, there is a monster in the forest, threatening you by mortal danger?

39
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:29,328
No, Your Majesty, I would kill the monster!

40
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:33,355
Maybe thieves came to the forest?

41
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,692
Nothing of the sort, Your Majesty! I would fight them off at once!

42
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,725
Maybe an evil wizard haunts you?

43
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:43,062
No, Your Majesty, I would sort that out!

44
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,400
What drove you to such a condition then?

45
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:50,391
My wife.
- Really?

46
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:56,037
Upon my soul, I married a cute woman, but she is harsh.

47
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:58,994
They twist me round their little fingers!

48
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:03,438
I mean my spouse and her daughters from her first marriage.

49
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,720
They’ve been getting dressed for the Ball for last three days

50
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,522
they have trotted us off our death!

51
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,079
I mean me and my little daughter,

52
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,958
who became a stepdaughter because of my weakness...

53
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:17,942
I am resigning, I will cloister!

54
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:22,749
if such heartrending things can happen in my kingdom!

55
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,799
Live your life on your own!

56
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,782
Shame on you, Forester.

57
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:32,473
Hush, hush, Sire, if my wife hears you I am dead!

58
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:36,376
Don’t put the blame on me! My wife is a very special woman.

59
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:39,530
Her sister, who was very the same as she is,

60
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,492
was eaten by an ogre. He got poisoned and died!

61
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:47,679
You see what a poisonous temperament has this family, but you are angry with me...

62
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:53,164
Well, let it be so, I am staying on the throne, give me my crown.

63
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,931
Forget it, Forester and come to my ball with your daughter.

64
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,345
Cinderella? Sire, but she’s such a little child!

65
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:11,918
Do as you please, but bear in mind that I will have such a fest,

66
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:16,723
that will make you forget all of your hardships and sorrows.

67
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,257
Farewell!

68
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,157
Everything is familiar here...

69
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,570
the clock...

70
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,640
the broom...

71
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,291
frying pans...

72
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,214
fire iron...

73
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,385
fire...

74
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:36,297
fireplace...

75
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,806
Let’s have a heart-to-heart talk.

76
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,428
Do you know what am I thinking of?

77
00:07:47,787 --> 00:07:49,760
I think about the following:

78
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,308
My mother and my sisters were invited to the ball.

79
00:07:58,799 --> 00:07:59,909
But I wasn't...

80
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:02,711
It isn't fair.

81
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,172
Is it?

82
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,964
They will dance with the Prince.

83
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:16,096
But he has never heard about me.

84
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,764
They will eat ice-cream ...

85
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:23,795
But I won't.

86
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,194
Though no one in the world likes ice-cream as I do.

87
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,919
While polishing the floor, I learned to dance.

88
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,733
While suffering insults in vain, I learned to think.

89
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:42,164
Listening to the cat’s purring

90
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,927
I learned to sing. And no one knows about that...

91
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,567
It hurts, doesn’t it?

92
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:57,677
I want it so much that people notice what kind of person I am.

93
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,887
But I want people to notice it themselves.

94
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:07,078
With no please and bother from my side.

95
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,675
Because I am very proud.

96
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,141
Can it be true that it will never happen?

97
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,875
Can it be true that I will never have joy and happiness?

98
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:24,300
Indeed, it is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never does.

99
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:27,970
One can fall ill because of that!

100
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:45,261
I want happiness to come to me.

101
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,808
It is so boring to receive presents only from myself.

102
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,527
on my birthday or on holidays.

103
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:56,806
Good people, where are you?

104
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,732
Good people, hey, good people?

105
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,773
Well then...

106
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,640
I will comfort myself:

107
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,067
when everyone's gone, I will run to the Court park,

108
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:25,343
I will stand beneath the windows

109
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:28,457
and feast my eyes at celebration at least from afar.

110
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,309
So you are dancing...

111
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:32,256
I am rushed off my feet from weariness preparing for the King's ball,

112
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,220
but you are just dancing.

113
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:39,436
I care about you much more than about my own daughters.

114
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:44,535
I haven’t given a single notice to them for months.

115
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:51,644
While I foster you all day long.

116
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:53,884
Where’s the gratitude?

117
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,719
Where’s the gratitude?

118
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:03,912
I know you wanted to run away to the ball today.

119
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,264
Only when everyone’s gone, mother, for no one will need me then.

120
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,734
Follow me, Cinderella.

121
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:33,370
Do you know, my little girls, what was this good-for-nothing doing?

122
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:35,622
She was dancing!

123
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,597
Dancing, before you have sewn down  my ruffles?

124
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,698
I sewed them down a while ago, sister Anna.

125
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,136
Dancing, before you ironed my collar?

126
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:46,070
I ironed it a while ago, sister Marianna

127
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:47,878
She was dancing!

128
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:52,076
Thoughtless about how tired I am preparing for the royal ball!

129
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,121
I made some coffee to refresh you, I’ll bring it right away.

130
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,059
Keep where you are, you impudent one!

131
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:00,747
She knows all the answers!

132
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,632
She does everything to drive us crazy!

133
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,870
She likes nothing better than arguing!

134
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,527
Where’s your father, you ungrateful?

135
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,581
Where’s this monster?

136
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,167
I saw him in the forest nearby.

137
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:17,266
What was he doing there?
- He was speaking to the King.

138
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,795
To the king?

139
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,497
To the king! To the king!

140
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,701
He was speaking ...

141
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:31,496
To the king? Why didn’t you report that to me?

142
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,755
Where are you, poisonous snake?

143
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:37,330
Hellhound!

144
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,601
Hey, hellhound!

145
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,772
I’m here, my darling.

146
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,796
Where were you?
- In the forest.

147
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,098
What were you doing there?

148
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,435
I wanted to fight the Mad Bear.

149
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,012
What for?
- To rest from domestic cares, my darling.

150
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:59,343
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes!

151
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:06,354
Is it truth that you have spoken to the King?
- The very truth, my dear wife.

152
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,410
Have you begged the King to raise your wages?

153
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:12,845
Somehow it hasn’t come to my mind.

154
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,633
Well, have you begged the King to register me and my little girls

155
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,056
in the Book of the reigning beauties of the Kingdom?

156
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,442
What are you talking about, darling, is it possible...

157
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:26,321
So, you have spoken to the King and wheedled nothing out of him?

158
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:29,806
Of course, but we’ve been chatting just like friends.

159
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:33,535
Poisonous snake!

160
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,145
They have upset me before the ball.

161
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:46,239
Why do I have to do everything?

162
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,694
I work like a beaver!

163
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:55,773
I run and I bustle, I beg and I quiz, I beseech

164
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:56,866
enchant..

165
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,742
I get and I gain.

166
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,372
I’ve got such connections that the King himself could envy me.

167
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:11,730
But that monster...

168
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,752
No!

169
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:20,274
That is settled then, I will drive you out of your own house.

170
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:26,756
And you will die in the forest, and your Mad Bear will eat you!

171
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:31,106
No, dear mother, don’t! Look what I’ve made.

172
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:35,789
I made this rose from satin shreds.

173
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,338
It looks just like real one!

174
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,791
A disgusting flower.

175
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,161
What for an ugliness!

176
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:47,095
What a bad taste!

177
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:52,090
You could pin it to your ball dress, it would be so beatiful.

178
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,685
But if you don’t like it I will throw it away.

179
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,178
Give it to me! Give it to me!

180
00:15:57,593 --> 00:16:00,523
You've said it was tasteless!
But you've shrieked it was ugly!

181
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,976
My dear little girls!

182
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,820
Don’t be angry, don’t quarrel!

183
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,741
To cease the quarrelling I will take the flower myself.

184
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,833
Are the ball dresses, which I told you to sew down during one night, ready?

185
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,656
Yes, mother.
Show them!

186
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:27,182
What a bad taste!
What for ugliness!

187
00:17:02,257 --> 00:17:04,782
Cinderella, you wanted to run to the park

188
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,606
and stand beheath the king’s windows.

189
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:13,532
You may do so, my dear.
- Thank you!

190
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,720
Just put the rooms in order, before you go.

191
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:18,569
Wash the windows, wax the floors,

192
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,678
white the kitchen, weed out the garden,

193
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,956
plant 7 rosebushes under the windows,

194
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,148
sort 7 bags of beans:

195
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:27,133
separate white and brown beans.

196
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,509
Get to know thyself,

197
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:32,857
and grind coffee beans for 7 weeks.

198
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,526
But I will not finish even in a month.

199
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:38,904
Hurry up, my dear, hurry up.

200
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:09,821
<i>They tease me calling me Cinderella</i>

201
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:18,026
because I work at fireside not sparing myself

202
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:22,359
I go round and round the kitchen

203
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:26,386
I am busy with oven all the time

204
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:31,806
I am always in cinders

205
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:41,190
Because of my kindness

206
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,715
I slave away from morning

207
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:50,321
deep into the night.

208
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:54,648
Anyone can command me

209
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:58,825
but no one

210
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:04,643
wants to thank me.

211
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:23,232
I hide my sorrow

212
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:27,955
I sing instead of weeping

213
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:32,233
I even smile

214
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:40,835
Will I ever leave this place

215
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:46,454
with its cinder and soot

216
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,257
Hello, goddaughter!

217
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,125
Godmother!

218
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:40,834
Dear godmother, you always appear all of a sudden!

219
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:42,541
Yes, I like to do so.

220
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:46,709
But last time you appeared out of the dark corner behind the fireplace.

221
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:52,462
Today you come over the air!
Yes, I am such an inventor.

222
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:25,018
You still can’t get used to the way I change!

223
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:29,119
I am delighted with that, I love miracles so much.

224
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,541
There wasn’t any miracle so far.

225
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:35,576
We, the true fairies, are so emotional

226
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:39,424
that we can grow old or young as easily as you, humans, turn pale or red.

227
00:21:40,187 --> 00:21:42,441
We grow old for sorrow and grow young for joy.

228
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,325
You see, how glad I am to meet you.

229
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:49,486
Today you were offended

230
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:51,708
24 times.

231
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,936
Of which for nothing...
- 24 times.

232
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,256
Today you deserved praise...

233
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,670
333 times.
- But they...

234
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,377
Did not praise you even once.

235
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:06,228
I hate those who want to do nothing and adore those who work hard.

236
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,361
I adore you and hate your evil step-mother.

237
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:12,739
I would turn her into a frog a long time ago,

238
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:15,582
but old woman has too many connections.

239
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:20,139
Let’s talk about you. Do you want to go to the ball?

240
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,939
Yes, godmother, I want it very much, but I can’t.

241
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,126
Don’t argue, you’ll go there.

242
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:28,110
It is very bad when the one who deserves to go to the ball never goes there.

243
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,581
But I have so many things to do, godmother!

244
00:22:31,072 --> 00:22:32,896
Today the friends will work instead of you

245
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:34,635
Boy!

246
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,552
Hares will weed out the garden,

247
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,286
mice will sort the beans,

248
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:43,052
cats will grind the coffee beans.

249
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,060
What about the roses?

250
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,507
Roses? Roses will grow on their own.

251
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:07,759
In a moment I am starting to work miracles.

252
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:12,861
I adore this job. Boy, give me the magic stick!

253
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:19,376
First of all, let’s roll a pumpkin here.

254
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,919
Thank you, dear godmother.

255
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,564
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without horses.

256
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,270
Thank you, dear godmother.

257
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,365
Wait, silly girl, how can you coach without a coachman.

258
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:13,316
Miracles are not over.

259
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,704
Coachman!

260
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,391
Coachman!

261
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,618
Bring the coach to the doorsteps after 5 minutes.

262
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,951
May I go now?

263
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:50,464
O, dear, in fact, you are still such a little girl.

264
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,775
How can you go to the ball in such dress!

265
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:09,714
Is it me?
- Yes, it's you.

266
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:18,808
You can trust me, I can see through the people.

267
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,523
Even through those, whom I love very much.

268
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:27,395
I can see clear that even in splendid ball dress

269
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:31,887
you stayed the same nice, industrious, kind-hearted girl.

270
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:38,451
Stay like this. This will bring you luck.

271
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,818
Let us go now, I will hand you into the coach.

272
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:53,463
Excuse me.

273
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:59,480
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice.

274
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:03,926
But let me make a few remarks, listen to me.

275
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,537
Let’s listen to him, he’s a good boy;

276
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:09,673
an excellent pupil, he reads a lot, even makes verses.

277
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,632
Speak, boy, we are listening to you.

278
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:18,007
Dear Cinderella, I watch you working all day long.

279
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:24,628
You have magical hands, amazing patience and you are very kind.

280
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:29,268
You don’t know that, but I’ve become your true friend.

281
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:32,804
Though I am not a wizard, but merely a apprentice.

282
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:38,359
let me tell you that friendship can work real wonders.

283
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:51,319
These glass slippers will bring you luck!

284
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:00,897
Take them.

285
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,145
Thank you, dear boy, I will never forgive your kindness.

286
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:27,027
And now, my dear, remember the most important thing.

287
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:32,496
You must return on the stroke of 12.

288
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,857
At midnight your new dress will turn into old and poor one.

289
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:44,825
The horses will turn into mice, coachman into rat and coach into pumpkin.

290
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,857
Remember that.

291
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:51,436
Well, I will remember that.

292
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,912
Boy!

293
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,807
Thank you, dear godmother.

294
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:42,275
Good evening.

295
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:46,224
Finally. I’m very glad.

296
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:51,229
May I present myself? King!

297
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:56,404
Don’t curtsey on stairs, it is very dangerous.

298
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:59,630
Good evening, don’t take your glove off,

299
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:02,156
I am so happy that you have come.

300
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:04,611
Good evening.

301
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,717
O, Your Majesty, it’s such a annoyance!

302
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:17,526
Your beautiful bertha torn and everyone can see that.

303
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:19,657
Where?
- Look!

304
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,121
What a horrible thing!

305
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:28,726
What an outrage, why haven’t my courtiers reported that?

306
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:33,317
Cowards, liars, flatterers!

307
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:37,670
I am resigning; I am shutting up in cloister immediately!

308
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,195
Since my courtiers behave so badly, farewell, my good lady.

309
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:47,035
How can you get upset because of such a trifle?

310
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,770
Oh, oh, oh! Don’t worry.

311
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:56,180
I will mend it so no one can see it.

312
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,829
Do you have a needle and cotton?
- Sure.

313
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:03,010
I am careful.

314
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:10,015
In this case, let it be so, I am staying on the throne.

315
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:11,760
Sit down, Your Majesty.

316
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,570
Like this, to make it handier,

317
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,020
just sit calm and don’t move or I can jab you.

318
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,749
You can’t imagine how glad I am!

319
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:26,503
I adore new mysterious guests.

320
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:30,183
Certainly, the old friends are good.

321
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:33,763
but I know everything about them.

322
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:36,718
For instance, Puss in Boots;

323
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:39,410
he is a regular fellow, clever cookie,

324
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,707
but when he comes he takes his boots off

325
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,712
and sleeps at fireside.

326
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,125
He never plays or runs with me.

327
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:53,368
Or Tom Thumb, he always plays for money.

328
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:57,879
Hide-and-seek. Try to find him!  That's too bad!

329
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,190
The most important thing is

330
00:32:01,188 --> 00:32:05,373
that their time has passed, their fairy tales are played...

331
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:08,340
While you are...

332
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:15,566
I, the fairytale king, tell you that you are on the verge of an amazing event!

333
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,558
Is that so?
Upon the word of King’s honour!

334
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:23,191
It is as simple as that! It wasn’t worthy to be noisy and capricious, was it?

335
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:30,046
Wonderwork, nothing can be seen!

336
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:35,895
You’ve got magic hands!

337
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:41,105
And you speak so simply, so frankly.

338
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:44,984
I’m so happy to see you! Let’s go.

339
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:13,422
Prince looked at me 3 times, he smiled once...

340
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:14,484
- 3 times.

341
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:15,909
He draw a sigh once.

342
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:20,369
Once. 5 altogether.

343
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,758
The King said to me: “I am glad to see you” once,

344
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,367
Once.

345
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,775
Ho! Ho! Ho! - once.

346
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:30,780
Move along, there is a draught here – once.

347
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:32,519
Once.

348
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,498
3 altogether.

349
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,669
What do you need these notes for?

350
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:42,067
Don’t to be an intruder on our joys, monster!

351
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,723
He always grumbles. Such a ball...

352
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:47,876
5+3=9. Total:

353
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:51,256
9 expressions of high regard from persons of the highest rank.

354
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,260
Now, my dear, I will gain my object

355
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,426
to enlist you in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties

356
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,088
10 expressions of high regard!

357
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:32,539
Prince, sonny!

358
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:43,819
Look, who’s come to visit us!

359
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:48,337
Do you recognise her?

360
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:51,750
Who is she? So?

361
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:59,472
Mysterious and beautiful stranger.

362
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,705
What a smart boy! True enough!

363
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:06,197
Why are you so pale?

364
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,925
Why are you silent?

365
00:35:10,962 --> 00:35:16,663
Sire, I am silent because I can't talk.

366
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:19,176
Don’t believe him, he can.

367
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,329
Verses, speeches and compliments.

368
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:22,990
Let’s go!

369
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,521
I am going to introduce my court to you!

370
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:36,098
Haven't you get tired on the way?

371
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,244
No, I haven't, I took a rest on the way.

372
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:16,854
Let me introduce to you a girl, who has never been here before.

373
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:24,587
Supernaturally sincere and fabulously sweet.

374
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,793
Let me introduce my ministers to you:

375
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:35,176
The minister of ball-room dancing.

376
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,481
Sir marquis de Pas de trois

377
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:47,721
Your Majesty, I know this girl!

378
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:55,011
This girl is a beautiful flower.

379
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,874
A very striking compliment.

380
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,265
Don’t you recognise me?

381
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:15,583
I don’t dare to.

382
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,962
Now we are going to play the Royal forfeits.

383
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:25,683
No one deposits any forfeits and no one redeems any forfeits,

384
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:29,674
Everyone will do what the King wants them to.

385
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:34,532
The first forfeit is yours.

386
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:38,926
How do you find it here, my lady?
- I like it here very much.

387
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:47,056
Then, could you sing something and dance for us?

388
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:48,133
All right.

389
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:53,287
She doesn’t make difficulties! What a good girl! Sonny!

390
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:10,081
I’m going to sing you a little song.

391
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:13,347
A bit of magic.

392
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:16,861
It just makes you heart high.

393
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,126
It is called "Good beetle".

394
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:36,103
Kids, form yourself into a ring!

395
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:39,714
Once there lived a good beetle, an old mutual friend

396
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:43,205
He never muttered or shouted,

397
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:46,429
just buzzed with his wings and strictly forbade to quarrel.

398
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,625
Kids, form yourself into a ring!

399
00:38:56,745 --> 00:39:00,179
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!

400
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,765
We got to love our old good beetle

401
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,930
for his kind soul, what a merry fellow!

402
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:46,605
Kids, form yourself into a ring!

403
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:49,533
I'm your friend and you're my friend, an old devoted friend!

404
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:17,770
Who is that nice old man, who is dancing without music?

405
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,245
He is the kindest wizard in the world.

406
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:23,733
He can refuse no request.

407
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:27,762
Evil people often took advantage of his kindness,

408
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,674
so he stopped his ears with wax.

409
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:35,030
Now he can hear neither requests nor music.

410
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:40,212
Arrange it that my daughters

411
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:44,646
were enlisted in the Kingdom’s Book of the reigning beauties.

412
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:47,977
Listen!

413
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:51,074
The first.

414
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:54,323
Beauties.

415
00:40:56,047 --> 00:40:59,823
Excuse me, madam, The next forfeit is yours.

416
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:04,970
Make something good, magical,

417
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:09,578
miraculous and pleasant for all, who are present.

418
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:13,678
It's as simple as anything, Your Majesty!
- Wonderful!

419
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:45,500
Don’t be afraid!

420
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:50,134
I’m not afraid in the least bit.

421
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:54,051
I expected the wonders from this night.

422
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,591
Here they are!

423
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,890
Yet, where are we?

424
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:04,520
We were carried to Wonderland.

425
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:09,720
Where are the others?

426
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,882
Everyone is in the place he feels pleasant.

427
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,194
Wonderland is vast.

428
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:17,242
But we won’t stay here long.

429
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:25,527
One can be here just 9 minutes 10 seconds and not a moment longer.

430
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:27,730
It hurts, doesn’t it?

431
00:42:30,395 --> 00:42:32,152
Do you feel sad?

432
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,719
I don't know...

433
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:40,038
May I ask you a question?

434
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,568
You are welcome.

435
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:49,223
A friend of mine ...

436
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:52,986
He’s a prince, too,

437
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,235
he’s quite brave and decisive, too,

438
00:42:57,382 --> 00:42:59,454
and he met a girl at the ball, too.

439
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:04,094
He liked the girl so much that

440
00:43:06,763 --> 00:43:08,396
he was wholly at a loss.

441
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,641
What would you advise him?

442
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:20,650
May it be that the prince just seemed to like the girl?

443
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:26,603
No, he knows for sure that nothing of the kind

444
00:43:26,724 --> 00:43:32,309
ever happened to him and will never happen again.

445
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:41,444
You are like a dream or a vision

446
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:45,228
What if I scare you away with my clumsy touch?

447
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:49,795
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment

448
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:54,250
and wake up in despair?

449
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,727
What if fall into forgetful sleep for a moment

450
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,824
and wake up in despair?

451
00:44:46,691 --> 00:44:51,191
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.

452
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:57,465
Dear, kind, mysterious guest.

453
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:09,674
Your time is up, your time is up, end your conversation.

454
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,093
End your conversation...

455
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,648
Are we still in Wonderland?

456
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,675
I don’t know.

457
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:28,494
I think we are.

458
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:32,970
What do you think?
- So do I.

459
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:40,190
May I have the next dance with you, o charming young lady?

460
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:44,673
I beg your pardon, marquis, but our guest has been already invited by me!

461
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:05,485
You know, Prince, there have been some days when I got so tired

462
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:08,695
that I was dreaming about sleeping even when I was asleep.

463
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:14,480
But today I'm so happy; I am dancing and I want to dance more and more.

464
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:24,200
Wonderland! What a success I had there!

465
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,650
What a hairdressing saloon is there!

466
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:31,615
What a perfume is there!

467
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,638
Thank you!

468
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:46,227
The wine we drank from a magic glass in the magic tavern

469
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:49,250
was fabulously excellent!

470
00:48:06,705 --> 00:48:09,439
Try to guess what am I thinking of?

471
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:14,937
You think it would be lovely to have some ice-cream.

472
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,383
I am ashamed to confess, you are right.

473
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:54,216
Finally, I am happy!

474
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:07,088
An hour, a full hour and 15 minutes.

475
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,286
One hour!

476
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:19,091
Dear Cinderella!

477
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:25,167
I have a very sad news.

478
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:27,374
Sad?
- Don’t get upset!

479
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,833
The King ordered to set back the clock one hour.

480
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:36,157
He wanted guests to dance longer.

481
00:49:37,368 --> 00:49:40,540
That is, I have nearly no time left?

482
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,776
Nearly.

483
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,359
I'm begging you, don’t get upset!

484
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:54,906
I am not a wizard; I am merely a apprentice,

485
00:49:55,027 --> 00:50:00,134
but I think everything can still come to a happy end!

486
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:28,520
The best ice-cream in the world, I've selected it personally!

487
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,008
What's the matter with you?

488
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:52,912
Thank you, dear prince. Thank you for everything.

489
00:50:54,286 --> 00:51:00,015
Thank you for your care. Thank you for your politeness,

490
00:51:00,446 --> 00:51:07,109
tenderness and kindness. You are the best person I ever met.

491
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,527
Why are you talking to me so sadly?

492
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:16,377
Because I have to leave.

493
00:51:16,497 --> 00:51:23,257
No, I can't let you go!

494
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,494
I thought it over,

495
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:28,641
after the ice-cream I would have told you straight that I love you.

496
00:51:29,804 --> 00:51:32,500
What am  I talking?

497
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,905
Don’t go!
Stay!

498
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,138
I may not!

499
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:38,317
I am not as ridiculous as it seems to you,

500
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:40,346
it's just because I love you.

501
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:43,641
It’s no good to be angry with one because of that!

502
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:44,879
Forgive me!

503
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:50,298
I love you.

504
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:32,902
The boy got so active!

505
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:33,368
Dear Cinderella!

506
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:41,068
I brought this ruby glass of ice-cream to comfort you.

507
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:46,920
Do me a favour, taste it. I will return the glass to the palace.

508
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:50,044
Do you want some?

509
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:24,070
What happened? Are you sick, my boy?

510
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:27,185
I knew it!

511
00:54:29,197 --> 00:54:32,039
I am absolutely healthy, Sire!

512
00:54:32,553 --> 00:54:36,133
It is bad to cheat the old man!

513
00:54:39,383 --> 00:54:41,338
40 serves of ice-cream!

514
00:54:41,772 --> 00:54:45,512
You have overeaten! Such a shame, 40 serves;

515
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:50,374
you haven't allowed yourself such a surfeit since you were 6.

516
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:54,859
Your stomach is frost-bitten!

517
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:56,931
I haven’t touched the ice-cream!

518
00:54:58,389 --> 00:54:59,334
Really?

519
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:04,232
Indeed. What’s the matter with you then?

520
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:09,884
I fell in love.

521
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:13,267
Yes, I fell in love.

522
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:17,685
with our kind and mysterious guest.

523
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:22,000
But she ran away so fast,

524
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,296
that this glass slipper slipped off her foot and fell on the stairs.

525
00:55:33,736 --> 00:55:36,189
You fell in love?

526
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:40,113
You fell in love?

527
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:43,561
I am resigning.

528
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:52,628
Deuce!  Hell! Why nobody reported me that he has grown up?

529
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:55,855
I’ve sung you the whole song about it!

530
00:55:57,827 --> 00:55:59,352
Really?

531
00:55:59,783 --> 00:56:03,695
All right then, I'll stay.

532
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:13,690
The boy fell in love.

533
00:56:20,129 --> 00:56:22,400
It is such a happiness!
- It isn't happiness!

534
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:26,137
Nonsense!
- She loves me not!

535
00:56:26,256 --> 00:56:30,990
Nonsense, she does, that’s why she didn’t stay for supper!

536
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,132
No, papa!

537
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:38,082
I feel offended!

538
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:41,176
I will find her!

539
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:45,319
Hello!

540
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:52,562
Gatekeepers of the Fairy Kingdom, can you hear me?

541
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:56,888
We are listening, Your Majesty!

542
00:56:57,009 --> 00:57:04,391
Has the girl crossed the gate of the Fairy Kingdom?

543
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:07,307
Having a single slipper on?

544
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:10,484
How many slippers did she have on?

545
00:57:11,064 --> 00:57:13,982
One!

546
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,568
Blonde or brunette?

547
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,314
Blonde!

548
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,793
How old was she?

549
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:26,854
About 16!

550
00:57:27,467 --> 00:57:28,776
Pretty?

551
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,467
Very pretty!

552
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:38,293
Nobody crossed the gate!

553
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:43,639
Why did you questioned me so thoroughly, fools?

554
00:57:44,203 --> 00:57:47,833
Out of idle curiosity!

555
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:52,093
Do not let anybody out, all right?

556
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:56,540
Lock the gate!

557
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:07,120
Soldiers, do you know what love is?

558
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,740
My only son and heir

559
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:16,897
fell in love for real.

560
00:58:18,422 --> 00:58:20,576
Do you understand the situation?

561
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:25,451
They had had an important conversation and then she ran away.

562
00:58:25,999 --> 00:58:28,369
That can happen.
- Don’t interrupt me!

563
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,844
What can we do?

564
00:58:30,964 --> 00:58:35,248
I will go with the minister round the country

565
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:38,277
watching through spyglasses,

566
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:43,711
but you will search the girl with the help of this glass slipper.

567
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:50,510
The girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.

568
00:58:50,629 --> 00:58:51,702
Is it clear?

569
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:53,210
It’s clear!

570
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:57,973
Now go to my treasury;

571
00:58:58,094 --> 00:59:02,420
there you will be given seven-leagued boots for swiftness.

572
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:07,424
I wish the girl to be found before nightfall.

573
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,443
Good morning, madams!

574
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:50,880
Excuse us for our discourtesy.

575
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:55,465
It is known that it is improper to appear without the boots before the ladies’ eyes.

576
00:59:55,862 --> 00:59:58,398
Begging your pardon, madams, they are seven-league boots.

577
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,172
I see, Corporal, why did you put them on?

578
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:05,351
To catch the prince’s bride, madam!

579
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:08,401
These boots exhaust us,

580
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,452
they take us far beside the target.

581
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:16,086
You won’t believe it, madam, how many girls we left behind immediately after start.

582
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:21,224
And even more girls were frightened out of their wits.

583
01:00:23,225 --> 01:00:26,125
Let me ask your daughters to fit the slipper.

584
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:29,151
You are welcome, which size?

585
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:33,659
I don’t know, but the girl who can fit the slipper upon her foot is the Prince’s bride.

586
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:40,008
The slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter, corporal, call for the King!

587
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:44,069
I'm telling you, the slipper fits upon the foot of one of my daughter!

588
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:47,528
I would be very grateful.

589
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,259
You know what I mean?

590
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,460
I will load you with money!

591
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:56,619
Thank you, but what about fitting?

592
01:00:57,812 --> 01:00:58,972
Two barrels of wine!

593
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:02,718
I can’t do it without fitting, an order is an order.

594
01:01:06,407 --> 01:01:10,833
Anna, Mary-Anna!

595
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:16,773
Draw your big toe in!

596
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:26,916
The heel.

597
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:37,418
Have you another size?
- Negative, madam.

598
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,682
What is to be done?

599
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:53,257
Cinderella!

600
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,737
She has magical hands, she can do everything!

601
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:01,897
Cinderella!

602
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:10,769
Cinderella, sometimes we were at quarrel with you,

603
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:13,655
but you shouldn’t be angry with us because of that.

604
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,656
I aways meant well to you.

605
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:20,597
Repay me with good!

606
01:02:22,995 --> 01:02:28,249
You can do everything, you have magical hands!

607
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,240
Mother!

608
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:35,903
Cinderella, put this slipper on...
- On my foot!

609
01:02:37,228 --> 01:02:38,007
Anna’s foot.

610
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,297
If the slipper fits her foot

611
01:02:42,951 --> 01:02:44,584
the prince will marry her!

612
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:49,093
Mother, I can’t...
- Cinderella,

613
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:53,299
I am begging you, my dear, beloved daughter.

614
01:02:53,418 --> 01:02:58,485
But I can’t!
- Cinderella, help Anna!

615
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:01,038
Help Anna!

616
01:03:03,186 --> 01:03:04,529
Not at any price!

617
01:03:06,187 --> 01:03:07,861
Go and say farewell to your father.

618
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:12,018
I will drive him out of his own home.

619
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:14,005
You know about my connections;

620
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,335
he’ll lose his head, he’ll die in prison or in dungeon.

621
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:18,603
Don’t!

622
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,918
Hey, hubby!
- Mother!

623
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:26,556
All right!

624
01:03:28,578 --> 01:03:29,258
I...

625
01:03:30,965 --> 01:03:32,573
I’ll try.

626
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:09,242
Congratulations, Anna!

627
01:04:10,899 --> 01:04:13,219
Your Royal Highness!

628
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:22,312
Well, now they will get it hot!

629
01:04:24,846 --> 01:04:29,643
I will introduce my own rules. Don’t cry, Mary-Anna

630
01:04:29,763 --> 01:04:33,564
The King is a widower, I’ll get a place for you, too.

631
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:40,220
It’s a pity the Kingdom is too small, there's little one can afford.

632
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:47,297
Well, I'll scrap with the neighbours, I’m good at it!

633
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:55,637
Soldiers, go to the palace on bare feet,

634
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:57,567
follow the Royal mother-in-law!

635
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:01,673
Forward, march! Hurrah!

636
01:07:55,598 --> 01:07:57,306
I scared you, my child!

637
01:07:57,935 --> 01:08:01,266
Don’t be afraid, I’m not a villain or bad man.

638
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:03,620
I am just an unhappy prince.

639
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,019
I have been wandering in the forest from the first light.

640
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:09,761
I am out of my mind with worry!

641
01:08:10,026 --> 01:08:15,189
Do you know who was singing in the forest nearby?

642
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:19,482
Have you met anybody?

643
01:08:26,047 --> 01:08:28,997
Never in my life was I so unhappy.

644
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:37,965
I have to find this girl to ask her why has she offended me.

645
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:43,966
I can’t see you, but somehow it seems to me that you are a good girl.

646
01:08:47,598 --> 01:08:49,306
Help me!

647
01:08:53,201 --> 01:08:57,374
Wait!

648
01:08:59,496 --> 01:09:01,899
Wait!

649
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,474
I don’t know, maybe I went mad.

650
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:10,111
Wasn’t it you who was singing here, in the forest?

651
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,541
The way you shake your head seems familiar to me!

652
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:22,397
And this golden hair! Show me your face!

653
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,481
Where are you?

654
01:09:32,608 --> 01:09:34,299
Where are you?

655
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:36,255
Where are you?

656
01:09:54,406 --> 01:09:58,450
If an evil wizard put spell on you, I will kill him!

657
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:04,369
If you are poor and simple girl, I will be glad to hear it.

658
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:06,334
Princesses always play hard-to-get.

659
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:08,793
If you don’t love me

660
01:10:09,216 --> 01:10:12,912
I will perform many feats of valour and make you to like me!

661
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:16,559
Say something!

662
01:10:17,404 --> 01:10:21,024
Where are you?

663
01:10:23,195 --> 01:10:24,554
Where are you?

664
01:10:28,151 --> 01:10:29,730
Where’s she?

665
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:34,208
Where is she, my dear daughter?

666
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:38,963
Here she is, Your Majesty, my dear son-in-law!

667
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:41,159
Nonsense!

668
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,266
Why nonsense? Take a look at her foot!

669
01:10:44,385 --> 01:10:50,081
I don’t need to look at her foot since her face shows that it isn’t she.

670
01:10:50,201 --> 01:10:52,396
But the slipper fits her foot!

671
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:54,235
It isn’t she anyway!

672
01:10:54,355 --> 01:10:59,157
A King's word is a word of honour! The glass slipper fits her foot,

673
01:10:59,278 --> 01:11:04,278
consequently, she is the Prince's bride, that’s what you have told to the soldiers.

674
01:11:05,355 --> 01:11:06,797
Is it true, soldiers?

675
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,333
They are silent!

676
01:11:09,721 --> 01:11:15,041
No-no-no, it's a done deal, my dear son-in-law!

677
01:11:15,161 --> 01:11:20,478
Damn it! What a mess, what should we do, marquis?

678
01:11:20,963 --> 01:11:22,521
Of course, we should dance!

679
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,470
What’s the matter with you, my beauty?

680
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,851
You are walking lamely, my beauty!

681
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:18,829
Softy!

682
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:22,177
The slipper ran away from you, beauty!

683
01:12:30,341 --> 01:12:32,505
It is impossibly small for you!

684
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:35,379
What a wizard managed to put it on your foot?

685
01:12:39,075 --> 01:12:40,964
It is too small for you either, miss!

686
01:12:42,953 --> 01:12:44,843
It doesn’t matter!

687
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:49,964
The unknown beauty has lost this slipper in the palace, too!

688
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:54,356
But it was a bit large for the unknown beauty.

689
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:56,603
Intriguer!

690
01:12:57,565 --> 01:13:00,001
I will complain to the King!

691
01:13:00,905 --> 01:13:04,760
I will complain against the King! Your Majesty!

692
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:09,948
It’s all right, madam, don’t be upset.

693
01:13:10,528 --> 01:13:14,012
Maybe you have one more daughter?

694
01:13:14,132 --> 01:13:15,116
She has!

695
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:21,293
Please, don’t chuckle!

696
01:13:23,811 --> 01:13:25,734
Who is this girl?

697
01:13:25,854 --> 01:13:28,801
My own daughter, Cinderella.

698
01:13:29,303 --> 01:13:31,209
She is as kind as I am!

699
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:35,187
For father’s sake she helped Anna to put the slipper on.

700
01:13:35,602 --> 01:13:37,077
But I didn't know anything!

701
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,095
I found her weeping bitterly in the garden.

702
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:42,553
Look what she wept at!

703
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:46,763
Another one!

704
01:13:50,313 --> 01:13:53,429
It’s her!

705
01:13:54,988 --> 01:13:58,088
Look at her, it’s her.

706
01:13:59,659 --> 01:14:02,277
Prince, where’s the prince?

707
01:14:02,626 --> 01:14:06,023
What for fabulous piggishness!

708
01:14:10,136 --> 01:14:12,921
I can stay in this kingdom no longer!

709
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,943
You snake!

710
01:14:23,842 --> 01:14:26,080
Follow me, my little girls!

711
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,614
Who do you think you are, you just put the crown in your head.

712
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:40,880
Where’s the prince?

713
01:14:41,691 --> 01:14:42,903
His Royal Highness...

714
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:48,494
To chase away his worries, he ran away,

715
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,072
at 11 o’clock, local time.

716
01:14:53,549 --> 01:14:57,096
It’s my fault, why didn’t I tell everything to the prince?

717
01:14:57,444 --> 01:15:01,621
Now everyone will be lost, the prince and I...

718
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:06,456
the king and the whole kingdom!

719
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:10,872
Prince, dear prince, where are you?

720
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:10,991
He’s here!

721
01:15:10,992 --> 01:15:12,021
He’s here!

722
01:15:23,876 --> 01:15:26,918
Sonny!

723
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:30,465
I am not a wizard, I am just a apprentice,

724
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:36,429
but friendship can work real wonders!

725
01:15:36,843 --> 01:15:41,240
Good boy, I give you a distinction.

726
01:15:41,498 --> 01:15:44,862
Change into other clothes, Cinderella, your wedding-day is near.

727
01:16:03,575 --> 01:16:06,088
Get married, get married!

728
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:11,690
Yet Cinderella hasn’t told if she loves me.

729
01:16:19,532 --> 01:16:25,929
I don’t like when people are disturbed while sorting out their relationship.

730
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:55,217
Well, my friends, we found our way to entire happiness.

731
01:16:56,327 --> 01:16:58,316
Everyone is happy.

732
01:16:59,063 --> 01:17:03,605
Except, old Forester’s wife, but it's her own fault.

733
01:17:03,725 --> 01:17:08,096
Connections are connections, but one must have conscience, too.

734
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:14,044
One day you will be asked: what can you present?

735
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:20,284
And no connection can help to make a foot small,

736
01:17:20,686 --> 01:17:25,128
make a soul  great and a heart  fair.

737
01:17:29,273 --> 01:17:33,831
Page-boy will find his happiness, too.

738
01:17:36,914 --> 01:17:41,043
A daughter will be born to the prince, she will be the spitting image of Cinderella.

739
01:17:42,203 --> 01:17:46,098
And the page-boy will fall in love in her.

740
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:52,194
And I will gladly bestow my granddaughter in marriage to him.

741
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:55,433
I adore these wonderful features of his soul:

742
01:17:55,553 --> 01:17:59,317
faithfulness, generosity, ability to love.

743
01:17:59,437 --> 01:18:06,298
I adore these fabulous feelings, which will never come to an...

744
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:08,071
end.

745
01:18:09,016 --> 01:18:12,845
THE END
