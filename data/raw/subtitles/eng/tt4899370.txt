1
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,614
<i>I left this place a thousand
times in my mind,</i>

2
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,825
<i>but I never actually went anywhere.</i>

3
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,704
<i>What was the final straw?</i>

4
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,665
<i>I had nothing.</i>

5
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,169
<i>There's the unsupportive family.</i>

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,130
No, I don't give a crap
if that's what she wants.

7
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,092
She's not gonna sit in my
goddamn house and do nothing!

8
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,178
<i>The dead-end job.</i>

9
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,931
<i>Jungle Ru went up and down</i>

10
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,225
<i>On a big adventure</i>

11
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>Then getting fired from the
dead-end job for being hungover.</i>

12
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,604
Yeah...

13
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,440
This isn't working.
I get it.

14
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:50,236
Megan, it's just, you don't really
connect with people very well.

15
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,946
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this.

16
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,447
No, no, no, it's fine.

17
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,574
Really.

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>In the end, you don't leave
because you have somewhere to go.</i>

19
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,171
<i>You leave because there's
nothing keeping you there.</i>

20
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>All I know is that
after my best friend died,</i>

21
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,443
<i>there was nothing left for me here.</i>

22
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,239
<i>I checked out of life completely.</i>

23
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,996
<i>And I realized if I didn't leave now,</i>

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>I wasn't gonna be far behind him.</i>

25
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,766
<i>Due to heightened security measures,</i>

26
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>please keep bags with you at all times.</i>

27
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,938
<i>All unaccompanied luggage
will be confiscated.</i>

28
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,178
Hello?
<i>Yeah.</i>

29
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:43,599
Uh, what is this pamphlet for the
Marines that I found in your dresser?

30
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,060
I think there's some pot left in the
sock drawer if you keep digging.

31
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,978
Yeah, don't be a wise ass,
this is my house.

32
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,898
And just so you know, running
away isn't gonna solve anything,

33
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,816
<i>'cause that's all you've ever done...</i>
Hang up that phone!

34
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,401
Let's go!

35
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,112
Let's go, move, move, move.

36
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,574
Let's go, faster, come on, move, move.

37
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,910
Tuck in that shirt!
My shirt?

38
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,578
Tuck your shirt in!

39
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,330
Fix your hair!

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,124
Get in line, move!
Let's go, move.

41
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,543
You have taken the first
step in becoming a member

42
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,337
of the world's finest fighting force,

43
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,005
the United States Marine Corps.

44
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,259
Tens of thousands of Marines
have begun outstanding service

45
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,261
for our country starting right here.

46
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,098
You will continue that proud tradition.
Do you understand?

47
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,474
Aye-aye, sir!

48
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,600
Say it like you mean it.

49
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,686
Do you understand?
Yes, sir!

50
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:35,401
Right now, right now.

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,239
When I tell you to move,
you better move!

52
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,662
Marine Corps!

53
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,039
You're an embarrassment!

54
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,377
I said three, step up.

55
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,967
Get off my wall.

56
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,176
I can make it!

57
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,429
Get off my rope and
get to the back of the line.

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,019
Get those arms straight, Leavey!

59
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,729
Get those arms straight!

60
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,147
I want straight arms!

61
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,441
You're gonna die out there,
you hear me?

62
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,861
Have fun at the graduation.
You're a failure.

63
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,446
Get out of my face.

64
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,059
Ready, front.

65
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,978
Platoon 5004,

66
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,521
dismissed!

67
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,149
Aye-aye, ma'am!

68
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,919
Megan?

69
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,796
Hello!

70
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,548
Hi.
Hi. We made it.

71
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,134
Well, you didn't.
You actually missed it, but...

72
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,303
Ah! You look like a little toy soldier.

73
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,013
Great, thanks.

74
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,184
You missed it, the whole
ceremony, but that's okay.

75
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,853
Really?
Yeah, it's over.

76
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:38,065
Jim... He really
wanted to see you graduate.

77
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,901
Geez, you'd think with all the
taxes we give to the military,

78
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,737
they'd come up with some kind
of street sign situation.

79
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,280
Hey, sport.
Hey.

80
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,324
Honey, we missed it.

81
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,827
We missed it?
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,829
Can you do it again for us?

83
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,249
<i>The United States will not
and cannot run that risk</i>

84
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,500
<i>to the American people.</i>

85
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,587
<i>Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession
of weapons of mass destruction</i>

86
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,923
<i>for a few more months
and years is not an option...</i>

87
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,842
Well, you don't look terrible.

88
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,553
Thanks.

89
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,806
No, I mean, I thought they were
gonna make you all <i>G.I. Jane,</i>

90
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,141
you know. No hair...

91
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,976
Hey, could we get the check, please?
Yeah.

92
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,519
You got it.
I just don't know

93
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,603
why you wanna do this.

94
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,355
Yeah, I know you don't.

95
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,233
So, no one else came today?

96
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,988
No, Dad couldn't get off work, so lay off.

97
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,614
I'm not talking bad about him,

98
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,992
although he does owe me
two grand in alimony.

99
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,660
You slept with his best friend.

100
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,328
Megan...
So I think you're even.

101
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,496
Megan...

102
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,542
Look, if...

103
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,464
If something bad was to happen,
God forbid, are we on the list?

104
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,133
I mean, just so that we would get notified?

105
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,718
Yeah, you're on the list.

106
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,762
Okay, so then, like, with your father?

107
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,435
You wanna know how much
you make if I kick?

108
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,978
Megan, don't be a shit, no, that's...

109
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,646
I just, I don't know how this works.

110
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,064
Thank you so much for coming, Mom.

111
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,483
Honey, I'm asking you because I don't...

112
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,650
Thank you for coming.

113
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,818
No, thanks for coming.
I didn't expect...

114
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,028
Bye, I love you.
Okay, bye, thank you.

115
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,112
Love you!

116
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,739
It's not like we drove
400 hours to get here.

117
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,700
<i>Give Iraq one last chance.</i>

118
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,666
<i>Jones, is tobacco use
permitted in a government vehicle?</i>

119
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,709
No, Master Sergeant.

120
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,212
Is your patrol car a government vehicle?

121
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,796
Yes, Master Sergeant.

122
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,508
Do we tolerate screw-ups,
losers, or laggards?

123
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,675
No, Master Sergeant.

124
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,678
Do we know the meaning of the
words won't, can't, or late?

125
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,430
No, Master Sergeant.

126
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,643
We have three new joins
assigned to the patrol section.

127
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,562
Privates Timmins, Lopez,
and Leavey, welcome aboard.

128
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,440
I trust you're gonna make us all proud.

129
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,362
Whoo!
It was so embarrassing.

130
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,322
Are we not doing it with salt or anything?

131
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,698
No, no.
Seriously?

132
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,283
This is, like, hard core, okay.

133
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,285
Yeah!

134
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,204
I love this song.

135
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,456
No!

136
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,046
I need another drink.
What do you say you and I...

137
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,464
Back off.
Hey, hey, hey.

138
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,466
You're my hero.

139
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,636
Huh? What?

140
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,807
No, I prefer the term "bleeder."
How much further...

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,891
I love that.
My feet are killing me.

142
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,142
That is so disgusting.

143
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,396
Who even wears stilettos to duty station?

144
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,814
Screw you, I'm like Wonder Woman.

145
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,190
Oh, yeah.

146
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,484
What!
Oh!

147
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,736
I should have been a baseball player.

148
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,029
Oh, my God.

149
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,239
We're gonna get in trouble.
Hold on.

150
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,949
What are you doing?
Oh, God.

151
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,451
Oh, wow, that's hot.
I like that sock look.

152
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,164
You didn't have anything for lunch.

153
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,791
What is that?

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,501
You're gonna make me pee myself,

155
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,877
seriously, I'm gonna piss myself.

156
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,879
Stop analyzing my puke.
I'm gonna piss myself.

157
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,172
I'm gonna go pee.
Hold onto that.

158
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,759
Megan, we gotta hurry!
I'll be quick.

159
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,269
Hey!
Actually, let's...

160
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,520
What's going on?

161
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,355
Just turn around and walk.

162
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,149
We're good, we're good, it's all good.

163
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,692
Oh, they got her.
It's all good.

164
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,116
Um, I'm almost done.

165
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,000
What's your problem, Leavey?

166
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,752
Master Sergeant, I'm sorry...

167
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,713
Shut up. Don't mess with me,
it brings out my Irish.

168
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,342
Why are you here in the Marines?

169
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,386
You don't know, do you?
Well, I do.

170
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,557
You think you're the first entitled brat

171
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,392
with a chip on her shoulder
who's come through my ranks?

172
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,979
This institution is for heroes,
not little punks

173
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,397
all screwed up in the head

174
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,192
because their mommies and daddies
didn't love them enough.

175
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,027
But you're in my corps now,

176
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,155
and I will not see you
disrespect the men and women

177
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,657
who made the Marines great!

178
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,825
Do you understand?

179
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,160
Yes, Master Sergeant.

180
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,958
One more hiccup and I'll see
you kicked out of here,

181
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,919
do you copy me?
Yes, Master Sergeant.

182
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,421
All right, you're on EMI, shit detail,

183
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,173
until further notice, so get some rest.

184
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,425
You're gonna need it.
Go on, get out of here.

185
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,829
Gunny Martin, meet PFC Leavey.

186
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,956
She's yours for the day.

187
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,584
Leavey...

188
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,503
Welcome.

189
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,855
Gross.

190
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,907
Ahh!

191
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,494
Ew!

192
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,831
Ugh!

193
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,418
Ugh!

194
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,592
Yeah, Cindy, I bet you think
that's really funny, huh?

195
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,885
Disgusting.

196
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,851
Who's this?

197
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,269
Rex?

198
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,230
Hey, you handsome boy.

199
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,192
Shit.

200
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,612
Okay!

201
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:02,908
You done in here?

202
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,035
Uh, almost, I've got two left.

203
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,411
Good, we need you outside.

204
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,504
Sit, sit.

205
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,591
You found it, you found it, good boy.
Come here, come here.

206
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,761
Come here.
Sit down, come here.

207
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,638
This guy loves having his belly rubbed.

208
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,056
What's he sniffing out?

209
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,183
Explosives.

210
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,561
We go in before the convoy, sniff out IEDs,
make sure no one gets hurt.

211
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,855
You guys on the front lines?

212
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,149
Sometimes we're in
front of the front lines.

213
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,569
Zeus here is a beast, aren't ya?

214
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,655
Is he yours?

215
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,241
No, he belongs to the Corps,
but he's mine for now.

216
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,827
What are you here for, training?

217
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,870
No, I'm cleaning out
the kennels for a week.

218
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,957
How do you get to do that?

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,458
Leavey, you up.

220
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,919
I'm up?

221
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,890
Attack!

222
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,767
Get him!

223
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,686
Ow!

224
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,604
Out!

225
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,774
You grab her?
Yeah, I got her.

226
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,192
Hey, Cindy.

227
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,987
Okay, Lance Corporal Walters,
you be the handler.

228
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,655
You're still the decoy!

229
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,532
Let's give Cindy a break.

230
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,161
Oh, no, I'm good.
Sucks, huh?

231
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,580
Yeah.

232
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,666
You know, I usually take the
pants off, just keep the top on.

233
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,042
Really?

234
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,335
Dogs know to aim for the jacket.

235
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,796
Thanks.

236
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,099
Rex, heel. Heel, Rex.

237
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,143
Oh... Shit.

238
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,605
Okay, this one, you approach.

239
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,026
You listen to his spiel
and then start to run, okay?

240
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,029
If Rex attacks, you call him off.

241
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,780
Sir, I would like to see some ID.

242
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,036
Sir, I'm gonna search you,
and if you try to run away

243
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,662
or make any sudden aggressive moves,

244
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,414
my dog is trained to attack you.

245
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,836
Get him, get him. Get him.

246
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,214
Ah! Get him off!

247
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,842
Get him off!
Out, Rex, out.

248
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,177
Out, Rex, out!

249
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,559
Up.

250
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,353
Up.

251
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,396
Up.

252
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,023
Up.

253
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,526
Good boy, good boy.

254
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,458
Oh, gee.

255
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,544
You think I'm afraid of you?

256
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,383
Okay.

257
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,969
I am afraid of you.

258
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,806
But don't think I can't
make you afraid of me, too.

259
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,684
That's right, I'm a badass...
Leavey...

260
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,395
You back for more, huh?

261
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,939
Gunny, how do I become a dog handler?

262
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,108
You?
Yeah.

263
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,235
What do I have to do exactly?

264
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,196
For starters, you need to stop screwing up.

265
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,991
Then, you'll need an expert rifle score,

266
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,661
above 90% on all your exams,
a first class PFT,

267
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,204
and you know who gets those things?

268
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,331
People who aren't full of shit.

269
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,209
Gunny, I've been dealing with
a lot of shit the past few days,

270
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,877
and I can assure you,
I am not full of it.

271
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,507
Well, that would surprise me,
because unless I heard wrong,

272
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,343
you were just found pissing outside
the Provost Marshal's office.

273
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,386
The Provost Marshal?

274
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,180
And that's definitely the act of
a full-of-shit person, don't you think?

275
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,348
Yes, Gunny.

276
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,978
Crap.

277
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,858
<i>Gene Monahan, the Yankees'
veteran trainer, is out.</i>

278
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,945
<i>Looks like one of the doctors
in attendance is out.</i>

279
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,129
Cease fire, cease fire, unload, all clear.

280
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,131
<i>There's lives in your hands.</i>

281
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,841
Yes, sir.
And you are the alpha.

282
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,178
It comes from you, bring it from here,
so he knows you mean it.

283
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,473
<i>So, you want us to run it again?</i>

284
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,850
<i>So we gonna keep running
this till we get it right.</i>

285
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,935
<i>You're gonna save lives out there.</i>

286
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,689
<i>And the Red Sox
come pouring out of their dugout,</i>

287
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>the Yankees out of theirs.</i>

288
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,194
<i>They've all met out near the
pitcher's mound in a scrum.</i>

289
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,321
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

290
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,580
Why does your run
always seem to end up here?

291
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,500
Does it?
I hadn't noticed.

292
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,253
Hey, I've got a PFT in a couple of weeks.

293
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,379
Just wondering,

294
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,090
you got any openings coming up?

295
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:19,766
Good talk.

296
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,935
<i>Out of the gate,
there's a fly ball deep to left,</i>

297
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,104
<i>it's on its way, there it goes,</i>

298
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,731
<i>and the Yankees are going
to the World Series!</i>

299
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,369
Cease fire, cease fire, unload, all clear.

300
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,247
Shooters, your prep time has ended

301
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,332
with a magazine of five rounds.

302
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,876
I finished the morning reports.

303
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,753
I need the trainer's schedule, too.

304
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,380
When do you need it by?
1400.

305
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,798
On it, Gunny.
Enter.

306
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,427
PFC Leavey,

307
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,721
why am I not surprised
to see you in here today?

308
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,227
Yeah, I heard you got
first class on your PFT,

309
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,062
and you shot expert.

310
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,731
Gunny, do you have a dog for me?
No.

311
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,526
Did I excuse you?

312
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,698
But I do got a can, though.

313
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,576
What you say there, Mason?

314
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,494
Think she ready for a can?

315
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,122
I think so, Gunny.

316
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
Carry on.

317
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,712
Let's get to work.

318
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,387
Hey, cute dog.

319
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,431
What's his name?

320
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,474
I mean, her name.

321
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,270
I haven't named her yet,
I'm waiting for us to bond.

322
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,606
Don't forgot to use your praise voice.

323
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,566
Good can, good can.

324
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,443
At least my can listens to me.

325
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,113
Hey, she listens to me.
You listen to me, right, baby?

326
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,032
Come on, come on.

327
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,491
You hear that?

328
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,784
Huh?

329
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,411
Come on.
You hear that?

330
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,081
Morning.

331
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,291
Morning, Gunny.

332
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,127
Any DUIs last night?

333
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,879
No, Gunny.

334
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,340
Good.
It's gonna be a good day.

335
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,134
We gonna train harder than ever before.

336
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,471
Walters, what was you doing last night?

337
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,181
Playing <i>Halo,</i> Gunny.

338
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,515
That's what you do all the time?

339
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,059
You shipping out in three weeks.

340
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,937
You better be ready to fight
when it's time to fight.

341
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,940
Mason.
Yes, Gunny.

342
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,149
Are you still a virgin?

343
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,360
No, Gunny.

344
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,445
Are you sure about that?
Because you look like one.

345
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,617
Bennett, did you talk
to your wife last night?

346
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,160
No, Gunny.
You think I give a damn?

347
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,165
Coletta, you wipe that smile off your face.
Yes, Gunny.

348
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:50,959
Now, on a serious note,

349
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,378
I have somebody that
just came back from Iraq.

350
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,089
He wants to talk to y'all
about the experience,

351
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,341
so you'll know what it is.

352
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,385
He's been where you're going,

353
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,596
and the things that he
tells you will save lives

354
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,847
and save limbs.

355
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,684
This is Sergeant Andrew Dean.

356
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,436
Sergeant, take the floor.
Thank you, Gunny.

357
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,525
Morning.
Morning, Sergeant.

358
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,568
Are you ready for war?

359
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:18,945
Yes, Sergeant.

360
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,863
Everything you've prepared for,

361
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,032
every lesson you've learnt,

362
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,369
everything you think you know

363
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:30,039
will just go to shit
the moment you're in country.

364
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,166
These homemade bombs are full of crap

365
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,002
that our dogs have never sniffed.

366
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,717
You get caught in a sandstorm,
the dogs will be confused,

367
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,428
and they won't be able
to detect the odor cones.

368
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,391
You're about to be running
through shit's creek, literally.

369
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,562
With 50 pounds on your back,

370
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,814
a dog on a leash,

371
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,817
trying not to smack
his head in with your rifle.

372
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,696
And the grunts that you're protecting?

373
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,075
Well, they'll pretty much
hate you from day one.

374
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,204
Do this job right, you might save lives.

375
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,708
Do it wrong, and you'll wind up dead.

376
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,172
And no matter how bad I'm making it sound,

377
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,591
I'm not even coming close.

378
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,558
You need to keep them calm.

379
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,854
Lie down, Rex, lie down.

380
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,439
That's looking good.

381
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,900
Down.
That's looking good.

382
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,987
Just pull so there are
no wrinkles in the gauze.

383
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,074
You need to practice
all of this before you deploy.

384
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,577
Okay, let's take off the leashes.

385
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
Rex, no, no.

386
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,042
Are you having a problem over there?

387
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,377
No, I got this.

388
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,712
Good boy.

389
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,174
I said take off the leash.

390
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,427
Come on, buddy, just relax.

391
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,138
Good boy, just relax.

392
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,224
You need to muzzle that dog now.

393
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,810
Ahh!

394
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,729
Bad dog!

395
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,148
Shit.

396
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,234
It's gonna happen when it happens.

397
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,236
Gunny, I'm telling you,
it's gonna heal in no time.

398
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,238
He broke six bones, Walters.

399
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,614
You wanted to see me, Gunny?

400
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,408
You're getting a dog.

401
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,575
What?

402
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,701
You're giving her my dog.

403
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,078
Wait.
He's not your dog.

404
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,080
He's not my dog.
He's a Marine Corps dog.

405
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,706
Rex needs an experienced handler.

406
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,500
Are you questioning
my authority, Lance Corporal?

407
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,544
She's a Boot.
She's only trained a can so far.

408
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,004
Quit whining and act
like a goddamn Marine.

409
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,970
You got this?
Think faster.

410
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,138
Yeah, I got this.

411
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,014
Good, you're dismissed.

412
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,666
Remember me?

413
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,506
All right, Rex, get in the house.

414
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,554
In the house, now.

415
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,890
You're not gonna get any food
unless you listen to me.

416
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,646
I will stand here all day, okay?

417
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,455
Yes.

418
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,790
Good, good.

419
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,043
Good boy, stay.

420
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,920
Stay.

421
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,935
Over here, seek.

422
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,271
Seek, seek.

423
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,483
Seek.

424
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,902
That's time, Leavey.

425
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,238
Damn it.

426
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,454
You found one out of five.

427
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,039
See this guy?

428
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,543
Dead, dead, dead.

429
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,586
Oh, and your dog, yeah, he's dead, too.

430
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,965
And you blew off your legs in the process.

431
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,299
Follow me.

432
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,387
Again, Leavey.

433
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,557
Hey, hey. Hey.

434
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,641
Where are you going?

435
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,851
Following the perimeter.
He's pulling towards the desk.

436
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,311
But I thought there was a search pattern.

437
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,188
Forget the search pattern, Leavey.

438
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,649
He's showing a change, all right?

439
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,192
Listen to him.
Okay.

440
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,111
Rex, seek.
Follow him.

441
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,320
Okay, seek.

442
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,830
That's it, that's it.
He's on odor, present higher.

443
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,926
Praise him, Leavey, praise him.

444
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,846
Good boy, good boy, good.

445
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,683
Okay, this is a good detection dog.

446
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,518
There's nothing wrong with him,

447
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,353
so it must be you.

448
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,814
What are you doing wrong?

449
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,818
Everything you feel goes down leash, okay?

450
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,986
Everything.

451
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,697
If you're not confident,
then he's not confident.

452
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,576
I could train the heck
out of you, Leavey, but...

453
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:03,205
I can't teach you how to bond, okay?

454
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,957
Okay.

455
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,876
Good work.

456
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,095
Okay, he's just nervous.

457
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:19,972
These aren't nerves.

458
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,057
Shh!

459
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,725
I've been watching this dog all year.

460
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,144
He's the most aggressive dog
I've ever treated.

461
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,565
Hey!
He can't deploy without this exam.

462
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,776
I'll have to sedate him.

463
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,032
Rex, calm down, calm down.

464
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,867
Come on.

465
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,664
This door always stays closed, okay?

466
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,541
Hey, Alice, Tucker.

467
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,086
All right, go find Walters

468
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,629
and tell him I want Tucker's
cleaned out again.

469
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,755
Yes, Sergeant.

470
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,049
Hey, good girl.

471
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,221
Leavey, wrap his leg.
Show him you're not afraid.

472
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:01,764
Yes, Sergeant.

473
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,978
Rex, sit. I mean...

474
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,147
Lay down.

475
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,733
Rex, lay down.

476
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,952
Stay.

477
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,792
I'm just gonna wrap your paw.

478
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,718
Just...

479
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,469
Here you go.

480
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,681
Good, good.

481
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,102
If you ever get into trouble,

482
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,687
you're gonna want me
to know how to do this.

483
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,109
Hey.

484
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,571
I didn't...

485
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:00,781
I didn't ask for Rex.

486
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,450
I didn't even want him.

487
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,661
Yeah, well, I did want him.

488
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,539
So, don't get him killed.

489
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,199
Hey.

490
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,576
Hey.

491
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,720
Rex, sit.

492
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,390
Oh, good.

493
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,948
We're shipping out tomorrow.

494
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,743
We are so not ready for this.

495
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,458
But people are counting on us,

496
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:39,088
and if we do it wrong, people die,
so we gotta do it right.

497
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,967
Okay?

498
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,692
<i>Tomorrow, beginning the
moment you step off that bird,</i>

499
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,528
<i>you must act, trust your training,</i>

500
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,614
<i>trust your partner, trust yourself.</i>

501
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,740
Hoo-ah!

502
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,492
<i>And remember,</i>

503
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,871
<i>everything you see, hear, taste, and touch</i>

504
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,539
<i>over these next seven months</i>

505
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,375
<i>will remain with you for
the rest of your lives.</i>

506
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,127
<i>Make it count.</i>

507
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,424
You okay, Leavey?

508
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,218
Yeah, I just can't find my Ka-Bar.

509
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,512
It was in my stuff and now I...
It's behind you.

510
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,641
Thank you.

511
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,311
Look, it's okay to be freaking
out right now, all right?

512
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,562
It's normal.

513
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,397
I did, everybody does.

514
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,482
You'll be fine.

515
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,901
You got this.

516
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,819
And I wanna hear about
all the asses you kicked

517
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,029
when you come back.

518
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,114
Not if, but when, okay?

519
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay.

520
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,829
Good luck.

521
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,331
Thank you.

522
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,806
Rex, shh, quiet, you're fine.

523
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:16,393
Hour of silence, Leavey.
I'll settle for 30 minutes.

524
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,603
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,994
It works for birds.

526
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,292
Hey, I know.

527
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,586
Hey, it's okay, I know.

528
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,797
You don't know where we're going

529
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,548
or what's gonna happen when we get there.

530
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,302
I know it sucks, but we're
in this together, okay?

531
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,890
It's okay. It's okay, buddy, I got you.

532
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,407
We're on final, be on the ground in 10.

533
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:14,410
Get your gear together, strap in.
Get ready for landing.

534
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,829
All right.

535
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,125
Okay, listen up.
Where's Marion and Peters?

536
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,167
Sir.

537
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,627
Your vehicles are right over there.

538
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,254
You're going to Camp Perditha.

539
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,672
Leavey, Jones.
Yeah.

540
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,590
Your convoy's waiting for you
right over there.

541
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,467
You're going to Camp Ramadi.
The rest of you, follow me.

542
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,636
Hey, don't forget,
no matter how bad it gets,

543
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,597
you could have been out there
sniffing bombs with a tin can.

544
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,058
True.

545
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,518
Be safe.

546
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,270
Okay.
All right?

547
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,105
Hey, good hunting.

548
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:45,566
See you later, idiots.

549
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,860
<i>Adios!</i>

550
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,222
At least we got a single, right?

551
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,686
Sometimes it actually pays to be a girl.

552
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,161
Don't be scared.

553
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,008
Hey.

554
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,887
Oh, great.

555
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,349
You wait to get to Iraq
to find your inner puppy.

556
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,098
Up, up, up, up.

557
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,267
Good boy, good boy.

558
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,686
Yes, that's a good boy, good boy.

559
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,398
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,318
Good boy, good boy, yeah, yeah.

561
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,239
That's a good boy.

562
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,074
Relax, Boot.

563
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,826
It's outgoing, not incoming.

564
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,495
Ain't that right, Chico, huh?

565
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,746
Thanks.

566
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,584
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,727
Settle down.
Come on, man.

568
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,978
Let's go.

569
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,188
Yeah, move it along.

570
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,647
Hurry it up, all right?

571
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,957
First day of school, bud.

572
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,045
Wish me luck.

573
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,806
I'm pretty sure they sell
loofahs in the gift shop.

574
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,517
Actually, no, they bombed the gift shop.

575
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,020
Well, that's too bad.
I like loofahs.

576
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,690
I'm Matt Morales.
I'll be your tour guide today.

577
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,484
Megan Leavey.
Who's that?

578
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,736
This is Chico.
Chico, sit.

579
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,615
I trained Chico to lick the enemy to death.

580
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:23,075
Nice.

581
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,161
So, where are you from?
New York.

582
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,663
Ah, yeah? Me, too.

583
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,873
You're not a Yankees fan, though, right?

584
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:30,916
Born and bred.

585
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,084
Oh, come on.

586
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,044
Dagger to my heart, really?

587
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,130
Well, I guess we'll
never speak again, Megan.

588
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,676
Chico, we don't talk
to Yankees fans, right?

589
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,885
Good boy.

590
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,475
This is Corporal Morales.

591
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,686
Morales, Lance Corporal Leavey.

592
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,437
Morales will drop you at the ECP,

593
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,690
then he's off to Sadr City,
so you'll be on your own

594
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,108
till we can get another team out there.

595
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,443
Just try and keep your
dog from overheating.

596
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,778
Okay.

597
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,281
Last female handler
got her panties in a pretzel

598
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,908
'cause we don't allow girls on missions,
just checkpoints.

599
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,493
That gonna be a problem with you?

600
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,036
Not at all.
Good.

601
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,872
Dismissed.

602
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,007
"Panties in a pretzel."

603
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,676
Hmm.

604
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,429
Thought we weren't talking anymore.

605
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,889
Well, I was talking to myself right there,

606
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,309
but, you know,
I'll give you another chance,

607
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,060
and if you mention the
Yankees again, we're done.

608
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,398
Staff Sergeant Jarvis
is a real charmer, though.

609
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,026
Last week he told me
he always liked my people.

610
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,987
My dad's Puerto Rican,
my mom's Scandinavian.

611
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,406
Who do you think he was
talking about, huh?

612
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,616
The Scandinavians, obviously.

613
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,118
Right, that's what I thought

614
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,137
Welcome to the capital of shit.

615
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,723
What's with all the dogs?

616
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:55,143
Strays, full of diseases.
Keep 'em away from your dog.

617
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,770
Shoot 'em if you have to.

618
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,522
Here's all you need to know.

619
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,148
Don't search till they're out of the car.

620
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,817
Make sure they open everything.

621
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,444
Remember, Iraqis, they don't like dogs.

622
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,238
It's in their religious teachings,

623
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,697
and they damn sure don't like ours.

624
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,241
There's a bounty on canine handlers

625
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,576
and an even bigger bounty
on female canine handlers.

626
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,162
Which means they'll
probably wanna kill you.

627
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,040
Well, actually, unless they wanna bone you.

628
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,167
Or they might wanna bone you
and then kill you.

629
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,295
And if one of them pulls out a
cell phone, boom, you're dead.

630
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,674
Aside from that, it's pretty chill.

631
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,885
Seriously, be smart,

632
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,346
keep your head on a swivel,
heightened awareness.

633
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,056
Okay.

634
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,535
Go, go, go, get to the line.

635
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,800
You need to have fun.

636
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,885
No complaints, bro.

637
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,388
See ya.

638
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,904
Hey, keep everybody moving.

639
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,823
Jones, move his truck.

640
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,076
Rex, you want some water?

641
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,749
Bandini, tell that guy to cut his engine.

642
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,542
Turn your engine off.

643
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,261
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

644
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,527
Ask him the reason for traveling today.

645
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,572
I'm heading to Baghdad for business.

646
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,324
You speak English.

647
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,784
Yes, better for business.

648
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,871
Hey! Cut your engine off.

649
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,582
I told you to turn that bike off.

650
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,959
Lift your shirts.

651
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,129
Come on, turn around, come on.

652
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,301
Leavey, clear the car.

653
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,095
Open the trunk please, sir.

654
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,646
Jesus, Bandini.

655
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,982
I told you to turn that bike off.

656
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,609
Get up, get up.

657
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,778
Stand over here.
Lift your shirt.

658
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,488
Damn straight, better for business.

659
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,115
Stay back.

660
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,911
You want me to shoot you next time?
Pick your bike up.

661
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,498
Don't touch it, though.

662
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,337
No.

663
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,799
Come here.

664
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,942
Clear.

665
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,694
What is his name?

666
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,195
Hey, kid, we ask the questions here.

667
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,532
Sir, could you get in the vehicle
and proceed to the checkpoint?

668
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,876
His name is Rex.

669
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,503
Here,

670
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,798
let me give you my card, X-box.

671
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,425
No, no, no.

672
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,637
Back in your vehicle now.
Rex!

673
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,555
Come on.

674
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:03,975
What are you doing?

675
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:05,560
You never tell a <i>Haji</i> your dog's name.

676
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,811
He's just a kid.

677
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,271
Yeah, and I've seen kids not much older

678
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,231
call a dog over with a detonator in hand.

679
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,026
You wanna keep your dog alive?
Sort your crap out.

680
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,778
Hey, let's go.

681
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,072
Next.

682
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,201
Keep these people moving.
Let's go, let's go!

683
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,341
We'll get better at this, I promise.

684
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,177
Good boy.

685
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,014
Seek.
You sure?

686
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,685
All right.
Oh, what is it?

687
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,769
You did it.

688
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,647
Good boy, good boy, come on, come on.

689
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,524
Seek, come on.

690
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,237
Could be a full suit.
Check it out.

691
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,823
Good boy, good boy.
Did he find it?

692
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,199
Those guys ever take a break?

693
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:03,118
No.
Come here.

694
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,036
I guess so.

695
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,287
Good boy.

696
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,748
You wanna play, boy? You wanna play?
Go get it.

697
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,918
Good boy, Rex.
Come here, Rex.

698
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,676
Leavey, Recon needs you
on a mission, five minutes.

699
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,642
I thought I wasn't
allowed to go on missions.

700
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,310
There's no one else.
Get your gear.

701
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:38,903
Yo.

702
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,824
They blew up five of our guys.
Let's get in there and smoke them out.

703
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,744
One of you check the road.
The house is over here.

704
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,705
I'll take the road.
You get the houses.

705
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:52,167
Okay, hey, sweep the dogs.
They might be stuffed with IEDs.

706
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:15,982
Clear.

707
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,118
I just wish this guy had a couple rugs.

708
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,287
Ask him why so many rugs?

709
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,705
They're prayer rugs.
Ask him.

710
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:36,920
They're a religious family.

711
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,089
They're not enemies of the States.

712
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:43,927
And they thank Americans for helping

713
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,178
in the fight against insurgents.

714
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,305
Oh, we thank you for your bullshit.

715
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,307
Hey, open this cabinet.

716
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,937
Open it!

717
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,652
Get back.

718
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:06,157
What's he got?
He got something?

719
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,867
We need some room, step back.

720
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,661
Move these rugs.

721
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,376
His sons put 'em there.
We don't care.

722
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,836
Move them!

723
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:18,962
He's not a well man.

724
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,255
Tell <i>habibi</i> we don't care about his health

725
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,090
and he needs to move them.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

726
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,176
Move them now.

727
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,263
Today!

728
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,826
Okay, gonna need someone to check that.
I got it.

729
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,464
Oh, my God.

730
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,216
Don't move! Don't move!

731
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,801
Hey! Stop!

732
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,137
Stop!

733
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:10,722
Don't move! Don't move!

734
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,309
Nice work, cleared
out quicker than we found it.

735
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,644
All right. More bad luck.

736
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:19,814
Look at this.

737
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:21,649
This is you?

738
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:23,109
Well, it's him.

739
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,445
Well, don't get all big-headed on me now.

740
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,032
Shit, you just saved a bunch of lives.

741
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,827
Outstanding work.
Both of you.

742
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:35,288
Thank you.

743
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,167
Come on, Chico.

744
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,351
Three, two, one.

745
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,186
You cheated!

746
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,229
I won!

747
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,899
I won! I won!

748
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,535
It's okay, they're fine, they're fine.

749
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,184
Yeah, we shook 'em up.
Chico.

750
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,646
Oh, you're slick, 'cause
I already know what card that is.

751
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,690
There we go, pick up some more.

752
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:45,733
Keep going, you still don't have it.

753
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:46,818
Oh, my God.
Keep going.

754
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,319
Keep going.
Relax.

755
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,696
He looks like he's
actually trying to decide

756
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,823
which of my body parts
he wants to eat first.

757
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,032
Yeah, he is.

758
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:54,242
Oh!

759
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,285
The moment has come.
Mmm-hmm.

760
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,000
You set that up.

761
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:04,043
Totally didn't.

762
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:05,962
That was good.
Thank you.

763
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,591
So, Mets fan,

764
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,011
did you ever play?

765
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,680
I did, high school, third base.

766
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,850
I thought I was actually pretty good,

767
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,768
but college scouts disagreed,

768
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,062
so here I am.

769
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,608
Screw 'em, I'm not really a
sit-in-the-classroom kind of guy anyway.

770
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,193
Me neither.

771
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,113
So, what's your story?

772
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,781
Why'd you join?

773
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,200
I wanted to get the fuck away from my life.

774
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,123
That was a downer.

775
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,295
Does it have anything to do with Jesse?

776
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,049
I saw your tattoo.

777
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:53,634
Um...

778
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,430
Yeah.

779
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,932
I mean, he was my best friend.

780
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,310
We used to spend every
weekend at his house.

781
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,729
I mean, not like that.
We were...

782
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:05,897
He was like my brother.

783
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,356
His family was amazing,

784
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,317
unlike mine.

785
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,152
I spent Christmases there,

786
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:17,408
and one weekend we were
drinking and taking pills,

787
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,161
doing stupid high school stuff,

788
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:24,624
and we took the exact same amount.

789
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,294
I mean, I probably took
even more than he did, but...

790
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,299
Well, I woke up.
He didn't.

791
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:40,098
His family keep trying to reach out,
but I can't even...

792
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,603
It should have been me,
and we all know it.

793
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,194
I gotta get up early.

794
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,280
I'm gonna go to sleep.

795
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,122
Good night.
Night.

796
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:35,695
Good boy, good boy.

797
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,003
We need one dog team for a road
sweep and surrounding area check.

798
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,212
But you requested two teams.

799
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:54,463
Things change.

800
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,798
We only have the room for one team.

801
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,303
Hey, it's going down leash.
I'll go.

802
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,429
Leavey.

803
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,182
I got this.

804
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,351
Line up!

805
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,477
You heard him, let's go.

806
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,146
Move it.

807
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,659
You're from New York?

808
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:24,869
Yeah.

809
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:26,746
Me, too.

810
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,415
My first time in country.

811
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,253
What about him?

812
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:36,797
Germany.

813
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,591
Germany.

814
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,134
German shepherd, I like that.

815
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,386
You know what I heard?

816
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,223
I heard the enemy likes
to steal the dogs, right?

817
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,474
Strap bombs on them,

818
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,268
send them back to their owner.

819
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:52,396
Well, since Rex can break
someone's arm with his teeth,

820
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,606
I'm not too worried.

821
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:20,675
Leavey, dog up.

822
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,971
It's okay.

823
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,907
They've been spending
a lot of time together.

824
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,617
I'm glad I'm not them.

825
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,785
Stop talking!

826
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,080
Good boy, good boy.

827
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,227
Found something!

828
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:59,523
Hey, Leavey, does he really
need another break?

829
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,651
With all due respect, it's been two hours,

830
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,945
and it's 120 degrees, so yeah, he does.

831
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,281
It's not like he hasn't earned it.

832
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,919
Vehicle approaching.

833
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,003
Guns up.

834
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,388
Rex.

835
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,142
Gomez, warning shot, one round.

836
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:38,687
He's not slowing.

837
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,815
Stand by to light him up.

838
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,125
Gomez, O'Connor, secure the <i>Haji.</i>

839
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:00,793
Get on the ground, get on the ground.

840
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,171
Get on the ground.

841
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,425
Get on the ground.

842
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:12,304
Get on the ground now, get on the ground.

843
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:13,848
Lay flat on the ground now.

844
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,015
Put your hands behind your back.

845
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,350
Hands behind your back.

846
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:19,895
Rex!

847
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,357
Clear!

848
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,817
Leavey, check the vehicle.

849
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,111
Hey, come on, let's go.

850
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,990
Okay, okay.

851
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,697
Rex, Rex!

852
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,576
Rex, no, no, no.

853
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:27,755
Rex.

854
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,098
I'm not leaving without my dog.

855
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,351
Come on, come on.

856
00:58:58,911 --> 00:58:59,995
Hey!

857
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,497
How did your dog miss that?

858
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,873
You could have got us all killed.

859
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,043
I never seen an IED buried this deep.

860
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,006
You gotta see this.

861
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,425
They must have triggered
the bomb from those houses.

862
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,302
I don't know, maybe
they were targeting Rex.

863
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:16,804
No, they were targeting Leavey and Rex.

864
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,013
Let's get those cowards.

865
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,974
Radio Morales, get him and
his dog down here now.

866
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,643
No, if we wait for Morales,
the spotters will be gone by then.

867
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:24,395
We can do it.
No way, forget it.

868
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,647
Do you see how many IEDs we found today?

869
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,274
How are you gonna make it
through the field without us?

870
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:29,525
God damn it, Leavey, you're injured.

871
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,945
Yeah, because those assholes
waited all day watching us.

872
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,196
She's got a concussion, Sergeant.

873
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,948
She may be confused, disoriented.

874
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,074
They almost killed us.

875
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:40,286
How are you gonna make it through
the field and the house without us?

876
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:41,954
What about your dog?
He's injured, too.

877
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:56,385
He's fine.

878
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,179
We can do this.

879
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:05,019
Let's go!

880
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,312
I'm gonna check with Air Support.

881
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,022
In the meantime, Gomez,
get your team together.

882
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,773
Get in there, check it out, do it fast.

883
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,650
We'll cover you from here.
Yes, sir.

884
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:14,069
Go, what are you waiting for?
Move, move!

885
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:19,867
The first house,

886
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,328
150 meters.

887
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,706
It's a little too quiet,
but it's up to you.

888
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,044
We don't have all day.

889
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,213
We'll follow you, Leavey.

890
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:34,882
Let's move out.

891
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,651
He found another one?

892
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,445
Yeah.

893
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:03,994
It's a pressure plate.

894
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,046
Good boy. Seek.

895
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,769
Okay, Leavey, we're ready for you.

896
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,694
Clear!

897
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:56,964
Clear!

898
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,133
Leavey, you're up.
Seek.

899
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,761
This is a school.

900
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,390
That's messed up.

901
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,686
Seek.

902
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:26,952
Okay, Leavey.

903
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,045
Whoa, shit...

904
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,424
Looks like they were just here.

905
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,843
Jackpot.

906
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:45,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

907
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,598
Leavey, Leavey, Leavey!

908
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,224
Hey. It's okay.

909
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:50,809
It's Gomez.
What do you want me to do?

910
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,394
I don't know, something's not right.

911
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,272
He just got blown up, man.
I don't know what's going on.

912
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,191
Leavey, I gotta move, I gotta move.

913
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,654
Get down!

914
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,875
Johnson, Johnson!

915
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,085
Move it!
Let's move!

916
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,380
We gotta move!

917
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,051
Wait!

918
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,677
Covering, move!

919
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:26,804
Come on. Let's go.

920
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:27,930
Johnson!

921
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,139
Go, go, go, go!

922
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,099
Let's go, let's go.

923
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:46,323
Suppress the fire, let's talk, boys, talk.
I wanna hear talk!

924
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,909
Point and shoot, point and shoot.

925
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,953
Move it, move it.

926
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,830
Leavey, Leavey!

927
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,249
Johnson, Johnson, go!

928
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,667
We gotta move!

929
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,001
Go, go, go.

930
01:03:58,627 --> 01:03:59,628
Move!

931
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,965
O'Connor, O'Connor.

932
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,801
Covering. Move!

933
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,052
Move, move!

934
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,605
Move, Johnson!

935
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,570
Covering, move!

936
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,615
Go, Leavey, Leavey, move!

937
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,215
Moving, moving!

938
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:52,222
We gotta go, let's go, let's go!

939
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:55,475
Suppressing fire, right flank.
Let's move, boys.

940
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,060
Light 'em up.

941
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:58,562
Let's go, let's go!

942
01:04:58,645 --> 01:04:59,855
Let's go, move it, move it.

943
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,648
Come on, come on, let's go.

944
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,027
Covering!

945
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,862
Shriner, where's Leavey, Gomez?

946
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,656
Johnson, move!

947
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,325
Covering, move!

948
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,621
Leavey, ready?

949
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,249
Come on, let's go, let's go.

950
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,049
Let's go, let's go.
Okay.

951
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,133
Hurry up.

952
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,849
Winchester running low on ammo.

953
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,601
Go, go, go.
Wait.

954
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,436
Let's go, let's go, get in.

955
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,438
Move it, move it, Leavey.

956
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,398
Gomez, come on, get in.

957
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:44,775
Leavey!

958
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,068
Stop.

959
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,698
I think she didn't make it.

960
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,951
She didn't make it!
Hold it right now.

961
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,245
It's okay, it's okay.

962
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:00,415
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

963
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,959
On the right flank, right there.

964
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,043
She didn't make it.

965
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,169
Hold it.
Leavey!

966
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,588
Let's go, let's go.
Move it, move it.

967
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,090
We're leaving.
Wait!

968
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,591
Slow down, slow down, she's not in.

969
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:13,553
Okay, let's go, let's go.

970
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,682
Yeah, we got her.
Move, move!

971
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:41,915
Leavey, you're Medevac ASAP.

972
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:51,800
Hey, I'll take care of him, okay?

973
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,261
I promise.

974
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,596
Listen to me.

975
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,392
It should have been me, all right?

976
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:14,216
<i>This is helo zero niner departing
Ramadi with one wounded</i>

977
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,676
<i>en route to Baghdad hospital, over.</i>

978
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,098
Okay, Corporal.

979
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,059
Uh, you've got ruptured eardrums,
so hearing loss

980
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,186
and even short-term memory
loss are gonna be normal,

981
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:28,188
but you should fully recover.

982
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,731
Where's my dog?
He's okay.

983
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,191
He's fine, he's at Blue Diamond.

984
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,984
I need to see him.
Oh, no, no.

985
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,653
Uh-uh, Corporal, no, no.
Lay down.

986
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:35,904
He's okay, he's fine.

987
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:38,573
The important thing is we look
after you, make sure you're okay.

988
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,659
And just so you know,
they're sending you home

989
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,369
for Christmas, Corporal, three weeks,

990
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:44,913
then back to Pendleton
for training and rehab,

991
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,873
and you'll see your dog when
you get back to base, okay?

992
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,961
Uh, we notified her commander,
so he's aware of what's going on.

993
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,024
Dad.

994
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:34,004
I'm glad you're home.
You okay?

995
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:35,797
Mmm-hmm.

996
01:09:41,553 --> 01:09:42,721
You look good.

997
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,472
Okay.

998
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:55,901
Um...

999
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,154
I gotta work on Christmas.

1000
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,615
It's okay, Dad.

1001
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,075
You sure?
Yeah.

1002
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,327
You're okay?
Yeah.

1003
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,995
She'd probably rather if I didn't...

1004
01:10:07,579 --> 01:10:08,955
Yeah. I know.

1005
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:10,373
Go near there, so...

1006
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:12,626
Merry Christmas.

1007
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:13,919
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

1008
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,795
I love you.
I love you.

1009
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:17,589
Thank God you're okay.

1010
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:21,885
Bye, you.

1011
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,972
You're sure you're okay with that?

1012
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,474
Yeah, I got it.
All right.

1013
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,019
Thank you.
Yeah.

1014
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,021
Merry Christmas.

1015
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,109
Hi, baby.

1016
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,277
Hey, Mom.

1017
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,032
Okay, I am sorry, but I'm just...

1018
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,367
What do you mean Rex isn't back yet?

1019
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,744
He was supposed to be back a
week ago, and every time I call,

1020
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,454
someone says that he's gonna be back soon,

1021
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,580
he's gonna be back soon.

1022
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,374
I'm just a little bit confused.

1023
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,376
I'm just telling you
what I know, Corporal...

1024
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,836
And please, don't call again.

1025
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,339
I'll let you know as soon as I
have something to report, okay?

1026
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,424
Okay, wait just one second.
If somebody could just...

1027
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,434
This is wonderful, honey.
Did you see this, Megan?

1028
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:13,937
Oh! This is wonderful.

1029
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,815
Here, honey, this is for you.

1030
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,829
Thank you, Mom.

1031
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,124
I would have liked to get you more, honey,

1032
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,667
but the salon's been slow so...

1033
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,085
That's okay.

1034
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,088
So, that's the one, honey.

1035
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,925
I'm, like, so happy,
you can't even imagine.

1036
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,770
Just double check with Wilkins, all right?

1037
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,063
Yes, sir, will do.

1038
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,109
Reynolds?

1039
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,819
Hey, I'm Corporal Leavey.

1040
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:03,903
Leavey?
Yeah.

1041
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:04,988
Wow.

1042
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,866
You do know your phone style
is a bit aggressive, right?

1043
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,451
Actually, I don't think she does.

1044
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,495
Hey.
Hey, what's up, Leavey?

1045
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,830
Hi.
How you doing?

1046
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,915
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

1047
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,500
I heard you got a little
rattled up out there.

1048
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,127
Everything okay?
I'm fine.

1049
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,378
When did you get back?

1050
01:12:20,462 --> 01:12:21,463
Uh, last week.

1051
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,173
I'm just here for a couple days,
then I'm going back.

1052
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,424
How's Rex?
Where is he?

1053
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,343
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.

1054
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:27,427
Is he okay?

1055
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,346
I don't know how he is,
but I've been crap without him.

1056
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,848
Yeah, yeah, I can't imagine.

1057
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:35,018
I haven't left Bruno for what, 12 hours?

1058
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,353
Who's a good boy, Bruno?

1059
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,313
Yes, sir, I'll tell her.

1060
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,273
Hey, you can go and cuddle,
too, if you like.

1061
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:41,608
Rex just pulled up to the gate.

1062
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,568
Bruno, Bruno.
Bye, sir.

1063
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:44,778
All right.

1064
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,448
Hey, hi!

1065
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,159
Come here, come here, good boy.

1066
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:53,870
Careful, careful.

1067
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:58,375
Good boy, good, hi, good.

1068
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,503
Oh! Good boy.

1069
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:15,934
Okay.

1070
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:21,064
Good boy, good boy, good boy,
good boy, good boy.

1071
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,494
Good.

1072
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,955
Good, good, come on.

1073
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,083
Come on, stop, this way.

1074
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,670
Rex, come, it's okay.

1075
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,179
Hey, what's going on?

1076
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,098
They told me I didn't need the bottoms.

1077
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,768
Yeah, well that depends on
how much you like keeping

1078
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:00,270
both halves of your ass.

1079
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,521
Keep them on.

1080
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,649
Ha-ha!

1081
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,942
You guys are very funny!

1082
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,947
Okay, slow down, slow down, slow down,

1083
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,657
it's just some flowers, it's okay.

1084
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,667
It's...

1085
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,253
The crazy part, then they
ended up having loofahs,

1086
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:28,798
but they said they
couldn't deliver a loofah.

1087
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,468
It was sweet, that's really sweet.

1088
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,303
I mean, I like flowers, too.

1089
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,263
Cool, but the loofah
would have been, come on.

1090
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,347
That would have been funnier, yeah.

1091
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,724
The loofah would have worked, right?
Yeah, yeah.

1092
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,100
I know. Um...

1093
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,019
So, hi.

1094
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,228
Hi.
Hey.

1095
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:52,405
Wow, you're really strong.

1096
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:00,205
They're like college beds,
like dorm room beds.

1097
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:01,581
It's awful.
Yeah.

1098
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,125
Well, the good news is
you probably don't have

1099
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,168
to pay for drinks anymore

1100
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:06,753
now that you're a war hero and everything.

1101
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:08,838
You think I'm a hero?

1102
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,508
Well, that's the word on the street.

1103
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:14,844
So what have you been up to?
What's going on?

1104
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:18,264
Um, mostly just physical therapy.
It's the worst.

1105
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,769
The nurse is an absolute witch,
so that's not fun.

1106
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,771
Ai!
Yeah.

1107
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,439
So, what hurts?
Where does it hurt?

1108
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,024
Um...

1109
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:29,442
Mostly my head.

1110
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,862
My back, my neck,

1111
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:35,031
and I just...

1112
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:36,950
It feels like the bomb blew out my arches.

1113
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,077
So everywhere.
Mmm-hmm.

1114
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,830
Well, no more high heels for you.

1115
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,625
I know, so bummed about that.

1116
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,877
Hey, let me get your foot.

1117
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,045
Let me do some magic.

1118
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,838
A massage?
Yeah.

1119
01:15:50,964 --> 01:15:53,299
Just 'cause you're a hero.

1120
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:54,509
Lucky me.

1121
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:55,635
Heroes get massages.

1122
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,178
I should get exploded more often.

1123
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,264
Yeah, I should fly back more often.

1124
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,641
How's your boy, Rex, doing?

1125
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,519
He's good.

1126
01:16:05,645 --> 01:16:07,480
He's doing better, it's just slow.

1127
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:09,983
I think that I'm gonna be able
to start training with him again

1128
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,192
in a couple weeks.

1129
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,860
Hmm.

1130
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,780
How long do I have you for?

1131
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,616
Well, that depends.

1132
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,909
How long do you want me for?

1133
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,162
I'm a young man, we live into
our 80s in my family. Oh!

1134
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:25,915
Yeah, we get divorced in mine.

1135
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:27,000
Mmm.

1136
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,918
I could possibly make an exception, though,

1137
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:32,505
if you were all of a sudden,
say, a Yankees fan,

1138
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,090
went to a lot of Yankees games.

1139
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,926
That's a lot, you see,
that's a lot to ask for.

1140
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,678
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1141
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,472
I'm being serious.

1142
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:46,019
Well, so am I.

1143
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,439
I don't do the whole
forever and ever thing.

1144
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,858
Look, trust me, neither do I, usually.

1145
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,110
Okay, well, so stop being so serious.

1146
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:56,529
Let's just...
Let's just make out.

1147
01:17:06,331 --> 01:17:08,207
Inspection, 20 minutes.

1148
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,710
This is...
Don't say anything.

1149
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,462
We could get in trouble, though, right?
Yes.

1150
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:14,839
I think we should relocate...

1151
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:17,592
But not now.

1152
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,306
Detail, attention.

1153
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,648
<i>I'm sorry to inform you that Andrew Dean,</i>

1154
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,234
<i>Sergeant Andrew Dean,</i>

1155
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:40,531
was killed by a suicide bomber
at 1537 yesterday.

1156
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:45,411
<i>He tried to stop him,
but he couldn't in time.</i>

1157
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:49,916
<i>Bruno survived.</i>

1158
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,293
<i>They found Bruno lying on top of him.</i>

1159
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,713
<i>Andrew Dean was a good Marine,</i>

1160
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,758
<i>and he was a very good man.</i>

1161
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:02,720
<i>God bless his soul.</i>

1162
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:06,057
Bruno, up, Bruno, Bruno.

1163
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,477
Bruno, here boy, here, up.

1164
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:13,606
Bruno up, Bruno, Bruno, here boy.

1165
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,609
Bruno, here, Bruno.

1166
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,779
He's looking for him.

1167
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,531
He'll never stop.

1168
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,409
Sometimes we don't realize,

1169
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:29,288
as much as they our family, we theirs, too.

1170
01:18:39,966 --> 01:18:42,760
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1171
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,013
Come on, baby.

1172
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,308
Okay, come on, gonna try again.
Let's try again.

1173
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:54,480
Ready? Ready?

1174
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,441
Rex, come.

1175
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,192
Come on, come on.

1176
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,281
Come on, come on.

1177
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,538
I know.

1178
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:12,874
It's okay.

1179
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,714
Rex, Rex.

1180
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:21,424
Hey, it's okay.

1181
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,343
Rex, come, it's okay, it's okay.

1182
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,680
It's okay.

1183
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,640
I'm gonna keep you safe.

1184
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,187
I don't know what we're gonna do,

1185
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,480
but we're not going back there.

1186
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:55,875
So, I've been thinking,

1187
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,377
I don't think I'm gonna re-enlist.

1188
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,255
How do you feel about that?

1189
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,299
You wanna come live with me?

1190
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:08,346
Did you just fart?

1191
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:10,848
That's disgusting.

1192
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,353
And now you're falling asleep
while I talk to you?

1193
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,440
I mean, do you have any plans?

1194
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:20,983
Um...

1195
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,946
My plan is just to figure
it out as I go along.

1196
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,113
The civilian life.

1197
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:28,074
You wanna live that pop life?

1198
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,159
Mmm-hmm?
What is that?

1199
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,995
You're gonna be the fourth
member of Destiny's Child?

1200
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,288
Not exactly, no.

1201
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:35,498
That wasn't my plan.

1202
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:38,668
Now, I'm gonna give you two weeks,

1203
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,087
and you're gonna be bored out your mind.

1204
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,257
I bet you'll be back in my office
begging for your job back.

1205
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,175
Yeah, but I was blown up, so...

1206
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,803
Boring sounds really great right now.

1207
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,056
I know it's been some rough times recently,

1208
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,016
but I just don't want you
to rush into something

1209
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,519
that you're not ready to get into,

1210
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,479
especially when this is something you love.

1211
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:00,940
It is what I love, but I...

1212
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:07,405
Pretty sure I found something,
someone that I love even more, and, um...

1213
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,448
Well, actually, I was wondering,

1214
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,534
I was hoping that you
would write me a letter

1215
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,828
supporting me to adopt him.

1216
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,414
Well, of course I will, Corporal.

1217
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,251
You think I'm crazy?

1218
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,715
Oh, is that a trick question? Like...

1219
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,009
No, I'm being serious.

1220
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:30,803
What, for leaving the Marines?

1221
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:32,597
Yeah.

1222
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:33,890
No, absolutely not.

1223
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:36,225
You did your time.

1224
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:40,563
Hey, when's your tour up?

1225
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:42,815
It was up...

1226
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:44,942
A week ago.

1227
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,529
Now, I'm theirs for another 51.

1228
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:54,577
Uh...

1229
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,662
Okay, so...

1230
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,334
You re-upped?

1231
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,670
Yeah, I mean,

1232
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,506
what, is that a problem?

1233
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:11,969
Yeah.

1234
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,138
That's a problem.

1235
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, Megan.

1236
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,435
Megan, what are you doing?

1237
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,062
Look, you didn't ask me when you decided

1238
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,522
to leave the Marines,
and I wouldn't expect you to.

1239
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,775
Look, it's your decision.
I'm happy...

1240
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,693
Don't pretend like you didn't
know this would piss me off.

1241
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,613
You act like we talked about this.

1242
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,198
I mean, how the hell could I know that?

1243
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:34,659
I don't know, but it sucks that you didn't.

1244
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,164
He's tender, he's tender.

1245
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:41,874
It's okay.

1246
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,125
You want to adopt this animal?

1247
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,961
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

1248
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,713
He's scared and he's tender, like I said.

1249
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:50,007
Please don't write that.

1250
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,467
Are you listening to me?

1251
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,303
He's just scared and he hates
this muzzle that he's wearing,

1252
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:57,598
and no offense, but he's not a massive
fan of being at the vet's either.

1253
01:22:58,975 --> 01:23:00,351
I'll see him again in a week.

1254
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:01,811
Okay, but please don't
leave that on his chart,

1255
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,312
'cause they'll never let me adopt him.

1256
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:04,730
That's the point.

1257
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:07,775
Are you having some sort of
like a power trip or something?

1258
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:10,569
Are you not supposed to be
helping these animals?

1259
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,407
You poked him where he's hurt.

1260
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,117
He reacted.

1261
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:20,246
Let's set off 40 pounds of
explosives five feet under you

1262
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,665
and see how you like
being poked afterwards.

1263
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,126
Please, I'm begging you.
Please take it out of his file!

1264
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,934
Where's Rex?
No idea.

1265
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:47,690
Hey, Forman.
Come on.

1266
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:49,525
What's the deal?

1267
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,277
I'm getting him ready.

1268
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:52,361
What do you mean?

1269
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:53,946
They want him in Afghanistan.

1270
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,197
What? What are you talking about?

1271
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:56,407
They're redeploying him.

1272
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,659
No, no, they took him off active duty.

1273
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,619
Well, I guess they changed their minds.

1274
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,205
Are you his handler?

1275
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:06,792
I'm sorry.

1276
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,879
Hey, jerks. Let's go.

1277
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:11,338
Gunny.

1278
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:33,819
Jesus, Leavey, what are you doing here?

1279
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,155
Gunny, I...

1280
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:40,910
I came to say that I am sorry
for messing up your office.

1281
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:43,162
Now that's the weakest
apology I ever heard.

1282
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,623
Rex is not ready to be redeployed.

1283
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:46,707
It's not my call.

1284
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,417
The vet disagrees with you.

1285
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,919
He's a different dog.

1286
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,003
He has changed.

1287
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,088
I can't help you.

1288
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:55,049
Please, please just
change his classification

1289
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:57,593
so that I can adopt him when he gets back,

1290
01:24:58,177 --> 01:24:59,220
if he gets back.

1291
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:00,805
Your concern for the animal is honorable.

1292
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,933
You're devoted to him,
and I understand that,

1293
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,101
and I understand why you're angry.

1294
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:07,812
I'm not angry, I am trying

1295
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:12,274
to give a war hero a home for
the last few years of his life.

1296
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,443
How would you feel
if we had to put Rex down

1297
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,822
because he bit the hand of a
four-year-old he passes on the street?

1298
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,367
Just because the boy was holding a toy gun?

1299
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:22,910
Hmm?

1300
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:25,037
It happens.

1301
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:26,956
I've...

1302
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,293
I've looked into the parents' eyes before.

1303
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,548
I know what that feels like.

1304
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,384
They aren't pets.

1305
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,885
They aren't even dogs anymore.

1306
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,263
They're warriors,

1307
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,765
and they come back with
all the same issues we do.

1308
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:50,396
We're not being cruel, we're being
intelligent and responsible.

1309
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,275
No, no, not to Rex.
I'm sorry.

1310
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:56,402
I really am.

1311
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:58,821
Please.

1312
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:01,991
Leavey, just let this one go.

1313
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,326
Please. Gunny.

1314
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,412
Please.

1315
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,746
Look, Leavey, I'm sorry.

1316
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,264
Look,

1317
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:28,392
he's being flown out in a couple of days.

1318
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,896
If you wanna say goodbye to him,
I can arrange that.

1319
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,421
Hey.

1320
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:21,278
I'm sorry.

1321
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,357
Megan.

1322
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,444
Megan, honey.

1323
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:46,989
Megan!

1324
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:51,577
What?

1325
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:53,704
Megan, put some clothes on.

1326
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,831
What?
Who loves you?

1327
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:57,750
What's going on?

1328
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,752
Come over here and meet her.

1329
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:02,212
I didn't name her because I wanted
you to, but if you don't call her

1330
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:03,547
Lover Girl, I think you're crazy.

1331
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,007
You've gotta be kidding me.

1332
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,175
No, I'm not kidding you.

1333
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,718
You thought you could just replace him?

1334
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,679
Honey, I'm not trying
to replace him, I just...

1335
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,683
Look, I know you love him, but...
Jesus Christ,

1336
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,602
Megan, you're a mess.
You can't let your whole life

1337
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:18,103
fall apart over some dog.

1338
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:20,022
Some dog?

1339
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,816
That dog saved my life.

1340
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,112
Go to hell.
Hey, now, Megan,

1341
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:28,364
you can't talk to your mother like that.

1342
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:29,782
She is trying to help you.

1343
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,283
Get a job, Jim.

1344
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:32,451
We are not finished here.

1345
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,537
You cannot come back to my
house like some big war hero

1346
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:38,374
and talk to me like that
just because you got hurt.

1347
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:39,625
Back off, Mom!

1348
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,543
You can screw up your life
as much as you want.

1349
01:29:41,627 --> 01:29:43,045
You cannot take it out on me.

1350
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,838
Go in there right now
and apologize to my husband!

1351
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:45,881
Apologize??
Yes!

1352
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,216
Apologize to this guy?

1353
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,300
Yes.

1354
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,135
I can't believe you left Dad
for this douchebag.

1355
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,553
You have no goddamn right to...

1356
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:53,722
You know what...
Go be with your father.

1357
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:55,641
I am done!
Gladly!

1358
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:11,281
Hey.

1359
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:19,164
Baby.

1360
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:29,633
Son of a bitch.

1361
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:39,059
Don't open it!

1362
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:40,269
Jesus, baby, baby.

1363
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,021
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a car.

1364
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,192
It's the alarm, sweetie, it's okay.

1365
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:52,865
It's all right.

1366
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:36,867
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1367
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:39,244
You have any idea how hot it is in there?

1368
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:40,913
How hot it is?

1369
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,831
Take care of your animal, asshole.

1370
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,375
My animal is fine.
What are you, crazy?

1371
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:52,257
Lunatic.

1372
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:14,530
Hi. Hi, yeah, can I talk to Forman?

1373
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:19,826
It's about Rex.

1374
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:22,788
Yeah, I know I keep calling.

1375
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,516
Megan, how are you doing?

1376
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:45,602
We haven't heard much from you.

1377
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,605
I'm okay, I'm better.

1378
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,399
In what ways?

1379
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,068
Well, I...

1380
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:58,448
I don't flip out as much when
I see or hear certain things.

1381
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,158
I still can't quite...

1382
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:06,415
Tolerate any real, um, human interaction.

1383
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:09,751
Even you guys are kind of a drag.

1384
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:12,546
How are you sleeping?

1385
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,506
Um...

1386
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,426
Just a few bad dreams.

1387
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:18,677
About?

1388
01:33:19,261 --> 01:33:21,805
Mmm. Mostly imagining what he's doing.

1389
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:25,684
Just hoping he's not in pain.

1390
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:28,854
He could die any day.

1391
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,106
He could be dead right now, and...

1392
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,359
What would you say to Rex
if he were here right now?

1393
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:40,365
Well, you know he's a dog, right?

1394
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:06,475
This is gonna sound so cheesy, but...

1395
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:08,226
Um...

1396
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,859
Sorry.
It's okay.

1397
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:24,034
I'd probably, um...

1398
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,704
I'd thank him for...

1399
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,501
Trying to teach me what love is.

1400
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:36,004
What do you mean, trying?

1401
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,590
It sounds like he taught you a lot.

1402
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,392
Hey.
Hey.

1403
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:50,268
Is that dinner?

1404
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,943
Well, they always said breakfast
is the most important meal.

1405
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:02,197
How was your day?

1406
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,992
You go to group?

1407
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:08,203
How was it?

1408
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,127
Uh, so, uh, this came for you.

1409
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,629
Who is Morales?

1410
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:20,215
Why is he sending you Mets crap?

1411
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,552
He's just some guy I used to know.

1412
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:26,221
Yeah, some guy I'm gonna have to
be chasing off with a shotgun?

1413
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:27,764
Mm-mm.

1414
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:30,809
Baby,

1415
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:36,189
I know that you feel
like you lost everything.

1416
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:41,153
I know what that feels like.

1417
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:47,159
But the thing is,
you gotta keep living.

1418
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:51,163
I am living.
No, you're not.

1419
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:55,292
This isn't living.

1420
01:35:57,085 --> 01:35:58,754
You gotta figure out what it would take

1421
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:01,840
to make it worth it.

1422
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,183
Rex would be worth it.

1423
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,441
You know what you gotta do?

1424
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:24,279
They won't talk to me.
I have abandoned him, I left.

1425
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,864
Then you gotta find a way.

1426
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,951
There are a few people in life, not many,

1427
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,662
that you gotta find a way for.

1428
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,915
If you needed something,

1429
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:38,126
I would do whatever it took,

1430
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,086
not because I'm any kind of great dad,

1431
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:44,382
but because how I love you
is stronger than what I'm not.

1432
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,888
I want you to be a person who shows up

1433
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,016
for work,

1434
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:56,394
for your friends' funerals,

1435
01:36:58,355 --> 01:36:59,523
for life.

1436
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,819
I've tried, I failed.

1437
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:04,986
So fail again.

1438
01:37:05,946 --> 01:37:10,826
And just keep failing until they're
tossing dirt on your corpse.

1439
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:15,664
Baby, all you gotta do is fight,

1440
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:17,582
and you know how to fight.

1441
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,752
You're a frickin' Marine.

1442
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,004
Right?

1443
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,551
I love you.

1444
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:32,889
Can I toss this, please?

1445
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:36,017
Maybe burn it?

1446
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:38,603
Please.

1447
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:39,813
It's disgusting.

1448
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,232
Actually, maybe just keep the card.

1449
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:43,775
You don't need it.

1450
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:48,154
I can't wait another three weeks
for someone to call me back.

1451
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:49,906
Can I just talk to him for five minutes?

1452
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,493
Well, it's actually not.
It's an Air Force decision.

1453
01:37:53,577 --> 01:37:55,704
The Air Force oversees the canine program.

1454
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,664
Well, then, can you tell me
exactly where he is?

1455
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:03,378
Okay, look, I know
I sound like a stalker here,

1456
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,088
but I'm calling for a war hero.

1457
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,138
Hello?
Corporal Leavey.

1458
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:16,474
It's Sergeant Forman.

1459
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:17,934
<i>I've been getting your messages all week,</i>

1460
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:19,853
<i>figured I better call you back,</i>

1461
01:38:19,936 --> 01:38:20,896
seeing as you're the only reason

1462
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,981
I still have a complete set of butt cheeks.

1463
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:25,358
Hey, yeah, I have been calling all week.

1464
01:38:25,442 --> 01:38:28,653
I guess I just wanted to know, how's Rex?

1465
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:29,988
He'd love to see you.

1466
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:32,365
Wait, what?
Rex.

1467
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,162
<i>You there?</i>
Yeah, uh...

1468
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,414
They finally decided to retire him.

1469
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,876
I just thought you might want
to come to the ceremony.

1470
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,711
Yes, I'm...

1471
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:46,588
<i>Does this mean that I can adopt him now?</i>

1472
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:50,008
I don't think so. I'm looking at his
file and it says he's unadoptable.

1473
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,094
I know what it says, I know, but, uh...

1474
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:54,638
I mean, hasn't he been reassessed?

1475
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:56,222
I have no idea,

1476
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:59,809
but it still says unadoptable
on his paperwork,

1477
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:02,312
and, uh...

1478
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:05,273
He's pretty sick, Megan.

1479
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,151
How bad is it?

1480
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,112
If you're gonna try and do
something, I'd do it fast.

1481
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:39,474
All right, then after that, we open.

1482
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:40,725
Senator?

1483
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:43,561
Senator Schumer?

1484
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:46,439
Excuse me, can I just have
a moment of your time?

1485
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,691
I'm in the middle of something.

1486
01:39:47,774 --> 01:39:48,817
I've been calling for weeks.

1487
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,652
It's about my partner in Afghanistan.

1488
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,404
He's not doing well.
He needs your help.

1489
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,155
All right, I'll get back to you later.

1490
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:57,617
Uh, his name is Rex.
He's a bomb sniffer.

1491
01:39:57,701 --> 01:39:59,202
He saved thousands of lives in Iraq.

1492
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,873
Here we are in Fallujah.
He found all those AK-47s.

1493
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:07,127
And here we are in Ramadi,

1494
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:09,587
and, uh, here he is today.

1495
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,173
He's 10 years old,
and if I can't adopt him,

1496
01:40:12,257 --> 01:40:13,550
then they're gonna put him to sleep.

1497
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,344
What did you say your name was?

1498
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,013
Uh, Megan, sorry.

1499
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:21,433
Corporal Megan Leavey.

1500
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,768
Oh, very nice to meet you, Corporal.

1501
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:25,854
My pleasure.

1502
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:30,567
Um, sir, sir, excuse...
Excuse me!

1503
01:40:30,984 --> 01:40:32,444
Sir!

1504
01:40:33,069 --> 01:40:35,989
Finn, don't yell at people.

1505
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:37,365
How else am I supposed
to get his attention?

1506
01:40:37,449 --> 01:40:38,658
You're literally scaring him away.

1507
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:39,951
Just be quiet.

1508
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,120
Have a conversation with someone.

1509
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:43,997
Hi, sign my petition to
adopt a veteran war dog?

1510
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,623
So, what is this for?

1511
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:49,627
This is a petition for me
to adopt my Marine war dog.

1512
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:52,630
He's very sick and his
retirement ceremony's coming up,

1513
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:54,340
so I'm really hoping
I get to bring him home.

1514
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:58,178
You're the Marine?
Mmm-hmm.

1515
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,138
Thank you.

1516
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,765
Thank you for your service.

1517
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:07,312
It's not that hard.

1518
01:41:12,442 --> 01:41:16,613
We're live in five, four, three...

1519
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:21,242
Hi, I'm Kristine Johnson.

1520
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:23,828
Today, we're joined by
a very special guest.

1521
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:27,248
Thank you, Megan, for being here,
and tell us your story.

1522
01:41:27,332 --> 01:41:29,167
Why is Rex so important to you?

1523
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:32,504
Well, he's just an amazing animal,

1524
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:36,674
<i>and I want him to be able
to live the rest of his life</i>

1525
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:40,762
<i>in a happy home with someone
that he knows and loves.</i>

1526
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:41,971
<i>And why can't he?</i>

1527
01:41:42,055 --> 01:41:45,391
<i>Um, because a while ago,
they thought he was unsafe,</i>

1528
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,143
<i>but really, he was just scared,</i>

1529
01:41:47,519 --> 01:41:50,063
<i>and probably confused,</i>

1530
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:53,691
<i>probably just as confused and
scared as I was at the time.</i>

1531
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:57,362
And you were hit by an explosion together,
an IED, isn't that right?

1532
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:00,198
Yeah, in 2006, we were injured in Iraq.

1533
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:02,283
But despite your injuries,

1534
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,452
the two of you continued the mission.

1535
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:06,079
That's right.
That's amazing.

1536
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:07,455
Oh, thank you.

1537
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:10,375
<i>Now, I read that you have 22...</i>

1538
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,584
<i>Twenty-two thousand.</i>

1539
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:12,961
<i>Twenty-two thousand names on your petition.</i>

1540
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,129
Yes!

1541
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:15,964
That kind of support, is it helping?

1542
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:19,134
Well, we hope it is,
but it's too early to tell.

1543
01:42:19,217 --> 01:42:21,553
Good luck, Megan,
we're really pulling for you here.

1544
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:22,804
I appreciate it.

1545
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,140
Go ahead.

1546
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:28,643
Hold there.

1547
01:42:30,687 --> 01:42:32,147
I'm here for the retirement ceremony.

1548
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,648
Head to the fields, Corporal.

1549
01:42:35,692 --> 01:42:36,901
There you go.

1550
01:42:44,409 --> 01:42:45,702
Hey, I know you.

1551
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:52,250
Yeah, you're, uh, that famous
war hero, right, that's on TV?

1552
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,421
Big-time Mets fan.

1553
01:42:57,547 --> 01:42:59,924
What are you doing? Hey.

1554
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:07,682
You're back.

1555
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:10,018
Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:12,270
I'm, uh, here for Chico's retirement,

1557
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:15,190
then I ship back out in two days,
Camp Leatherneck.

1558
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,233
Can't get enough of that place.

1559
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:20,486
After that, that's it.

1560
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:23,198
Time to come home.

1561
01:43:26,409 --> 01:43:27,410
Wow.

1562
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:33,458
So, I hear Rex is retiring today, too.

1563
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:35,460
Yeah, I...

1564
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:40,340
Trying to get signatures,
still trying to bring him home.

1565
01:43:41,466 --> 01:43:42,717
Are you gonna get in some faces again?

1566
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,927
Start a couple brawls, maybe?

1567
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,595
Put someone in a choke hold,
knock someone out?

1568
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:48,056
Yeah, yeah, if I have to, yeah.

1569
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:54,145
Sorry, I haven't called you back. I...

1570
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,773
It's all good.

1571
01:43:57,982 --> 01:43:59,317
Look,

1572
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,488
it wasn't our time.

1573
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:11,079
At least one Marine
gets the girl in the end.

1574
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:16,751
You know, you rattled every
chain in the command, right?

1575
01:44:17,794 --> 01:44:19,629
I get to be the one to break the big news.

1576
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:22,882
Better take him home before
they change their minds.

1577
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,041
Rex!

1578
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,095
Hey.

1579
01:45:10,054 --> 01:45:11,264
Hi.

1580
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,668
Welcome home!

1581
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,339
What do you think?

1582
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:46,090
You like it?

1583
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,843
Sit, good boy, what's that?

1584
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,845
What is that? What's that?

1585
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:52,555
What about this?
You like a football?

1586
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:55,016
You like that, you like that?

1587
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:56,267
Oh, this is your favorite one.

1588
01:45:57,685 --> 01:45:59,354
Here's your girlfriend.
Here's your girlfriend.

1589
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:01,356
Yeah, yeah.

1590
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:04,525
You've got my hand, you've got my hand.
