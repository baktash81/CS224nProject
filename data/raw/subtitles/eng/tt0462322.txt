1
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,443
They called him Machete.

2
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,500
Selling the harsh day for the hard one.

3
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,101
100 for ruffin.

4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,669
Get in.

5
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:39,720
125 for accepting.

6
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:41,743
So which?

7
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,534
Have you ever killed anyone before?

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,086
As you may know

9
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,885
illegal aliens such as yourself

10
00:00:47,886 --> 00:00:49,523
are being forced out of our country

11
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:50,904
at an alarming rate.

12
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,936
For the good of other people.

13
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,795
Our new senator must die.

14
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:59,208
And for that I will pay you $150,000.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,988
Cash.

16
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:04,673
He was given an offer he couldn't refuse.

17
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,201
I cost the most.

18
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:10,264
Cause I'm the best there is.

19
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,605
Set up. Double crossed.

20
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,754
And left for dead.

21
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,263
I took a vow of peace.

22
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:29,211
And now you want me to help
you kill all these men?

23
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:30,358
Yes, bro.

24
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:32,983
I mean paltry.

25
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:35,852
So what I can do?

26
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,471
He knows the score.

27
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:49,108
Where are my wife and daughter?

28
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,374
He gets the women.

29
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:58,207
And he kills the bad guys.

30
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:03,710
You know that a Mexican day-labor

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,580
is a goddam federal?

32
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,216
But they soon realize.

33
00:02:09,236 --> 00:02:10,840
He's coming after us.

34
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:15,314
They just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

35
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:19,998
Action.

36
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:22,957
Suspense.

37
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,342
Emotion.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,608
Please father, have mercy.

39
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,671
God has mercy, I don't.

40
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,845
If you're gonna hire Machete
to kill the bad guy

41
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:41,791
You better make damn sure the bad guy

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,249
... isn't you.

43
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,511
Machete.

44
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,297
Rated X.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,365
Brought to you from your friends
at the Weinstein Company.

46
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,970


47
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,970


48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,730


49
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:27,740


50
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,960


51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,488


52
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:36,232


53
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,329
The roofer is in the house.

54
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,903
God damn it, girls.

55
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,774
If you're gonna do that shit, do it on stage.

56
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:43,596
Smoking hot.

57
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,162
Cherry darling, I told you too
many fucking times.

58
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:53,725
You can't be up there crying
and all that shit.

59
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,808
You know what go-go dance is?

60
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,697
Useless talent No. 12?

61
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,572
No. It's a happy dance.

62
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:04,458
You're up there and you dance happy.
It's go go. Not cry cry.

63
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,265
I'm quitting.

64
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,465
You say that at least one night a week.

65
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,094
I mean it this time.

66
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:14,817
I need a dramatic change in my life.

67
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,373
I've always said you're funny.

68
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:19,119
But if you don't stop all that crying and shit
I might have to fire your fucking ass.

69
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,748
And I don't wanna fire your ass 'cause
I love looking at your ass.

70
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,783
Any girl leaving early
must check out with their finger

71
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,778
and have a bye-bye slip.

72
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:30,436
Here is my finger.

73
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,803
And here is my bye-bye slip.

74
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:02,143
Dick.

75
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:03,089


76
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:14,845


77
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,523
All right boys. Come on.

78
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:46,675
All right. All right.
Come on.

79
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,338


80
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,189
Wait here, Lieutenant.

81
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,846
I'll handle this.

82
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,749
Hey, Abby.

83
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,361
I can see you've had a spot of trouble, Romey.

84
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:11,261
Would you like to tell me what happened?

85
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:12,662
They escaped.

86
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,000
All three?

87
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,011
Yeah.

88
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,711
I don't know...

89
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,285
I don't know how they did it.
Just... They got out...

90
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,473
I'm sorry, Romey.
But I just don't trust you anymore.

91
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:27,091
And you know the rules.

92
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,950
I'm out. I swear, Abby. I'm..

93
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,323
You're not gonna see me anymore.

94
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,612
Not so fast.

95
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,434
I also want your balls.

96
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,878
I'm really quite attached to them.

97
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,472
Oh, sweetheart.

98
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:57,352
I was really attached to my specimens.

99
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,466
Now they're out there
in the night doing God knows what.

100
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:03,304
I can't do it Abby. Please..
Please, Abby.

101
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:11,551
Let me go you fuckers.
Son of a bitch. Abby!

102
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,932
Listen. You don't need, Abby.

103
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,917
There's more.
There's more I can get you all you'll ever need.

104
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:20,624
Fucking fuzzy.
Let me go you son of a bitch.

105
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,101
I can get you more. No!

106
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,920
Pick this up please.

107
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,636
Where is the shit?

108
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,638
The shit's right there.

109
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,088
The deal is still good.

110
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:20,613
No.

111
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:22,245
It's not.

112
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:24,952
Hell down on me.

113
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,005
Now I want all of it.

114
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:56,090
Looks like I got you by the balls, Abby.

115
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,818


116
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:58,596
So.

117
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,934
I ask you one more time.

118
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:05,583
Where's...

119
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:07,801
the...

120
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,153
...shit?

121
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,687
Everywhere.

122
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:55,700
Ah, bulls.

123
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,924
Get that thing away from my pumps.

124
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:42,630
It's just overheating.

125
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,857
I need to get to town.

126
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,164
It's just a stripped radiator cab.

127
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:56,073
Water leaks when the heat's up.

128
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,313
No pressure.

129
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:04,921
Are you OK?

130
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:06,537
I'm just Cherry.

131
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,156
Wanna have a seat anywhere?
I'll be right in.

132
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:14,805
Here. Take this with you.

133
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,802
Not your good spring water?

134
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,490
Ain't nothing good about it.
Bottled myself.

135
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,746
I get it right there out of them.

136
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:24,016
Thanks...

137
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:25,178
JT.

138
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,581
We're serving inside tonight.

139
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,876
Best barbecue in Texas.
Round the clock.

140
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,131
I gotta go.

141
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,494
Saving lives? Are you?

142
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,088
How did you know that?

143
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,804
Now that's a rump roast.

144
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,996
I couldn't get off work this week.

145
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:56,430
But you only have to stay till ten.

146
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,893
A friend of mine will be here before
ten to pick up Tony.

147
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,739
I'm gonna eat your brains and
gain your knowledge.

148
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:06,097
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

149
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,227
Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

150
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:13,664
There's a packed suitcase under his bed.

151
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,109


152
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:19,025
Give it to Tony to take with
him when my friend picks him up.

153
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,429
I'll leave him watching TV.

154
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,557
But you need to be here in
the next 20 minutes.

155
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:31,310
Thank you.

156
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:37,057
Hey, what happened to your tooth?
- Fell out.

157
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,171
Say a prayer for your old man.

158
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,032
"No dead bodies for Dada tonight."

159
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:47,335
No dead bodies for Daddy tonight.

160
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,063
Amen.
- Amen.

161
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:56,291
Who was that you were talking to?
- Baby-sitter.

162
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,676
She's on her way.

163
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:07,358


164
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:40,956
How's it going, JT?
- All right.

165
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:43,910
Still open I see.
- Oh yeah. All night.

166
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:50,256
Free of charge.
Tonight is a special night.

167
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,538
What's so special about tonight?

168
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,497
Been open 25 years.

169
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:58,660
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

170
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:00,163
Who's the first?

171
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:01,757
Right there.

172
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,455
Must be passing through.

173
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:11,951
Seems only strangers eat here.

174
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:15,005
I still eat here, JT.

175
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,218
Yeah, you sure do.

176
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,288
By the way don't choke on
all that food you eat.

177
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,472
Hello, Palomita.

178
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,376
I don't go by that name any more.

179
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:37,757
So

180
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:41,325
You will become that fancy doctor?

181
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,035
Never did.

182
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,478
Thought for sure you would.

183
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,493
Talked about it enough.

184
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,023
That's the problem with goals.

185
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,621
They become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

186
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:59,136
That's my jacket.

187
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:02,650
I looked for it for 2 weeks.

188
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:05,086
Yeah? How long did you look for me, Wray?

189
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,876
Only the jacket belonged to me, you didn't.

190
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:08,692
So.

191
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,018
What are you doing now?

192
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,639
I'm going to be a stand up comedian.

193
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,416
Really?

194
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:23,904
You're not funny.

195
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:27,801
That's what I have been
trying to tell everybody.

196
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,990
But they all say I'm hysterical.

197
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,092
But you are not.

198
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,932
There is a difference between being frank

199
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,054
... and being dick.

200
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:39,743
Yeah.

201
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,559
Well.

202
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,372
It was really good seeing you again.

203
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,845
What name do you go by now?

204
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,220
In case I wanna catch one of your shows.

205
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:51,274
Cherry.

206
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,100
Cherry Darling.

207
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:57,177
It sounds like a stripper.

208
00:18:57,234 --> 00:19:00,585
No, it sounds like a Go Go Dancer.
There's a difference.

209
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,947
You'll always be Palomita to me.

210
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,412
I need a ride.

211
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,617
What do you say, El Wray?

212
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:24,331
I'll give you a ride.

213
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,314
Goodbye, Bill.

214
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,898
Which means 'See you later' ?

215
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:31,973
Of course.

216
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:36,725
What's up, Doc?

217
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,200
Your lady's looking pretty
good there. We're gonna see..

218
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,206
See if she could suck
the bend out of a river.

219
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:43,645
I'm kidding.

220
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,237
Take a look at that shit.

221
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,265
What happened to your arm?

222
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,595
I got bit.

223
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:50,387
Bit?

224
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,962
Bit by what?

225
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,340
Well... If I told you, you probably
wouldn't believe me.

226
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:58,067
Some bacterium or something?

227
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,396
Can you just sew it up?

228
00:20:03,366 --> 00:20:04,746
Normally, I would.

229
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,561
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

230
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,894
My problem is this one doesn't bleed.

231
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:11,853
Oh shit, check this out.

232
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:16,704
When this was still a military hospital,
this one guy came back from Iraq with this.

233
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,813
Chronic herpetic lesions.

234
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,844
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here.

235
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,094
Kind of like a fountain.

236
00:20:23,142 --> 00:20:24,851
Ah, Jesus.

237
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:27,392
How did you treat it?

238
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,092
Fuck that, I was never in Iraq.

239
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,870
Good for you.

240
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,923
This shit they spread around
there you wouldn't believe.

241
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:34,700
I swear to God I've got some Iraqi eye-balls

242
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,832
a friend of mine brought back
to make some studies on.

243
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:39,001
Incredible.
They were completely milked over.

244
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,359
Mustard gas does it to the eyes.
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

245
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:45,186
Spots fly you think?

246
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:49,693
Chronic viral lesion.
That looks like gout.

247
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,858
He's running a temperature of 105.

248
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:55,518
Is that bad?
- It's high.

249
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,033
Bad would be 108.

250
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:00,133
You could have a seizure, go psychotic.

251
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,686
And probably die.

252
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,635
Say ahh.
- Ahhh.

253
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:07,621
Ugh! Jesus!

254
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:08,835
Nice.

255
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,950
Black abscess tongue.

256
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:13,448
All abscesses should be drained. Period.

257
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,394


258
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,871
Shut up, Joe.

259
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:35,654
Baby.

260
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:37,958
Get the needles.

261
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,045
Right there.

262
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:45,384
Right now.
- Asshole.

263
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:55,018
It's spreading.

264
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:59,693
When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

265
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,825
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

266
00:22:01,826 --> 00:22:03,389
Lose arm? What do
you mean lose arm? My arm?

267
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,002
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

268
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,961
Now if we don't sever that arm now
it's gonna take over your chest.

269
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,855
We can't very well cut that off, can we?

270
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,982
Well shouldn't I get a second opinion?

271
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,201
Hi Joe.

272
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:18,097
I'm going to give you a very
strong anesthetic.

273
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,833
So you don't feel anything
during the procedure.

274
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:23,244
These are my friends.

275
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:25,222
My yellow friend

276
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,784
Is just to take the sting off.

277
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:31,606
My blue friend

278
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:33,795
You'll barely feel.

279
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:37,452
That means my yellow friend
has already taken effect.

280
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,131
See how fast my friends work?

281
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,894
And after my red-headed friend

282
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,994
You'll never see me again.

283
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,868
We all react differently.

284
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:02,856
Now what?

285
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:06,814
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia.
In loving memory.

286
00:23:19,787 --> 00:23:21,352
It's not the radiator.

287
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:23,924


288
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,595
What? Fucking pale.
Cheap.

289
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:03,571
Hey!

290
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,648
Bastard.

291
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:22,753
Hey, stop.

292
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,084


293
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:41,052
Stop!

294
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,442
Stop please.

295
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,860
What the hell was that?

296
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,436
People picking up road kill.

297
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,154
What? Like an armadillo?

298
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:14,845
Deer.

299
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,493
There are a lot of them around here.

300
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:21,519
You know I read a statistic that said

301
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:26,406
That the eating of venison
has risen 30 percent in the last few years.

302
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,497
Sixty percent of that's from road kill.

303
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,783
People eat road kill?

304
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,262
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour...

305
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:35,823
... and a deer darts out in front of you

306
00:25:36,044 --> 00:25:39,353
If you blink or brake or swerve ...

307
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,145
Sure you'll just kill yourself.

308
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:42,671
So what do you do?

309
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:44,273
Pick them off.

310
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:45,905
Just like this.

311
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,815
Send them flying away from you.

312
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:48,968
Unacceptable.

313
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:08,549
Cherry?

314
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:14,110
I thought you said if you saw a deer
you shouldn't fucking swerve.

315
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,707
That wasn't a deer.

316
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:53,978
Palomita.

317
00:26:58,282 --> 00:26:59,548
Don't let her die on me, Block.

318
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:00,883
What we got?
- Car accident.

319
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:05,238
Heavy contusions about the torso,
possible spinal trauma.

320
00:27:05,338 --> 00:27:07,673
One severed limb.

321
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,641
Where is the leg?

322
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,926
Three 'psychos' attacked her.

323
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:13,923
I shot at them.

324
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:16,649
I never miss.

325
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:22,879
They took the leg with them.

326
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:36,795
You have to come with us Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know.

327
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,280
He has to sign her in.

328
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:39,214
Do what now?

329
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,663
If he's with her,
he's responsible for her.

330
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,440
He'll fill this out after we talk. Let's go.

331
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:49,927
What were you doing with a rifle, Wray?

332
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:50,907
Nothing.

333
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,118
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

334
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,370
Come on, Wray.

335
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:58,373
You know you are not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

336
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,626
Here, I stick my neck out for you.

337
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:04,414
Now you've got a girl in your
wrecked truck with a missing leg?

338
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:06,637
A missing leg? It's now missing?

339
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,656
And here you're saying in front of everybody

340
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,579
that someone up and snatched it?

341
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,037
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

342
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,434
that you never should
have had in the first place?

343
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,953
And that now they're gone?

344
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:18,510
Sheriff, can we finish this
conversation somewhere else?

345
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,099
My thought exactly.

346
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:23,900
Dr. Block. Three fresh ones rolling in.

347
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:25,052
Christ, you're kidding.

348
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,429
Automobile accident off Highway 18.

349
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,065
DOA's?

350
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:31,071
Get Andy to pick them up.

351
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,894
That's unsanitary, Doc.

352
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,451
It helps me monitor my state of calmness.

353
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:39,198
If you get worked up enough to crack it.

354
00:28:40,091 --> 00:28:42,270
You might cut yourself pretty good.

355
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:44,401
Then I'd know I was not calm.

356
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:52,987
What do you say now, Doc?

357
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,837
Somebody call my wife.

358
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,936
It's JT, Sheriff.

359
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,547
JT? How is the barbecue business?

360
00:29:02,595 --> 00:29:05,744
Ever since my bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's going shit.

361
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,625
Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.

362
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:09,382
I wish there was something I could do.

363
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,022
Right now I ain't calling my brother.
I'm calling the sheriff.

364
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:16,514
What's the trouble?
- It ain't no trouble, not yet anyway.

365
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:20,134
I've got two delinquents been hanging
around here for over an hour.

366
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,707
They won't purchase.
They won't leave.

367
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:24,627
Oh never mind, here they come.

368
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,958
You cook that meat at 250 degrees, don't you?

369
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:30,885
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

370
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,995
You give me that recipe or I'll raise your
rent higher than Georgia pine.

371
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:36,678
Brother, ain't no Texans ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

372
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:38,615
That's a fact. He'd take it to his grave.

373
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,352
I could be bleeding like a
stuck pig I ain't gonna tell you.

374
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:44,690
I could be dying in your arms,
I ain't gonna tell you.

375
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:47,000
We'll see about that.

376
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:51,663
You gonna look?

377
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:54,255
Or you gonna eat?

378
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,139
You called for me?

379
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,534
I need for you to see this.

380
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:10,108
Looks like a no-brainer.

381
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:11,306
What does that mean?

382
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,374
No brain.

383
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,600
Scooped clean out of her skull.

384
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,696
.. don't...

385
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:18,940
Don't tell me.

386
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:20,581
Liquifactive necrosis.

387
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,480
Do you think?
- Oh sure.

388
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,765
Thank you, that'll be all.

389
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,656
Did you know she was back in town?

390
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:44,477
No.

391
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:47,224
I didn't.

392
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,523
What happened to her?

393
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:57,547
I don't know baby.

394
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:05,356
I thought you stopped seeing each other.

395
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,882
Oh yeah.

396
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:13,240
Yes, you have now. She's fucking dead.

397
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:17,157
I mean we stopped before.

398
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:25,611
I haven't talked to her in a while.

399
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,748
But you've written each other.

400
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:37,078
Here and there.

401
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:39,438
But nothing.

402
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:41,017
What are you doing?

403
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:44,341
Let me see your last three messages.

404
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,358
You have no right ...
- I don't?

405
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:52,941
I don't have a right?

406
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:58,811
Show it to me.

407
00:31:59,022 --> 00:31:59,720
No.

408
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:04,645
Now that's just to take the sting off.

409
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,347
Show it to me.

410
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:11,181
No please.

411
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:14,581
Show it to me.

412
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,565
Now let's see how fast your friends work.

413
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:34,176
It's pretty fast.

414
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,566
What do I know, my love?

415
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:42,246
Exactly.

416
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,781
That you're a cheating ...

417
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,423
lying...

418
00:32:49,073 --> 00:32:50,129
... sack.

419
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,433
I didn't want to hurt you.

420
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:55,015
But you did.

421
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:56,695
Because...

422
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,883
You're insane.

423
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:03,696
And I was afraid.

424
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,516
Of what you might do to me.

425
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,301
And to our son.

426
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:12,529
I'm the mother of your son.

427
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,166
And after this one

428
00:33:21,222 --> 00:33:23,372
I'll never see you again.

429
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:38,295
Block.

430
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:39,697
What?

431
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:43,016
You've gotta see this.

432
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:44,926
I'll be right there.

433
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,756
Where the hell are the bodies?

434
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,752
That's what we wanted to show you.

435
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,135
They are gone.

436
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,908
They didn't just get up and walk out, did they?

437
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:54,626


438
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,662
Somebody take care of this
perp for me before I fucking kill him.

439
00:34:57,745 --> 00:35:00,473
What the hell is going on?
- He was causing a ruckus over at Skip's place.

440
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:01,747
So I cuffed him.

441
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:04,983
Son of a bitch.
He bit my goddamn finger off.

442
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:07,900
Quit your hollering and get
yourself a goddamn band-aid.

443
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,582
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff!

444
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,841
He bit my finger clean off.

445
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:14,588
Shit.

446
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:15,630
Get him.

447
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:16,406
Book him.

448
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,268
Cause I'll fucking kill him if I have to do it.

449
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:19,325
Carlos.

450
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,563
Go get him.

451
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,018
Wray.

452
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:24,945
You stay put.

453
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,483
Are you sure he is in there?

454
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:49,021
He was.

455
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:51,766
Motherfucker.

456
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:25,967
He's gone.

457
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,367
Broke out the window.

458
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:29,905
Where's my finger?

459
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:31,982
Found your ring.

460
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:34,859
Could be the same guy as
your leg snatcher?

461
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:38,017
I didn't get a good look at mine.

462
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:43,333
Is that him over there?

463
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:38,034
Wray?

464
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:30,646
No. Don't touch him.

465
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:31,634
Why not?

466
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:33,051
He is infected.

467
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:34,558
With what?

468
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:35,671
Everything.

469
00:38:35,923 --> 00:38:36,932
Wray!

470
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,645
Drop the fucking gun.

471
00:38:45,418 --> 00:38:47,760
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

472
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,673
I'm gonna go and get Cherry.

473
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:50,538
Fine.

474
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:52,368
But we're taking my car.

475
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,162
I'm riding with you.

476
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:03,112
Don't make any sudden moves.

477
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,343
Viral infections.

478
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,960
They came pouring in.

479
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:23,541
Some are rapidly developing
colophony lesions.

480
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,490
Highly contagious.

481
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,717
What do you think?

482
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,770
Self-preservation comes to mind.

483
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,075
Yeah.

484
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,197
Just get the hell out of here.

485
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,355
First let me get my wife.

486
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,779
I love you sweetie.

487
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:47,689
There you go.

488
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:48,827
Come on.

489
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:49,557
C'mon.

490
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:50,830
Open up, dear.

491
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:53,649
I want you to be around for a while.
You understand?

492
00:40:53,707 --> 00:40:56,250


493
00:40:58,141 --> 00:40:58,986
Damn.

494
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:00,628
Mom.

495
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:04,842
You fart like a goddam pack mule.

496
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,244


497
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,668
I hate to do this to you, Earl.
But we need every man on the job.

498
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,669
The shit has hit the fan.

499
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:17,203
We need some guns and ammo.
Meet me at my brother's.

500
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:19,372
I got you. I'll be there.

501
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,040
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

502
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:23,866
C'mon.

503
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:13,740
Oh my God!

504
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,564
What the hell is going on?

505
00:43:16,184 --> 00:43:17,539
Are you gonna give me a gun?

506
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,757
Are you fucking kidding me?

507
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,203
Palomita.

508
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:34,112
Get up. We're leaving.

509
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:35,396
I can't walk.

510
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:36,471
So what?

511
00:44:36,845 --> 00:44:37,536
Get up.

512
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,323
Get up!

513
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:42,467
Motherfucker.

514
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:44,051
Look at me.

515
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:45,856
Look at me.

516
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:49,686
I was gonna be a stand up comedian.

517
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,333
But who's gonna laugh now?

518
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:53,388
Some of the best jokes are about cripples.

519
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:55,773
Let's go.
- It's not funny. It's pathetic.

520
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,808
Would you stop crying over fucking...

521
00:44:57,908 --> 00:44:58,872
...spilt milk?

522
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,983
I have no leg.

523
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:11,479
Now you do.

524
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:13,296
What do you think?

525
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,480
You could carry me, Wray?

526
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:22,193
You never wanted that before.

527
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,555
Why start now.

528
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,104
Sheriff must have taken the others to JT's.

529
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:47,172
Get in.

530
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:55,554
God damn it. Wait for me.

531
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,004
My leg stuck with the door.

532
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,209
It's just wood.

533
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:11,220
It's splintering.

534
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:13,090
You just leave it alone.

535
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,064
Why is this happening with me?

536
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:17,550
Just do me a favor right now.

537
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,083
Stay strong.

538
00:46:20,888 --> 00:46:21,800
Stay?

539
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:24,284
Yeah baby.

540
00:46:24,594 --> 00:46:25,391
Stay.

541
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,156
Okay.

542
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:29,744
My name is Electra.

543
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,697
Fucking listen.

544
00:46:30,797 --> 00:46:33,270
My name is Electra.
My name is Electra, too.

545
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,391


546
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:36,330
It's Berry.

547
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,274


548
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:39,429
No.

549
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,940
Is that Berry you want?

550
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,106


551
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:43,740
And from Electra and from Emilia.

552
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,664
Doesn't make any fucking sense.

553
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:48,106


554
00:46:48,356 --> 00:46:51,750
You can call me whatever the
fuck you want. I don't give a shit.

555
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,537
Conio, chica.

556
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,181
You said 10.
- I'm sorry.

557
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,322
We can't be watching your kid
all god damn night.

558
00:47:00,422 --> 00:47:02,875
Your friend never showed up
and we got shit to do.

559
00:47:02,975 --> 00:47:04,608
That's right.

560
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:07,364
Then start doing it.

561
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,900
Hurry. We're leaving.

562
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:18,462
Wait. My tarantula.

563
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:20,649
Bring it. Let's go.

564
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,185
And my turtle.

565
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,201
And my scorpion.

566
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,468
And we're not octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

567
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:28,839
Act upon it.

568
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,942
C'mon. Let's go.

569
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:39,733
Tony, what did I tell you?

570
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:42,356
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

571
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:45,015
It's okay. They can live in the same tank.

572
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:47,227
What about my pocket-bike?

573
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,127
It's in the trunk.

574
00:47:50,653 --> 00:47:53,472
Where do you think you're
going fucking bitch?

575
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:56,951


576
00:48:04,024 --> 00:48:07,254


577
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:15,791
Are you sure you're gonna do this?

578
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:17,448


579
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:20,491
Everybody grab a badge and a gun!

580
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:23,472
You're all deputies as
of this moment forward.

581
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,180
Except for you, Wray.

582
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,990
Don't die for me.

583
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:37,543
What do we got?

584
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,168
Something's wrong up there.

585
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,629
JT always comes out and greets.

586
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:43,828
Let's go.

587
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,115
Why don't just shoot yourselves?

588
00:48:49,668 --> 00:48:51,336
Don't shoot each other.

589
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,406
But especially...

590
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:57,399
Don't shoot me.

591
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:05,867
JT?

592
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:14,330
God.

593
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,466
Get off him, Rusty.

594
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:22,849
God-damn, JT.

595
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,304
Barbecue?

596
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:38,772
Asshole.

597
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:43,188
Damn good sausage, JT.

598
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,085
Best in Texas.

599
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:48,244
I must have passed out
after I killed those things.

600
00:49:49,504 --> 00:49:50,522
Nice shooting.

601
00:49:50,622 --> 00:49:52,701
Everybody gather up supplies.

602
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:54,175
We head up to any.

603
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:20,902
I want you to open that for mommy.

604
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:27,214
Now take the gun.

605
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:28,913
Careful.

606
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:32,063
And if anyone comes to the door ...

607
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,570
... that isn't me

608
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:35,826
I want you to shoot them, okay?

609
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,871
I'm not kidding, Tony.

610
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:39,311
You shoot them.

611
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,615
Just like your video games.

612
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,561
You shoot them in the head.

613
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:46,299
What if it's Dad?

614
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:50,062
Especially if it's your dad.

615
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,094
And be careful where you point that thing.

616
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,187
You'll blow your own face off.

617
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:07,732
I'll be right back.

618
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:10,112
I love you.

619
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:37,203
Hello, baby.

620
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,059
Look what you did to our son!

621
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:19,365
Goddam it.
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

622
00:52:19,432 --> 00:52:20,216
Daddy.

623
00:52:23,718 --> 00:52:25,490
Get your sorry ass in.

624
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,518
If it's escape vehicles you want

625
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:33,086
Escape vehicles I got.
Right this way.

626
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,937
Watch that meat.

627
00:52:36,005 --> 00:52:37,195
Meet my wife.

628
00:52:38,837 --> 00:52:40,804
Jessy James custom dominator.

629
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:43,137
I made Jessy a plate of
barbecue so God damn good

630
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:45,585
He made this baby for me
free of fucking charge.

631
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:48,609
Got anything that can transport more people?

632
00:52:50,049 --> 00:52:51,038
Mustang.

633
00:52:51,686 --> 00:52:53,726
This baby is chopped. Permanent.

634
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:56,083
Ain't got no bull bar,
chicken wire, none of that shit.

635
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:58,122
No protection.
- And she's fast.

636
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,910
Nitrous injected 350 horsepower engine.

637
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:02,539
Who are you?

638
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:04,411
I mean really.

639
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:06,014
Wray's Wreckage?

640
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:08,846
That's what it says on your truck.

641
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,391
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

642
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:17,158
I'm nobody.

643
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:20,575
It's the easiest thing to remember.

644
00:53:22,121 --> 00:53:23,436
So remember it.

645
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,045
Hey, you want some barbecue?

646
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:34,667
Best in Texas.

647
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:36,377
No thanks.

648
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:38,221
What's the matter?
You don't eat meat?

649
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,583
Oh, I eat meat.

650
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:42,243
I also eat lots of shit.

651
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:43,510
See this?

652
00:53:44,403 --> 00:53:45,525
What's that?

653
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:47,033
Shit eating grin.

654
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,531
Got to be a comedian.

655
00:53:50,452 --> 00:53:51,873
What do you think of the leg?

656
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:53,236
It's funny.

657
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:57,183
How is your stump?

658
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,093
They knocked it out something fierce.

659
00:53:59,193 --> 00:54:00,904
So I can't feel a thing.

660
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,511
This must be the real Bone Shack.

661
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:08,988
Old JT knows how to live.

662
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:10,735
Like fuck he does.

663
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,330
I like how you say fuck.

664
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,202
Dude.
Fuck you.

665
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:20,417
Fuck me.

666
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:27,077
Oh, so now you're the comedian.

667
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:29,438
Go ahead.
Drop your pants.

668
00:54:29,504 --> 00:54:31,529
That will be good for a laugh.

669
00:54:32,258 --> 00:54:33,804
I highly doubt that.

670
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:41,729
That's my jacket.

671
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:44,177
Yes. I know.

672
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:46,279
I looked for it for two weeks.

673
00:54:47,268 --> 00:54:48,053
Look.

674
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:51,079
You were being an unbelievable dick.

675
00:54:51,156 --> 00:54:53,373
I was walking out on you.

676
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,499
I was cold. I took your fucking jacket.

677
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,861
So.

678
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,586
If you're gonna go on with your
psycho-obsessive-controlling rants

679
00:55:00,593 --> 00:55:02,472
about a fucking jacket
then fucking take it.

680
00:55:02,473 --> 00:55:06,633
Cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

681
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:09,824
Did you find what was in the pocket?

682
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,011
Fuck now.

683
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:13,076
Look for it.

684
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,847
No. The other one.

685
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,371
I was gonna give it to you. But you left me.

686
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:33,261
And you took the jacket.

687
00:55:34,605 --> 00:55:37,312
And I looked for it for two weeks.

688
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:40,002
Read it.

689
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:49,593
Two against the world.

690
00:55:52,504 --> 00:55:53,871
Remember that?

691
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:57,578
I never forgot it.

692
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:00,123
Why did you leave?

693
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,996
Because you didn't believe in us.

694
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:05,105
Or in me.

695
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:06,804


696
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:09,615


697
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,945


698
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,052


699
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:32,994
I'm sorry.

700
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:34,770
You're gonna be all right.

701
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,694


702
00:57:39,018 --> 00:57:40,772
Come on.

703
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:42,941
Move your ass! Come on.

704
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:51,216
Are you all right?

705
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:02,829
What did I tell you, Tony?

706
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:06,521
Don't point the gun at yourself.

707
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,382
Didn't I tell you that?

708
00:58:10,765 --> 00:58:12,838
Thank you for telling me about it.

709
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,085
You know.

710
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,527
Don't mention it.

711
00:58:16,218 --> 00:58:17,533
That's an order.

712
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,990
If I had known that you were...

713
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:23,701
El Wray

714
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:26,898
I wouldn't have given you such a hard time.

715
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,221
Didn't mean to be a prick about it.

716
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,140
Need to know basis, that kind of shit.

717
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,388
Take this.

718
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,892
Do what you do best.

719
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:41,136
No. You're not.

720
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:42,691
Don't give him the gun.

721
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,448
Give him that gun, Tolo.

722
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:47,837
Give him that gun.

723
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,948
Give him all the guns.

724
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,822
That boy's got the devil in him.

725
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,344
Get to fight. Come on.

726
00:59:15,698 --> 00:59:17,207
Get to our vehicles.

727
00:59:18,608 --> 00:59:20,087
Everyone behind me.

728
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:32,818
Outside now.

729
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:53,445
God damn you!

730
01:00:03,669 --> 01:00:05,264
Everybody back inside.

731
01:00:14,586 --> 01:00:15,594
You, Skip!

732
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:17,737
Front and center.

733
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:20,497
Go out front.
Start up the Kill Dozer.

734
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,357
We need it to transport
the other survivors.

735
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:25,487
You're fucking crazy?
I'm not going out there.

736
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,085
I'll cover you.
- Not going.

737
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:29,614
I never miss.

738
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:30,852
Come on, Skip.

739
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,301
It's go go.

740
01:00:33,704 --> 01:00:35,316
Not cry cry.

741
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,217
Cherry!

742
01:00:47,802 --> 01:00:49,802


743
01:01:37,105 --> 01:01:37,844
JT.

744
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:39,921
You take whoever you can
fit in your convertible.

745
01:01:39,922 --> 01:01:41,187
Everyone else on board.

746
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,239
Skip, grab the twins.
Come on with me.

747
01:01:43,316 --> 01:01:44,873
You take the chopper.

748
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:48,519
I need someone else to drive my truck.
- I'll do it.

749
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:52,311
You're bleeding like a stuck pig.

750
01:01:52,368 --> 01:01:54,519
If your vision's blurred, you're on your last flight.

751
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:55,988
Anything else?

752
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:57,428
Don't wreck it.

753
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,407


754
01:02:00,462 --> 01:02:02,824
It ain't no barbecue without coleslaw.

755
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:03,956
Take this.

756
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:06,126
Fuckin' cool.

757
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:10,014


758
01:02:12,623 --> 01:02:14,456
I can take care of myself.

759
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:16,606
Bye, Daddy.

760
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:19,815
You remember how to ride a bike?

761
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:21,658
Useless talent number 32.

762
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,541
Good.

763
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:25,724
Anyone else have a car?

764
01:02:30,906 --> 01:02:32,771
Are you sure you're okay
driving this van?

765
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:33,742
Hell yeah.

766
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,661
Dakota!

767
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:45,231
Your engine is shot you've
got three blown tires.

768
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,952
But it's got his pocket-bike in the trunk.

769
01:02:48,957 --> 01:02:52,757
Is it fast?
- Zero to fifty in four seconds.

770
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,241
You go with her.

771
01:02:55,504 --> 01:02:56,628
I'm Cherry.

772
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:58,884
You sure are.

773
01:03:00,093 --> 01:03:01,169
Move out.

774
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:03,492
Damn machine.

775
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:38,744
Rusty!

776
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:41,835
Goddammit!

777
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,531
Sheriff?

778
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,259
How much ammo we got?

779
01:04:24,462 --> 01:04:25,690
Not enough.

780
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:40,887
Don't shoot.
We're not infected.

781
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,747
All survivors gotta come with us.

782
01:04:54,187 --> 01:04:55,502
Especially you.

783
01:04:57,057 --> 01:04:58,049
El Wray.

784
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,436
I don't go by that name anymore.

785
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:16,241
It's okay.

786
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:22,079
We're here in quarantine with
the other survivors.

787
01:05:32,048 --> 01:05:33,267
Where is here?

788
01:05:34,659 --> 01:05:36,119
Field Army Base.

789
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:38,617
El Wray?

790
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:41,735
That you?

791
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:45,993
He's with them.
I saw him in the convoy earlier.

792
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,543
I'm a scientist.

793
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:49,127
And a businessman.

794
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:50,317
Not military.

795
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,907
Princess wise is gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

796
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:57,968
They are stealing biochemical weapons.

797
01:05:58,016 --> 01:05:58,957
DC2?

798
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,345
Also known as Project Terror.

799
01:06:02,432 --> 01:06:06,099
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled land locked area.

800
01:06:06,108 --> 01:06:08,365
And you were supplying it to them?

801
01:06:09,037 --> 01:06:10,314
So why'd they shut you out?

802
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:12,042
They've found my supply.

803
01:06:12,397 --> 01:06:13,866
It's under our feet.

804
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:16,045
Ten stories down.

805
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,665
The only treatment is a regimented
exposure to DC-2 itself.

806
01:06:20,011 --> 01:06:21,767
Delays the negative effects.

807
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:22,986
They need it.

808
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:25,228
Like a drug.

809
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:26,180
Correct.

810
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:30,263
But we found that a small percentage
of people are not affected by the gas itself.

811
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:33,055
And within this small percentage lies a cure.

812
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:34,650
What do you wanna do?

813
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:38,480
Mexico.

814
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,947
Put our backs against the ocean.

815
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:42,477
And defend ourselves from there.

816
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,647
No. We have to get back to my lab.

817
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:46,678
This infection will spread all over the world.

818
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:48,502
To every man, woman and child...

819
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:50,375
Unless I finish my antidote.

820
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:53,629
You have an antidote?

821
01:07:00,615 --> 01:07:01,345
You.

822
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:02,833
You.

823
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:04,100
Come with us.

824
01:07:05,176 --> 01:07:06,069
Move it.

825
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:27,796
Do you like Ava Gardner?

826
01:07:28,996 --> 01:07:29,860
Sorry?

827
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:35,249
Ava Gardner.

828
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:36,804
Do you like her?

829
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:39,492
Yeah, I guess.

830
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,449
I'm just thinking that you ...

831
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,540
... kinda look like
Ava Gardner a little bit.

832
01:07:52,545 --> 01:07:55,150
You've got something you
wanna say to me?

833
01:07:55,918 --> 01:07:57,529
I have nothing to say to you.

834
01:07:57,626 --> 01:07:59,738
You've nothing to say huh?
That's funny.

835
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:03,387
Cause I coulda swear you just give
me a fuck you look great now.

836
01:08:03,445 --> 01:08:05,461
You wanna say Fuck You to me?

837
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:07,198
Not at this moment.

838
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:11,791
You know what this is?

839
01:08:13,327 --> 01:08:14,162
A gun?

840
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:16,498
It's simplicity itself.

841
01:08:17,737 --> 01:08:20,521
You see you point it
at what you want to die.

842
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:23,157
And you pull the little trigger here.

843
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:25,365
And a bullet comes out here.

844
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:29,301
And the bullet hits you right there.

845
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:31,797
And you know what?

846
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,934
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

847
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:42,426
Don't taunt me, tramp.

848
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:46,027
I am not one to be taunted.

849
01:08:46,171 --> 01:08:47,313
You got it?

850
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,267
Let me hear you say, " I got it. "

851
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,503
I got it.

852
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,548
You're damn more better.

853
01:09:17,246 --> 01:09:18,043
Salt.

854
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:19,800
Get it. I figured out it's salt.

855
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:21,153
Blood is salty.

856
01:09:21,393 --> 01:09:24,600
That's all my sauce needed
which is a little more salt.

857
01:09:24,647 --> 01:09:27,106
Just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talking about.

858
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:28,294
What are you doing JT?

859
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:30,469
That's all I got to do to put a
little more salt in.

860
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,810
To do the same goddamn thing that blood did.

861
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,378
I'm telling you, my brothers,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

862
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,176
Don't do nothing stupid, JT.
I got it covered.

863
01:09:37,272 --> 01:09:41,547
It's already got my sweat. It's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood.

864
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:44,787
Drop the gun.

865
01:09:44,816 --> 01:09:45,546
JT?

866
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,282
Do it now.

867
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,713
Don't shoot.

868
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:51,690
JT you all right?

869
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:02,330
He's all right, bro.

870
01:10:02,435 --> 01:10:04,795
God damn but I'm
not all right at all, brother.

871
01:10:04,856 --> 01:10:05,711
Not at all.

872
01:10:05,874 --> 01:10:06,959
Wait here.

873
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:09,808
I sure will.

874
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:13,664
Goddam sauce.

875
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:23,373
... in cages.

876
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,262
See them in action.

877
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,950
See them in love.

878
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,503
See them in terror.

879
01:10:32,196 --> 01:10:34,408
White skin on the black market.

880
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:37,712
Soft flash for hard cash.

881
01:10:38,237 --> 01:10:39,879
Women in cages.

882
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:41,971
I'm gonna get my dick wet.

883
01:10:42,374 --> 01:10:44,485
She's got one leg.

884
01:10:44,534 --> 01:10:46,031
Easier access.

885
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:49,680
Good point.

886
01:10:57,049 --> 01:11:00,957
Get the rest of the shit upstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

887
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,898
Get Lewis down here.

888
01:11:18,116 --> 01:11:19,508
He's getting his dick wet, Sir.

889
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:22,201
Get him the fuck down here now.

890
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,194
Lewis.

891
01:11:34,227 --> 01:11:35,121
Listen.

892
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,052
Where are my men?

893
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:54,030
I've got several right here.

894
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:58,050
What the fuck is this?

895
01:11:58,366 --> 01:12:00,181
Their balls, sweetheart.

896
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:05,574


897
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:07,341
Let us go.

898
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,387
Tell me why we should.

899
01:12:08,388 --> 01:12:09,990
Because I earned it.

900
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:11,200
How you figure that?

901
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:12,506
You want the story?

902
01:12:12,573 --> 01:12:14,455
I spin it for you quick.

903
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:17,650
Turmoil in some nasty caves
on the Afghan border.

904
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:20,808
Me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands.

905
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:22,488
And our balls in or throats.

906
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:24,331
Looking for America's most wanted.

907
01:12:24,431 --> 01:12:25,884
Bin Laden
- Yeah.

908
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:28,096
For once I ran towards
right on the money.

909
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:29,323
I come around a corner.

910
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:31,560
Bam. There he is looking
me right in the eyes.

911
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:32,376
Wait.

912
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:34,517
You killed Bin Laden?

913
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,869
I put two in his heart.

914
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:38,741
One in his computer.

915
01:12:38,866 --> 01:12:40,181
So that was you.

916
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:41,314
Yeah.

917
01:12:42,427 --> 01:12:43,540
That was me.

918
01:12:48,128 --> 01:12:50,009
He wasn't supposed to be there.

919
01:12:50,019 --> 01:12:51,324
We weren't supposed to be there.

920
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:55,324
And I sure as fuck wasn't supposed
to be the one who punches #% ticket.

921
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:59,001
So instead of a chest full of medals
we got a face full of DC2.

922
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:00,681
No cure.

923
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:03,961
There is none till we find
somebody from the other side

924
01:13:03,984 --> 01:13:06,008
... willing to sell us batches of this shit.

925
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:09,082
Science comes first.
But business comes a close fucking second.

926
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:13,123
Then you realized if you could infect
a large enough populace

927
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:15,519
... and experiment on its survivals

928
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:17,391
You'd find a cure.

929
01:13:17,718 --> 01:13:22,171
I swore to my men that I'd do everything
in my power to keep them alive.

930
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:24,495
That's what I intend to do, Wray.

931
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:28,152
Understand...

932
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,186
I never had a choice.

933
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:36,384
Neither do I, sir.

934
01:13:38,697 --> 01:13:41,221
God bless you and
your service to this country.

935
01:13:47,778 --> 01:13:49,170
Are you a doctor?

936
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:53,450
I was earlier tonight.

937
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:57,602
I always wanted to be a doctor.

938
01:13:58,293 --> 01:14:02,421
Instead, I can do this.

939
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,770
Useless talent No. 66.

940
01:14:10,555 --> 01:14:11,832
I'm very pliable.

941
01:14:11,851 --> 01:14:14,127
A girlfriend of mine had a theory.

942
01:14:14,227 --> 01:14:16,546
She said at some point in your life

943
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,720
You find a use for every useless
talent you've ever had.

944
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,326
It's like connecting the dots.

945
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:25,175
I'm not that optimistic.

946
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:29,362
I feel like I'm sinking
down the drain and I can't get out.

947
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:30,407
She'd say

948
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:33,700
When you're stuck in that spiral

949
01:14:34,621 --> 01:14:35,773
You reach up.

950
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:39,220
What if there's nothing up there.

951
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,879
Just reach up.

952
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:45,345
You're a dancer.

953
01:14:45,825 --> 01:14:47,543
I was earlier tonight.

954
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:50,826
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement.

955
01:14:57,535 --> 01:15:00,742
I'm starved for entertainment, baby.
And that means you.

956
01:15:01,175 --> 01:15:02,604
Radio.

957
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:06,060
Well, baby. Now.

958
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:16,999
That's what I'm talking about.

959
01:15:17,623 --> 01:15:19,140


960
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:22,020
Keep dancing.

961
01:15:24,727 --> 01:15:28,441
I have seen me some
crazy ass shit in my day.

962
01:15:29,596 --> 01:15:32,571
But I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

963
01:15:33,015 --> 01:15:35,545
I've seen me a stripper with one breast.

964
01:15:35,813 --> 01:15:38,472
And I've seen me a
stripper with twelve toes.

965
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:41,142
And I've seen me a
stripper with no brains at all.

966
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:44,118
But I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

967
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,307
And I'll bet them rock.

968
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,071
Dance bitch!

969
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:52,471
Break a leg.

970
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,998
Break it off.

971
01:16:05,605 --> 01:16:07,544
Dance for me, motherfucker.

972
01:16:21,688 --> 01:16:23,595
You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?

973
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:24,758
Actually

974
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:25,766
Yes.

975
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:28,342
You gave me some wood?

976
01:16:28,454 --> 01:16:31,271
Now I'm gonna give you some...

977
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,918
... fucking wood!

978
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:48,474
Your Gas! You need your gas!

979
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:50,612
Fucking gas. Fuck it!

980
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,763
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

981
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,164
Where did you get that?

982
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:11,207
Useless talent No. 37.

983
01:17:38,057 --> 01:17:41,100
I broke my leg.
- Okay.

984
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,394
I made you something.

985
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:46,988
I do believe in you.

986
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:49,310
I always have.

987
01:17:49,743 --> 01:17:52,210
I believe that you can be better.

988
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:53,899
You deserve better.

989
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,040
Even better than me.

990
01:17:57,163 --> 01:17:58,232
Right now..

991
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:00,332
I need you to become..

992
01:18:02,022 --> 01:18:03,846
Who you were meant to be.

993
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,284
Stand.

994
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,330


995
01:18:20,101 --> 01:18:22,098
Open that door, will you baby?

996
01:18:50,366 --> 01:18:52,545
We've destroyed most of the tanks.

997
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:55,963
Any that are left we'll get
on our way to the helicopters.

998
01:18:55,992 --> 01:18:58,024
There are two helicopters.

999
01:18:58,331 --> 01:19:00,356
Big enough to take all of us.

1000
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:02,804
Who can fly?

1001
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:08,267
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

1002
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:11,560
I can fly, but...
No way in hell I'm gonna fly on that.

1003
01:19:12,203 --> 01:19:15,150
Okay. Cool. I'll fly.

1004
01:19:23,808 --> 01:19:26,093
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

1005
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:29,404
Take care of this for me then, Sheriff.

1006
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:31,046
With pleasure.

1007
01:19:31,507 --> 01:19:32,639
Two minutes.

1008
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:35,461
Brother's a good man, JT.

1009
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:37,304
Best in Texas.

1010
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:41,720
Hop on.

1011
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:46,564
No. The other way.

1012
01:19:50,559 --> 01:19:51,682
No.

1013
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:53,782
The other way.

1014
01:20:40,397 --> 01:20:43,421
The helicopters are on the
other side of this wall.

1015
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:50,793
We make a run for it.

1016
01:20:50,902 --> 01:20:54,021
No. If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

1017
01:20:54,137 --> 01:20:55,548
Don't you get it?

1018
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:57,497
We're the antidote.

1019
01:20:58,246 --> 01:21:00,205
Was there another way around?

1020
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,304
Wait here.

1021
01:21:27,665 --> 01:21:31,237
I suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around?

1022
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:33,378
I think there is no.

1023
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:36,979
We have to get over that wall.

1024
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,621
I was thinking we could build us a new place.

1025
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:46,194
Right there where the old one was.

1026
01:21:46,665 --> 01:21:47,682
You cook.

1027
01:21:48,412 --> 01:21:49,727
I work the back.

1028
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:54,009
You don't make that rent so goddamn high.

1029
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,872
Share the recipe.

1030
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,176
We'll share the rent.

1031
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:05,357
Start at 250 degrees.

1032
01:22:08,812 --> 01:22:09,964
I knew it.

1033
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:13,737
For how long?
- For about ...

1034
01:22:14,044 --> 01:22:15,210
Twelve pounds.

1035
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:16,508
Twelve hours.

1036
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:18,434
Wrapped in tinfoil, right?

1037
01:22:18,537 --> 01:22:20,582
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1038
01:22:20,938 --> 01:22:21,936
Damn.

1039
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:24,838
Tomatoes?
Fresh?

1040
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:26,083
Canned.

1041
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:28,281
No shit?
- Yeah.

1042
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,969
Score me some?
- Oh, yeah.

1043
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,273
Cause we're brothers.

1044
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:36,528
Thank you for this.

1045
01:22:37,248 --> 01:22:38,620
You just remember.

1046
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:41,279
You gotta take this recipe to your grave.

1047
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:46,185
I think I can goddamn guarantee that.

1048
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:12,735
That's our cue.

1049
01:23:15,067 --> 01:23:16,344
Cherry, darling.

1050
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:19,445
Follow you.

1051
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,150
Let's go.

1052
01:25:00,616 --> 01:25:01,443
Wray!

1053
01:25:04,486 --> 01:25:06,100


1054
01:25:08,747 --> 01:25:09,559
Okay.

1055
01:25:09,892 --> 01:25:12,263
Can you do that? Cause we're leaving.

1056
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,750
They told me I'd find you here.

1057
01:25:42,425 --> 01:25:44,460
I was beginning to lose hope.

1058
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,649
I'm sorry.

1059
01:25:48,233 --> 01:25:49,385
But I lied.

1060
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,126
I did want to hurt you.

1061
01:25:57,448 --> 01:25:59,349
My turn.

1062
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:12,835
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.

1063
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:17,042
Never liked that son of a bitch.

1064
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:22,916
Was as useless as a pecker on a pope.

1065
01:26:29,636 --> 01:26:31,210
Don't touch anything.

1066
01:26:32,151 --> 01:26:34,177
He said not to touch anything.

1067
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:37,333
Shut up.

1068
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:40,096
Sit down and don't fucking touch anything.

1069
01:26:46,686 --> 01:26:48,203
Everybody sit down.

1070
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:05,673


1071
01:27:11,404 --> 01:27:12,594
Go. Leave me.

1072
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:15,061
I am not leaving you here like this.

1073
01:27:15,837 --> 01:27:18,425
Motherfuckers around here eat road kill.

1074
01:27:20,052 --> 01:27:21,022
You see?

1075
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:22,606
I'm funny.

1076
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:25,028
I made you laugh.

1077
01:27:25,134 --> 01:27:26,459
Go to the ocean.

1078
01:27:26,526 --> 01:27:29,464
Put your backs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1079
01:27:30,482 --> 01:27:32,325
I'm not leaving you Wray.

1080
01:27:33,746 --> 01:27:35,387
Two against the world.

1081
01:27:37,509 --> 01:27:38,728
There will be.

1082
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:41,358
I promise.

1083
01:27:42,606 --> 01:27:43,826
I never miss.

1084
01:27:45,726 --> 01:27:47,127
Don't worry, baby.

1085
01:27:48,356 --> 01:27:49,998
You'll find your way.

1086
01:29:09,379 --> 01:29:11,808
It's like you said it would be, Wray.

1087
01:29:13,805 --> 01:29:15,821
I'm like you said I would be.

1088
01:29:16,493 --> 01:29:17,808
I find the lost.

1089
01:29:19,008 --> 01:29:20,054
The weary.

1090
01:29:21,754 --> 01:29:23,472
Those who have no hope.

1091
01:29:23,741 --> 01:29:24,854
I find them.

1092
01:29:25,421 --> 01:29:26,678
And I lead them.

1093
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:30,010
To a land we've made for ourselves.

1094
01:29:31,594 --> 01:29:33,120
The land by the sea.

1095
01:30:08,056 --> 01:30:09,365
It's beautiful.

1096
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,956
She's beautiful.

1097
01:30:15,049 --> 01:30:16,786
I wish you could see us.

1098
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,351
Us two.

1099
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,769
It's like you said it would be.

1100
01:30:22,911 --> 01:30:25,609
Two against the world baby.

1101
01:30:25,699 --> 01:30:28,623
Two against the world.

1102
01:30:48,346 --> 01:30:51,256


1103
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:55,069
This film is a brilliant achievement in motion picture history.

1104
01:30:55,111 --> 01:31:01,171
Finally, the truth about Hitler's diabolical plans
to create a race of superwomen can be told.

1105
01:31:02,853 --> 01:31:05,560
Werewolf Women of the S.S.

1106
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,304
Welcome to Death Camp 13.

1107
01:31:08,351 --> 01:31:10,957
Home of the Nazis' diabolical plan.

1108
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:14,089
To create an army of super werewolf soldiers.

1109
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,206
This is projected.

1110
01:31:15,215 --> 01:31:17,745
Its failure will be your demise.

1111
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,598
... and the end of Germany, Borman.

1112
01:31:21,368 --> 01:31:23,748
You have been chosen.

1113
01:31:24,401 --> 01:31:25,764
Rejoice.

1114
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:29,338
They have found the perfect solution.

1115
01:31:29,366 --> 01:31:34,578
The She-Devils of Belzac.

1116
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:40,812
Can they alone supply the blood
needed to save Hitler's mad dreams?

1117
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:44,728
Or with the pride of Germany fall into ruin?

1118
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:46,193
This is my project.

1119
01:31:46,278 --> 01:31:51,443
We are now in total control of Pure Wolf.

1120
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:55,714


1121
01:32:00,277 --> 01:32:00,935


1122
01:32:01,019 --> 01:32:03,104
Featuring Udo Kier

1123
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,850
Sheri Moon Zombie

1124
01:32:04,954 --> 01:32:06,428
Tom Towles

1125
01:32:09,369 --> 01:32:10,444


1126
01:32:12,943 --> 01:32:17,141


1127
01:32:17,505 --> 01:32:19,713
This is my Mecca!

1128
01:32:36,062 --> 01:32:39,301


1129
01:32:59,462 --> 01:33:02,457


1130
01:33:04,338 --> 01:33:06,025
If you..

1131
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:08,213
are thinking

1132
01:33:08,251 --> 01:33:10,157
of going

1133
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:12,143
into

1134
01:33:12,284 --> 01:33:14,285
this house

1135
01:33:15,655 --> 01:33:16,932


1136
01:33:17,429 --> 01:33:19,354
If you ...

1137
01:33:19,429 --> 01:33:21,166
... are thinking

1138
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:23,133
... of opening

1139
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:26,184
... this door.

1140
01:33:27,753 --> 01:33:29,161


1141
01:33:29,246 --> 01:33:30,814
If you...

1142
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:32,814
... are thinking

1143
01:33:32,871 --> 01:33:34,965
... of checking out

1144
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,331
... the basement.

1145
01:33:41,341 --> 01:33:42,439


1146
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,749
Don't look behind.

1147
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:46,806
Don't look in there.

1148
01:33:47,097 --> 01:33:49,369
Don't look up.

1149
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:52,186
Don't look anywhere.

1150
01:33:53,445 --> 01:33:55,758
Don't scream for help.

1151
01:33:59,172 --> 01:34:02,327
Don't even breathe.

1152
01:34:02,623 --> 01:34:03,621

Timing & Text by Bodza

1154
01:34:15,794 --> 01:34:19,161
If you are thinking of seeing this film alone.

1155
01:34:49,094 --> 01:34:51,186
In the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts

1156
01:34:51,387 --> 01:34:56,717
The 4th Thursday in November
is the most celebrated day in the year.

1157
01:34:57,949 --> 01:34:59,897
The table is set.

1158
01:35:00,012 --> 01:35:03,279
The festivities have begun.

1159
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,141
For the uninvited guests to arrive.
