1
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:25,492
Tension that had been brewing for
months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...

2
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:29,697
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu
orchestrated a swift and violent coup...

3
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:34,056
...against the democratically elected
government of President Samuel Azuka.

4
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:38,257
In the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups...

5
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:41,091
... there'd been a long history
of ethnic enmity...

6
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:45,570
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.

7
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,812
The victorious Fulani rebels
have tak en to the streets...

8
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,448
...as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country.

9
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:57,450
Thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter.

10
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,248
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo
have abandoned their homes...

11
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:05,571
...and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it.

12
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,811
Gen. Yakubu has tak en control
of most of the country...

13
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,697
...and appears firmly in charge.

14
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:13,612
There's no word on the United Nations'
reaction to the coup...

15
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,613
...but United States forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy.

16
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,015
As you can see behind me,
on the USS Harry S. Truman...

17
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:43,458
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.

18
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,132
This once peaceful country...

19
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,690
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...

20
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,971
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.

21
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,415
However, nothing can prepare
the country...

22
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:59,851
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.

23
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,015
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...

24
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,329
...has been assassinated.
l repeat:

25
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,969
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.

26
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,412
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.

27
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,019
Let me take those for you.

28
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,172
He got one in the leg!

29
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,136
Put him in the sickbay now!

30
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,579
Well, look at you.

31
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,458
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

32
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,459
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.

33
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,371
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.

34
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,771
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,814
See you in chow to debrief.
You...

36
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,489
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.

37
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,574
Attention on deck.

38
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,208
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.

39
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,534
Everybody get chow?

40
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,770
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

41
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,933
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...

42
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,129
...scattered throughout this sector.

43
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,457
They've captured
government armories...

44
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,573
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.

45
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,457
ln addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.

46
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,131
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...

47
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,772
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
lnternational Relief Services.

48
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:55,376
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.

49
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,539
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.

50
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,020
Your secondary objective...

51
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:03,491
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...

52
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,578
...if they so choose to leave.

53
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,971
St. Michael's Mission, right here.

54
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:09,899
You will halo over Cameroon...

55
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,371
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.

56
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,690
When you get your package...

57
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:18,854
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.

58
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:22,855
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.

59
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,853
-Questions?
-Sir...

60
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,090
...rules of engagement?

61
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:31,379
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.

62
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,413
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?

63
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,931
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.

64
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,652
Anything else, gentlemen?

65
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,330
All right.

66
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,410
Dismissed.

67
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,899
Gentlemen, three minutes out.

68
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,416
lt's okay. lt's okay.

69
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,972
You speak English?
You speak English?

70
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:38,532
Good. Good.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

71
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:42,542
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?

72
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,933
You sure? You sure?

73
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:48,095
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?

74
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,094
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.

75
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,219
Nice and easy. Come on.

76
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:54,215
Zee, we're moving.

77
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,102
lt's all right. l'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

78
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:11,971
Open.

79
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:20,772
Clear.

80
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,378
Lasana, where's that wa--?

81
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,535
These American men are here
to see you!

82
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:52,618
l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
l'm here to get you and your people out.

83
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:55,015
We're in the middle of surgery here.

84
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,334
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.

85
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,256
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?

86
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,783
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.

87
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,856
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.

88
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,662
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.

89
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:09,419
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.

90
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,177
You're frightening my staff.

91
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,816
l'll be with you when l'm done.
Now please wait outside!

92
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,816
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.

93
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:21,215
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?

94
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,215
Doc, maybe you can help her out.

95
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,380
Ma'am, may l assist?

96
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,095
-Are you a doctor?
-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.

97
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,256
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.

98
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,415
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.

99
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:41,773
Then close for me.

100
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,415
We're taking our good old time here.

101
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,783
All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.

102
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:56,940
Hurry up, Doc.

103
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:04,144
l assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?

104
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,136
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.

105
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,502
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.

106
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,815
Get your things together,
but pack light.

107
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:16,620
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.

108
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,424
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.

109
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,224
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.

110
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:26,139
l'm responsible for 7 0 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.

111
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:29,024
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.

112
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:30,698
What does that mean?

113
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,095
l mean nonindigenous personnel,
ma'am.

114
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,459
Then we have a problem.

115
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:39,016
l will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.

116
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:43,064
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...

117
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,978
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.

118
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,377
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...

119
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,456
...including privileged white doctors.

120
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,662
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!

121
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,862
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.

122
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,856
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:

123
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:05,496
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.

124
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,815
We can take those who can walk.

125
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:10,704
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.

126
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,336
You're right, lieutenant...

127
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,737
...it's not your problem.
lt is my responsibility...

128
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,579
...and l will not leave
without my people.

129
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:33,980
All right, give me a minute.

130
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,619
-A minute?
-That's right.

131
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:41,418
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.

132
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,101
Get Command on the horn.

133
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,581
Eagle One to Command.

134
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:52,465
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.

135
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,423
Eagle One to Command.

136
00:11:58,626 --> 00:11:59,979
Eagle One.

137
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,538
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.

138
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:03,741
No, we got her.

139
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,503
But she wants to bring the 7 0 people
here along with her.

140
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:10,459
Yes, sir, l understand.

141
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,139
l will handle it.

142
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,740
Eagle One, out.

143
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:24,778
Dr. Kendricks.

144
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:34,456
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.

145
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:36,697
There will be helicopters for them too?

146
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,145
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.

147
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:42,699
l understand.

148
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:44,542
Thank you, lieutenant.

149
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,379
Hurry, please.

150
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,265
Why don't we just get Doc
to tranq her the fuck out?

151
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:00,863
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.

152
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,978
l ain't sure this bitch is American.

153
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:06,865
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.

154
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:11,264
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.

155
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,341
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.

156
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:18,896
We must leave quickly.
Quickly!

157
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,058
God will bless you, Lena.

158
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:31,537
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?

159
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:40,816
Okay, let's clear these hooches.

160
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,106
Come here, you guys.

161
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,939
lt's okay. lt's okay. Come on.

162
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:02,028
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.

163
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:06,181
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.

164
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,505
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.

165
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,180
Bless you, Lena.

166
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:17,948
Thank you for everything.

167
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,947
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.

168
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,667
Take care of yourself.

169
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,863
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.

170
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:34,144
All right. Let's go.

171
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,419
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.

172
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,181
Roger that.

173
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,538
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.

174
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:45,778
Come on.

175
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:50,263
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.

176
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:53,267
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.

177
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,657
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!

178
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,468
Sister Grace.

179
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,143
-The mother?
-She is dead.

180
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,942
Oh, no.

181
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:02,941
Oh, no.

182
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:05,299
What am l going to do
with this child?

183
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,618
Lena.

184
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,862
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
lt's the only chance she has.

185
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,945
We gotta move quicker than this.

186
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,022
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.

187
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,146
Take care of yourself, girl.

188
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:29,941
Sister Siobhan.

189
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,308
Mind yourself.

190
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,742
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.

191
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,423
l'm not going.

192
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,939
Sister!

193
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,305
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-l'm not going.

194
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,619
What?

195
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,503
Good luck.

196
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,139
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.

197
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,788
All right, let's make it quick.

198
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,668
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

199
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,303
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.

200
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,543
Take care.

201
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,143
Go with God.

202
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,667
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.

203
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,421
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.

204
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,429
l got her.

205
00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:01,149
We're only five klicks in. lt's seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.

206
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:04,468
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.

207
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:07,429
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.

208
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,221
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.

209
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,461
Let's go.

210
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:16,782
Come on. You've gotta speed up.

211
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:20,069
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--

212
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,349
Watch those trees.

213
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,910
l'm gonna help you.

214
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,266
lt's all right. l'll tell them.

215
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,146
We got you.

216
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,581
Lieutenant.

217
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:26,064
We need to stop.

218
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,586
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.

219
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:34,149
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.

220
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,544
These people need to rest.

221
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,908
And we have a child
who needs medication.

222
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,627
Here we go.

223
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:45,153
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.

224
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,345
Let's go, doctor.

225
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:55,101
Come on, sir. Here we go.

226
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:00,304
What you want to do?

227
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:04,070
Rest for 30.

228
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,666
Lake, hold it up.

229
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,871
We're gonna rest for 30.

230
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,591
Set a perimeter.

231
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,622
Perimeter up.

232
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,631
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.

233
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:43,424
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...

234
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:45,307
... on our path.

235
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,945
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.

236
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:53,866
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to-- Listen to me!

237
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:57,231
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby quiet, you understand me?

238
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:59,669
Whatever it takes. Go now.

239
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,187
Get up. Get up.

240
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:13,508
Danger close.

241
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:28,593
Go.

242
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:52,270
Clear.

243
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:03,834
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.

244
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:41,513
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!

245
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:44,957
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.

246
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,946
And find us a safe place to rest.

247
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,635
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.

248
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:55,346
l can't do that. lt'd risk the safety
of all these people here.

249
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:59,347
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.

250
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:03,355
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.

251
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:06,078
l don't presume
to know them all. Red?

252
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:08,071
Dr. Kendricks.

253
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:09,910
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

254
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:11,387
Come on.

255
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,912
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?

256
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:11,034
lt's my watch, ma'am.

257
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:13,909
You can call me Lena.

258
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,987
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest
you get some rest.

259
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,717
You know....

260
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,837
Thank you for saving my life.

261
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,435
lt wasn't about saving your life.

262
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,549
lt's about getting the job done.

263
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,917
Completing the mission, that's all.

264
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,518
My dear...

265
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:08,714
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.

266
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:13,908
-But l'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.

267
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,558
Gentlemen.

268
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,467
Please.

269
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,996
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.

270
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,229
There are only sick people here.

271
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,113
Please, sir.

272
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,274
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!

273
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,151
No! Please! Please!

274
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,350
-No!
-No!

275
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,592
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.

276
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,993
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.

277
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,071
We have only sick people here.

278
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,468
Please.

279
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,429
No, commander.

280
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,239
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

281
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,197
Holy Mary, mother of God...

282
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,989
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.

283
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,275
Commander, no!

284
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,237
-Blessed....
-No!

285
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Holy Mary, mother of God....

286
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,397
What the fuck was that?

287
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,509
Hyena.

288
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
Flea, Lake, status?

289
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,399
Clear.

290
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,229
Clear, L.T.

291
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,559
Zee?

292
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,478
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.

293
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,079
This is Star One. My ETA,
your location, five minutes.

294
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,798
Popping smoke.

295
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:14,159
Do you have smoke?

296
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,195
Roger. Yellow smok e.

297
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,955
That's us.

298
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:32,190
Eyes on.

299
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:04,790
Slo, bring her up.

300
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,953
-Let's go! Come on! Now!
-Let's go, ma'am. Come on.

301
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,874
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!

302
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:12,594
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

303
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:17,750
Come on!

304
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,910
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!

305
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:30,471
lt's a gunship!
lt's here to protect us!

306
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,152
-What about the others?
-They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!

307
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,721
You gotta move faster!

308
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:37,713
-What are you doing?!
-Keep your head down!

309
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:38,871
Stand back.

310
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,634
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!

311
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,717
Keep your head down!

312
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:45,960
-Let us go!
-Dr. Lena!

313
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,392
-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!

314
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:52,390
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?

315
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:56,714
l simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!

316
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:59,316
-What about my people?!
-l'm not here for them.

317
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:00,551
You lied to me!

318
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:02,441
You lied to me!

319
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:05,395
Liar! Bastard!

320
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,791
Lena! Let me go!

321
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:11,601
What about my people?!
l won't leave them!

322
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:13,516
You lied to me!

323
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:16,513
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.

324
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:19,282
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!

325
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,354
Who decides for me?! You?!

326
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,594
Your government?!

327
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,720
Bastard! l won't leave them!

328
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,191
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!

329
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:40,236
Let's go! Go! Let's go!

330
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:43,480
Lena! Lena!

331
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:44,632
Listen to me!

332
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,911
Listen to me! lt's okay.

333
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:59,196
Let's go!

334
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:23,073
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.

335
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:25,402
We saw this on the way in.

336
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:38,392
No!

337
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,196
No!

338
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,036
No!

339
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,080
-Doc!
-No!

340
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:58,233
Come on.

341
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:05,915
Let's turn it around.

342
00:37:58,686 --> 00:37:59,880
Musa.

343
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:01,761
Patience!

344
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:10,603
Lena!

345
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,917
We can only take 1 2 people.

346
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,156
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.

347
00:38:28,726 --> 00:38:30,876
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.

348
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:36,436
Go. And tell the others.

349
00:38:38,646 --> 00:38:41,444
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.

350
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:52,959
Thank you.

351
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,120
Hurry, please.

352
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,282
Red!

353
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,960
Go with the package.

354
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:22,676
Now, goddamn it!

355
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:32,318
What are you doing?

356
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,725
New mission?

357
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:39,681
No.

358
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,076
Same mission.

359
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,159
Get them ready, Zee.

360
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:57,362
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.

361
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,119
Let's go! Get her ready.

362
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:01,926
We gotta go. We gotta go.

363
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:04,237
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!

364
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:07,965
Get her out of there!
Get off!

365
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:10,482
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!

366
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:11,636
Keep your head down.

367
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,199
She has no one to care for her.

368
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,838
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!

369
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,203
Hold her tight!

370
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:28,280
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.

371
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,080
See you in Cameroon.

372
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,886
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:33,721
Here we go. Stay low.

374
00:40:34,648 --> 00:40:36,001
Head down.

375
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,077
Let's go.

376
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:40,840
Sergeant! Let's go!

377
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,639
Eagle One, over.

378
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,286
Can you wait one, sir?

379
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:27,122
A.K.

380
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:28,597
Command.

381
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:29,917
Yes, sir?

382
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:34,321
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?

383
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:36,320
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.

384
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,402
You can't get a woman on a helo?

385
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:39,684
She was on the bird.

386
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:42,843
-It's difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.

387
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:46,524
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Request helicopters to take them out.

388
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:48,327
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.

389
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:51,606
Come on, give me three choppers. l'll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.

390
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:52,918
Negative!

391
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,683
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.

392
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,727
We'll give you what help we can
from our end, but right now...

393
00:41:58,889 --> 00:42:00,117
...you are on your own.

394
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:04,761
Man, l hope you know
what you're doing.

395
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:06,924
Me too, sir.

396
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:09,962
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.

397
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:14,080
Negative on the evac.

398
00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:19,324
Come on. There you go. Come on.

399
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:22,246
Hang on to the knot, doctor.

400
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:23,764
-Come on.
-We got you.

401
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:25,726
Come on. Come on, doc.

402
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,363
Americans.

403
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,166
Some went in the helicopter.

404
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,200
Some went up the mountain...

405
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,124
...to Cameroon.

406
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:14,606
Slo.

407
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:23,524
Give me your chow, man.

408
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,567
l don't like roast beef anyway.

409
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:43,009
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.

410
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:44,286
Roger that.

411
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,320
What do you got?

412
00:44:56,131 --> 00:45:00,443
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.

413
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:01,920
How strong?

414
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:04,924
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.

415
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:06,600
Rebels?

416
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,845
Could be.

417
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:11,681
Why would anybody be following us?

418
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:13,885
l don't know.

419
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:17,603
But we're gonna find out.

420
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:19,806
Good job.

421
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,121
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.

422
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:25,323
-Sir?
-We got a problem.

423
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:27,880
We got possible hostiles on our 6.

424
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,803
Get them up, get them ready to move.

425
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:31,371
Roger that.

426
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,130
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?

427
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,647
Thank you. lt'll just take a second.

428
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:47,442
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.

429
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:48,846
You sure?

430
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,560
Yes, l'm sure.

431
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:03,848
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.

432
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:06,885
Get your people ready to go now.

433
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:09,925
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.

434
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:11,851
Come on.

435
00:46:13,612 --> 00:46:16,172
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.

436
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:21,565
How you doing?

437
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:24,804
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?

438
00:47:24,973 --> 00:47:26,725
You know what l'm talking about.

439
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:38,571
You know as well as l do...

440
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:41,566
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.

441
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,408
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...

442
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:48,804
...and we hump for a day.

443
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:51,243
Zee, keep them moving.

444
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,484
Be with you in a second.

445
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:58,326
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.

446
00:47:59,013 --> 00:48:00,492
l'm confused.

447
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:02,371
And the boys are confused.

448
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:03,972
Get to the point.

449
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:07,172
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?

450
00:48:08,654 --> 00:48:10,007
Talk to me.

451
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:13,812
l'm with you either way.
You know that.

452
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:18,569
When l figure it out, l'll let you know.

453
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:32,806
This way.

454
00:49:16,694 --> 00:49:18,685
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.

455
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,732
You're gonna want to come
tak e a look at this.

456
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:30,173
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.

457
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:34,690
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!

458
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:35,844
Slo.

459
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:37,929
Stay down. Stay down.

460
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:40,245
Zee, Flea, with me.

461
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:46,447
What do you got?

462
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:49,607
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.

463
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:03,523
How strong?

464
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:05,487
l counted seven so far, sir.

465
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,612
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.

466
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:15,215
There could be more in the hooches.

467
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:17,334
Bring them up.

468
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:29,254
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.

469
00:50:40,855 --> 00:50:42,288
L.T.

470
00:50:43,095 --> 00:50:45,086
Rules of engagement.

471
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:47,167
We're already engaged.

472
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,212
Hand me the binoculars.

473
00:50:58,296 --> 00:50:59,524
Flea, you got the Zippo?

474
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:01,805
Roger that.

475
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:04,014
Zippo first.

476
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:08,688
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.

477
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:11,769
Silent and quick.
Gold Team, on me.

478
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:17,530
Silk, close up that back door.

479
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:20,928
-Flea, keep your eye on the package.
-Roger that.

480
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:22,529
Holding.

481
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:24,011
Let's go.

482
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:33,125
On-site.

483
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,928
Goddamn.

484
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:32,970
Been going at it all day.

485
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,489
-On-site.
-Roger that.

486
00:53:24,658 --> 00:53:25,647
Go!

487
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,335
lt's okay. l'm here to help you.

488
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,617
l'll help you. lt's okay.

489
00:54:58,619 --> 00:54:59,768
Atkins!

490
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:07,368
Hide!

491
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,138
Go! Run! Get out of here!

492
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,938
-Doc, get them out of here!
-Move!

493
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,809
Go! Go!

494
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,735
Hold on. You hold on.

495
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,458
Come on, little man, come on.

496
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:28,219
Boss, you want me to take a look
at that?

497
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:31,619
l'm all right.

498
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:10,291
lt's a kid. lt's only a fucking kid.

499
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:25,853
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.

500
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,258
Look at your work, motherfucker.

501
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,255
Lake.

502
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:21,662
Doc, get over here.

503
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,021
Red.

504
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:53,933
Her baby's dead.

505
01:00:06,743 --> 01:00:08,335
Zee.

506
01:00:27,303 --> 01:00:30,818
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

507
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:34,180
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

508
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:37,983
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

509
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:39,496
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

510
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:42,581
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

511
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,015
She has a low pulse.

512
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:05,733
How can they do this?

513
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:08,894
This is what they do.

514
01:01:10,263 --> 01:01:13,221
They cut off the breasts
of nursing mothers...

515
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:16,978
...so that they'll never again
feed their own babies.

516
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:21,694
This is what they do.

517
01:01:27,424 --> 01:01:28,652
Doc.

518
01:01:30,264 --> 01:01:32,016
l need morphine.

519
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:52,659
Dr. Kendricks.

520
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,218
Dr. Kendricks.

521
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:02,935
lt's all right.

522
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:09,416
-ls something wrong?
-Let me take care of your arm.

523
01:05:12,026 --> 01:05:13,175
All right.

524
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:29,462
Careful.

525
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:35,180
Try this.

526
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:37,457
lt will help you stay awake.

527
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:40,939
What is it?

528
01:05:41,107 --> 01:05:42,620
Cola nut from the tree.

529
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,426
lt's harmless.

530
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:50,464
We've been using them
for generations.

531
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,497
Patience, right?

532
01:05:56,027 --> 01:05:57,619
How long you been at the mission?

533
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,100
l live there.

534
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:02,940
l've been living there since l was 1 0.

535
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,256
How come?

536
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:09,940
l heard they were helping children
who had been forced into the war...

537
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:12,100
...so l ran to them.

538
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:20,336
Will you get me to my daughter?

539
01:06:27,627 --> 01:06:28,980
Yes, ma'am.

540
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:41,066
How'd you end up here in Africa?

541
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:43,663
l came here with my husband.

542
01:06:45,308 --> 01:06:47,344
We wanted to help.

543
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:52,547
We went to Sierra Leone.
They were short of doctors there.

544
01:06:53,148 --> 01:06:54,297
Cut.

545
01:07:02,308 --> 01:07:04,583
How did your husband die?

546
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:14,148
We were at the hospital.

547
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:17,385
The rebels came.

548
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:22,705
My husband tried to stop them,
to protect me...

549
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:25,780
...but he couldn't.

550
01:07:28,028 --> 01:07:29,507
l'm sorry.

551
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:40,344
You did a good thing today.

552
01:07:48,588 --> 01:07:51,022
l don't know if it was a good thing
or not.

553
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:59,063
Feels like so long since l've done...

554
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:02,704
...a good thing, the right thing.

555
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,859
You should have some rest.

556
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:12,862
Thank you for taking care of my arm.

557
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:51,708
Easy, boss.

558
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:06,380
-Are we there yet?
-Glad to see you still got it...

559
01:09:06,749 --> 01:09:08,182
...but we got trouble.

560
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,744
You all right?

561
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,459
What do you got?

562
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:21,309
This is the outfit
that's been on our tail.

563
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,543
-Hey. You with me, boss?
-Yeah.

564
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,264
-This is at 2200 hours.
-Yeah.

565
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,582
Four hours ago.

566
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,229
Three hours.

567
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,860
We figured they'd make camp
and come at us after first light, right?

568
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,383
Bad call.

569
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,302
Two hours ago.

570
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,499
One.

571
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:45,306
These guys run the damned Olympics.
They've been closing in on us all night.

572
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,702
How long we got?

573
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,900
An hour, two tops.

574
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,743
We shouldn't have stopped.

575
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,939
How the fuck are they tracking us
at night?

576
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,428
Someone's transmitting something.

577
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,343
Zee.

578
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,379
We got a rat in the nest.
Get them up.

579
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,542
Take their weapons away.
We search everybody right now.

580
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,509
-Okay, team.
-Dr. Kendricks.

581
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,262
-Turn two.
-Lena. Get up.

582
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,658
Everybody, up.

583
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:28,027
Point out everybody that came into
the mission in the last three days.

584
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,623
-Right now.
-Let's see the weapons.

585
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,782
Give me your weapons.

586
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:40,909
-Gideon.
-Let's go. Step forward, sir.

587
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,470
Who else?

588
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:46,150
Who else?!

589
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:47,546
These people.

590
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:50,743
-Step forward, you two, right now.
-On your knees.

591
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:52,390
L.T.!

592
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,505
Down! Now!

593
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:58,340
Silk.

594
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,303
No!

595
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:07,303
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-He's my friend!

596
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,302
You know what?
He could also be armed.

597
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:11,985
Get back there with the others!
Go on!

598
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,505
-Watch his hands.
-Fuck.

599
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:22,419
Shit.

600
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:25,942
What the hell is that?

601
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:28,309
What do you got?

602
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,025
He's bugged.

603
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:31,624
You fuck!

604
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:38,909
-Stop it!
-Who told you to do this?

605
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:41,301
-They have my family.
-Who told you to do it?!

606
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:43,860
-They have my family.
-Who has your family?!

607
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:46,750
l was promised no harm
will come to them.

608
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,827
-Who told you to do it?!
-Stop it!

609
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:53,464
-Who told you to do it?!
-Col. Sadick.

610
01:11:54,192 --> 01:11:55,227
Col. Sadick.

611
01:11:56,672 --> 01:11:59,232
l am one of many
who give him information.

612
01:12:00,672 --> 01:12:02,663
About who?
lnformation about who?!

613
01:12:02,832 --> 01:12:04,663
We have to follow....

614
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:07,710
Who?! Who?!

615
01:12:07,872 --> 01:12:10,102
We have to follow....

616
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:12,742
-Follow who?!
-Arthur.

617
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,345
Arthur?

618
01:12:22,032 --> 01:12:23,784
l am not a killer.

619
01:12:26,992 --> 01:12:28,664
The fuck you're not.

620
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:36,670
-What do you wanna do with him?
-Let him bleed out.

621
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,426
Why?

622
01:12:44,832 --> 01:12:49,542
What is going to happen
to my family?

623
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:52,826
l don't know.

624
01:12:53,472 --> 01:12:56,111
-Help them.
-Zee. Lake.

625
01:12:56,512 --> 01:12:58,742
-Get them up.
-Everybody up. Now.

626
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:09,908
Who knows what this is?

627
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:17,305
This is a transmitter.

628
01:13:19,393 --> 01:13:22,430
l took this off Gideon's dead body...

629
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:24,825
...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.

630
01:13:28,513 --> 01:13:30,390
You have any more of these here?

631
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:35,472
Why would anybody wanna transmit
our position?

632
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:40,024
Transmit our position
to over 300 Nigerian soldiers...

633
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:41,867
...who ran all night...

634
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,631
...to get to within an hour and a half
of where we are now?

635
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:52,022
Red.

636
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,188
Somebody's gonna tell me.

637
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:01,867
Somebody's gonna start talking
right now.

638
01:14:02,993 --> 01:14:06,269
Because if they don't tell me
what l want to know...

639
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:08,583
...by the time l count to five...

640
01:14:08,753 --> 01:14:10,903
...l'm gonna kill someone else.

641
01:14:11,793 --> 01:14:13,226
One.

642
01:14:15,313 --> 01:14:16,905
Two.

643
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,790
Three.

644
01:14:22,473 --> 01:14:23,986
Don't fuck with me.

645
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:26,503
-Four.
-Please.

646
01:14:27,233 --> 01:14:28,586
Please.

647
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,267
There's no need for this.

648
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,107
Please.

649
01:14:34,274 --> 01:14:36,834
Now you got something
to say to me, don't you?

650
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:39,384
My name is Arthur Azuka.

651
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:45,550
l'm the only son
of President Samuel Azuka.

652
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:50,831
Please don't blame them.

653
01:14:51,794 --> 01:14:52,829
Please.

654
01:14:54,354 --> 01:14:56,185
l'm sorry to have misled you...

655
01:14:56,354 --> 01:14:58,993
...but there are enemies
looking for me everywhere.

656
01:14:59,234 --> 01:15:01,828
That is why you're being pursued.

657
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,712
Our report said the entire
presidential family was executed.

658
01:15:08,074 --> 01:15:10,668
Your reports were incorrect.

659
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:13,625
They were not executed.

660
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:16,184
They murdered my father...

661
01:15:16,754 --> 01:15:18,745
...along with my mother...

662
01:15:19,634 --> 01:15:21,067
...and my two...

663
01:15:22,514 --> 01:15:23,947
...younger sisters...

664
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,545
...out of greed...

665
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,664
...and my father's fight for democracy
for his people.

666
01:15:35,074 --> 01:15:36,587
My people.

667
01:15:38,114 --> 01:15:40,582
When it first appeared
there might be trouble...

668
01:15:40,754 --> 01:15:43,222
...my father sent me away with this man.

669
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:46,107
Col. Okeze.

670
01:15:47,954 --> 01:15:51,470
Lieutenant, his father was more
than the president.

671
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:53,227
He was the tribal king.

672
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:55,511
That makes him the heir
to the lbo nation.

673
01:15:56,115 --> 01:15:57,992
lt's a bloodline they must cut.

674
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:01,950
The Fulanis will comb heaven
and earth to find him.

675
01:16:09,795 --> 01:16:11,228
You knew about this?

676
01:16:13,075 --> 01:16:15,543
You knew all the time,
and you didn't tell me.

677
01:16:18,435 --> 01:16:20,187
l didn't trust you...

678
01:16:20,435 --> 01:16:22,073
...at the time.

679
01:16:29,915 --> 01:16:31,985
l wonder what it takes
to earn your trust.

680
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:36,553
Red, Lake.

681
01:16:41,675 --> 01:16:44,314
Tell them to pack their things.
We're leaving.

682
01:16:45,795 --> 01:16:48,628
Men, give them their weapons.
We're moving out of here.

683
01:16:48,795 --> 01:16:50,274
-Pack up your things.
-Come on.

684
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:51,584
Move it out!

685
01:16:52,355 --> 01:16:54,471
-Get in, get out. Okay?
-Come on.

686
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:56,667
Move it. Move it.

687
01:16:57,115 --> 01:16:59,913
-Come on. See you. Hurry back.
-Back in formation.

688
01:17:28,716 --> 01:17:32,504
They must continue their route to
the Tandjile Pass or they'll lose a day.

689
01:17:32,676 --> 01:17:36,828
So they must come out here,
near the Cameroon border.

690
01:17:40,036 --> 01:17:41,151
No!

691
01:18:10,276 --> 01:18:12,073
How many men
do you have in Gashanka?

692
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,669
Right on time.

693
01:18:20,956 --> 01:18:23,516
Good hustle, Red.
Come on up and brief Zee.

694
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:28,792
This river will get us
straight into Cameroon.

695
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:30,795
They'll be expecting us.

696
01:18:32,317 --> 01:18:33,955
What do you think?

697
01:18:34,117 --> 01:18:36,312
l think we're fucked
either way we go.

698
01:18:37,757 --> 01:18:40,715
We backtrack, cross downstream...

699
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:44,187
...come up, go through the jungle
and rip right into Cameroon.

700
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:47,986
Roger that. Let the other men know.

701
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:49,909
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.

702
01:18:50,757 --> 01:18:52,031
L.T.

703
01:18:52,637 --> 01:18:55,197
-What do you got?
-Rhodes on the phone.

704
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:00,150
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters.

705
01:19:00,317 --> 01:19:02,592
lntel reports military elements
in your sector...

706
01:19:02,757 --> 01:19:05,669
...conducting search and destroy
of a U.S. military unit...

707
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:09,792
...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the
late president. What can you tell me?

708
01:19:09,957 --> 01:19:12,187
Yes, sir, we just discovered that
ourselves.

709
01:19:12,357 --> 01:19:15,554
He and his bodyguard hid themselves
within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.

710
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:18,709
That's a major problem, lieutenant.

711
01:19:18,877 --> 01:19:22,552
He inv olves your mission in the
internal politics of a foreign nation...

712
01:19:22,717 --> 01:19:26,551
...affecting U.S. diplomacy and
seriously increases the mission's risk.

713
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:29,271
He's considered a criminal
by the new regime.

714
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:31,035
He's a major liability.

715
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:34,553
-What exactly does that mean, sir?
-His party is excess cargo.

716
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:36,509
You mean he's not human, sir?

717
01:19:37,157 --> 01:19:40,593
Captain, this man is the lbo tribal
leader. Do you know what that means?

718
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:42,793
Cut the shit. Who do you think l am?

719
01:19:44,837 --> 01:19:47,955
Sir, we both know what'll happen to him
if l leave him out here.

720
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,308
There won't be a trial or a jury.

721
01:19:50,478 --> 01:19:52,833
Outside the courthouse,
they'll put two in his head.

722
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,588
l'm just asking for a little help here.
Put yourself in my shoes, Bill.

723
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,350
l've been in your shoes, lieutenant.

724
01:19:58,518 --> 01:20:01,476
Send in an air evac immediately
and get all of us out of here, sir.

725
01:20:01,638 --> 01:20:04,948
Negative on air support at this time.
Airspace is too hot.

726
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:09,350
Your judgment has risk ed the lives of
your men and the mission's success.

727
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:12,669
l advise you, complete the evacuation
as planned! Do you read me?!

728
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:16,188
Yes, sir, l read you. Loud and clear.

729
01:20:16,998 --> 01:20:20,513
But l cannot, in good conscience, do that
without taking these people to safety.

730
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:21,713
That's not your mission!

731
01:20:21,878 --> 01:20:24,028
When have l not completed a mission?

732
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:27,508
My team will complete this mission.

733
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:29,197
l give you my word on that.

734
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:30,996
l don't like this.

735
01:20:31,638 --> 01:20:33,788
Get your ass back here alive
soon as possible.

736
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,949
Maintain contact with OP center.

737
01:20:38,198 --> 01:20:40,348
l'll direct air support
as soon as l can.

738
01:20:40,678 --> 01:20:41,952
I promise you.

739
01:20:42,678 --> 01:20:43,793
Yes, sir.

740
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:46,037
Eagle One, out.

741
01:20:48,758 --> 01:20:50,032
Bring them up.

742
01:20:50,678 --> 01:20:53,238
Everybody up on L.T. now. Double time.

743
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:54,957
So much for diplomacy.

744
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:57,357
Come on, let's go.

745
01:21:02,198 --> 01:21:05,953
Here's the deal. lt's been strongly
suggested that we turn over Arthur...

746
01:21:06,999 --> 01:21:09,638
...and abandon these refugees
out here in the bush.

747
01:21:11,719 --> 01:21:14,677
l'll tell you right now
l'm not gonna do that.

748
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,871
l can't do that.

749
01:21:18,919 --> 01:21:20,637
l broke my own rule.

750
01:21:21,959 --> 01:21:24,029
l started to give a fuck...

751
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:27,399
...and brought you guys along with me.

752
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:33,798
We're about to walk into some serious
shit. Before we do, l'd just like...

753
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:40,118
...to hear what you guys have to say
about it. That's all. Speak freely.

754
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,229
ln my opinion, sir...

755
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,471
...we cut our losses.
This isn't our fucking war.

756
01:21:47,839 --> 01:21:49,909
As far as me being in or out...

757
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:52,511
...you know the answer to that.

758
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,269
Let's get these people to safety.

759
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,036
Let's finish the job.

760
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,796
l can't leave them, sir.

761
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:08,991
l'm good to go.

762
01:22:10,999 --> 01:22:12,955
What about you, Red?

763
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:20,271
l can't look at them
like packages anymore.

764
01:22:21,999 --> 01:22:24,389
l'm gonna get them out...

765
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:27,115
...or l'm going to die trying.

766
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,752
Are we there yet?

767
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,949
Thanks, fellas.

768
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,119
Strip those packs down
to rolling gear only.

769
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,353
Have the refugees drop anything
that don't go '' boom.'' Let's move.

770
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,114
Double time. Let's go. Hustle.

771
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:00,874
L.T...

772
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,959
...those Africans are my people too.

773
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,799
For all the years that we were told
to stand down and to stand by...

774
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,998
...you're doing the right thing.

775
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,873
For our sins.

776
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,189
Hooyah.

777
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,789
Hooyah.

778
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,309
We gotta go.

779
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,629
Let's go.

780
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,915
Lieutenant.

781
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,996
l'm sorry l didn't tell you
about Arthur.

782
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,916
l should have trusted you.

783
01:23:47,641 --> 01:23:49,518
lt's not your fault.

784
01:23:52,681 --> 01:23:55,673
l would've done the same thing
if l was in your position.

785
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:57,638
l wouldn't have trusted me either.

786
01:23:57,801 --> 01:24:00,190
l'm gonna get your people
to Cameroon.

787
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:04,553
l promise.
Come on. We gotta hurry.

788
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:57,319
L.T., hold one.

789
01:24:57,561 --> 01:24:59,711
Hold one.

790
01:25:23,962 --> 01:25:25,714
What do you got, Lake?

791
01:25:33,322 --> 01:25:36,473
Everybody down.
Get down! Get down!

792
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:44,435
Where you at, motherfuckers?

793
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:46,513
Where you at?

794
01:26:01,682 --> 01:26:03,035
Fat fuck.

795
01:26:05,922 --> 01:26:07,992
Look at this motherfucker.

796
01:26:08,202 --> 01:26:09,715
Pussy.

797
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,312
Clear, L.T. lt's just a pig.

798
01:26:13,722 --> 01:26:15,235
l'm crossing over.

799
01:26:19,722 --> 01:26:20,711
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.

800
01:26:20,882 --> 01:26:22,396
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.

801
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:28,277
-Zee!
-Smoke! Give me smoke!

802
01:26:28,443 --> 01:26:29,592
L.T...

803
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:31,835
...l got hit. Sniper.

804
01:26:32,003 --> 01:26:32,992
Go!

805
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:43,000
-Look who it is. The fucking cavalry.
-Keep your hand on that.

806
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:44,437
-Sit him up.
-How's he doing?

807
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:47,279
He's all right. One in the shoulder.
Clean hit.

808
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:49,161
Sorry, sir. He caught me sleeping.

809
01:26:49,323 --> 01:26:50,358
Don't worry about it.

810
01:26:50,563 --> 01:26:53,555
-Did you get that little son of a bitch?
-We got some of him.

811
01:26:53,803 --> 01:26:55,282
-You see anybody else?
-Sorry.

812
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:56,796
-l'm better than that, sir.
-Don't worry.

813
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:58,112
l'm better than that.

814
01:26:58,283 --> 01:26:59,432
-Fuck that.
-Can you walk?

815
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:00,672
Yes, sir.

816
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,761
Let's go, Doc. Make it tight.
Get me back in this shit.

817
01:27:05,443 --> 01:27:06,876
All right. Ready.

818
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:12,116
Get down!

819
01:27:57,764 --> 01:27:58,958
Grenade!

820
01:28:36,804 --> 01:28:38,203
Dr. Kendricks!

821
01:28:38,684 --> 01:28:40,322
Lena!

822
01:28:40,924 --> 01:28:42,323
Lena!

823
01:28:50,004 --> 01:28:51,642
Lena, listen. Wake up.

824
01:28:51,844 --> 01:28:54,836
Wake up. Oh, God. Wake up.
Wake up. Do you hear me?

825
01:28:55,044 --> 01:28:56,238
Okeze! Okeze!

826
01:28:56,404 --> 01:28:57,519
Wake up.

827
01:28:57,724 --> 01:28:59,123
Okeze.

828
01:29:00,045 --> 01:29:01,558
Lena, listen to me.

829
01:29:01,765 --> 01:29:03,995
We've gotta get out of here now!
You hear me?

830
01:29:04,525 --> 01:29:08,120
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of here right now.

831
01:29:08,285 --> 01:29:10,196
Slo, Zee, get them ready to go now!

832
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:11,794
Sit up.

833
01:29:11,965 --> 01:29:12,954
Slo!

834
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:15,878
Slo!

835
01:29:17,965 --> 01:29:20,923
-Oh, fuck! Goddamn it!
-Fuck.

836
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,715
l never saw it coming, boss.

837
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,119
Son of a bitch.

838
01:29:27,765 --> 01:29:30,120
lt wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

839
01:29:30,285 --> 01:29:32,640
lt's my fault.
lt's my fault, all right?

840
01:29:32,805 --> 01:29:33,999
Breathe.

841
01:29:35,445 --> 01:29:37,083
-You know what to do, right?
-Yeah.

842
01:29:37,285 --> 01:29:38,559
Yeah, l know what to do.

843
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:41,558
You hear me? l got it, okay?

844
01:29:41,725 --> 01:29:43,681
Breathe. Just relax.

845
01:29:45,925 --> 01:29:47,358
Breathe.

846
01:29:47,805 --> 01:29:48,794
No!

847
01:29:51,205 --> 01:29:52,194
No.

848
01:29:54,405 --> 01:29:57,522
You'll get them there, right?
lt's not for nothing, right? Right?

849
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:59,721
l'll get them there. Don't worry.
l got it.

850
01:29:59,885 --> 01:30:02,353
l got everything, all right?
Don't worry.

851
01:30:03,925 --> 01:30:06,200
Breathe, Slo. Breathe, breathe.

852
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:09,640
l guess we're there, huh, boss?

853
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:12,476
Yeah, we're there.

854
01:30:33,966 --> 01:30:36,526
Zee, get these people ready to go.
Do it now.

855
01:30:37,366 --> 01:30:38,765
Silk...

856
01:30:38,926 --> 01:30:41,565
...get his weapons and ammunition.

857
01:30:43,286 --> 01:30:44,878
What about the body?

858
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:46,844
We gotta come back for it.

859
01:30:47,246 --> 01:30:48,679
Goddamn it.

860
01:30:49,046 --> 01:30:50,559
Goddamn it!

861
01:30:56,246 --> 01:31:00,159
-No.
-Listen to me, goddamn it! Listen to me!

862
01:31:00,326 --> 01:31:03,079
This man is dead. lf you don't
want his death to be meaningless...

863
01:31:03,246 --> 01:31:06,397
...it's time for you to become a man
and get your people into Cameroon!

864
01:31:06,646 --> 01:31:09,479
Now cowboy the fuck up!
You got it?

865
01:31:12,646 --> 01:31:14,284
Do you understand me?

866
01:31:14,446 --> 01:31:16,164
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

867
01:31:16,326 --> 01:31:17,441
-You all right?
-Yes, sir.

868
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:19,079
-Stay with this man.
-Yes, sir.

869
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:20,166
lt's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

870
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:21,758
lt's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

871
01:31:24,486 --> 01:31:25,839
Get down! Stay down!

872
01:31:26,806 --> 01:31:29,479
Open up those toolboxes, boys.
They'll be coming!

873
01:31:29,646 --> 01:31:31,398
Conserve your ammo!

874
01:31:31,606 --> 01:31:32,641
Get down! Get back.

875
01:31:32,966 --> 01:31:35,002
-Red, how many claymores you got?
-One, sir.

876
01:31:36,326 --> 01:31:38,887
Stand by to lay down cover fire for Red.
On my mark!

877
