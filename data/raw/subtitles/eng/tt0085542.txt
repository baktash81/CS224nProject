1
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,532
My father's kingdom was a peaceful one.

2
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,474
It was a land of prosperity,

3
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,580
gentility and appreciation of freedom

4
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,614
which my father valued above all else.

5
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,975
Had it not been such,
I would not be who I am.

6
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,021
Instead of riding across open fields
and hunting with my father,

7
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,988
I would be sitting with my mother,
hands folded,

8
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,091
knitting stockings and such
andentertaining boring young men

9
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,632
who would fulfill my mother's dreams
to be the perfect princess

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,101
in dresses and jewels
and married off by the age of 1 8.

11
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,734
But my father didn't see the world
that way.

12
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,603
As his only heir,

13
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,940
I was able to enjoy
all the adventures life had to offer

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,049
as if I've been born a prince,
instead of a princess.

15
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,051
So my mother lovingly frowned
on us both

16
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,221
and hoped one day I would meet my match
and come to my senses.

17
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,728
Are you enjoying yourself, Augustin?

18
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,831
Ah, my lovely daughter,
just in time for lunch.

19
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,195
How was your morning ride?

20
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,535
Wonderful! She's the best horse
I have ever ridden.

21
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,111
Good. Just stay out of the lzma woods.

22
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,679
The Tree People won't care
if you are a princess.

23
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,408
They'll rob and kill you either way.

24
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,115
I know, father. Ah... I'm starving!

25
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,486
Please, use your fork, Luisa!

26
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,789
What would I do without you, mother?

27
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,626
Luisa, have you been in touch
with the Duke of Tugandore?

28
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,325
His mother said
he's quite interested in you.

29
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,569
We exchanged a few letters.
But he's such a bore.

30
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,937
- Everyone bores you.
- Father doesn't.

31
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,240
Flattery will get you everywhere.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,410
Luisa, you have to start thinking
about marriage.

33
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,313
It's not right for
a young woman your age,

34
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,713
not to be married.

35
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,718
Look at the way you dress
and carry yourself,

36
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,221
Iike one of your father's stable hands.

37
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,891
That's no way for a princess to behave.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,328
I'm not concerned with marriage, mother.

39
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,797
There are far more important

40
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,264
and interesting things
to put my efforts into.

41
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,334
Like what?

42
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,667
- Riding...
- Fencing...

43
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,896
Hunting...

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,207
All right, enough!

45
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,670
Is marriage such a bad thing?

46
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:34,937
Not always.

47
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,621
What was that?

48
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,855
What was that?

49
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,796
My King, Queen Remini,
are you all right?

50
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,298
Yes, we're fine, Paxian.

51
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,870
Send some man to the village
to tend to the injured.

52
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,598
I'd like to go, too.

53
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,071
I'm sure they can handle it.

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,699
I'm sure they can,
but I'd like to see for myself.

55
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,275
I think it's good for Luisa to be
with her people.

56
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,233
Luisa!

57
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,699
Inside! Inside, now!

58
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,795
Come with me!

59
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,062
Hold on!

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,038
This way!

61
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,274
Here, under here!

62
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,139
Luisa is down there.

63
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,476
Send some men to find her!

64
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,548
As you wish.

65
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,619
Cover your eyes!

66
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,557
Don't look!

67
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,466
We weren't prepared for this.

68
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,834
Let's go come on.

69
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,490
Your Highness,
you should go back inside.

70
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,227
Man, get ready!

71
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,397
Do not fire until he's almost upon us!

72
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,391
Wait!

73
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,266
Get ready!

74
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,979
Aim for the head!

75
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,342
Fire!

76
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,363
Luisa, are you all right?

77
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,604
Find her parents.

78
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,368
- Thank God you're safe.
- Where did the dragon come from?

79
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,908
Paxian, we haven't had a dragon attack
in over twenty years.

80
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,740
- I don't know.
- Find out!

81
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,745
I don't think it will give up
so easily next time.

82
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,915
That day was only the beginning...

83
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,260
The Fire Dragon returned
to Carpia every few weeks.

84
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,257
Sometimes to feed...

85
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,628
Sometimes it seemed
just to inflict destruction.

86
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,665
There was nothing my father could do.

87
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,603
Within 3 months,
our kingdom was almost destroyed.

88
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,809
... for the children.

89
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,287
Come back here!

90
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,458
The people are turning on each other.

91
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,900
They're starving to death.

92
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,604
May I suggest there may be other things

93
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,765
more appropriate for a princess
to concern herself with?

94
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:15,305
Really? And what do you consider
more appropriate than my kingdom?

95
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,814
- Luisa, that's enough!
- But father, he's not...

96
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,884
- Come, let them speak alone.
- But mother...

97
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,111
Luisa, please!

98
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,889
You can't act that way
in front of your father!

99
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,827
I don't like Paxian.

100
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,491
He treats me with no respect.

101
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,694
Even if that were true,

102
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,828
it doesn't mean you can behave
in such a way.

103
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,305
He's your father's advisor, not yours.
Now, go to your room!

104
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,702
- But...
- Now!

105
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,359
I just received word that King Quilok
is requesting a meeting with you.

106
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,192
Quilok? What does he want?

107
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,235
He is willing to open the doors of
his kingdom to you and our people,

108
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,838
but he wants
you to surrender allegiance.

109
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:14,967
T o him.

110
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,067
That little snake!

111
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,778
If I thought it were possible

112
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,437
I'd believe he sent his dragon
after us himself.

113
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,807
We've run out of options.

114
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,474
We may have to consider his offer.

115
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,648
Why hasn't the dragon attacked
his kingdom?

116
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,947
He must have something protecting him.

117
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,422
Perhaps it's just luck.

118
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,558
Your Highness,
desperate citizens of Carpia

119
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,258
have gathered outside the castle.

120
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,868
Should we allow them entry?

121
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,629
- Absolutely not!
- They're starving out there.

122
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,039
They're not our responsibility.

123
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,672
Until King Augustin surrenders
to our Kingdom,

124
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,578
his people will remain at the mercy
of the elements.

125
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,947
Or the Fire Dragon,
whichever comes first.

126
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,781
My father could never see beyond
our little province.

127
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,295
It's all going to be so different,
so soon...

128
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,194
I want you to put
more men around the Dracone.

129
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,659
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,012
What about Knight Alodor?

131
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,290
Oh, with all due respect,
that is not something to consider.

132
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,451
Well, he is the only man
to ever kill a dragon.

133
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,857
He's a traitor!

134
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,630
The Knight Alodor was banished
by King Quilok for treason.

135
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,464
It's no secret that King Quilok
was envious of Alodor.

136
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,631
Nevertheless,
Alodor's knighthood was taken from him.

137
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,673
The most serious of punishments
that can befall a knight.

138
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,644
And it is in strict violation
of our treaties,

139
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,977
to employ a knight
which has been banished.

140
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,482
I know what the treaties say, Paxian.

141
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,644
My father was part of the council
that wrote them.

142
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,653
But the future of the kingdom
is at stake.

143
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,485
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but it's you who told me

144
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,617
that when a king begins to choose
which laws to follow

145
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:20,255
to suit his own needs,
he has been corrupted by his own power.

146
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,963
Mother, you scared me.

147
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,706
You were eavesdropping.

148
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,809
No, I just didn't want to disturb them.

149
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,674
Luisa, I already asked you
once to go to your room.

150
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,180
Now please, do as I asked.

151
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,266
Who is the Knight Alodor?

152
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,293
Luisa, stay out of it!

153
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,765
If this is a man who can help,
we have to find him

154
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,431
Who cares what he did?

155
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,109
Half of all soldiers
are former thieves and criminals.

156
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,337
What's the difference?

157
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,744
Are you saying you know how to rule
a kingdom better than your father?

158
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,975
No more than Paxian thinks he can.

159
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,552
Paxian is the King's Chief Advisor.

160
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,280
Well, then he's not a good advisor.

161
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,913
That's not your business.

162
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,526
Father doesn't want to see it,
but you know I'm right.

163
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,363
Alodor defeated an lce Dragon
for King Quilok the First.

164
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,830
After he died,
King Quilok the Second claimed

165
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,833
that Alodor turned against him.

166
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,200
I wouldn't believe anything Quilok said.

167
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,807
That's beside the point.
Alodor is banished.

168
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,273
Anyway, Luisa, go to bed.

169
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,971
And it will slip my mind to tell
your father about you spying on him.

170
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,744
I don't want to hear anymore
about this from you.

171
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,350
Good night.

172
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,077
I'll send in your maid.

173
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,233
What are you doing?
You are supposed to be dressing for bed!

174
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,842
I'm going to the lzma forest,

175
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,275
to find this mysterious Knight Alodor
everyone is talking about.

176
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,246
You should not be going anywhere
at this hour.

177
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,215
Especially not to lzma.

178
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,717
I am going, and I can protect myself.

179
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,451
I know he must be in lzma.

180
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,986
If I were Alodor,
that's were I'd be hiding.

181
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,561
And that's where I'm going to find him.

182
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,629
Don't move!

183
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,362
A girl?

184
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,396
A Princess.

185
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,829
I'm Princess Luisa of Carpia.

186
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,333
So you are..

187
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,641
Do you know,

188
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,143
we had the Queen of Persia here,
only the other day.

189
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,746
Lovely woman. Spoke well of you.

190
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,974
I am the Princess of Carpia.

191
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,745
Yes, yes...

192
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:06,517
Well, our Princesses are
wearing boys' clothes these days?

193
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,323
Our cloak of arms.

194
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,755
Certainly looks like it.

195
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,495
I am looking for the Knight Alodor.

196
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,697
Alodor?

197
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,400
Do you know him?

198
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,862
What would you want with a man
like that?

199
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,668
I have a proposition for him.

200
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,944
Yes. But it's not safe here,
there is something coming. Let's go!

201
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,306
Could it be the Knight Alodor?

202
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,439
I doubt that very much.

203
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,573
Now, come on!

204
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,218
Tree People.

205
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,084
- What should we do?
- Stand perfectly still.

206
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,726
- Will they leave us alone?
- No, they'll probably kill us.

207
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,066
Do you have a weapon?

208
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,665
- A dagger.
- A dagger?

209
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,231
That's not a weapon, that's cutlery.

210
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,680
You took your time.

211
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,257
Who is this?

212
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,424
I am Princess Luisa of Carpia.
I'm looking for the Knight Alodor.

213
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,259
And who, might I ask, are you?

214
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,470
I'm the one who deserves a thank you
before answering any of your questions.

215
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,675
Is this blindfold really necessary?

216
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,941
I guess so...

217
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,704
I want to speak to Alodor.

218
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,841
I know you know him.

219
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,576
Why are you stalling?

220
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,616
Why would the King send his daughter
to carry a message?

221
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,483
I volunteered. You're still stalling.

222
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,790
- I don't believe you.
- Because I'm a woman?

223
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,123
Because as his only heir,
you are indispensable.

224
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,024
A good king would send a messenger,
or a soldier...

225
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,996
- Or a pigeon.
- Right.

226
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,105
A Fire Dragon has been terrorizing
our kingdom for the past few months.

227
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,998
It's brought destruction of
a kind we've never seen before.

228
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,138
King Quilok says
he will give our people shelter

229
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,646
only if my father surrenders
his kingdom to him.

230
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,382
If Quilock gains that much power,
none of us is safe.

231
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,316
Which is why I need to speak to Alodor.

232
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,323
He's the only man
who's ever killed a dragon.

233
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,222
We need him to do it again.

234
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,372
My father says
he will reinstate his knighthood.

235
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,071
- I'm afraid he could not accept.
- Why not?

236
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,506
- Alodor is dead.
- How do you know?

237
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,447
Because he was my father.

238
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,483
You can sleep here tonight.

239
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,853
T omorrow you'll return to your castle.

240
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,740
Well, Gabriel, what are we going to do?

241
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,718
What are we going to do?

242
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,817
It's not our fight.

243
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,630
No. It's not our fight

244
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,198
Not.

245
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,097
But...

246
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,828
The last time my father fought
for a kingdom,

247
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,429
he was betrayed and abandoned.

248
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,470
I won't let that happen to me.

249
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,348
Gabriel, don't let
your family's experience with Quilok

250
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,712
call out your attitude towards Augustin.

251
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,214
By all accounts,
he's a good king and a decent man.

252
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,420
You're right.

253
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,059
Yes, I am.

254
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,320
But you're also a smug.

255
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,696
Yes I'm afraid that's true, too.

256
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,063
It's not our fight.

257
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,805
It's not our fight.

258
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,088
Bad dream?

259
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,389
- I was sure you've left me.
- Leave you?

260
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,789
Why would anyone want to leave
this lovely place?

261
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,798
Cup of tea?

262
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,429
Why was Alodor expelled by Quilok?

263
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,036
I think you wanna go
and ask Gabriel that.

264
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,472
Where is he?

265
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,642
He's outside.

266
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,207
I'm not a typical princess.

267
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,673
I see your weapons collection.

268
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,043
Not exactly for ordinary fighting men.

269
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,985
I also know that knights
always pass down

270
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,919
their knowledge to their sons.

271
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,454
Especially if that knight
had such a particular skill.

272
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,759
Like hunting dragons.

273
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:18,994
So you're up.

274
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,090
We'll escort you back,
it's not safe here to go alone.

275
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:24,532
Thank you.

276
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,598
Thank him.

277
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,230
It was his idea, not mine.

278
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:32,443
Now, before we go,
I want to show you something.

279
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,778
I think you're going to find
this rather impressive.

280
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:43,983
Are you watching?

281
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,434
And that...
that was just a mild mixture!

282
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,561
With a concentrated mixture
I can bring down a mountain.

283
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,066
That's always good to have as an option.

284
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,101
An option?

285
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,970
- Let's get going!
- You weren't impressed?

286
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,168
- Let's pack up.
- T ell me you were impressed!

287
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,012
You're taking everything?

288
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,820
We are always on the move.

289
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,522
- Do you think you can keep up?
- That's not a problem.

290
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,689
Don't wait for me. Carry on!

291
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,069
Because of your relationship
to my late father,

292
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,698
I'm making you this offer.

293
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,775
If it was anyone else,

294
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,903
I would have simply let
your kingdom wither away.

295
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,080
Don't patronize me!

296
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,116
This is extortion, pure and simple.

297
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,981
You can qualify
my offer anyway you want.

298
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,746
The simple fact remains.

299
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,184
I can save your people and you can not!

300
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,828
You have two days to consider.

301
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,059
Don't bother seeing me out.

302
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,565
His father is rolling
in his grave right now.

303
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,264
What would you like me to do?

304
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,469
Find me a miracle.

305
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:21,514
Barring that, we may have
to accept his offer. Let's wait.

306
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,044
My father will be very grateful,

307
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,124
if you help us fight off
the Fire Dragon.

308
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,823
But I don't fight dragons,

309
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,860
or favor kingdoms,
or the men who rule them.

310
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,520
My father is a good man.

311
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,896
His people love and respect him.

312
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,467
He's willing to give up
his throne for their sake.

313
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,400
Doesn't that say something about him?

314
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,105
Why would I care about your father?

315
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,875
We need your help.

316
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,644
Unfortunately,
I don't need much from you.

317
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,280
My father can make you a knight.

318
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,285
How are things going down here?

319
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,954
And I suppose you also
don't need our large reward.

320
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:03,822
Money?

321
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,686
Oh, we like money.

322
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,127
I remember what it looks like.

323
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,631
- Money is good.
- Great.

324
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,757
Perfect.

325
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,441
Nice girl.

326
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,078
Fish are rising.

327
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,939
How could you promise
such a thing in my name?

328
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,447
Do you know what the penalty is
for falsely representing the King?

329
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,813
- Yes, father, I know. But...
- Quiet!

330
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,483
- Where is he?
- They are in the waiting hall.

331
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,563
- Should I send for them?
- No. Just go. Now.

332
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:13,956
What?

333
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,899
Do not make me regret giving
you free reign all these years.

334
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,560
Please, go!

335
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,406
Augustin, at least speak with him.

336
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,511
This is ridiculous.

337
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,240
The son of a dragon slayer?
The son of a banished knight?

338
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,916
This is not a plan.

339
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,711
We have to consider all the options.

340
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,346
King Quilok is making an offer,
no matter how unpleasant,

341
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,651
that will save out people!

342
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,053
And you are entertaining a fantasy.

343
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,395
His terms are extortion.

344
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,359
I have to think this through.

345
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:58,743
Nice place!

346
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,173
Why am I being made to wait?

347
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,112
Perhaps they're preparing appetizers.

348
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,843
You're a fool!

349
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,355
Gabriel, last night we slept
in a hole in the ground.

350
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,251
This is a palace.

351
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,353
I'm not too eager to leave.

352
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,664
Gentlemen, the King will see you now.

353
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,817
My daughter made you an offer
on my behalf without my knowledge.

354
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,793
I knew she was a liar.

355
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,690
Careful!

356
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,967
Can you do
what my daughter says you can?

357
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,901
Can you kill this dragon?

358
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,436
It was my father who did that.
I'm not my father.

359
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,633
You didn't answer my question.

360
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,035
Do something!

361
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, dragon slayer,
the dragon has returned.

362
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,067
- That's too bad.
- Do something!

363
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,235
Do it yourself.

364
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,871
Gabriel, tell me now.
Can you destroy this beast?

365
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,005
That doesn't really matter.

366
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,188
Yes, it does.

367
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,456
It matters to the people out there
and that matters to me.

368
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,423
If you can kill this dragon,
I will honor my daughter's promise.

369
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,659
The King's ransom for the dragon's head.

370
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,134
- You can't possible consider...
- Be quiet!

371
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,232
You have my word.

372
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,173
What say you?

373
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,508
Come!

374
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,367
Steady, there, steady... Go!

375
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,955
Well done, my boy! Good shot!

376
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,717
So...
you finally got the smoke cloud to work.

377
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,294
When did you test it?

378
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:13,761
I didn't.

379
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,126
It was far too dangerous.

380
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,325
I decided to let you test it for me.

381
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,062
Thank you!

382
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,642
Let's have a talk with these two.

383
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,609
Your Majesties,
judging by what I saw this afternoon,

384
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,511
I think we can say with certainty

385
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,488
that neither I nor any other man
can defeat this dragon

386
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,821
You fought off the Fire Dragon today.
Can't be impossible.

387
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,591
No, he said he thought it impossible
for any man to defeat this dragon.

388
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,293
Then why is Quilok's kingdom
seemingly protected from the dragon?

389
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:55,438
A dragon is
the incarnation of malevolence.

390
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,065
It will attack and attempt
to destroy anything and everything,

391
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,543
except a Dracone.

392
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,405
The Dracone is the sphere
we see between the dragon's eyes.

393
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,752
The Dracone is in fact a shell,

394
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,753
the egg which holds
the dragon's offspring.

395
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,858
Quilok must have a Dracone perched
on top of his castle.

396
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,029
And how did Quilok
come to get the Dracone?

397
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,796
My father.

398
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,264
Gabriel's father killed an lce Dragon,

399
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,067
cut the Dracone out of it.

400
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,036
He's the only man ever to have done so.

401
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,796
Every dragon is born female

402
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,365
and carries with it a single Dracone
for all of it's life.

403
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,563
Before a dragon dies,
it will expel its Dracone,

404
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,165
then the infant dragon emerges.

405
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,212
It learns quickly. Within a few days,
it can feed and fly.

406
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,649
Then it abandons its mother to die...

407
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:17,686
Flies away.

408
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,656
The whole cycle begins again.

409
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,652
A fascinating lesson.

410
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:27,086
I'm sure the King would arrange
a teaching position for you.

411
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,099
How do we kill it?

412
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,669
As I said, we can't kill it.

413
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,137
But another dragon can.

414
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,366
Another dragon?!

415
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,510
You can't trust Gabriel!

416
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,512
We have no idea what he intends to do.

417
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,775
He will bring further destruction to us.

418
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,782
He's a liar, like his father!

419
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,744
What do you mean by that?

420
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,023
When his father
was a knight to Quilok the First,

421
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,625
it was no secret
that he hated the prince.

422
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,124
Quilok the first held Alodor
in very high regards,

423
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,286
they were very close,

424
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,928
having been through
many difficult times together

425
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,000
So, why was he banished?

426
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,433
After the King died,

427
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,232
Alodor remained his head knight.

428
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,701
The young Quilok valued
Alodor's experience,

429
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,207
but the feeling was not mutual.

430
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,709
He questioned every decision
the King made.

431
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,780
Alodor believed that he himself
should be King.

432
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,715
Quilok had much patience with him,
out of respect for the relationship

433
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,049
he had with his father,
but he was then told

434
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,022
Alodor was going to attempt
to overthrow the King.

435
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,326
Quilok then put a price on his head
and Alodor fled,

436
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,259
never to be heard from again.

437
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:37,299
He was a man without virtue, or morals.

438
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,098
Now, it seems, his son has able to sway
you into trusting him

439
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,230
the way his father swayed Quilok.

440
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,071
For your sake, I hope
the apple falls miles from the tree.

441
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:57,117
You said what's on your mind,
you can go now.

442
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,731
Wait, I'm coming with you.

443
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,563
I don't think so.

444
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,364
I order you to take me along.

445
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,333
I'm not a knight of your court just yet.

446
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,632
I don't take orders from you.
Sorry, Princess.

447
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,006
I think I should send both of you
to charm school.

448
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,249
You know, my boy,
if our plan doesn't work,

449
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,553
we will only have put many more lives
in peril.

450
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,688
Well, then let's hope there's
a bit of my father's blood in me.

451
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,962
Wait for my signal.
When you're done, meet me back here.

452
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,198
Be careful, lad. Good luck.

453
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:47,860
What do you want?

454
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,499
I want you to stop treating me
like I'm useless.

455
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,232
You again?

456
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,332
What are you doing here?

457
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,962
Helping you. Now do you see
I can keep up with you?

458
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,836
I've tracked you down twice.
Helping me?

459
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,766
You should stop telling me more lies.

460
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,904
Almost killing me isn't helping me.

461
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,772
I am as capable as any man...

462
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,644
Please, I've heard it before.

463
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,148
But it seems nothing
I could say would make you turn back.

464
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,454
At least you're learning.

465
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,021
Just stay close and
try not to get yourself killed.

466
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:17,851
I'll try.

467
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,094
There, there, I'll be back soon.

468
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,533
Stay!

469
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,152
Why are we stealing the Dracone now,

470
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,778
instead of under the cover of night?

471
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,582
There is a changing of the guards
in the morning

472
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,488
so it's when the Dracone
is the least defended.

473
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,984
I'm going in alone.

474
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,256
- I want to go with you.
- I need you here.

475
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,059
It is the best place to spot you
when I exit.

476
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,992
You'll then start the signal
to Sangimel.

477
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,400
Inside is all you'll need
for the signal.

478
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,766
How will you get inside?

479
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,139
I grew up here.
I know this castle in all its shadows.

480
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,743
Be careful,
there's Tree People everywhere!

481
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,709
You know I can take care of myself.

482
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,671
Put down the Dracone
and surrender your weapons!

483
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,648
Paxian...

484
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,878
Let go of me!

485
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,381
You aren't in charge here, Princess.

486
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:43,253
I know you! You are the son of Alodor.
I recognize your amulet.

487
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,192
Does that mean
you're gonna let me walk free?

488
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,858
I'm afraid not.

489
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:08,480
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

490
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,751
How insightful of you.

491
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:18,587
You would have made a good queen.
Such a waste.

492
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,594
Why are you doing this?

493
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,890
Augustin is weak.

494
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,393
His kingdom is run by laws,

495
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,999
but no law can control the will of man.

496
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:32,169
All Quilok needed was a little help
from a fiery friend.

497
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,045
You are responsible for the Fire Dragon?

498
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,011
It wasn't hard to do.
The Fire Dragon was hibernating.

499
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,843
All I did was wake it from its sleep.

500
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,515
You are a murderer!

501
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,385
Yes.

502
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,193
Finish her off.

503
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,530
No, no!

504
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,168
- What happened?
- Paxian.

505
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,844
He's been conspiring
with Quilok to destroy my father,

506
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,107
and they're using the dragon
to help their cause.

507
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,682
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

508
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,687
We need to get back to the castle,
to warn my father.

509
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,466
That's one baby that doesn't give
you motherly feeling inside.

510
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,143
What's that?

511
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,815
Another one of Sangimel's inventions.

512
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,111
Given enough time,
he can make almost anything.

513
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,489
What are you doing?

514
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,819
Letting the lce Dragon know
where to find us.

515
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,560
Are you sure about this?

516
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,333
Perhaps we should
take the Dracone back to Carpia.

517
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,528
If it protected Quilok,
it will protect us.

518
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,696
Then the innocent people
in his kingdom would be destroyed.

519
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,241
Is that what you want?

520
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:19,767
You want to be like Quilok?

521
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,406
As long as Sangimel's awoken it,
this will bring it here.

522
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,111
Why?

523
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,043
It senses one of its own kind in danger.

524
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,975
Once we endanger the Dracone,

525
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,384
it sets changes and it sends out
a distress signal.

526
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,817
The lce Dragon will follow it.

527
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,016
The dragons of different species
can't abide one another.

528
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,594
When the lce Dragon sees
the Fire Dragon,

529
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,287
all hell will break loose.

530
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,260
But how can you be sure
that the lce Dragon

531
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,923
will defeat the Fire Dragon?

532
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,430
Sangimel's seen them both.

533
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:47,602
He believes the lce Dragon
to be more powerful.

534
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,036
Is he sure?

535
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,974
That's not something you can measure.

536
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,474
But being more experienced,

537
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,238
I'd be more than happy to defer to him.

538
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,928
How did you allow this to happen?!

539
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,568
We have lost our only protection!

540
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,000
You have put our kingdom
in jeopardy as well.

541
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,438
All right, this is very simple...

542
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,416
Find Gabriel!

543
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,387
Find him and kill him!

544
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,383
Then bring me back the Dracone.

545
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,048
Do you think you can do that for me?

546
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,387
Yes.

547
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,461
Or is the thought of killing
your former Captain's son

548
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,792
a difficult one?

549
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,231
Yes.

550
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,830
Honesty. I like that.

551
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,806
However, if you don't think
that you can bring yourself to kill him,

552
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,309
then kill yourself!

553
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,279
It will make everything easier
on the both of us. Go!

554
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,125
That should be enough. Open the box.

555
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,088
The box is made of lead.

556
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,090
It should block any scent
or sound the Dragon can pick up on.

557
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,430
Don't we want the Dragon
to be able to find it?

558
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:25,857
Not while we're holding it.

559
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:26,997
Right.

560
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,501
We just needed to draw the dragon
to the general area.

561
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,068
Once here, she and the Fire Dragon
will find each other.

562
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,538
Come, we have to move quickly.

563
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,940
Where are we going?

564
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,576
There is an abandoned farm up ahead,
where we can hide.

565
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,210
I can't find Luisa.

566
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,411
Did you ask her maid?

567
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,242
She hasn't seen her since last night.

568
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,513
She wouldn't
have gone out knowing the danger.

569
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,246
Wouldn't she? She's your daughter.

570
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,251
You are the one that told her
she could behave like a man.

571
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,689
This is the price you are paying
for letting her behave like a son,

572
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,762
instead of the princess she should be!

573
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,488
I would never tell her to risk her life.

574
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,599
No! She would do anything
to prove to you

575
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,168
that she's capable of being your heir!

576
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,132
She must have followed Gabriel.

577
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,605
She's out there,
in the midst of all this danger.

578
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,030
We'll have to wait. They are too close.

579
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,186
What about the Dracone?

580
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:09,863
They can't sense him in the lead box.

581
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,725
They will want to kill one another.

582
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,102
We are safer now.

583
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,429
T ry to get some rest.

584
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,196
You'll need it.

585
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,726
So your father always wanted a son?

586
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,656
He wanted a child.

587
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,027
Your father? What did he want?

588
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,229
He wanted his honour back.

589
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,170
My father changed after his dismissal.

590
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,303
Service to his kingdom was
what defined him

591
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,003
and without it he became
more withdrawn.

592
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:01,848
He felt empty and ashamed,
though he didn't need to.

593
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,647
He tried his best to keep it from me.

594
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,479
He still taught me everything
he knew about being a knight.

595
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,225
But even without the title,
I was the son of a knight,

596
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,758
and I should behave as such.

597
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,220
May I ask how he died?

598
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,692
I think he died for having no purpose.

599
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:22,460
He just sort of withered away

600
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,671
He had you,
I am sure that comforted him.

601
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,433
I guess that wasn't enough.

602
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,317
I think he would have been
very proud to see you now.

603
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:42,922
We can go now.

604
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,653
Halt! We've been instructed
to take you prisoners of King Quilok.

605
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,787
Lay down your weapons
or we'll be forced to...

606
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,305
You really want to take your shot?

607
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:12,510
Good choice!

608
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,616
Go back to your village.

609
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:37,703
Hello, Princess!

610
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,632
We have to hurry back to the castle.

611
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:41,966
Oh, you're welcome!

612
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,725
Princess!

613
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,870
Princess!

614
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,706
Princess?

615
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,408
Princess?

616
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:53,976
Your smartest move
would be to turn round and ride home!

617
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,123
You still have time to save your lives!

618
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,509
- Princess, are you all right?
- Yes.

619
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:36,310
Get out of here!

620
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,287
That dragon will be back in a minute.

621
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,913
- We're all going.
- No, no, not without my horse.

622
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:41,851
No!

623
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,853
Look! You go.

624
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,160
I'll hold them off for a while.

625
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,569
Go! Go!

626
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,871
Bye, bye, my boy!

627
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:30,133
My lord, if I may be blunt,
I think we've made a terrible mistake.

628
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,165
Paxian, have you seen Luisa?

629
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,970
I have no idea where she is.
Perhaps with her mother?

630
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:40,606
It's not too late to accept
King Quilok's offer.

631
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,343
Your Highness, wait!

632
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,117
Stubborn oaf!

633
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,009
Luisa! We've been worried sick!

634
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:52,384
Are you all right?

635
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,887
I see you found the Dracone.

636
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,651
Father, Paxian is a traitor.

637
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,557
He's been working
with Quilok all along.

638
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,694
Paxian? Impossible!

639
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,727
It's true.

640
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,159
He nearly killed your daughter.

641
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,929
Gabriel saved me.

642
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,198
He was just here,

643
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,669
trying to convince me to give
in to Quilock.

644
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,075
How could I've been so blind?

645
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,176
- I'll go and find him.
- No.

646
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:23,375
You stay here,
find a way to deal with these dragons.

647
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,953
I'll take care of him myself.

648
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:30,219
Send one of your sentries,
don't go after him yourself.

649
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:33,089
He tried to kill my only child
and he betrayed me.

650
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,197
No. This is my battle.

651
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:48,635
Luisa, you cannot leave.
I cannot lie for you anymore.

652
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:52,172
Please, Luisa,
don't put me in this position!

653
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:57,112
It's my father. I must go.
Please, don't tell my mother.

654
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,184
I must tell her. I'll tell her,
if you don't stop right now.

655
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,223
I have no choice.

656
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,255
And if you don't return?
What it will happen to me?

657
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,727
It will be on my head. Please.

658
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,925
Don't tell my mother.
Things are bad enough already.

659
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,060
Do this for me!

660
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,840
I trusted you!

661
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,409
Spare me the 'how-could-you' monologue!

662
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,621
Your routine became tiresome long ago.

663
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:34,781
How dare you?!

664
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,723
You have always been a weak king.

665
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,960
How much strength does it takes to plan
the murder of innocent people?

666
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,195
You were bound to be destroyed
at some point.

667
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,206
Why not by Quilok?

668
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,010
I'm simply taking what I can.

669
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,054
It's been a while
since I've killed a man,

670
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,083
but this shouldn't be too hard.

671
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,353
You don't have the guts!

672
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,597
I may sped hollo echo
when I pierce your heart.

673
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,073
Finally!

674
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,071
I'll meet you back at the palace

675
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,611
to figure out
how we'll get back the Dracone.

676
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,996
No! Father!

677
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,080
Congratulations, Paxian,

678
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:49,490
you've managed to destroy
our entire plan.

679
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,023
Augustin may be dead,

680
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:55,555
but the kingdom of Carpia
is worth nothing

681
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,933
with all the dragons attacking it.

682
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:02,997
Their kingdom will be destroyed
and our kingdom will be next.

683
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,766
I promise you I will...

684
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,569
Your promises are worthless.

685
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,004
I'll take care of it.

686
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,374
We made a deal: you were to get
your share for getting me their kingdom.

687
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,886
Half of nothing is nothing.
It's nothing.

688
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,385
You have failed miserably.

689
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,884
You think you should be rewarded
for that?

690
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:24,993
Of course not.

691
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,854
But if Gabriel is able to defeat
the lce Dragon,

692
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:30,659
it will all be fine.

693
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,133
Who do you think you are,
telling me what to worry about?!

694
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,500
We need to get back the Dracone,
that is your job.

695
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:41,541
And there is nothing in the world
that will make me help Gabriel.

696
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:45,238
- Nothing!
- Why do you hate him so much?

697
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,580
On his death bed, my father told me

698
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,587
that only by blood did I come
by the throne.

699
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,255
If it were by merit,

700
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,383
he would have given it to Alodor
without hesitation.

701
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,959
You had a simple task:
to conjure the Fire Dragon,

702
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,397
so they would come to us for protection.

703
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:06,465
Where are we now?

704
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,894
I can't believe
that the son has turning up to be

705
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,733
a bigger problem than the father.

706
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,840
How many Robin Hoods
can one family produce?

707
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,673
We don't even know
if their plan will work.

708
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,803
Don't be so sure about that!

709
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:22,406
Gabriel's father has killed
an lce Dragon before

710
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:28,286
and I'm sure that his son probably knows
all of his little tricks.

711
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,120
I want you to go down there,
kill him yourself

712
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,093
and bring me back my Dracone!

713
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,585
Myself?

714
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,198
Pontiero!

715
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,667
Yes, Your Highness.

716
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:47,237
T ake this... worm and track Gabriel.

717
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,036
Make no mistake.

718
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,880
You are worthless to me,
if you fail again.

719
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,786
I will not leave until the King returns.

720
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,116
What is your plan?

721
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,524
First we have to get the dragon away
from the kingdom.

722
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,829
For her own safety,
Luisa should stay here.

723
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,694
You should know by now that Luisa
has a mind of her own.

724
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,959
She doesn't listen to anyone,
but herself.

725
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:13,932
Mother?

726
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,202
Where have you been?

727
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,207
What happened?

728
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:25,275
Where is your father?

729
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,129
It took no time for the lce Dragon
to sweep through our kingdom

730
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,132
and drive a new fear into our people.

731
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,862
With Sangimel dead,

732
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,900
Gabriel had little chances succeeding
on his own.

733
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,602
He had only a story told to him
by his father

734
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,143
of how to kill the beast.

735
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,707
With the pride of a true knight,

736
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,778
he refused to show any fear or doubt

737
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,941
as he began to put a plan into action.

738
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:07,982
I'm coming with you.

739
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,616
No, it's too dangerous.

740
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,955
I have to go. My father is dead.

741
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,698
He's dead because I brought you here.

742
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:19,357
Because I convinced everyone to go along
with this.

743
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,230
Because of me...

744
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,428
Because your father is gone,

745
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,765
is exactly why you and I must be strong.

746
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:30,167
Everybody is looking to us
for decisions and guidance.

747
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:36,781
I want to go with him. I need to.

748
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,080
Then, go!

749
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,523
Let's go!

750
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,804
We have to draw the dragon up
to the mountain of salt.

751
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,996
- What will you do?
- You'll see.

752
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:15,983
Come on!

753
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:23,296
Stop right there!

754
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,895
Hand over the Dracone
and your lives will be spared.

755
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,003
How thoughtful!

756
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,173
Pontiero,
anytime you and your men are ready,

757
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,799
I'll be happy to watch
our new friend die.

758
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:42,108
Pontiero, that was an order
from King Quilok.

759
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,481
See, this man understands that
if we don't defeat the dragon,

760
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,745
we'll all die.

761
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,089
If we're gonna survive,
we have to work together.

762
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,887
I think my position on
that matter is pretty clear.

763
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,352
Yes, it is.

764
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,741
Just so you are clear on my position.

765
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,475
This is where I stand.

766
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,672
Return in side with your King.

767
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,849
Anyone who goes
with them will be killed!

768
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:22,987
T o hell with all of you.

769
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,317
You'll be dead in a few minutes,anyway!

770
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,827
My apologies for not having lived up

771
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,867
to the true spirit of a knight sooner.

772
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,871
I served under your father.
He was a good man.

773
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,900
And wrongly banished.

774
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,075
It was all a fabrication of Quilok.

775
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,879
I should have stood up for him then.

776
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:48,678
Thank you.

777
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,383
Do you know where we're going?

778
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,445
To the salt mine.

779
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:06,528
Queen Remini, your kingdom is mine now!

780
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:12,002
Really? I didn't hear that proclamation.

781
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,816
Do you think it was just bad luck

782
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,292
that brought the Fire Dragon upon you?

783
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,030
I'm not like my father,
who was happy sitting around

784
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,500
and keeping things the way
they've been for hundreds of years.

785
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:45,004
A kingdom, if it's not growing,
is dying.

786
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,474
You bastard!

787
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,581
You did all this?!

788
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:03,690
In moments, your last chance,
your half knight will be dead!

789
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,796
My kingdom will be the only safe
haven for you and your people.

790
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,195
Do you really think we're just going
to roll over

791
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,597
and accept you as our king?

792
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,728
Your naivety is only surpassed
by your stupidity!

793
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,396
Now get the hell out of here!

794
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,475
I like a little bit of spirit
in my queen,

795
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,009
but everything within reason.

796
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,315
Make this easy on yourself.

797
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,187
Besides,
you could have a younger man now.

798
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,285
Come to my...

799
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,125
That was for my husband.

800
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,080
Stay with the soldiers.
They'll protect you.

801
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,375
And who will protect you?
I'm going up there with you.

802
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:07,520
Just listen. Stay here.
This will protect me.

803
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:15,459
If the dragon comes near, fire on it!

804
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,791
Princess, our arrows do no good.

805
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,730
I don't care,
we can't stand here and do nothing.

806
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,008
Is this what you're looking for?

807
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:15,239
Of course. The salt. Salt melts ice.

808
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,553
Come and get it! Come and get it!

809
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:00,932
What's happening?

810
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:38,511
Go get him, quickly!

811
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:34,797
I'm a representative of the King.

812
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:39,400
Let me pass and I promise you
he will remember this favor.

813
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:41,238
No, no!

814
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,272
How are you feeling?

815
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:14,306
Alive.

816
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,774
You sound surprised.

817
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:17,806
I am.

818
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,307
Had I known you were
so confident in your plan,

819
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:22,939
I don't think I would have been
so eager to vouch for you.

820
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,279
Had I've known
that any of us would survive,

821
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,750
I would have asked for more money.

822
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,151
I'm sorry about your father.

823
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,894
- How's the Queen?
- She's a strong woman.

824
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,633
We've already begun rebuilding
and joining the two kingdoms.

825
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,069
Both will be richer and more secure
than ever before.

826
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,030
Good.

827
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,709
The doctor says it will take some time
for you to heal completely.

828
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,815
Yes, but I should be able to ride
within a couple of days.

829
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,011
I don't wish to overstay my welcome.

830
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,119
You're welcome has no limit here.

831
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,785
It's a beautiful kingdom.

832
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,056
Worth saving.

833
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,658
And its people.

834
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,027
Especially its people.

835
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,649
This is a sad day for our kingdom.

836
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,758
But it is also a hopeful one.

837
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,888
Gabriel,
you are exactly the kind of knight

838
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,054
I wish to have leading my court.

839
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,456
I hope you've decided to accept.

840
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,096
It would be my great honor.

841
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,864
And my first request
as Head Knight would be to ask

842
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,496
knight Pontiero to join us.

843
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,108
We could use a knight
with some real experience.

844
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,577
It would be my honor.

845
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,612
Congratulations!

846
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,718
If I may say so, you look different.

847
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,523
I hope that's a good thing.

848
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:10,883
I would say yes.

849
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,156
I guess I had a couple of these
in my closet after all.

850
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:18,128
T oday they seemed more appropriate
than my riding boots.

851
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,226
You look perfect.

852
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,493
That's not to say I won't be riding.

853
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:23,793
Of course not!

854
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:27,202
And I suppose I would be taking orders
from you from now on.

855
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:28,870
It's about time.

856
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,219
Once news of Gabriel's success spread,

857
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,289
Iife as we had known it slowly returned
to Carpia,

858
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:44,955
the dragons were gone,

859
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:48,491
Quilok was gone,
and we began rebuilding both kingdoms

860
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,895
into one land without fear of
either kind of beast.

861
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:55,568
My mother filled my father's shoes
with grace and dignity

862
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,864
and ruled with the same fair hand
that he had ruled with.

863
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,333
As for me, she never stopped
trying to arrange

864
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,241
every detail of my future
the way she wanted it.

865
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:08,805
Only this time for once my mother
and I agreed.

866
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,745
What do you think of those two?

867
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,280
- May I speak freely?
- Always.

868
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,283
I think they are
both incredible stubborn

869
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,654
and incredible brave.

870
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,990
Two qualities necessary
to survive marriage.

871
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:25,131
I feel as like my mother is watching us.

872
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:27,566
Yes.

873
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,698
What does she expect to see?

874
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,904
It's like every time I'm sitting
with a young man

875
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,305
she wants me to kiss him,
right then and there.

876
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,338
Every time?

877
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,137
How many men
have you been inviting over?

878
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,175
Don't start!

879
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,980
I didn't. You did.

880
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:57,930
T o the valiant men and women
who've helped save our people,

881
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,827
both those who are among us

882
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,994
and those who now occupy our memories.

883
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:07,240
T o Sangimel, without whom
we'd be truly not be here.

884
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:09,201
T o our King.

885
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,944
T o my King, who will always be
our guiding light

886
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,482
down the road we now travel upon,
without him.
