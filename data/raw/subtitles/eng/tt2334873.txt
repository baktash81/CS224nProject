Okay.

165

Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe

166
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,792
I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,072
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

168
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,958
And the lawyers.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,792
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

170

I was so anxious

174
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,519
about moving here.
Yeah?

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,435
I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
Oh, well...

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,518
Another drink? We're celebrating.
Of course, yeah.

177
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,990
Oh, the flight was bumpy.
Uh-huh.

178
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,352
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

179
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,393

I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

182
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,315
Isn't first class a fortune?
Yes, I was quite shocked.

183
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,433
I thought you were tapped out.
I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

184
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,830
I've run up some serious debts.

185
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,832
So how did you fly first class?

186
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,914
I don't know, Ginger. I just did.

187
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,871
All I meant was, if you've got no money,
to go first class...

188
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,878
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,152

at my luggage?

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,510
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

191

You told me you had to sell everything.
Look, look, look.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,388
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

193
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,956
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

194
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,991
God, I hate to tell you about that.

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,432
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef

196
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,672
until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell,

197
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,030
and then it seems
you can't give it away.

00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,151
We got 200,000 bucks.

318
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,715
Oh, that's fantastic.

319
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,996
I thought I'd drop dead.
That's great.

320
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,237
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

321
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,032
He was shaking when we won.

322
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,233
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell
her, this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

323
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,078
Congratulations.
Yeah.

324
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,392
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

325
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,191
Well, if you like, I think Hal could
probably help you do better.

326
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,389
Yeah?

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,236
You know... You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to...

328
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,553
Hey, come on. We don't know the first
thing about money, but he does.

329
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,116
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

330
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,238
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

331

333

I'm talking about 20 percent.

Profitable enough?
20 percent?

He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

336
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,432
You mean, not starting
my own business.

337
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,955
No, we mean investing with Hal.

338

Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

339
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,909
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

The hotel deal or something.

342
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,715
It'd be great for them.
Make a killing.

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,952
Pay attention, Augie.
I'm paying attention.

344
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,070
You will make money for them,
won't you?

345

I make money, they make money.

God, they're hard work.

I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

I've got that luncheon to plan,

the fundraiser

I've rented them a limo

to the South Street Seaport.

He works with me.

I gotta get a beer.

You want a beer?
Can I buy you a drink?

I have a drink, but thank you.
I'm dropping dead of hunger.

You like clams, Jasmine?

483
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,118
No, no, no. I'm not hungry.

Let me see. What is this?

485
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,989

Martini.

Hey, listen, I just...
I want you to know,

790
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,197
it's great when a grown-up continues
with their education. Not for nothing.

791
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:37,077
Well, my goal is to study
interior decorating online.

792
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,676
Why don't you just go
to decorator school?

793
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,514
Well, I have to use my days
to work and pay my way.

794
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,837
As Hal said, "It's not
the money, it's the money."

795
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,834
Yeah, okay, but, you know, life
ain't all work and no play, right?

796
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,918
Ginger says between work
and school, you're cracking up.

797
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,230
Hey, why don't you shut up?
No, no.

798
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,591
I'll admit, it's been very trying,

799
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,400
but I'm determined
to make something of myself.

800
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,639
You don't like working with the dentist?
No, I do not.

801
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,792
<font color="#808080">CHILI:</font> Well, Ginger said you're
not used to working a job.

802
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,514
Well, in that respect,
I was very fortunate.

803
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,478
He was a handsome guy
with money.

804
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,030
He was a smooth talker and pampered her.
What's she gonna say, no?

805
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,229
Uh...

806
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,953
I got it.

807
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,672
Why does it have to be a decorator?
Why can't you pick something else?

808
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,708
What would you want me to do?

809
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,633
Do you want me to wait tables?
Bag groceries?

810
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,791
Hey, Ginger bags groceries.

811
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,073
Well, Ginger and I are
completely different people.

812
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,918
Yeah, she got the good genes.

813
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,795
It's not genetic. You can't always
blame everything on your genes.

814
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,634
If you're prepared to work hard
and not settle...

815
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,155
What, you mean Augie?
She means me.

816
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,474
Oh. Who do I have to sleep with around here
to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?

817
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,399
<font color="#808080">JASMINE:</font> Oh.

818
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,998
That's what I...

819
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,519
What...? What...?
Oh, Christ, I can't remember.

820
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,918
So Chili was telling me that you used to
have a really nice collection of cars.

821
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,599
Oh, yes, my husband did.

822
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,432
He used to collect vintage
Bentleys and Mercedes.

823
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,996
<font color="#808080">DAVE:</font> Wow, those are expensive cars.
Yes, they are.

824
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,795
You know, having wealth
is nothing to be ashamed of.

825
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,709
We were very civic-minded.
Yeah, with other people's money.

826
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,679
This guy lost every penny
of Ginger's money.

827
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,111
I tried to bring my sister
and her husband in on a good thing.

828
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,794
I mean, what do I know
about financial schemes?

829
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,515
You'll be very happy to know
that I lost every cent of my own money.

830
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,433
You know, every home,
every stick of furniture,

831
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,200
every fur, every ring
and every bank account,

832
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,318
and still it wasn't enough
to placate the government.

833
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,353
Her husband was a slick operator.
I was there a week,

834
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,190
I knew he was hitting on her girlfriend.
I really need to study.

835
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,869
I need some peace, okay?
<font color="#808080">GINGER:</font> Okay.

836
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,590
I'm not gonna make it
if you turn this place into a nightclub.

837
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,832
I can't. I just can't.
<font color="#808080">GINGER:</font> All right, all right, all right.

What? Main event's not on yet.

839
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,473
Out.
I'm not leaving now.

840
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,114
You know,
she's right about you, Chili.

841
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,511
You drink, you become a jerk.
What about her? She's drink...

842
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,790
Jerk? Come here.
Heh.

843
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,756
I'm sorry I don't drive a Bentley.

844
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,753
Let's go to the bar.
<font color="#808080">GINGER:</font> Bye. Thank you for coming.

845
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,598
Good night.

846
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,231
Jesus, it's a mess.
Oh, I'm sorry.

847
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,275
Ginger, I'm really... I don't...
I don't know what came over me.

848
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,308
But I have told you before, your taste
in men leaves a lot to be desired.

849
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,915
Yeah, I know these are
not your kind of guys.

850
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,799
I mean, God, don't you wanna
meet some decent man?

851
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,793
You know, someone
who can take you out of this...

852
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,508
What? This hole?

853
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,870
Yeah, I know
what you think of it here.

854
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,435
I mean, you've got two kids.

855
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,712
You can do better than Chili
and his drunken loser friends.

856
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,993
If I thought I could do better, I would.
So far no one's beating my door down.

857
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,038
You know, he's sexy
and he doesn't steal.

858
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,633
Okay, okay. Do you always have to
make those stupid sarcastic digs?

<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

860
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,072
I'm scared, Hal.

861
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,676
Paula said the reason Howard
is leaving Global innovations

862
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,913
is he's not comfortable with business
practices from a legal standpoint.

863
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,156
Howard Trask is such a pussy.
No, no...

864
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,228
What do you think I have lawyers for?
He didn't wanna wind up in jail.

865
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,149
Jail? Jesus.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

866
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,670
If I back out now, I hate to tell you
how much money we'd lose.

867
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,475
It's like a domino effect.
One thing would follow the other.

868
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,996
Hey, let me deal with it, okay?

869
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,953
Is there anything you want
that you don't have?

870
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,673
Is there?

871
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,274
No.

872
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,517
So stop worrying
and let me spoil you.

873
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,996
No, I agree. I mean, Howard
always was a prissy mama's boy.

874
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,679
Yeah, mama's boy.
That's the perfect phrase.

875
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,800
Okay, how about Tuesday
the 22nd at 9?

876
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,673
I can't make 9.
How about the afternoon?

877
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,350
All right, 2, 3?

878
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,189
I can't make the 22nd.
How about the 21 st?

879
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,233
We have nothing open on the 21 st.
Good night.

880
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,993
Well, he wants me in a week.

881
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,192
Well, another day or two won't matter.
How about the 24th?

882
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,152
Fine. Oh, wait, no.
Go for 9?

883
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,590
That's my colonoscopy prep day.

884
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,358
That's always very special.

885
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,359
Why don't you think about it
and call me?

886
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,519
Before you go,
can you call Dr. Girsback

887
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,678
and tell him I read the x-rays
and we can talk later?

888
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,916
Sure.
No, no, no.

889
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,037
When you're done,
when you're done.

890
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,232
When you're finished.
Thank you.

891
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,557
Are you feeling more
comfortable in the job?

892
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,396
I hope you're pleased, because I
am determined to make it work.

893
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,838
It fits in perfectly with my class.
Are you getting better on the computer?

894
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,989
Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student
there, but another girl helps me, so...

895
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,074
I'm glad you're relaxing
more into this job.

896
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,871
I'm trying.
Heh, I must say, I like having you around.

00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,435
Thank you.
Since you started working here,

898
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,355
have you noticed I've been wearing
more colorful neckties? Heh, heh.

899
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,116
I...
Since you... I'm just... Just joking.

Can I make a confession?

901

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,397

00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,991
arousing.

Really? I don't think I dress
in the slightest provocatively.

907
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,316
Does it upset you if I tell you
that I, um, find you attractive?

908

Dr. Flicker, where is all this talk
leading? Well, I'm not the kind of person

909
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,798
who likes to beat around the bush.
I find you a very alluring woman.

910
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,510
I'm flattered, but I certainly hope
that's not why you hired me.

A certain elegance in a woman
has always been enticing to me.

912
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,359
I shouldn't be hearing this.
No, don't be upset.

913
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,717
I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?
Don't be upset.

914
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,118
Really, I think if you get to know me,
you'd come out of your shell more.

915

I'm not in a shell.

Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?
No.

917
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,077
It would remove your inhibitions.
I don't have inhibitions.

918
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,355
Stop.
Oh, Dr. Flicker.

919
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,989
Stop being standoffish.
I'm not standoffish.

920
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,714
You should be proud.
You've made a conquest.

Oh, Dr. Flicker.

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,148

otherwise nothing happens.

948

Then you blame everything but yourself. No,
I want to. It's not that I don't want to.

949
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,872
Can I bring my sister?
For moral support? Absolutely.

950
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,672
And Tony and I will be there.

You'll have fun.
It's a huge party.

952
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,596
Maybe you'll get lucky.

Oh, we'll find you something.

Oh, God, I haven't shown my face
socially in so long.

956

Sharon said there could be
some eligible men there.

957

I haven't been to a party in years.
You know, Chili hates them.

958

What are you doing out here?

I was having lunch in Southampton
and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.

962

Oh, hi. Hal Francis.
This is my wife. Honey?

Jasmine.
Hello.

964
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,998
Amy will be handling your contracts for
Empire Solutions and Global innovations.

965
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,794
She's brilliant. We couldn't
have done any better.

966
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,798
We should get together
on that Empire Solutions thing.

Free on Tuesday?
I'll make sure I am.

That's great.

969
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,400
Are you having an affair
with Amy?

970
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,318
Amy, my lawyer?
Don't give me that. She's very pretty.

Someone made a remark.
What remark?

973
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,276
They saw you having lunch with her.
Taking her hand.

974
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,994
Oh, what crap. Who told you that?
I know who.

975
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,959
That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?
Were you?

976
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,913
I had a business lunch with Amy
at the Four Seasons.

977
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,236
Lydia was there.
Did you take her hand?

978
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,519
You think if I was having an affair,
I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?

979
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,280
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes you drink at lunch.

980
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,714
Maybe you were high.

981
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,191
It's obvious she's got crush on you.
You're building a case.

982
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,318
If you were having an affair,
I would be pretty upset.

983
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,034
Well, I'm not,
so don't get your temper up.

984
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,437
I'm just jealous because I love you.
You should be flattered.

I have no idea.
Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.

Well, they're not very wide.

You know?

1297
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,397
You should babysit. I used to
babysit when I was a teenager.

It's how you make extra money.

1299

Mom said you never did any work,
because you were so rich.

Well, I didn't know
what I wanted to become.

1301
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,518
And Hal, my husband,
he swept me off my feet.

You know the song "Blue Moon."

Yeah, but I always wanted
to do something with my life.

1304
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,835
You know, I had energy.

1305
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,278
I didn't just shop and lunch
and go to matinees.

1306
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,755
You know, I ran charities
for poor people

1307
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,197
and, you know, raised some money
for museums and schools.

1308
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,472
You know, with wealth
comes responsibilities.

1309
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,396
I wasn't just some mindless consumer
like so many of my so-called friends.

1310
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,036
Though I won't say
I dislike buying pretty clothes.

01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,350
Tip big, boys.

1312
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,720
Tip big, because you get good service
and they count on tips.

1313
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:30,117
You know, someday
when you come into great wealth,

1314
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,316
you must remember to be generous.

1315
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,757
Mom said you used to be okay,
but you got crazy.

1316
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,956
Yeah, and then you talked
to yourself.

1317
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,996
Well, there's only so many traumas
a person can withstand

1318
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,596
until they take to the streets
and start screaming.

1319
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,272
That's right, boys, they picked me up
on the street talking to myself

1320
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,273
and gave me something
called Edison's Medicine.

1321
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,238
Why Edison?

1322
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,433
Because they use electricity
to get you thinking straight.

1323
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,398
See, everything unraveled so quickly.

1324
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,229
You know, I started experiencing
anxiety and claustrophobia

1325
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,436
and this acute fear of death.

1326
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,673
You know, I had nightmares
and a nervous breakdown.

1327
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,957
I mean, you must have heard
of Prozac and lithium.

1328
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,311
Well, all those drugs
just made me worse.

1329
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,318
Of course, you know,
I probably did suspect

1330
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:31,553
that not everything Hal did
was always 100-percent aboveboard.

1331
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,115
Christ, I mean,
you'd have to be an idiot

1332
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,438
not to think his phenomenal success
was too good to be true. Heh, heh, heh.

1333
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,110
But a cheat is a cheat.

1334
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,630
And when he had other women,
I just flipped out.

1335
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,077
You know, and one thing led
to another and...

1336
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,436
But that's all history, boys.

1337
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,956

1343
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,030
Mm. And the moon will
look incredible through it.

1344

Sure.
You ever think

1347
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,755
you could see yourself
married to me?

1348
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,713
Married?

1349
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,948
I have it all planned, but obviously
you can say no if it sounds terrible.

1350
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,556
All right? But you come with me
next month to Vienna.

1351
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,672
We live there for a few years
and I can teach you to waltz.

1352
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,872
And you can have all the chocolate
cake and wine you want.

1353
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:54,036
And then we come back and I get
serious about my political dream.

1354
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,834
And then we adopt kids
and we live in the house

1355
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,510

a fantastic job making beautiful.

1356
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,909

is you have to stand next to me

1357
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,192
and smile at photo ops
when I throw my hat in the ring.

1358
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,995
So you're saying you love me.
Can't you tell?

1359
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,153
I hope I didn't cause you to become ill
over the prospect of being my wife.

1360
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,352
You know, sometimes I get
these headaches.

1361
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,915
You always take Xanax
for a headache?

1362
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,676
I'll admit, my heart's beating a little
fast. Yeah. Ooh, your hands are shaking.

She's cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.

1382
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,630
You told me that yourself.
I need space.

1383
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,110
Just give me some space, okay?

1384
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,436
I can't sleep.

You know what he doesn't do?

1394
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,672

Hi.

1401
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,358
You seem up.

1402
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,149
He's taking me to pick out
an engagement ring tomorrow.

1403
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,834
Wow. How great.
What's that smell?

1404
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,799
Did you break a bottle of perfume?
Oh.

1405
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,799
Al doesn't call it perfume,
he calls it a fragrance.

1406
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,718
That's sweet.
But if I may say,

1407
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,316
you may have doused yourself
a little over-abundantly with it.

The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.

1429

Hal left his Rolex there.

1430
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,874
But he told me that he was going
on a business trip to Chicago.

1431
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,389
If he'd said Paris,
I would've gone along,

1432

about, so I did some checking and...
