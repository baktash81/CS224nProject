1
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,799
We are the shadows

2
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,052
and the smoke, we rise.

3
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,477
We are the ghosts that hide...

4
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,523
...in the night.

5
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,763
Don't shoot me.

6
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,606
Who is that?

7
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,734
There's your money. Release the hostages.

8
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,943
How much in there?

9
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,780
- Three.
- You're too late. We want $5 million.

10
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,242
Fuck, it's humid!

11
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,456
Last chance!

12
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,249
Take it or leave it.

13
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,626
All at ease!

14
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,420
Take a seat, Gunner.

15
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,881
Hey, you're all cannon and no balls!

16
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,342
We want the money now!

17
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,136
- Warning shot.
- No!

18
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,308
A little low.

19
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,232
Lights out!

20
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,099
I'll kill him! I swear I'll kill him!

21
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,185
If I were you,
I'd take this opportunity to leave.

22
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,479
What's your call? You stayin'?

23
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,567
Yeah, we tried.

24
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,945
I'll kill them all! I don't care.

25
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,864
There's more fools in this world
than people. So back off, cuz.

26
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,282
You back off!

27
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,620
You know, you're gonna be dead anyway.
So I'm gonna shut up.

28
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,957
Last chance. Let the hostages go

29
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,543
or you're out of there.

30
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,837
Bring the money here to me.

31
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,714
I need the money myself.

32
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
I'll take the four on the left.

33
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,176
Oh, here we go.

34
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,470
Why don't you take the two on the right
and leave the rest alone?

35
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,722
I'll kill them all!

36
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,391
You should take the two on the right.
You're not that fast anymore.

37
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,351
The only thing faster is lightning.

38
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,563
"Light!" Get original!

39
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,859
Bullets go faster than blades.

40
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,610
We'll see.

41
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,530
Bring the money here! Now!

42
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,407
You want the money?

43
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,618
Go get it.

44
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,579
Kill them!

45
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,962
- I call that a tie.
- Come on, keep dreaming.

46
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,797
A little compassion, folks.

47
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,507
You know, I don't think
you hit one of them.

48
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,342
I don't see any knives, actually.

49
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,096
Three million doesn't buy much nowadays.

50
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,681
How are you guys doing?

51
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,853
- What the hell is he doing?
- Hanging a pirate.

52
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,521
Don't be ridiculous.

53
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,275
Gunner! What are you doing?

54
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,277
Hanging a pirate!

55
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,739
- That is seriously demented.
- This is no good.

56
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,450
Not that you'd feel it,
but put one in Speed Racer's shoulder.

57
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,452
- You're on your own.
- Appreciate it.

58
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,120
It's good to have friends.

59
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,955
- Gunner.
- Yeah?

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,291
This isn't how we work. Let him go.

61
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,543
Why? He'd do it to us.

62
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,046
You know what you're doing
is a little crazy, right?

63
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,130
That's his problem.

64
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,299
It's your problem, too. It's a little sick.

65
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,596
Hey, don't touch my money.

66
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,015
Gunner, last chance.

67
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,017
Let him go or we're letting you go.

68
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,561
It's good to hang pirates.
Old Viking custom.

69
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,855
It isn't an old Viking custom at all.

70
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,667
We don't kill like that.

71
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,752
Yeah? Not polite enough?

72
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
- Let him go, Gunner.
- How are you doing, Barney?

73
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,424
Pretty good.

74
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,593
My partner here kicked me
with steel-tipped boots.

75
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,512
- Can you believe that?
- You deserved it.

76
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,139
I think I'll need stitches.

77
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,265
Maybe.

78
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,809
- I hate stitches.
- Everyone does.

79
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,145
Let him go, Gunner.

80
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,354
Let him go?

81
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,523
Let him go.

82
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,543
- Think he's cool?
- Go.

83
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,226
Gunner, you cool?

84
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,522
Yeah.

85
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,577
No, keep it.

86
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,705
You appreciate a good blade.

87
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,754
Coming!

88
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,301
Who is it?

89
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,971
Someday you'll find a man
who'll be happy just to watch you sleep.

90
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,187
- Hi. I didn't know you were back.
- Hey, babe.

91
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,273
Yeah, I just arrived.

92
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,525
- Hey.
- You look great.

93
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,278
I wish you would have called.

94
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,405
I've never been a good caller.

95
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,283
I haven't heard from you in over a month.

96
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,785
Really? Time flies, huh?

97
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,038
Won't happen again! Sorry.

98
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,791
But I do have a surprise.

99
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,878
Rose-flavored. Your favorite.

100
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,216
And I did have something else for you.

101
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,722
It's something I picked up from Burma.

102
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,390
It's a ruby.

103
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,729
It's a good color,
but it's hard to see in this light.

104
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,442
This kind of looked a little shinier
when I bought it in the shop, you know?

105
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,403
Lace, everything all right?

106
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,867
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

107
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:31,954
He's a friend.

108
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,331
Kind of late. You got a name?

109
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,586
Friend. She just told you.

110
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,382
Lee, come on.

111
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,884
Don't leave like this. Lee, I'm sorry.

112
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,886
I thought things were good between us.

113
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,265
I felt like you never cared about getting
in my life or letting me into yours.

114
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,975
- Stop.
- Yeah, sure I did.

115
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,772
No. Not the way two people who are
serious about each other do.

116
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,525
I have known you for over a year and a half,

117
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,652
and I don't even know
what you do for a living.

118
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,363
What's it matter?
When I'm here, I'm with you. That matters.

119
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,242
That matters, but when you're here,
you're not really here.

120
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,704
Okay? You don't talk to me.
You don't open up to me.

121
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,330
I have no idea what you're feeling.

122
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,042
You bring me presents.
They're beautiful presents but I want you!

123
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,336
You're a good man. I love you, but...

124
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,964
- Lace!
- I hate his voice.

125
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,508
- Did you say something?
- Don't let him come down here.

126
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,634
Did you say something?

127
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,846
- Do not let...
- Paul, just give me a second, okay?

128
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,356
Lee, I'm sorry.

129
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,192
Please tell me you understand
what I'm saying.

130
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,154
- You have to understand.
- I understand.

131
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,199
- You take care.
- Take care.

132
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,247
He's no good, Lace.

133
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,204
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

134
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,376
This is my friend...

135
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,544
What's your name again, baby?

136
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,046
- Cheyenne.
- Cheyenne.

137
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,215
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Cherokee, Pawnee.

138
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,217
You want a drink?

139
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm good.

140
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,846
Why don't you run upstairs

141
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,226
and get me one of them
super-duper six-olive martinis, baby?

142
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,977
- Anything for you, baby.
- You got it.

143
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,399
- Got a crush on me.
- Like the last 50.

144
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,109
Hey, brother, who's counting?

145
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,820
- Damn, you look good.
- Look at you.

146
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,863
You look like a goddamn
cold piece of steel, brother.

147
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:16,243
Yeah, well.
Okay, my friend, let's finish this bird up.

148
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,372
Well, let's do it, bro. It's taken you
a couple of years to do a couple of letters.

149
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,919
We had to get rid of Gunner.

150
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,673
Well, he went Crankenstein on your ass.
You got to cut him loose.

151
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,049
You wanna fill in?

152
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,843
Let me tell you something.

153
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,803
Remember where we was last time?

154
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,722
Where were we?
We were ass-deep in that mud and blood.

155
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,142
- Nigeria.
- Yeah, your hand was all shot to shit.

156
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,311
You were bleeding all over the place,
and I was bleeding,

157
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,897
and you know what I did?
I promised myself,

158
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,360
I don't wanna die all alone,
full of holes in the mud and blood.

159
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,448
I'm gonna die with something that counts.
I'm gonna die with a woman.

160
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,868
I wanna die with someone
who cares about me, you know.

161
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,953
I don't wanna die for a woman.

162
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,122
I wanna die laying next to a woman.
That's what I want.

163
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,127
- It's Christmastime.
- Yeah, I can smell him from here.

164
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,594
Mr. Christmas. How you doing, brother?

165
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,930
I'm good, Tool.

166
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,724
How's the missus?

167
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,518
Yeah, all good.

168
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,437
Oh, good.

169
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,774
So, take a look. What do you think?

170
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,820
It still looks like a black chicken.

171
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,324
Black chicken?

172
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:42,537
Man. It's good to see you, brother. Miss you.

173
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,332
You're looking very beige tonight.
What's up?

174
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,750
The usual.

175
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,794
- All good?
- Yeah.

176
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,420
I got a great idea.

177
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,089
Why don't you let me doodle, like, a...

178
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,801
Charlotte's web on your head?
On the top of your head.

179
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,511
You know, something different,
something exciting.

180
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,472
'Cause you got one of them
perfectly-shaped domed, muscular heads.

181
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
I could put a web on the top of the head.

182
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,896
Maybe a pregnant Charlotte
coming out of your ear,

183
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,316
peeking around,
making sure them bugs don't come inside.

184
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,860
Her long leg dangling down your neck.

185
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,696
- Yeah. Sexy, right?
- Very sexy.

186
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,074
He looks thrilled.

187
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:23,119
Well. Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm feeling a little lucky tonight.

188
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,956
I'm feeling very accurate.

189
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,875
- Another time. Come on.
- Come on, take him on.

190
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,877
Come on, Christmas. Bring it, baby.

191
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,337
Don't encourage him, please.

192
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,505
He never beat you in your life.

193
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,882
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing.

194
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,940
Yes?

195
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,112
Yeah.

196
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay.

197
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,245
Well, I got three pieces of work.

198
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,875
Two a walk in the park,
and one to hell and back.

199
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,752
- I need some time alone.
- Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting.

200
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,687
Now we can see inside of him.

201
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,690
And I see lies.

202
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,695
He wasn't stealing from you.
He was stealing from us both.

203
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,324
You want your apes' respect?
Snuff those two.

204
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,423
Let's just keep it simple.

205
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,675
If the money's right,
we don't care where the job is.

206
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,760
- Got it?
- Let's quit jerking off,

207
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,721
get down to business, see who's hungry.

208
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,223
I know your real name's
probably not Barney Ross.

209
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,684
You don't need to know my name.

210
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:36,229
The only thing you need to know is
the job's real and the money's real.

211
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,732
But since we're in this nice place,

212
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,152
you might as well just call me Mr. Church.

213
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,071
Okay, Church. What can I do for you?

214
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,575
In a minute.
I'm still waiting for one more guy.

215
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,743
Who?

216
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,714
You know him?

217
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,758
Yeah, we used to be
on the same team together.

218
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,801
What's my oldest, worst friend doing here?

219
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,429
Both of your names came
to the top of the list.

220
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,765
- Is that a problem?
- Yeah.

221
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,767
Should've shot him when I had the chance.

222
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,226
Big Barney Ross.

223
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,312
Bigger Trench mouse.

224
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,774
- What are you doing? Praying for work?
- Could be.

225
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,150
Have you been sick?

226
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,527
- You've lost weight.
- Really?

227
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,197
Whatever weight I lost, you found, pal.

228
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,242
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each other's dicks, are you?

229
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,334
Let's get down to business,
see who wants the work.

230
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,377
You ever hear of an island called Vilena?

231
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,004
- No.
- Yeah.

232
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,382
It's a little island in the Gulf.

233
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,634
That's right.

234
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,345
- You should read more.
- Thanks.

235
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,266
There are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in.

236
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,895
But a general by the name of Garza
has overthrown the half-ass government.

237
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,772
That's right.

238
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,025
My people are having a problem
with this fanatic Garza.

239
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,319
- So you want Garza gone?
- I want him dead.

240
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,404
All it takes is a little army.

241
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,864
Only an idiot would do this job.

242
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,450
- How much?
- Oh, like I said.

243
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,540
I'm busy anyway,
so give this job to my friend here.

244
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,166
He loves playing in the jungle.

245
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,668
- Right?
- Right.

246
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,295
Hey, why don't we have dinner?

247
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,505
Sure. When?

248
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,841
- In a thousand years.
- Too soon.

249
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,680
- What's his fucking problem?
- He wants to be president.

250
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,935
I got to recon this island first.

251
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,020
I'll have a contact for you on the island.

252
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,566
Good riddance.

253
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,485
I got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job,

254
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,696
so our fee is $5 mil.

255
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,699
- $5 mil?
- And I want half upfront,

256
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,284
and the other half in an offshore account.

257
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:57,537
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

258
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,500
What I have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over.

259
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,339
So if you take this money
and you don't deliver,

260
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,385
me and my people

261
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,597
are gonna come get you and your people

262
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:20,226
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats.

263
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,812
You got a problem with that?

264
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,195
Let's talk.

265
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,754
Whoever stood you up sounds bad.

266
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,214
Yeah, but it will pay good.

267
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,674
Yeah, well, money aside.
What happened to your code?

268
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,759
What code's that?

269
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,969
"The target has to deserve it."

270
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,931
That was canceled due to lack of interest.

271
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,519
- You're dark. Dark and cold.
- You noticed.

272
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,272
- And I ain't buying into that, by the way.
- You will.

273
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,237
Stick around, young man, you will.

274
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,660
Vilena.

275
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Next job?

276
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,338
They got work there?

277
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,802
Come on.

278
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,845
You know you shouldn't be here, Gunner.

279
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,847
Don't replace me.

280
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,308
I'm good.

281
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,436
I'm still good.

282
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,438
You're still using.

283
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,148
I can't trust you anymore, man.

284
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,486
- You can't trust me?
- Hmm.

285
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,783
You can't trust me?

286
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,326
I can't.

287
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,206
You can't trust me?

288
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,883
Be careful.

289
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,427
You threatening me, Gunner?

290
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,056
Nah, I'm a nice guy.

291
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,651
So, going over the info
this guy Church gave me,

292
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,612
there's probably about
6,000 people on the island.

293
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,197
How many soldiers?

294
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,657
Maybe a couple of hundred.

295
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,828
It wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small.

296
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,079
You do know that.

297
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,832
Great, they've got a small army.

298
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,167
What do we got?

299
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,501
Four and a half men.

300
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,296
That smells disgusting.

301
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,799
Disgusting? Chicken gumbo is bad,

302
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,678
but eating on rats and gorilla nipples,
that's delicious?

303
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,513
Not so funny.

304
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,099
- I need a raise.
- Why?

305
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,768
I need more money for my son.

306
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:08,561
I want to send him to a better school.

307
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,064
- Did Yin Yang get a family?
- I have no idea.

308
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,024
You don't ask, I don't tell.

309
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,235
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

310
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,446
That's the way it's gonna be.

311
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,032
Now the target on this island
is a guy named General Garza.

312
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,077
- What's the problem?
- Who gives a shit what the problem is?

313
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,829
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

314
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,957
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

315
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,086
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

316
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,256
- This morning.
- Yeah? What'd you talk about?

317
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,428
Avoidant personality disorder.

318
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,638
You think too much.

319
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:47,517
You know, Toll Road, you're a great guy,
a little fucked up, no doubt about it,

320
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,394
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

321
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,646
- Yeah.
- You're talking about my ear.

322
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,940
Come on. Don't start with the ear again.

323
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,233
- Not the ear story.
- The ear story, not again.

324
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,360
- We all know the ear story.
- We don't want to hear the ear story.

325
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,862
- We all know I wrestled in college.
- Right.

326
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:04,450
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

327
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,162
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

328
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,415
and forms cauliflower ears.

329
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,127
My college roommate used to bring up
my ear configuration all the time.

330
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,130
Parties, social events, you name it.

331
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,924
That didn't really bother me all that much
because he's usually bragging about

332
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,760
how my ears are a badge of courage.

333
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,972
- Made me a little less self-conscious.
- Of course it would.

334
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,723
But that was short-lived.

335
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,769
One morning, during spring break,
I hear him on the phone, bagging on me,

336
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,021
talking about my "queer ear."

337
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,650
You see something funny?

338
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,026
Sorry, go ahead.

339
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:43,614
So I realize I'd become the brunt of a joke
simply because I look a little bit different.

340
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,492
So I decided to educate my roommate

341
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,037
on the common decency that should be
afforded people who look a little different.

342
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,332
I smashed him upside his goddamn head!

343
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,168
Several times.

344
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,005
Until he had a little cluster
of cauliflower all his own.

345
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,717
- And your point is?
- It ain't easy being green.

346
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,679
The fuck you think I'm talking about?

347
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,060
Anyway, me and Christmas
are gonna head down to Vilena

348
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,229
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job.

349
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,024
How much we get paid?
I need more money for my family.

350
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,568
What fucking family are you talking about?

351
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,030
My family.

352
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,365
You know, don't ask.

353
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,050
Listen, that girl wasn't your type.

354
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,593
Her loss, right?

355
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,762
I should have broke that bastard's jaw.

356
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,555
Maybe you were lucky.
He could have broke yours.

357
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,476
- Impossible.
- You know, Christmas, I understand,

358
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,562
but let's just say you were with her
for a couple of hours,

359
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,481
and it's nice, and it's hot and heavy,

360
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,358
but after that, think about it.

361
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,318
What do you do for the rest of the day?

362
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,529
She probably did you a favor.

363
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,240
Now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself.

364
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,784
You're a bleak bastard.

365
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,851
Morning. Morning.

366
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,897
Morning! Speak English?

367
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,318
Big plane, huh?

368
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,238
Yeah, we use it to transport
injured animals.

369
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,824
- Why are you here?
- Ornithologists.

370
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,452
We're photographing exotic birds.

371
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,882
You're nervous?

372
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,216
Nervous?

373
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,762
No. Why?

374
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,555
You just look nervous.

375
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,974
I'm not nervous. Do I look nervous?

376
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,519
Your skin looks a little dry.

377
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,146
That's because of the altitude.

378
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,733
Well, it's not the altitude.
You fly with the window open all the time.

379
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,027
- Dehydration.
- Yeah, it is dehydration.

380
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,864
But there's ways to get around that.
There's new skin, it's like stem cell research.

381
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,200
You are looking handsome.
Don't worry about it.

382
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,077
- You're jealous?
- I'm a little jealous. Yeah.

383
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,995
You're younger.
You have youth on your side.

384
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,291
Overall, I'm happy to be myself. Are you?

385
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,377
- So you're done.
- Done.

386
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,962
- Good to know you.
- Good to know you.

387
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,381
Yeah, we do this all the time.

388
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,050
We kid ourselves.
That's how we stay awake on the plane.

389
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,843
I'm the only one who stays awake
on the plane.

390
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,179
- He's always sleeping.
- Yeah, you're right.

391
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,763
- What's the address?
- Yeah, it's in my head.

392
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,890
Do you wanna share it?

393
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,435
It's the Gloria Cantina.

394
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,438
So actually, Cantina Gloria in Spanish.

395
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,982
Spanish. Who are you, Zorro?

396
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,110
Army.

397
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,486
- Shit.
- Come on.

398
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,821
In there.

399
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,467
- You rolling?
- No, I'm on holiday.

400
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,764
You, you, move the truck!

401
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,936
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit.

402
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,271
Got him.

403
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,906
Look at these clowns,
hand-picked monkeys.

404
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,501
What's wrong with this picture?

405
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,463
Everything.

406
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,507
Let's get out of here.

407
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,343
No, that's the point, you know.

408
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,887
You think you know someone,
and you truly do not.

409
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,973
Aren't you the guy who said,
"The man who best gets along with women

410
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,017
"is the man who can
get along without them"?

411
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,936
No, no. You're so not listening.

412
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,815
I'm talking about when you give all
the control to the woman.

413
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,733
- You relinquish the power.
- Right.

414
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,735
- You give it all to the girl.
- Right.

415
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,614
Right at that very moment is the time
that she will tear out your heart.

416
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,826
She'll screw the milkman,
she'll get pregnant with a stranger.

417
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,203
I'm telling you,
it's exactly what's happening

418
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,832
and it's repeating itself
every relationship I have.

419
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:08,916
It's the same.

420
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,125
Truthfully, she wasn't your type.

421
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,586
- Well, I wasn't finished.
- Look, enjoy your freedom.

422
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,005
- Yeah, you wait till it happens to you.
- It has.

423
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,222
Contact's late.

424
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,349
All right, let's go.

425
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,184
Chill.

426
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,564
One of the nuts has legs.

427
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,941
I hate this outfit. I hate this hat.

428
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,025
Take it off.

429
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,624
Have you ever been rejected?

430
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,629
Would you be sad if I was dead?

431
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,721
You're really pushing the boundaries
of our relationship, you know that?

432
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,613
- Is that the contact?
- Could be.

433
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,909
Too bad she's so homely.

434
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,285
Stay focused.

435
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,706
Are you the contact?

436
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,458
I'm Sandra.

437
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,792
What are your names?

438
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:35,794
Buda, Pest.

439
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,425
Follow me, please.

440
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,307
Buda and Pest? Nice.

441
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,820
Did you do all these?

442
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,658
Yes. Take one.

443
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,242
A gift.

444
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,744
I don't take free gifts.

445
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,539
- How much you want for it?
- Nothing.

446
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,583
Taking money for something is not a gift.

447
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,461
Taking nothing for something is.

448
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,505
Is it like this all the time?

449
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,174
This place was a beautiful place.

450
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:27,012
Then one day, they came with money,
and General Garza sold his soul.

451
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,806
And people who fight back are killed.

452
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,391
You said "they" came with money.

453
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,433
Who's "they"?

454
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,352
Some Americans. That's all I know.

455
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,230
But someday all of this will change back.

456
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,941
You really believe that?

457
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,109
Yes.

458
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,780
You have a family, Sandra?

459
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,950
My mother, when I was little, she died.

460
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,953
And my father, he's gone, too.

461
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,871
Do you?

462
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:53,998
- Me?
- Yes.

463
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,666
He has a truck and a seaplane.

464
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,714
Sandra, how close
can you get to the palace?

465
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,549
The palace? Why?

466
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,218
We just wanna check out the view.

467
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,845
There is no view.

468
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,555
Why don't we just go there anyway, okay?

469
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,320
Where is my grove?

470
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,699
Where is your manpower?

471
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,665
Do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce?

472
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,375
Of course you don't. Let me tell you.

473
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,669
We are eight weeks behind schedule.

474
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,173
Kick your peasants' asses.
Get me my product.

475
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,510
When you talk like this to me
in front of my men, it's no good.

476
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,598
I am your lifeline.

477
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,184
I am the one who coordinates
all this confusion.

478
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,561
I am making you rich.

479
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,813
And being wealthy is very good.

480
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,942
It allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be.

481
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:13,285
Sometimes things
are just not worth the money.

482
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,745
Sure they are.

483
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,675
Sandra, I was wondering about something
you were saying.

484
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,969
- From a female point of view...
- What are you doing?

485
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,348
Conversing. Look it up.
Out of curiosity,

486
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,976
you ever have a person you liked
disrespect you in a bad way?

487
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,853
Dis...

488
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,064
I'm not sure what the Spanish is
for "disrespect."

489
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,359
Come on. Why don't you man up? Jesus!

490
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,527
She wasn't your type.

491
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,071
Why don't you just keep saying,
"She wasn't my type?"

492
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,490
So I could put a bullet in your bleak brain!

493
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,576
Look who I'm talking to.
Dracula's life coach.

494
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,120
No wonder you're alone.

495
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,955
Sandra, are we close?

496
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,248
It's just over there.

497
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,041
- Pull over, please.
- Yeah, really.

498
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,884
- Where is he going?
- I'm glad you asked.

499
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,011
Well, I suppose you could say

500
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,807
we like to look at the world
from different views.

501
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,397
You... You got a black heart.

502
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,526
She wasn't your type.

503
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,785
We should get going.

504
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,037
He's very emotional.

505
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,663
What are you looking for?

506
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,670
Sandra, how do I know
you're not setting us up?

507
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,298
What does "setting us up" mean?

508
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,759
You don't look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time.

509
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,928
How did you get involved in this?

510
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,013
An American came here.

511
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:42,142
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

512
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,268
And you're not afraid?

513
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,937
I'm afraid.

514
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,397
But he said maybe you can help Vilena.

515
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,858
I don't think so.

516
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:50,943
Why not?

517
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,403
To get this place going again,

518
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,614
you have to rip the guts out of it
and start from the ground up

519
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,283
and even I don't think
that's worth the money,

520
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,371
so if I were you, I'd leave. Just leave.

521
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,631
You should leave.

522
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,349
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

523
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,175
Run!

524
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,785
- Get her.
- Got it.

525
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,134
Are you crazy?

526
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,553
- You could have killed me!
- You're welcome.

527
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:47,768
What?

528
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,564
All right, speed it up. We're on the way.

529
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,987
If we get out of here, it's a miracle.

530
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,574
- She's coming with us, right?
- She'd better.

531
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,912
- How can we leave?
- We got a plane.

532
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,581
- No, I can't leave.
- Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.

533
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,625
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah? They'll find you in an hour.

534
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,419
- Maybe, but I'm staying.
- Staying for what? There's nothing here.

535
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,921
Not to you.

536
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,926
Look, if you stay, then you're dead.
She's leaving with us.

537
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,351
- I got the guys inside.
- Give me a 60-second lead.

538
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,061
- You got it. Go, go, go!
- Come on.

539
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,704
Get in.

540
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,039
- Get in.
- No.

541
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,666
- Get in.
- No, no, I can't.

542
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,543
- Let's go.
- I can't. I belong here.

543
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,712
- There's no time.
- Go, you go.

544
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,005
Please, go.

545
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:41,715
Shit.

546
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,358
Hey!

547
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,361
You look nervous.

548
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:44,569
Come on!

549
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,576
Run, you bastard!

550
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,740
- Where's the girl?
- Gone. She wouldn't leave.

551
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,492
Wouldn't leave?

552
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,452
Why the hell would anybody wanna stay?

553
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,964
The hell...

554
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:49,968
The hell with it.

555
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,637
- Climb, baby, climb.
- Come on, baby.

556
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,525
God damn it.

557
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,368
- Going back?
- Yeah.

558
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,621
- Fry and die.
- Fry and die. Let's do it.

559
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,361
What are they doing?

560
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,090
Yes!

561
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,936
Great job.

562
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,105
That was a statement!

563
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:29,252
How did two obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel,

564
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,755
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

565
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,549
With help, that's how.

566
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,802
Everything's under control,
except one detail,

567
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:42,015
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone.

568
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,767
Bad Shakespeare.

569
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,020
Somehow the company parasites got to her.

570
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:48,813
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic.

571
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,817
But blood or not, she goes.

572
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,403
Call it the price of doing business.

573
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,989
You don't kill your familia.

574
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,367
Come around my house
during the holidays, pal.

575
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,680
Nice bird.

576
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,475
First of all, I don't feel comfortable

577
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,144
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun.

578
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,604
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up.

579
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,231
Not if you wanna know where they are.

580
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,690
What do you know?

581
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,067
I used to be one of them.

582
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,823
Why are you turning on them?

583
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,366
Lovers' quarrel.

584
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,618
We settle on 50.

585
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,203
No, math whiz.

586
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:48,289
We settle on 100 grand,
upfront, in my pocket.

587
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,583
The guy thinks he's a real badass.

588
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,502
Actually, I'm a horror show.

589
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,298
This geezer's a bloody joke.

590
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,675
Life's a joke, gum-chew.

591
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,721
I've been standing in a space
about the size of your mouth for six hours.

592
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,391
If you don't want that Fu Manchu
knocked back into the '60s,

593
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,811
you'd better keep your gum-chewing trap
shut and show some respect!

594
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:11,521
Hey.

595
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,274
Need a facelift, pretty boy?

596
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,150
Bring it.

597
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,236
Back off, Paine.

598
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,320
I'm gonna kill him.

599
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,613
We need him.

600
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,616
Back off!

601
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,456
Here's what I think is happening.

602
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,918
This guy who calls himself Church
is really a front for the CIA.

603
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,045
So we're working for the agency?

604
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,548
Yeah.
Church hired us to take out the General,

605
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,593
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

606
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,930
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

607
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:47,599
went rogue and teamed up with the General

608
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,018
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

609
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,103
And that's a big cash loss.

610
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,148
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

611
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,942
or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

612
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,195
That'd be a bad headline,
so they hire us to kill him.

613
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,781
And they're back in business.

614
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,117
- And we're taken out.
- Nobody's gonna miss us.

615
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,621
- Is it still $5 million?
- You'd never live to spend it.

616
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,122
I'm telling Church the deal's off.

617
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,417
Sound about right?

618
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,627
That's about right.

619
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,711
I agree.

620
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,072
You still got the helmet?

621
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,159
Where is he?

622
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,217
- Who the hell is that?
- Some punk.

623
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,844
- Don't worry about it.
- We got your back.

624
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,181
If he comes over here, we'll bust his ass.

625
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,855
What do you want?

626
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,441
Your life.

627
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,568
I was thinking about taking it.

628
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,653
Is that right?

629
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:27,865
But I don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me.

630
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,284
You shouldn't have bruised her face.

631
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:31,536
Really?

632
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,413
I would have liked to have kept it
the way it was.

633
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,289
Keep the bitch, 'cause I'm done with it.

634
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,364
Lee.

635
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,623
Next time, I'll deflate all your balls, friend.

636
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,886
Now you know what I do for a living.

637
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,346
I'm not perfect, but you should have waited.

638
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,808
I was worth it.

639
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,837
Where is she?

640
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,854
So your daughter paints, too?

641
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:05,523
This is how it starts!

642
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,316
There's nothing here. Let's go.

643
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,943
Or how it ends!

644
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,149
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep?

645
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,151
No. What happened to your girlfriend?

646
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,362
Another one bites the dust, brother.

647
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,659
I was gonna paint this for her,
and you know what? I'm gonna finish it.

648
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,078
Then I'm just gonna smash the shit
out of it.

649
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,455
You wanna be alone?

650
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,542
Not really. So, what's up?

651
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,586
On this island, there was this girl.

652
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,088
There usually are.

653
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:16,010
You know, she showed us around.
She was the target's daughter.

654
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:21,641
And when she had a chance to leave,
she didn't do it.

655
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:24,936
She had some guts.

656
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,856
Why can't I get that out of my mind?

657
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,318
You know, she stands for something.

658
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,403
You know, man, we don't stand for shit.

659
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:39,700
We used to, but that dried all up,
like this is gonna dry all up.

660
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,119
This here paint is gonna dry.

661
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,455
What dried up?

662
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,418
Just belief, man. Just the belief in the soul,

663
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:52,588
just, I don't know,
the human parts, brother.

664
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,300
You remember that time
we was up in Bosnia?

665
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,554
We took down them Serb bad boys.

666
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,185
All our guys were getting chopped up
all around us,

667
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,980
and there was blood everywhere.

668
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,815
I never thought I was gonna make it
out of there,

669
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,484
- and I know you didn't, either.
- Yeah.

670
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:17,113
Kind of feeling like dead, too, you know?

671
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,949
My head's all a very black place.

672
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,993
I don't believe in shit.

673
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,705
Just goddamn Dracula black.

674
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:31,585
I remember I got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there, that Slivovitz.

675
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,839
I don't know,
I think that's what it was called.

676
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,758
And I ain't feeling no pain now.

677
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,845
And I'd come up on this...

678
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,433
I'd come up on this old wooden bridge,
and I see this...

679
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,269
I see this...

680
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,900
I see this woman standing there, you know?
And she's...

681
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,987
I stepped out, and she saw me,

682
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:02,742
and she's just looking right in my eyes,
and I was looking right in her eyes.

683
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,412
I knew what she was gonna do.

684
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,957
She looked at me,
and I knew she was gonna jump.

685
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,251
You know what I did, man?

686
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:17,548
I just turned around and I kept walking,
until I heard that splash.

687
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,012
Then she was gone.

688
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,224
And after taking all them lives,

689
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:32,938
here was one that I could have saved,
but I didn't.

690
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,902
And what I realized later on was,

691
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,532
if I had saved that woman, I might have,

692
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,704
I don't know,
saved what was left of my soul, you know?

693
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,615
Sandra,

694
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,744
short for Alexsandra,
which is Latin for "Defender of mankind,"

695
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:29,995
and, bingo, here you are.

696
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,372
Now that's synergy.

697
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,251
You're not following that.

698
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:40,172
And I know you're probably not,
illiteracy being 98% in your country.

699
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,632
Try following this.

700
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,556
A very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman.

701
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:54,311
You push some if you have to,
but you never strike them.

702
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,066
This man, however,
does not share that moral dilemma.

703
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:04,989
So the question, Sandra,
why were the Americans here?

704
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,705
Don't fight back.

705
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,833
Just relax.

706
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,909
Again, what did the Americans tell you?

707
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,078
Who were they after?

708
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,290
Continue.

709
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,652
You wanted answers.

710
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:07,903
Not like that!

711
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,780
Whatever you say.

712
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,296
- I'm going back to Vilena.
- Yeah? Something change?

713
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,172
- What's the plan?
- There is no plan.

714
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:30,676
- Wait, wait, wait. We need a strategy.
- I'm going. You're not.

715
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,429
- What?
- I said I'm going. You guys aren't.

716
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,390
- What are you, out of your mind?
- It's personal business.

717
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,059
- You don't owe that woman nothing.
- I didn't say I did.

718
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:41,186
You want to kill yourself? Go ahead, fine.
Your call.

719
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,273
Listen, I don't want to kill myself.
You guys, take care. I got to do this.

720
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,275
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

721
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,110
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it.

722
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:52,740
This is my choice. There's no guilt.
There's no guilt. Take care.

723
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,248
Yeah, fuck it. His choice. Yeah.

724
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:11,467
I said I'm going alone.

725
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,551
I'm going, too.

726
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,553
Come on, Yang, get the hell out.

727
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,180
Just drive.

728
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,025
Don't lose your nerve.

729
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,862
Don't talk to me, cockroach.

730
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,501
So, why are you doing this?

731
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,294
Friends die together.

732
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,340
Hey. Give me the good luck ring. Come on.

733
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,259
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on.

734
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,429
- Speed better than luck.
- Whatever.

735
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,265
It's difficult.

736
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,725
What is?

737
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,019
My life is difficult. I need more money.

738
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:05,145
Why is that?

739
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,272
- I work harder than the rest.
- No, you don't.

740
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:12,027
Yes, I do. Because they're taller,
everything is harder for me.

741
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:16,407
When I get hurt, the wound is bigger
because I'm smaller.

742
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,076
When I travel, I need to go farther.

743
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,577
I know, 'cause you're smaller, right?

744
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,162
Yes.

745
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,374
My life is harder than you think.

746
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,838
- I need more money.
- I know. You told me.

747
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,297
For your family, right?

748
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,757
I don't have family.

749
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,426
I know.

750
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:37,803
Maybe one day I will.

751
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,139
Down!

752
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,041
- Get out there!
- Why me?

753
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:09,376
Because you're smaller.

754
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,437
Do that again, I'll kill you!

755
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,058
Gunner!

756
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,648
Come on, Gunner.

757
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,192
Man's good.

758
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,812
What are you doing? You're dead, junkie!

759
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,236
Insect.

760
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,084
Bail!

761
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,177
Shit!

762
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,124
Yang!

763
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,668
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

764
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,504
It's over!

765
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,298
Let's talk about this.
I forgive you, Yang!

766
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:07,471
That almost hurt.

767
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:08,931
Back off!

768
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,815
What do you wear, size three?
Bring it, happy feet.

769
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:50,639
Come on, bring it!

770
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,137
Size matters.

771
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:40,731
Gunner!

772
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:41,982
Hello, karma!

773
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:48,947
Shit!

774
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,102
You shot me.

775
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,564
Hey, don't say that.
You were gonna kill him.

776
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:24,483
No, I was just gonna scare him.

777
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:27,486
Don't say that. You never liked him.
You were gonna kill him.

778
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,571
That's true.

779
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,536
Am I dying?

780
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,997
The shot's a couple of inches
above your heart.

781
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,504
Gunner, who sent you? Who hired you?

782
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,298
Who cares?

783
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,883
Who cares? I care.

784
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:55,138
Don't go out a total asshole.
For once, cooperate.

785
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,309
Who sent you? Who hired you?
Tell me. Let me make it right.

786
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,603
Bury me right.

787
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,606
And I want a Viking funeral.

788
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,486
You mean where they put you in a boat
and set you on fire, Viking?

789
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,488
- That's right!
- You're not a Viking.

790
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,824
So what? Who cares?

791
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,077
If that's what you want, you got it.

792
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,122
Who sent you? Is the girl still alive?

793
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,331
Come closer.

794
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,352
You know, it's not easy being your friend.

795
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,271
That's true.

796
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,857
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it twice.

797
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,860
I know the layout.
I'll tell you about it on the way.

798
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,654
What the hell happened to you?

799
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,197
It's too sad to talk about it.

800
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,286
Let's fly.

801
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,764
You know, the enemy's
always been terrified of noise,

802
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,892
especially shotguns.

803
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,896
With this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute,

804
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,689
you tell me who's tolerating that.

805
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,777
You know what? I trust you.

806
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,071
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

807
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,200
Omya Kaboom.

808
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,702
When Omya's prime is struck,

809
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,706
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself.

810
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,876
And when that happens,
anything that gets in my lady's way

811
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,670
becomes instant red sauce and Jell-O.

812
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:52,005
And if that doesn't work,

813
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,011
her sister will.

814
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:03,600
So let me get this right.
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him

815
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,769
and, at death's door,
he gives you the whole layout?

816
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,020
Something like that.

817
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,189
But I had to promise him this Viking funeral.

818
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,274
You know, where you have to
spread the ashes over the ocean.

819
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,027
What a way to poison
about a thousand whales.

820
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,362
At least.

821
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,491
Listen, we owe the big bastard a send-off.

822
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:21,993
- I would have win.
- I know you would have win.

823
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:30,252
Mumbo jumbo, hoodoo lady, hoodoo

824
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,380
Boom-lay, boom-lay, boom-lay, boom!

825
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:39,469
More like a million whales.

826
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,888
It's 3:36. We have 20 minutes
to take this place down.

827
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,806
I'll take the cellar.

828
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,183
We've got company.

829
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,685
I got him. You guys take off.

830
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,883
Is there a reason you've taken
the soldiers this man has trained

831
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,386
and made them look like fools?

832
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,514
They look like warriors.

833
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,937
Warriors loyal to me.

834
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,401
I thought the people of Vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me.

835
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:05,281
But then I think maybe this is your plan,
because you cannot control me.

836
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,827
And torturing Sandra works for you.

837
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,497
You want to kill her to make me suffer.

838
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,293
A man can never kill a child.

839
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,629
But you can.

840
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,548
You're losing your mind.

841
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:25,218
You do not control me!

842
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,556
Bring Sandra here.

843
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:34,477
Bring her now or I will kill you.

844
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,020
Go get her.

845
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:39,245
- No, no.
- Sandra, Sandra, it's me. Sandra.

846
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:43,249
Hey, it's me, it's me. Sandra, it's me.

847
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:46,669
It's me. It's me. It's okay.

848
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,131
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

849
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,382
How are you here?

850
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,009
I just am.

851
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:57,013
- Can you move?
- Yes.

852
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,598
Okay.

853
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,933
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go.

854
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,576
- Get off.
- Let's see what you got here.

855
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,703
Nice.

856
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:22,622
Goddamn.

857
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,459
I'm having these babies, seeing as
you ain't gonna need them anymore.

858
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,592
All right, I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

859
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,553
You're gonna give me answers.

860
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,807
If they're not the right answers, you will die.

861
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,102
Why are you here?

862
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:50,900
Bird watching.

863
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,070
Stop him!

864
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,406
- This is not his fight. It's mine.
- Get her out of here.

865
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,033
Seal the building.

866
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,620
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

867
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,080
What?

868
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,253
Time's up.

869
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,671
- Where's Barney?
- What's the call?

870
01:24:11,922 --> 01:24:12,922
We can't find him in 10 minutes,

871
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,006
we're going out the same way we came in.

872
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,091
- No way.
- That's what he'd want.

873
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,301
Ten minutes! Let's go.

874
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,391
Hi. What's your name?

875
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,685
- You having fun yet, mate?
- Yeah, not bad.

876
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,270
Personally, I'm glad you came back.

877
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:28,438
Yeah?

878
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:32,817
Get him up.

879
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:37,447
Stand him up.

880
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,036
You know,
if you didn't have this Kevlar vest,

881
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:46,539
your insides are gonna be
like fucking mush.

882
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:47,915
Well, ain't that sad?

883
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,208
You know, you're a lucky man.

884
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,752
You're the lucky man.

885
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:52,962
No, no, you're a lucky man.

886
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,965
- He told me to keep you conscious.
- Did he?

887
01:24:58,177 --> 01:24:59,927
All right. All right.

888
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,391
Now this is your last time.

889
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:09,145
You give me the right answer,
and I'll cut you a break.

890
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,066
If you give me the wrong answer,
you will die a damn slow death.

891
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,693
Do you understand me?

892
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:17,570
- Do you understand me?
- Yep.

893
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,323
- Who sent you?
- Can't breathe.

894
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,241
Loosen up.

895
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:24,160
Who sent you?

896
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,664
Your hairdresser.

897
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,687
You're good.

898
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,849
Go, we gotta go!

899
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,580
Come on.

900
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:39,522
Shit!

901
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,670
Remember this shit at Christmas!

902
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:07,425
Damn, that thing's loud.

903
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:10,052
- What happened to you?
- I got my ass kicked.

904
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,224
Damn, that stings!

905
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,642
Suck it up!

906
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:18,227
Come on. Get my rifle. Let's go.

907
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:39,457
What's this?

908
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,462
Everything bad that has happened,
you bring.

909
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,130
Take your money!

910
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:50,426
I only see death with you. Take it all and go.

911
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:51,969
I'm not going anywhere.

912
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:53,304
You are done here.

913
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,680
You can't succeed without me.

914
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,015
I am the leader.

915
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:57,308
You're a puppet in a hat.

916
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,394
No.

917
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:20,539
Now!

918
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,919
Get back.

919
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,131
This shit's getting old.

920
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:35,763
Throw down your weapons.

921
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,891
There's no way out.

922
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,521
- Your lucky ring stinks.
- I know.

923
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,606
- Let's backtrack.
- The building's rigged.

924
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,566
It's the only way out.

925
01:30:58,328 --> 01:30:59,453
Chopper's ready in five minutes.

926
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:00,579
We're not leaving yet.

927
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,134
- What's he saying?
- He said we're dead with an accent.

928
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:14,593
We ain't dead.

929
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,345
- Blow the building.
- Not yet.

930
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:20,015
We will kill this American disease.

931
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,034
Blow the building!

932
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,244
She's still in there!

933
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,996
The money!

934
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:53,966
Blow it!

935
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:03,058
She's out. Blow the fucking building!

936
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:48,455
I'm out!

937
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:46,221
Let's go. Come on.

938
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:48,599
Cut Munroe off!

939
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:49,993
Come on!

940
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,028
Hey!

941
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:07,821
- Thing's too heavy.
- Give me it.

942
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:10,616
- What do you want me to do?
- Throw it as hard as you can.

943
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,684
- Blow the dump.
- Got it!

944
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,426
Munroe!

945
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:16,348
Drop the weapons,
or I'll put a bullet through her eye.

946
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:19,851
Don't test me.

947
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,239
No, no, no.

948
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:34,741
Shut up or I'll kill you.

949
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:39,663
The agency parasites hired you,
didn't they?

950
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:43,584
I'd have paid you twice as much
to go fishing.

951
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:46,628
You'd have to think
I'm pretty freaking stupid

952
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:48,463
to surrender to the agency.

953
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:53,343
Why would I do that? I created this.
I made it all happen.

954
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,848
And then they wanted me out. Why?
Because I saw the big picture.

955
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:01,768
Unlike people like her father, you,
the agency,

956
01:39:02,395 --> 01:39:04,313
you see life through a freaking keyhole

957
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,857
because you let emotions
cloud your judgment.

958
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:10,694
Emotions are the cancer of the intellect!

959
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,029
Stop walking.

960
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:17,492
And what about me and you?
We're both the same.

961
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:21,538
We're both mercenaries.
We're both dead inside.

962
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,333
So why the hell did you come after me?

963
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:27,210
I didn't come after you, dipshit.
I came for her!

964
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,940
- You okay?
- Yeah.

965
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,401
Call it a tie.

966
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:55,197
Yeah, I guess so.

967
01:39:55,782 --> 01:39:57,866
You know, you're not as fast as you think.

968
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:00,077
I'm beginning to sense that.

969
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:45,080
The second account number's mine.
It'll help get things going around here.

970
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:47,958
No, I can't. You've done so much.

971
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,586
Yeah, well, so have you. A gift for a gift.
You take it.

972
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:56,383
- Will you come back?
- I promise I'll always be around.

973
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:02,889
Take care.

974
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:33,295
What?

975
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,005
Truthfully?

976
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,631
Yeah?

977
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:39,134
I never really thought she was your type.

978
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,328
All right, baby. All right.

979
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:07,788
Come on, let's see what you got.

980
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:11,708
That's my boy!

981
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,214
Go south!

982
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,805
You lost! You lost!

983
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:31,061
So you're back from the dead.
How you healing?

984
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:34,981
Good, considering
you could have killed me.

985
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:36,691
I forgive you.

986
01:42:37,193 --> 01:42:38,485
Okay.

987
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,070
I would have win.

988
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,447
Never.

989
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:46,952
Hey, Gunner.

990
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:50,121
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, brother. Therapy.

991
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,874
- What's he saying?
- He said try therapy.

992
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:56,962
Man's got a point.

993
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:05,387
You know what?

994
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:08,056
I'm gonna do you a favor, Tool.

995
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:11,142
"I once knew a man called Tool..."

996
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:13,270
I love poetry.

997
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:17,065
"To me, was the epitome of cool

998
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:19,651
"He was good with a knife

999
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:24,406
"Bad with a wife..."

1000
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:26,741
That hurts.

1001
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:29,160
"But to think he could beat me

1002
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:33,331
"Dreaming he'd defeat me

1003
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:36,167
"Cool Tool

1004
01:43:38,504 --> 01:43:39,588
"You gotta be a fool"

1005
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:45,260
Oh, yeah.
