1
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:42,172
Atten-hut!

2
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,734
Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

3
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,475
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,679
I know we've been up for 72
hours, but I expect perfection.

5
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,722
Nothing else.

6
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,123
The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

7
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,959
I'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

8
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,693
Then you'll dive from there.

9
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,530
Once we hit our target,

10
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,298
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

11
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:15,898
I'll handle the chopper,
and I'll find the professor.

12
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,637
Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

13
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,769
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

14
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:22,608
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

15
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,981
We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

16
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:21,291
Ah!

17
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,873
Red Two, handle the boat.

18
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:41,036
I'll take care of the bozos
on the jet ski.

19
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,388
Ah!

20
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:01,730
Oh!

21
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,617
Gotcha.

22
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,389
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe,
U.S. Navy.

23
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,323
Where is the briefcase?

24
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:39,855
It's right behind you.
Man, am I glad to see you.

25
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:43,870
- I never thought I'd see my family...
- I'll get you out.

26
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,270
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

27
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,036
Yeah, I'm with you. Absolutely.

28
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,989
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

29
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,462
If I had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

30
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,931
Just a joke.

31
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,731
Do you mind if I call my wife
to tell her I'm okay?

32
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,567
I have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

33
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
We gotta keep moving.

34
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,901
Lieutenant, I am safe.
Please. She thinks I'm dead.

35
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,912
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

36
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,643
Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.

37
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,512
It's voice activated.

38
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,148
Hey.

39
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:40,851
These are my kids.

40
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,287
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

41
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,823
I doubt it. Hurry up.

42
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,959
Hey! We're almost ready.

43
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:54,334
Give us another sec.

44
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,875
Professor!

45
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,242
The doctor says you've
healed up real good, Shane.

46
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,255
I should've been
out of here weeks ago.

47
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,348
Look, I know heads
are gonna roll for this.

48
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:16,722
Hey, you took a bullet.

49
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,455
Yeah, but I want you to know
I take full responsibility

50
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,326
for what happened
to the professor.

51
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,627
Plummer was the best
security expert

52
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,564
the Department of Defense
ever had.

53
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:29,593
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST":

54
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:32,105
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

55
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,835
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

56
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,968
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

57
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:38,239
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

58
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,771
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

59
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,818
GHOST is still out there.

60
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:47,786
Which is why I'm sending you
back in.

61
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:50,289
I know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

62
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:52,792
I was with your father
when he led a platoon...

63
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,021
With all due respect,

64
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,530
I'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

65
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,362
All I'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

66
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:02,900
And you're the best.

67
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,960
I need someone I can trust on this

68
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,303
- and I know I can trust you.
- Okay.

69
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,637
I'll put a team together.

70
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,768
No. It's not
that kind of mission.

71
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,712
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

72
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:20,712
<i>Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.</i>

73
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,983
<i>It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.</i>

74
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:25,546
<i>Whoever killed her husband</i>

75
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,785
<i>must think that GHOST
is still in that house.</i>

76
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,919
<i>Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.</i>

77
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:34,056
<i>A safety deposit box has been discovered
in Zurich in the Plummers' name.</i>

78
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,933
<i>I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.</i>

79
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,995
<i>We're hoping it's the GHOST program.</i>

80
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,939
<i>In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.</i>

81
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>That's where you come in.</i>

82
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:48,805
<i>While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.</i>

83
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:10,028
Ah!

84
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,276
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

85
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,369
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

86
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:25,641
Come on.

87
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:30,914
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

88
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:36,356
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

89
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:39,291
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

90
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,295
He's gonna stay with you
while I'm away.

91
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,354
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:47,731
Oh! This is Helga and Tyler.

93
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:49,895
Ma'am. Baby.

94
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,463
- That's a pretty dress.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,032
I have date
with butcher tonight.

96
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,044
I want to look nice.

97
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,376
Ah!

98
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:11,583
You have a pleasant family.

99
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,558
Well, for the younger ones,

100
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,686
I think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

101
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,698
It's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

102
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,098
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

103
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:24,466
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

104
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,835
Howard wasn't around much.

105
00:09:26,906 --> 00:09:28,965
His work took him
all over the world.

106
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,839
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

107
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:34,141
Yeah, I can understand
that lifestyle.

108
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:39,342
Anyway, about a week ago,

109
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,750
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

110
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,516
I didn't tell the kids 'cause
I didn't wanna scare them.

111
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,318
Mrs. Plummer, I've dealt with...

112
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:48,586
Ow! Oh, my God!

113
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,993
I'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

114
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,928
Gary, down!

115
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,556
He bit me.

116
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,726
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

117
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:02,330
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

118
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:05,204
I'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

119
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,641
Out, out.

120
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:44,037
I'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

121
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:45,943
I'm gonna miss you too.

122
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,778
I'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

123
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,547
Bye, pumpkin.
I love you, pumpkin.

124
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,424
Oh, and kids? Remember,

125
00:10:57,492 --> 00:11:01,053
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

126
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,154
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

127
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:09,629
I'm sorry.
I don't do this very often.

128
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,398
You're going away for a few days.

129
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,768
Yeah, I know.

130
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,704
I got it.

131
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,435
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

132
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,536
- I take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

133
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,081
It's okay.

134
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,480
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

135
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,543
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

136
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,454
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

137
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:41,897
Go.

138
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,434
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

139
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,527
Have some fun.

140
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,835
Bye-bye.

141
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,371
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

142
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,072
No, ma'am.

143
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,174
Too bad.
It could have come in handy.

144
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,690
Ah!

145
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,026
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

146
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:16,923
Please!

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,491
Oh, my God! Shut up!

148
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,403
<i>Prepare to be annihilated.</i>

149
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,637
Hey!

150
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,680
- Where's the baby?
- Tell me. Come on.

151
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,238
No!

152
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,751
Shut up! No, she didn't.

153
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,447
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

154
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:41,046
Oh, my God. Tell me!

155
00:12:41,123 --> 00:12:43,614
Is there anyone here
that understands

156
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,661
the meaning of the word
"discipline"?

157
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:50,255
Hey, Flipper. You don't like it?
Do something. I make bottle.

158
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,634
Thank you, Peter.

159
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,104
Yes!

160
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,263
- Ow!
- Gotcha!

161
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:27,390
Ah!

162
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,597
What's your problem?
Get off me!

163
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:34,662
Oh, my God!

164
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:37,335
What are you doing, you spaz?
That's my boyfriend!

165
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,469
So you're the one breaking in!

166
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,035
- Go back inside!
- No!

167
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,226
We speak English, buddy.

168
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,818
Look, about the sirens
and the strobe lights.

169
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:01,093
We own a bakery, so we're up
kind of early. Would you mind?

170
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,961
Sorry.

171
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:08,132
Oh, and we found this
in our pool filter.

172
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,765
Keep that zoo reined in,
huh, babysitter?

173
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,545
Yo, fool, handle me like that again
and I'll lay knuckles upside your head!

174
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:19,139
Okay! Enough is enough!
Come on, Scott, let's go!

175
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:20,808
- Come on.
- No, you don't.

176
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:25,821
Get back here.
Give me 20.

177
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,356
I meant push-ups!

178
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:30,689
- Zoe?
- Drop down! Do 20!

179
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,854
- This is not the Army or Navy!
- One...

180
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,091
Real nice move, Lt. Smooth.

181
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,861
He'll probably never speak to me!

182
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,402
- Then I did you a favor.
- Whoa!

183
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,061
Personal bubble invasion.

184
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,435
Your mother was worried sick
about you!

185
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,406
You should call here and tell her.

186
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:48,705
I'm sure you'll take care of that
for me.

187
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:51,405
Stay out of my life!

188
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:56,377
Wait! You can't do this!

189
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:59,285
I have plans!
It's Saturday night! Ow!

190
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,752
Not anymore.

191
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:07,884
- You too. Lights out.
- Bite me.

192
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:10,396
Boy, this family's in
for a rude awakening.

193
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,671
What are you doing?

194
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,731
You're burning daylight! Move!

195
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,300
It's Sunday.

196
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,380
And it's 6am!
You're insane!

197
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,285
Listen up!

198
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:15,053
Your behavior is unacceptable.

199
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:17,389
In order to maintain
a state of safety,

200
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:19,292
we need to maintain
a state of order.

201
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:21,456
One more little bite?

202
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:23,966
We going to be strong mine
worker when we grow up.

203
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:25,433
Excuse me.

204
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,197
Excuse me!

205
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,438
Now, I've only got one rule.

206
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,477
Everything is done my way.
No highway option.

207
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,910
- Do you copy?
- Do you copy?

208
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:43,780
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

209
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:47,846
- Do not copy me.
- Do not copy me.

210
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,926
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

211
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,791
Uh...

212
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,623
Peter farted.

213
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
- Oh, that is so gross.
- Quiet!

214
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:05,105
Everybody up.
That means you too.

215
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:08,631
Tracking devices,
never take them off.

216
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,874
The panic button
is for emergencies only.

217
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,848
Touch that,
you'd better be dying.

218
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,781
Or you're dead.

219
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,821
I would rather chew off my arm
than wear that.

220
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:25,052
Just because my mom is paranoid doesn't
mean we have to take orders from you.

221
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,389
Let me explain how
the chain of command works.

222
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:30,294
I tell you what to do
and you do it!

223
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:33,389
End of chain.

224
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:36,458
I'm not gonna have time
to remember all of your names.

225
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:41,906
You'll be Red Leader.
Red Baby. Red One. Red.

226
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,835
Where's the older male?
There were five.

227
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:50,246
He walks like Dracula

228
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:55,480
with footsteps
silent like death.

229
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,249
He's in his room.

230
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,617
Red Two!

231
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:05,829
Red Two, open up!

232
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,494
Red Two!

233
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:18,842
What have you done?

234
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,502
What? I thought...

235
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:22,944
Is this what you're
trained to do?

236
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,777
A "shock and awe" on my door?

237
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:27,909
I can fix that
with a hammer and some nails.

238
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,077
- It's real easy to fix.
- No, it's not! Look!

239
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:33,953
It's broken in half!
You can't fix that!

240
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:37,482
If you'd been wearing this,
this wouldn't have happened.

241
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,930
What are you talking about?
I was in the bathroom!

242
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,968
You know I would never
ask you for your help...

243
00:18:46,036 --> 00:18:48,435
...but he has got to go.

244
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,750
Somebody help me, please!

245
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:10,882
Help me, somebody!

246
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:15,328
- Stop it, Peter! This is nuts!
- Peter, cut this out.

247
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:23,260
Hey, good soldiers
aren't scared of anything.

248
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,203
I'm not scared. I'm annoyed.

249
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:28,537
Ever since he heard Daddy say
there was a ghost in the house,

250
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:32,977
he puts on that blanket and chases me
everywhere. It drives me crazy.

251
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,707
Peter, have you seen this ghost?

252
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,689
All right, here he comes.

253
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:01,702
Hey! You leave towel
on floor in bathroom.

254
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:05,106
I pick up after kids,
not you.

255
00:20:05,176 --> 00:20:07,974
And light a match next time.

256
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,812
Oh!

257
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,117
Good news.

258
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:26,321
Your background checks
have cleared,

259
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,331
and we are free
to give you the box.

260
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,128
- Oh.
- Excellent.

261
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,658
Just as soon as you
provide us with the passwords.

262
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:34,897
Passwords?

263
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,462
It was your husband's wish

264
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,599
that the person who collects the box

265
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:41,109
must provide us
with the passwords.

266
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,304
Great.

267
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:46,143
- Is it "The GHOST?"
- Ghost.

268
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:47,842
Mmm... No.

269
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:56,191
<i>These brats! Sugi pula!</i>

270
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,352
I had it!

271
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:02,363
- Remain calm.
- I am calm.

272
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:06,492
I quit!
That makes me calm.

273
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:09,435
Let's not be hasty about this.

274
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:21,512
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

275
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:25,541
<i>- Don't even think about it!
- Lt. Wolfe?</i>

276
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,745
<i>It's Julie Plummer.</i>

277
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,618
<i>- Who's this?
- Julie Plummer.</i>

278
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,850
<i>- What's that?
- Julie Plummer!</i>

279
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,893
Ah!

280
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,292
<i>- Oh, Mrs. Plummer.
- Did something fall?</i>

281
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,354
<i>- What was that noise?
- Nothing. Everything's okay!</i>

282
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,299
You'll be happy to know that I found
the culprit that's been sneaking around!

283
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,427
<i>- Great. Who was it?
- Just some teenager.</i>

284
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:48,065
<i>Teenager? I wanted to tell you
I'm gonna be a few more days.</i>

285
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,234
You'll be a few more days?

286
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,939
<i>- Yes, is that a problem?
- No, that's no problem!</i>

287
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,540
No, I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm just doing my...

288
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,140
<i>Your what?</i>

289
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,119
<i>- Duty.
- Sure everything's okay?</i>

290
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,780
Things are great,
Mrs. Plummer.

291
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,189
Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

292
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,285
<i>- Well, tell the kids I said...
- Bye, Mrs. Plummer!</i>

293
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,991
Just hang...
Let's calm down.

294
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,299
Just... just try to relax.

295
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,999
Ah!

296
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:30,976
Ah! She bit me!

297
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,812
Red Leader!

298
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,047
I command you to come back here!
That's a direct order!

299
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,315
You can't leave a man behind!

300
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:41,550
Red Leader!

301
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,587
Red Leader!

302
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,493
I don't even know
how to change a diaper!

303
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:49,925
Don't worry!

304
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,094
If she loves you,
she'll come back, huh?

305
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:58,367
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

306
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,170
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

307
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,768
- When is she coming back?
- Soon.

308
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,973
For now,
we'll just have some more big fun.

309
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,209
That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

310
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:11,617
- Tomorrow's a school day.
- I have wrestling.

311
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,245
I need a release for Driver's Ed.

312
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,812
I've got Fireflies.

313
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,049
I have to go to the mall.

314
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,058
I have to stop her
from spending so much.

315
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:20,390
Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

316
00:23:20,461 --> 00:23:22,622
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

317
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,631
Only then can we rise
to the challenge.

318
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:31,838
Okay,
who's gonna change Red Baby?

319
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:33,498
Guys?

320
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:40,078
Ah!

321
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:44,242
God! Red Baby!

322
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:48,988
Alrighty. We'll try this.

323
00:23:49,056 --> 00:23:51,388
Yes. Whoa.

324
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,324
Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

325
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,931
Hi. Zoe says you look
like The Hulk.

326
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,666
I think you're cute.

327
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,765
Thank you.

328
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,109
- Do you do kung fu?
- Yes.

329
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:19,673
Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

330
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,582
No.

331
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,755
Why are your boobs so big?

332
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,518
They're not boobs.

333
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,754
Do you have to wear a bra?

334
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,494
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

335
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,906
You know, little girl,

336
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:51,743
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

337
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:55,375
Do I look like I'm five to you?

338
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,817
What did I say?

339
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:02,516
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

340
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,130
Okay, troops! Breakfast!

341
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:11,392
What are you waiting for?
Dig in.

342
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,956
Feel free to mix and match.

343
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,595
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

344
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:18,799
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

345
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:20,933
I've survived months
off this stuff.

346
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,807
Okay, like, I'm really gonna eat
all of these carbs?

347
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,945
I can cross my eyes.
Wanna see?

348
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,413
No.

349
00:25:36,257 --> 00:25:38,054
Tyler hates it when I do that.

350
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,956
I know how he feels.

351
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:45,423
What's he...? Red Four!

352
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:57,367
Plummer residence.

353
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:00,345
Yes, I know it's Monday today.

354
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:02,506
No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

355
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:05,211
Yes, we'll be right there.

356
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,777
Who was that?

357
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,083
Your vice principal.

358
00:26:10,155 --> 00:26:12,623
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

359
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,318
you're both suspended.

360
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:17,089
He wants to see you
in his office right away.

361
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:55,220
What is it?

362
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,358
- It's a minivan.
- Ugh.

363
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,063
Now,
is this supposed to...?

364
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,628
- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

365
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,174
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

366
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:08,233
Not on my watch.

367
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:16,244
- Hold that.
- How fast is your watch?

368
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:20,379
You'll be suspended for sure.

369
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:23,921
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

370
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,586
Who drives like this?
You're crazy!

371
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:39,172
What are you doing?
Stop!

372
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,437
Got 'em here.

373
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:46,604
My fault.

374
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,741
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

375
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:53,878
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

376
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:59,388
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

377
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,120
You ever, uh, do any time?

378
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:05,161
Sasquatch.

379
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:08,064
- You got something to say, boy?
- No.

380
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:09,829
No? Good.

381
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,928
Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

382
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:14,666
coming out of your shoulders.

383
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,436
- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

384
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,137
- Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

385
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:23,909
You just bought yourself
an extra 15 minutes on the mats.

386
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,143
With the Murninator!

387
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:29,585
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe.

388
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,919
I'm watching the kids
for the Plummers. A few days.

389
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,323
Oh, babysitter, huh?

390
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:38,226
Well, good.
Whatever job you can get, right?

391
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:41,321
I'm Murney.
Duane Murney.

392
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:43,730
My friends call me
"Little Puppet. "

393
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm the VP here.

394
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:48,796
I'm in charge of discipline,
conduct and truancy

395
00:28:48,873 --> 00:28:53,105
from top to bottom,
K through 12.

396
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:55,509
You're in my house now,
strong man.

397
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,207
- You're the vice principal.
- And the wrestling coach.

398
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:00,943
See the Creeper over there?

399
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:04,612
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

400
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:08,714
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

401
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,316
Out of 23!

402
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,726
These are the worst students
in my school.

403
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:16,822
- I'm ashamed...
- Your school?

404
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,068
Good morning, kids.

405
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:24,037
Mr. Murney,
thanks for watching my chair.

406
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:26,939
- I'll take it from here.
- Roger. Absolutely.

407
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,034
I was just informing
our new friend here

408
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:31,443
about some of the duties
as vice principal.

409
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:34,380
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

410
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:36,916
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

411
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:40,112
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

412
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:43,418
Right. I'll be on the roof.

413
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,925
Bye, now.

414
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,291
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

415
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:52,423
I'll cut you some slack seeing as
it's Lt. Wolfe's first day. Thank you.

416
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,025
Okay.

417
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,569
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

418
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,006
So, what's with this Murninator?

419
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:05,670
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

420
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:07,940
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

421
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,608
So, you're the bodyguard?

422
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,481
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

423
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:15,987
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

424
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,955
aren't fully aware of the situation

425
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:20,116
and that's the way she wants it.

426
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,962
She also told me
you're a "Teams" guy.

427
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,931
- Yes, I am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class

428
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,026
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

429
00:30:31,103 --> 00:30:34,265
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

430
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:37,172
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

431
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,402
It's the way I run this school.

432
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:40,808
I like that.

433
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:48,480
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

434
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:50,817
Permission granted.

435
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:03,260
<i>We don't need no music
We don't need no band</i>

436
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:07,235
<i>All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands</i>

437
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:09,568
<i>We said jammin' in the stands</i>

438
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,904
<i>J- A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

439
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:17,002
<i>What? J-A-M-M-I-N
Jammin' in the stands</i>

440
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:20,105
Go, Mustangs! Whoo!

441
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:23,583
"Black belt.
Honorable discharge. "

442
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:25,644
Clean as a whistle.

443
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:30,520
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

444
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:36,191
Hey!

445
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:39,131
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

446
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,794
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

447
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,533
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

448
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:49,440
It's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

449
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,809
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

450
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,814
Well, the odds are never pretty.

451
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:57,214
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

452
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,013
The naked streets of Bethesda

453
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,212
can be so dark and dangerous.

454
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:05,316
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

455
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:07,622
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

456
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,924
I, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

457
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:12,726
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

458
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,233
Ooh-ah!

459
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,565
Sensei.

460
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:19,798
You know what that's called, homeboy?

461
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:22,204
Total control.

462
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,833
You all right? Hmm?

463
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,708
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

464
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,440
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

465
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,539
What do you think?
I'll go easy on you.

466
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,278
- I'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

467
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,445
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

468
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,547
So it's kinda like "doo-doo" duty.

469
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,388
Don't worry about it.

470
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,397
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

471
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,927
And I'll see you in class.

472
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,771
At ease.

473
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,233
That guy don't have his head on right.

474
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:03,006
I was fine!
I don't need your help!

475
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,850
Okay, okay.

476
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:14,185
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- I tried feeding him.

477
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,849
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

478
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,723
- Would you help me?
- No.

479
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:21,457
Just the thought of...

480
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:30,971
- Emergency.
- What are you...? I... Hey!

481
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,572
Hi.

482
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:35,633
What's up with him?

483
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,700
Where are you going?

484
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:25,055
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

485
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,197
Ha-ha.

486
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:21,106
I should go, okay?

487
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:23,509
Call me, you guys,
if you need anything.

488
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,343
My number's on the fridge.

489
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,905
Are you okay?

490
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:31,612
Oh... Wow.

491
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:35,852
Is there anything I can do?

492
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,654
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

493
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:40,559
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

494
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:43,688
I mean, they're just kids,
you know.

495
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:46,165
Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

496
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:49,101
After you shower.
Or, before. It doesn't matter.

497
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,161
I'll see you guys.

498
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:59,445
Very funny.
Thank you for the letter.

499
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:27,470
Guys, be quiet.
I told you he had boobs.

500
00:36:28,908 --> 00:36:31,638
Lulu, can I see you
in the family room?

501
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,007
Who are those people?

502
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,746
My troop. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.

503
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,685
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

504
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:46,883
Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

505
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,482
Mom's our den mother!

506
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,825
You better tell your little
friends that they have to...

507
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:02,295
- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- I don't do cookies.

508
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:05,103
We have to. If we don't
sell enough cookies,

509
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:07,838
we can't go
to the Jamboree.

510
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,575
They're waving at me.

511
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:20,089
All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

512
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,886
Tonight I'm your den mother.

513
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,587
That means if you want
to live to see tomorrow,

514
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,562
you do exactly as I say!

515
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,825
Do we understand each other?

516
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,833
Den mother,
you frighten me.

517
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:34,630
Good.

518
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,830
Now, let's move out!

519
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:49,681
- I call the front!
- Middle back!

520
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:51,445
Fine, I'll get the back.

521
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,953
Yeah, he's kind
of a dork, but he's okay.

522
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,319
<i>- How's Helga?
- Helga's fine.</i>

523
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,688
<i>- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...</i>

524
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:02,525
Look, Mom, I'd love to stay and chat
all day, but I have homework to do.

525
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,746
Oh, no!
They're back!

526
00:38:32,424 --> 00:38:35,882
Hey, Skeever, what glows
in the dark till you squish 'em?

527
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:37,053
Fireflies!

528
00:38:45,604 --> 00:38:47,731
Please. Leave us alone.

529
00:38:47,806 --> 00:38:49,636
This is troop 16 territory.

530
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:52,073
How are we supposed
to sell raffle tickets

531
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,737
if this place reeks
of your skanky cookies?

532
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:57,007
Hey! Hey!

533
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:59,675
Boo!

534
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:02,743
Get outta here!

535
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,256
- These cookies taste disgusting.
- I know.

536
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:10,259
- We really scared these guys.
- Where are my troops?

537
00:39:21,638 --> 00:39:22,969
Lulu, what happened?

538
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,600
Those boys over there
broke our cookies.

539
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:27,267
Broke your cookies.

540
00:39:27,343 --> 00:39:29,868
- Mm-hm.
- Lulu, this is not a toy.

541
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:34,974
Forget those boys. I am here
to protect you, not cookies.

542
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,042
Understand?

543
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,282
Good, now get in the car.
We're all going home.

544
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:44,053
Wait. You can't take us home yet.
You're supposed to take us to eat.

545
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,985
Where do you usually go?

546
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:50,429
Welcome to Woody Woodchuck's!

547
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,303
Let go!

548
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:05,938
And they say war is hell.

549
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:27,127
Ah! I figured you'd
come back for him.

550
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,101
Lulu, watch your brother.
Inexcusable!

551
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:32,694
- I've never left a man behind.
- Oh, relax.

552
00:40:32,772 --> 00:40:36,208
Once we found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning.

553
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,674
Whoa! Whoa!

554
00:40:37,744 --> 00:40:42,374
Not cool! Uh, there is no
freestyling in the ball pool!

555
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:55,724
Should we send
someone in after him?

556
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,561
We're good.

557
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,505
Holy baloney.

558
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,482
Ooh! Someone's gonna get busted!

559
00:41:20,551 --> 00:41:23,075
- Who are these people?
- What's wrong with this?

560
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:27,453
- We need to talk.
- Don't hate the player, hate the game.

561
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:35,956
Beat it.

562
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:40,863
Party's over!

563
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:42,665
Oh, my God, it's here.

564
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:45,730
You're all gonna clean
this house spotless.

565
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:49,039
No highway option.
Now, get cleaning.

566
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,079
- I'm outta here!
- Wait! Scott!

567
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:53,171
Move! Later!

568
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:03,015
Oh, no, you don't.

569
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,590
This is my favorite shirt.

570
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:30,307
Thank you.

571
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,708
Come on, Seth! You've
been in there for an hour!

572
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,581
Thanks a lot, Lt. Loser! Now
I'm gonna be the school joke.

573
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,880
I don't know what
I'll say to my friends.

574
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,921
You call those people
your friends?

575
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,481
They have no respect for you.
They have no respect for your home.

576
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,118
You have no respect
for yourself!

577
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,594
I do, too, respect myself!

578
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,029
Company downstairs.
That means you too.

579
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,499
You're not my dad.

580
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,433
In case you
haven't noticed,

581
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,199
this family is going through
a really hard time

582
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,867
and you're just making
everything a lot worse.

583
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,001
You have no feelings.

584
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:37,807
We hate you
and you hate us.

585
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,178
So why don't you
just leave us alone?

586
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:43,582
Don't worry. When your
mom comes back, I'm gone.

587
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:48,180
- Now what?
- Scott.

588
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,055
Run! Take the babies!
Go to your rooms!

589
00:44:16,417 --> 00:44:18,681
Shane! Come over here!
Take one of these!

590
00:44:18,752 --> 00:44:20,117
Lulu!

591
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:24,553
- Get inside. Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

592
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:27,809
Don't move.

593
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:34,253
Ahhhh!

594
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:46,898
Kids, it's safe!

595
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,598
- Who was that? What'd they want?
- What happened?

596
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:52,834
- Don't leave us!
- What do they want?

597
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:55,775
They were after the program
that your father invented.

598
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,879
They were after this.

599
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,884
All right, all right, come on,
guys. Let's hope this is it.

600
00:46:11,993 --> 00:46:15,485
<i>- 9- 2-6, 3-1-0-4-3.
- 9- 2-6...</i>

601
00:46:15,563 --> 00:46:16,621
<i>3- 1-0-4-3.</i>

602
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,563
<i>They want our
Ghost movie?</i>

603
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:20,464
Haven't they heard
of Blockbuster?

604
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:23,527
<i>- Tell her Rita Miller.
- Rita Miller.</i>

605
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:26,538
So there really are people
out there to get us?

606
00:46:26,606 --> 00:46:29,166
Yes, there are, Zoe.
That's why I'm here.

607
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:32,302
I think we're gonna need
a little more cooperation.

608
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:35,837
From now on,
you listen to me...

609
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,679
...and I'll listen to you too.

610
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:40,179
Deal?

611
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:44,117
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

612
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:46,988
- If you just relax...
- I'm relaxed! I'm relaxed!

613
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,994
You've got to relax!
Please, it's on the...

614
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:51,893
Okay. I'm not
feeling well, here.

615
00:46:51,964 --> 00:46:54,694
- Oh, my God! There's a bee!
- There's no bee!

616
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:57,327
- There's a bee!
- There's no bee! Stop! Please!

617
00:46:59,238 --> 00:47:02,435
Okay, so she wrecked the car.
The insurance will pay for it.

618
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:05,908
They were parallel parking.
The instructor jumped.

619
00:47:05,977 --> 00:47:08,878
But it's not about her.
It's about the boy.

620
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:10,676
Has he been
skipping class again?

621
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:13,741
Skipping class? He always
skips sixth period, but...

622
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:14,876
All right. Seth!

623
00:47:17,956 --> 00:47:19,446
Okay, take off the hat.

624
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,956
Go ahead.

625
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:27,557
Look at that.
That's how he showed up for practice.

626
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:31,658
I was doing a little recon in
his locker and I found this.

627
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:34,627
Okay?

628
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:38,732
If it was a girlie
magazine or a hamster, fine.

629
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:42,744
Boys will be boys.
But this is sick.

630
00:47:42,812 --> 00:47:44,939
All right. He dyed his hair.
He's not a Nazi.

631
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:47,380
This is not normal.
We're very concerned.

632
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:51,042
Why don't you get back to class?

633
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,520
Mr. Murney, would you
give me a minute?

634
00:47:58,895 --> 00:48:01,090
Look, I'm sure this
is about their father.

635
00:48:01,163 --> 00:48:05,532
We've tried to get Seth and Zoe to talk
to the psychologist, but they won't.

636
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,262
Maybe you can get through to them?
See what's going on?

637
00:48:08,336 --> 00:48:10,463
I'll talk to them
and see what I can do.

638
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,002
Thanks.

639
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:19,575
Seth, I don't understand
unless you explain it to me.

640
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,047
Why would you join wrestling
if you hate it?

641
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,107
Because my father
wanted me to!

642
00:48:24,185 --> 00:48:27,586
Look, I know you're
just trying to help, but don't!

643
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,850
I can take care of myself.

644
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,206
Refrigerator magnet.

645
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:57,047
Smart kid.

646
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,677
Red One!

647
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:04,484
You're in charge. Anyone gets within
40 clicks of the perimeter, signal me.

648
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,992
Keep all doors sealed, do
your homework, preheat the oven

649
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,257
and don't let Lulu
in the cookie jar.

650
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:45,393
- Everything's ready?
- Yeah.

651
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:50,924
Come on.

652
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:10,311
All right. All my Nazis
are finally here.

653
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:13,753
I want all of you
at attention!

654
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:17,188
Okay, let's start
where we left off yesterday.

655
00:51:02,635 --> 00:51:05,968
We open in a week, people.
The set isn't finished.

656
00:51:06,038 --> 00:51:09,405
Mother Abbess just quit
because she got shingles!

657
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:13,934
And every step-ball change would
make Bob Fosse rise from the grave

658
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:16,606
just so he could have
a heart attack again!

659
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:21,277
- I'm really sorry. I'll get it right.
- No, you won't, Seth.

660
00:51:21,353 --> 00:51:25,187
You and your mother
over here can't get it right.

661
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:28,623
And I know this
because I am a professional.

662
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:31,126
<i>I directed Show Boat
with Greg Brady.</i>

663
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:33,493
It wasn't union,
but it was good.

664
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:42,862
Obviously, I quit!

665
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,673
Exeunt stage right!

666
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:54,049
Seriously, Seth, if you drop me
again, I'm going to kill you.

667
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:56,347
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

668
00:51:56,419 --> 00:51:58,319
I'm fine.

669
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:01,080
Come on.

670
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:03,250
I'm not gonna quit!

671
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:07,319
- I don't expect you to understand...
- Hey...

672
00:52:07,397 --> 00:52:11,355
I may not understand a whole
hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

673
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,958
but I definitely
understand not quitting.

674
00:52:14,036 --> 00:52:17,130
And from what I see,
you're pretty good.

675
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:20,368
A little discipline,
you could make a go of this.

676
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:23,809
- But what about Murney?
- He's an all-talk spaz.

677
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:26,347
<i>So, The Sound of Music?</i>

678
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:29,349
- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

679
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:34,116
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

680
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:37,589
Nothing wrong with that.

681
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,717
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

682
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:42,695
They probably already do, Seth.

683
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:45,027
But you'll kill 'em later.

684
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:49,328
Come here.

685
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:52,860
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

686
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:56,204
Is performing
what makes you happy?

687
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,744
Yeah,
more than anything.

688
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:03,839
All right, fall in.

689
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:06,680
Company. Center stage.

690
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:12,217
Company! Center stage!

691
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,158
Who is this guy?

692
00:53:15,227 --> 00:53:20,597
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

693
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:24,466
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

694
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:26,969
all around the world.

695
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:30,098
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

696
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:34,907
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

697
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:39,678
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

698
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:42,276
and stealth air attacks!

699
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:47,483
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

700
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,617
...to direct this production?

701
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,161
Yes.

702
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,096
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir!

703
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,132
Once upon a time,
there was a family...

704
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,998
...of elves.

705
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:05,302
And one day the little elf family

706
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:08,707
went into the magic forest

707
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,009
to find a secret...

708
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:14,140
...gnome...

709
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:15,581
...facility,

710
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:21,521
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

711
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:27,528
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

712
00:54:27,595 --> 00:54:32,931
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

713
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:37,335
finishing off anything left alive.

714
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:45,576
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

715
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:47,807
We got 'em all.

716
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:54,148
Even the teeniest...

717
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:58,157
...littlest elf of all...

718
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:00,556
...Rodriguez.

719
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:04,153
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

720
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,755
Oh, come on...

721
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,994
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

722
00:55:09,068 --> 00:55:11,559
I'll write it down for you.

723
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:14,629
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

724
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,471
You gotta do the dance.

725
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:21,672
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

726
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:24,408
You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

727
00:55:24,983 --> 00:55:28,384
Come on.

728
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:45,658
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

729
00:55:45,736 --> 00:55:47,966
Seth.

730
00:55:48,038 --> 00:55:49,699
Zoe. Uh!

731
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:51,673
Today you drive.

732
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:54,870
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

733
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:57,140
Exactly.

734
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:03,042
We're all gonna die.

735
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:06,847
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

736
00:56:06,923 --> 00:56:08,618
In a minivan? No.

737
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:11,091
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

738
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,752
Especially when Zoe's driving.

739
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,901
- Zoe Plummer!
- Zoe, what are you doing?

740
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:23,460
- What are...? Slow down!
- Truck!

741
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,813
Whoa! Whoa!

742
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:35,747
- Whoa!
- Not bad.

743
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,214
Land! Solid land!

744
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:46,283
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

745
00:56:47,728 --> 00:56:50,219
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

746
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:51,959
- Play nicely.
- Sorry.

747
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,660
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

748
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:59,000
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

749
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:02,165
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

750
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,802
Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

751
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:07,574
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

752
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:11,981
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

753
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:15,948
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

754
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:20,219
Well, keep up the good work.

755
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,656
Oh!

756
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:26,095
You look very nice today.

757
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:31,099
Oh. Thanks.

758
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,696
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

759
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:37,206
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

760
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:41,371
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

761
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:44,347
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

762
00:57:44,415 --> 00:57:47,145
Seth?

763
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:50,085
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

764
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:54,190
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

765
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:56,452
- I quit.
- You quit.

766
00:57:56,526 --> 00:57:59,518
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

767
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:02,565
And everybody knows
that quitters...

768
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:04,099
...quit.

769
00:58:06,937 --> 00:58:08,837
What are you scared of, Prancer?

770
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:13,000
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

771
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:16,442
<i>- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.</i>

772
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:19,174
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

773
00:58:19,248 --> 00:58:21,910
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

774
00:58:21,984 --> 00:58:25,852
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

775
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:29,913
Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

776
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:36,286
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

777
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:39,967
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

778
00:58:40,035 --> 00:58:42,868
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

779
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:47,067
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

780
00:58:47,142 --> 00:58:49,302
Where? When?

781
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:52,937
- After school.
- Okay.

782
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:57,975
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

783
00:58:58,052 --> 00:58:59,610
Okay?

784
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:04,385
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

785
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:15,530
Out of my way!

786
00:59:17,603 --> 00:59:20,436
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

787
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:28,443
Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

788
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,718
Oh, that is so gross.

789
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,191
Come on! Come on!

790
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,661
What? That's it!

791
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:49,256
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

792
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,836
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

793
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:05,973
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

794
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:08,817
Oooh!

795
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:11,251
Rule number one.

796
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:15,587
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

797
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:20,459
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

798
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,556
I'll be your daddy.

799
01:00:26,235 --> 01:00:28,863
Ah!

800
01:00:28,937 --> 01:00:31,770
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

801
01:00:32,608 --> 01:00:34,166
Oh, God!

802
01:00:34,243 --> 01:00:36,973
From this position,
it's relatively easy

803
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:40,640
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

804
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:44,347
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

805
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:47,844
The chicken wing.

806
01:00:47,922 --> 01:00:49,651
The arm bar.

807
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:54,158
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

808
01:00:54,228 --> 01:00:58,062
- Ahhhh!
... the pacifier!

809
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:10,201
Any questions?

810
01:01:10,277 --> 01:01:12,507
Anything you
didn't understand?

811
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:15,572
Ah. The nipple crippler.

812
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:19,551
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

813
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:23,611
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

814
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:29,856
And finally...

815
01:01:35,134 --> 01:01:37,227
Pinned!

816
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,462
That was awesome!

817
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,305
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

818
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:51,575
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

819
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,863
Go!

820
01:02:17,207 --> 01:02:18,901
Sorry!

821
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,774
I didn't get that cone!

822
01:02:35,057 --> 01:02:36,786
Crawl!

823
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:54,698
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

824
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:25,435
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

825
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:38,509
Okay.

826
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,271
- Again.
- Again?

827
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:40,604
You're going to sleep.
Good night, Peter Panda.

828
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,439
Good night, Daddy.

829
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,346
Good night, little fella.

830
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:57,816
Good night.

831
01:05:07,135 --> 01:05:11,036
Hey, Skeever, what do you put in a jar
and shake till they're dead?

832
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:13,334
Fireflies?

833
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:19,509
Go away
and we won't hurt you.

834
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,614
Hiya!

835
01:05:37,663 --> 01:05:39,824
Don't even think about it.

836
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,077
Cookie!

837
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:03,949
Eat it, you jerk!

838
01:06:04,022 --> 01:06:06,490
Go get 'em!

839
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:10,622
Customer service.

840
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:21,294
From now on, you do things our way!

841
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:23,100
No highway option!

842
01:06:23,173 --> 01:06:26,266
Ah!

843
01:06:43,426 --> 01:06:46,053
- Gary the duck?
- No.

844
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,152
We've been
here two weeks.

845
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,494
This is a matter of national security.

846
01:06:50,565 --> 01:06:54,661
Well, I am sorry, sir, but none
of these answers ring true.

847
01:07:00,008 --> 01:07:03,910
Howard. I'm so stupid.

848
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:07,740
Is it "my angel"?

849
01:07:08,682 --> 01:07:10,582
Yes, it is indeed.

850
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:19,622
Well, I'll leave you to your business.

851
01:07:25,131 --> 01:07:28,328
Please, Howard,
no more surprises.

852
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:53,014
Zoe, a rookie sniper
could drop you like a deer.

853
01:07:53,091 --> 01:07:56,527
- Good.
- Good?

854
01:07:56,595 --> 01:07:59,359
All right,
this is about Scott again.

855
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,456
No, it's not.

856
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:07,664
You were right about him.
Stupid guy.

857
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:11,230
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

858
01:08:12,143 --> 01:08:15,670
Nothing. Okay.

859
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:28,719
You know, when I was little,
my mom left.

860
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:33,695
My dad was a spec ops soldier like me.

861
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:39,758
When I was eight, he shipped
me off to military school.

862
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:49,474
I guess he liked being a soldier
more than he liked being a dad.

863
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,308
One day, I get a letter.

864
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:56,943
No more dad.

865
01:08:57,987 --> 01:09:00,181
That's terrible.

866
01:09:02,023 --> 01:09:06,483
For a long time I thought if I talked
about it, I was letting him down.

867
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:10,429
Like I was supposed to be brave
or something.

868
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:15,265
Yeah.

869
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:22,339
It's okay to talk
about your dad, Zoe.

870
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:29,141
I do miss him so much.

871
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:33,681
I don't know, I just...

872
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:37,052
I wanna be strong for Lulu
and Tyler and Peter

873
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:39,683
and Seth and my mom.

874
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,694
That's such
a big burden to carry.

875
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,032
I know.

876
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:52,770
I miss him so much.

877
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:56,000
It's okay to miss your dad.

878
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:03,414
I'll get it.

879
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:07,549
- Really?
- Yes.

880
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:10,918
Seth! Seth! Guess what?
Mom's coming home.

881
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:14,288
- When?
- Tomorrow! She's coming home tomorrow!

882
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:16,485
- When did you talk?
- Mommy's coming.

883
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,721
Here, buddy,
Mommy's coming home!

884
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:20,058
Mom's coming home!

885
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,688
She is?

886
01:10:21,765 --> 01:10:23,255
She's coming back.

887
01:10:26,236 --> 01:10:28,397
Peter,
aren't you excited?

888
01:10:28,472 --> 01:10:33,932
- When's she gonna be here?
- So, what are we gonna do?

889
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:37,537
We should dress up nice.
We should make her something.

890
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,810
- We'll clean up the entire house.
- That's a good idea.

891
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:44,512
- We should make a banner too.
- In the family room.

892
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,635
What's wrong, Gary?
Foot got stuck?

893
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:10,673
Hang on, hang on.

894
01:11:12,046 --> 01:11:15,072
Okay, now just stay still.

895
01:11:36,336 --> 01:11:38,770
Hi. Come on in.

896
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,399
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

897
01:11:48,414 --> 01:11:50,278
<i>- Yes?
- Hey, it's Shane.</i>

898
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,840
I have excellent news.
I think I found GHOST.

899
01:11:52,918 --> 01:11:55,079
<i>- Do you have it?
- It's in a steel vault.</i>

900
01:11:55,154 --> 01:11:59,648
It needs some sort of two-pronged key.
I've been working on it, but it's tough.

901
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:02,226
Great. Good work.
We're on our way.

902
01:12:02,261 --> 01:12:05,287
Don't do anything further.
I'll be there soon.

903
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:06,922
Yes, sir.

904
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:11,596
Ready?

905
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:14,695
The good news is,
once I give this to my C.O.,

906
01:12:14,772 --> 01:12:17,605
whoever's been bothering you
ain't gonna be.

907
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:19,666
- Really?
- Really.

908
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:24,010
What's wrong? Your mother's
coming. You should be happy.

909
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:26,982
But, Shane, doesn't that
mean you have to go?

910
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:31,183
You should get ready.
Your mother will be home soon.

911
01:12:49,205 --> 01:12:53,039
I had a fight with Zoe before I left,
so they probably trashed the place.

912
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:42,054
Welcome home, Mom.

913
01:13:43,957 --> 01:13:48,017
Hi! I missed you!

914
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,085
Guy!

915
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:59,901
Shane, I am so proud of you.
I truly am.

916
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:02,907
I am going to give you
your choice of assignment.

917
01:14:02,975 --> 01:14:07,240
Anywhere you want to go,
you just name it.

918
01:14:07,312 --> 01:14:10,076
Well, I appreciate that.

919
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:12,912
But I'll have to think about it.

920
01:14:14,185 --> 01:14:15,846
You're gonna think about it?

921
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:18,890
Well, the military's
all I've ever known.

922
01:14:18,957 --> 01:14:21,892
- I have no regrets.
- I should hope not.

923
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,393
It's just that being
with this family...

924
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,725
- I've never had a...
- Put your hands up!

925
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,259
The Chuns?

926
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,603
You gotta be kidding.
I swear I checked them out.

927
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:37,903
Give us the key.

928
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:42,638
- Put your hands up!
- Okay. All right.

929
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:44,577
Here.

930
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:47,076
Now!

931
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:55,348
You promised us GHOST
months ago!

932
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:58,451
Well, I'm sorry.
There were delays.

933
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:00,188
Shane!

934
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,128
Stop talking.

935
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,530
Shane's not gonna be
babysitting you anymore.

936
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,195
I trusted you.
Howard trusted you.

937
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:14,299
You've betrayed us
and you've betrayed this country.

938
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,277
Guess what?
North Korea pays better.

939
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,542
Chun, watch them.
They're squirmy.

940
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:24,441
You two, come with me.

941
01:16:01,653 --> 01:16:04,645
Did you bring the
stethoscope, Mrs. Chun?

942
01:16:04,723 --> 01:16:07,419
No, but I've
got some C-4.

943
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:19,496
I just had my eyebrows done.

944
01:16:42,025 --> 01:16:43,822
Quiet!

945
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,565
I said "Quiet,"
you little bug!

946
01:16:54,704 --> 01:16:56,227
Now, Peter!

947
01:16:56,338 --> 01:16:57,327
Ah!

948
01:17:05,114 --> 01:17:06,274
Hiya!

949
01:17:06,348 --> 01:17:08,339
Well, that's cute!

950
01:17:32,474 --> 01:17:34,338
That stuff doesn't hurt!

951
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:42,109
Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

952
01:17:42,182 --> 01:17:43,774
Hold on, I got it.

953
01:17:44,918 --> 01:17:46,146
Shane!

954
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,654
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

955
01:17:48,722 --> 01:17:50,690
I'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

956
01:17:50,757 --> 01:17:53,190
Hurry!

957
01:17:53,259 --> 01:17:55,159
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

958
01:17:55,228 --> 01:17:57,423
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

959
01:18:02,668 --> 01:18:03,965
Hold on!

960
01:18:05,705 --> 01:18:08,037
They're headed for the car!

961
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:11,132
- Zoe, call 911.
- I forgot my cell phone.

962
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:15,009
- Great. The only time you don't.
- We're gonna be okay!

963
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:27,825
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

964
01:18:27,893 --> 01:18:29,121
Find a cop!

965
01:18:38,903 --> 01:18:39,961
Ahh!

966
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:54,646
- He's gaining on us.
- I'll handle it.

967
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:23,543
Look, Zoe! It's the cops!

968
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:35,313
I assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

969
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:40,554
I accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

970
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:43,324
If I had better resources...

971
01:19:53,173 --> 01:19:56,904
I told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

972
01:19:56,977 --> 01:20:00,672
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

973
01:20:00,747 --> 01:20:04,615
- One, two...
- Bill.

974
01:20:04,684 --> 01:20:07,151
She doesn't know.

975
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,484
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

976
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,024
Leave the family alone
and I'll get you in.

977
01:20:13,092 --> 01:20:14,616
You better not be bluffing.

978
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:23,293
Zoe! Seth!

979
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:27,202
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

980
01:20:29,674 --> 01:20:31,801
Ah!

981
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:35,312
That was the code. I saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

982
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:40,340
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

983
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,283
You can't make him do this.

984
01:20:42,353 --> 01:20:45,685
I know Howard.
You haven't got a chance.

985
01:21:25,894 --> 01:21:29,091
Quick like a turtle!
Lie on your back!

986
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:55,613
And that's
the Peter Panda dance.

987
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:58,749
All right. Go.

988
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:01,725
Yeah, right.

989
01:22:01,761 --> 01:22:03,820
Okay, I'll go first.

990
01:22:13,139 --> 01:22:15,869
Great work, Shane.
I knew you'd figure it out.

991
01:22:15,942 --> 01:22:19,035
I think you'd better open it.

992
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:24,373
Wait, wait, wait!

993
01:22:24,449 --> 01:22:26,713
Back away.

994
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,588
You open it.

995
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:33,055
Come on.
I walked the floor first.

996
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,286
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

997
01:22:35,961 --> 01:22:37,053
Ah!

998
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,139
Ahhh!

999
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,156
Any last words, Shane?

1000
01:23:11,227 --> 01:23:13,286
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

1001
01:23:21,904 --> 01:23:24,065
Shane, are you okay?

1002
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:25,902
Oh!

1003
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:30,711
She was never
a good neighbor.

1004
01:24:01,341 --> 01:24:03,434
Zoe, you're going too fast!

1005
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:05,501
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

1006
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:08,946
Who said anything about
stopping? I'm parking.

1007
01:24:22,394 --> 01:24:26,387
- What are you doing to these kids?
- Hands where I can see them!

1008
01:24:26,465 --> 01:24:28,695
Okay. Calm down.

1009
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:30,997
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

1010
01:24:33,838 --> 01:24:35,806
I want the GHOST.

1011
01:24:42,714 --> 01:24:47,014
Um... Calm down.
It's just a duck.

1012
01:24:47,085 --> 01:24:49,383
- Where's the GHOST?
- I have it.

1013
01:24:51,488 --> 01:24:52,853
Bring it here!

1014
01:24:58,495 --> 01:24:59,894
Put it on the ground.

1015
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:08,164
Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

1016
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:11,866
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

1017
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:19,843
Gary, now!

1018
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,315
Ah!

1019
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,151
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1020
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:43,102
So I guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

1021
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:47,870
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

1022
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:50,809
I'm still here,
aren't I?

1023
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:53,879
Yeah.

1024
01:25:55,849 --> 01:26:00,411
- What now?
- I don't know. I'm on dry land.

1025
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:02,148
True.

1026
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:04,714
Which means you're
the superior officer.

1027
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,692
True.

1028
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,659
So you tell me.

1029
01:26:11,497 --> 01:26:12,521
Um...

1030
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:18,597
Lulu!

1031
01:26:18,671 --> 01:26:21,003
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I have a few words?

1032
01:26:21,074 --> 01:26:22,837
Sure.

1033
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:24,604
Well, we... I... You know.

1034
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,277
Oh.

1035
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:31,576
We'll talk later.

1036
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:35,518
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- I suppose it is.

1037
01:26:35,587 --> 01:26:40,115
- I guess you'll be leaving us now.
- I guess so.

1038
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,128
I want you to have this.

1039
01:26:47,798 --> 01:26:50,323
Because I don't want you
ever to forget me.

1040
01:26:53,804 --> 01:26:56,500
I will never forget you.

1041
01:26:58,976 --> 01:27:01,444
'Cause you're the
best friend I ever had.

1042
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:04,912
No matter how far...

1043
01:27:04,981 --> 01:27:07,779
...or long life takes me away,

1044
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:10,752
I will always be thinking about you.

1045
01:27:12,822 --> 01:27:15,052
I love you, Shane.

1046
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,819
I love you too.

1047
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:31,672
From now on, it's your command.

1048
01:27:34,576 --> 01:27:36,635
At ease, soldiers.

1049
01:27:36,712 --> 01:27:40,546
Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

1050
01:27:44,152 --> 01:27:45,312
Awww.

1051
01:27:45,386 --> 01:27:47,047
Look who just woke up.

1052
01:27:47,855 --> 01:27:49,880
- Shane?
- Yes?

1053
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:54,018
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

1054
01:27:54,095 --> 01:27:56,586
We still have one more mission.

1055
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:37,732
Looks like you have
a hit on your hands.

1056
01:28:37,803 --> 01:28:39,929
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

1057
01:28:40,004 --> 01:28:43,872
You should take over the drama
department instead of wrestling.

1058
01:28:45,143 --> 01:28:48,112
It's gonna be nice
having you around now.

1059
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:50,704
Now that Murney's found
his true calling.

1060
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:02,450
It's gonna be my pleasure
serving with you.

1061
