so many thrills...

and anger management classes,

00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,140
and I order said child remanded
into the care of the Family Services,

the father can demonstrate

She used to sleep with this.
Would you give that to her?

1368

- Make sure she gets that?
- Yeah.

anger's your biggest tool.

1383

Yeah, yeah, I know him, yeah.

1538
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,380
They're working at Freddy's gym,

1539
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,405
and they're doing this, uh, charity event
for wounded veterans.

1540
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,900
And they want to know
if you want to go eight rounds,

1541
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,940
with Brady, for the cause.

1542
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,281
We think that you'd bring
in a lot of people, big crowd.

1543

Raise a lot of money.

1544

It's your opportunity
if you want it, Billy.

1545
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,446
You don't need a license
to fight for a charity, so...

- Good seeing you, Tick. Let me know.
- Yeah.

You gotta do what we practiced here.

He's been wearing the same
set of clothes for the past two days.

1559
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,660
He said something about his mom and
dad getting in a fight last night,

1560
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,580
and then his dad went out
after his mom left.

1561
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,700
- His mom left?
- Yeah.

You should find out
if he ain't got a place to stay.

1565
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,820
If he's out on the street,
then we can figure out

1566
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,321
where we can put him,
what we need to do, all right?

1567
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,300
"Kodug"? Is that a word?

1568
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,780
I feel like I've heard
someone say, like, kodug.

1569
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,740
Or Kodug's like a country
or something like that.

1570
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,126
Can we just get out of here?

didn't like you watching the fights.

you can't do it.

He's a liar.

1710
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,100
Yeah, look, I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about you.

1711
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,380
I can't do this without you.

1712
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,164
I can't do this with you.

1713
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,340
Why?

1714
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,180
I don't train pro fighters.

1715
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,740
What, you're saying to me
that someone came in

1716
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,650
and offered the boys a pro shot,
you would've give it to them?

1717
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,011
All I need is the six weeks.

1718
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,740

1719

You get my everything.

1721
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,409
This is about my family.

1722
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,330

What?

1730
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,180
He tried to protect his mom,

1731
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,611
and his dad shot him.

1732
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,241

1738
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,367
I should've known right then.

1739
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,645

you could control that."

1752
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,380
God must have some kind of plan

1753

to teach me

1754
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,601
some kind of lesson.

- Hmm?
- "You're a dream crusher."

how not to be a dream crusher.

you'll still keep taking care of yourself,

1774

Mr. Hope,
after careful review of your file,

1776

including the assessment
from your case worker,

1777
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,300
I'm gonna remove
the visitation restrictions,

1778
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,420
and the reunification
can begin next week.

1779
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,380
Your attorney will receive
notification in the mail.

1780
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,005
Good job, Mr. Hope.

1782
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,605
Thank you.

01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,660
You have new shoes?

1784
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,860
No, I've had these.

1785
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,340
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1786
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,740
Baby, I don't remember
those shoes. Remember...

1787
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,660
I don't have that much food here,
baby, but I can make you an egg.

1788
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,125
You want an egg?

1789

No, why aren't you eating?

Why didn't you eat anything?

- You think I'm a baby.
- I don't think you're a baby.

1792
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,940
Then how come you won't let me come?

1793

Look, 'cause I told you,
I told you it wasn't up to me.

all the decisions, you know?

1799
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,980
me, I can't make them, you know?

01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,286
Not so much.

1801
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,161

to eat something? Just, just...

there's hope...

you can't avoid saying it...

1859
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:47,460
that this evening could produce
a great story

1860
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,100

01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,940
who's been through so much,
but realistically,

1862
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,340
what chance is there that Hope
could come back and win

The cards are stacked against Hope.

Um, his age, um,
the fact that he's been off,

1867

the best fighter

1868
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,281

The ultimate revenge motive
for Hope tonight,

1874
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,820
is that in his heart, he believes

he's avenging the death of his
wife in a bizarre incident

Escobar is a product of Colombia.

In the past, Roy Jones,

1892
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,180
when we spoke about fighters
from Colombia,

1893
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,780
almost always, they were big punchers.

1894
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,100
This is a different story.

1895
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,180
JONES JR.: Yeah,
this is a whole different story.

1896
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,380
Not often do we talk
about Colombian fighters

1897
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,260
and talk about the full package.

1898
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,260
Most of them come with an astronomical
amount of punching power,

1899
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,020
but not skills to match that.

as he is powerful.

I said, more recently, Sergio Martinez,

1903
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,660
but Carlos Melzon was a beast,

1904
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,900
