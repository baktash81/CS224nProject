1
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,086
I'm gonna miss you.

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,796
Wish I didn't have to go.

3
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,383
I love you so much.

4
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,679
Now you're gonna take your pills,
sweetheart, huh?

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,891
All right? Don't just chew 'em up
and spit 'em out.

6
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,104
I can't believe you're traveling, mom.
I know how much you hate to fly.

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,316
Yeah, I do, but some things are important.

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,694
Thank you for letting me
leave him with you.

9
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,697
Of course. He's a cutie.

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,532
Hey, kids! Come say hi to grandma!

11
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,284
I'm on the phone!

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,828
So, um, the yellow pills are twice a day,

13
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,538
- and the blue ones...
- I know, mom.

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,998
You gave me the list, remember?

15
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,541
Yeah, I know, but...

16
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,710
And these are his toys.

17
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,546
- And he sleeps with Mr. Moose.
- Hey!

18
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,228
If you guys don't come in here right now,

19
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,466
I'm gonna flush your phones
down the toilet!

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,719
I don't wanna see them...
I mean, i-i'm...

21
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,263
I don't wanna disturb them.
I know they're busy.

22
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,474
And hey, don't you yell so much!

23
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,435
I don't want you to stress him out.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,062
- Mom...
- He's already... freaked.

25
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,149
I don't think he' stressed. He's fine.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,444
- Hi, grandma.
- Oh, hi, Tommy!

27
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,362
So... who died?

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,156
Oh, an old, old friend.

29
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,950
Hey, maybe you'll play
with dashiell some time.

30
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,747
Maybe.

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,585
Okay, um...

32
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,298
If anything should happen,

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,009
know that I love you, dashiell. Yeah.

34
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,470
Mommy loves you
and you're gonna be taken care of.

35
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,097
Okay, mom, stop being so dramatic.

36
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,350
Okay? Flying is very safe.

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,226
You'll be back before you know it.

38
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,187
Nothing is gonna happen.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,221
Claire!

40
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,514
Allie.

41
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,391
So glad you came.

42
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,559
- Thanks for letting me know.
- Oh.

43
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,062
Of course. Mom really missed you.

44
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,397
She really loved you.

45
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,816
I loved her.

46
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,276
Stop it! I can see you!

47
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,403
Three now.

48
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,738
Three,
can you believe it? Stop it!

49
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,534
Dad will be really glad you came.
It'll mean a lot to him.

50
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,432
Wonderful.

51
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,167
I'm wearing high heels in honor of Joyce.

52
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,961
- Aww.
- She had such great legs,

53
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,004
and she always loved to show them off.

54
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,758
She did! She had the best legs.

55
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,593
Claire! Oh, you made it!

56
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,388
Oh, that would mean so much to her.

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,182
This is Claire,
one of Joyce's oldest friends.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,393
They were at college together.

59
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,396
Claire lives in Ohio now.

60
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,191
- We're so sorry for your loss.
- Oh, bless you, darling.

61
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,026
Call us and come over to dinner, Howard.

62
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,405
- Thank you, I will.
- We love you.

63
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,158
Claire.

64
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:04,077
Howard... I'm gonna kill you.

65
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,415
Now that she's gone,
now that it can't hurt her,

66
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,624
I'm gonna kill you.

67
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,629
This weekend.
I'm gonna do it this weekend.

68
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,466
Howard, oh!

69
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,719
- Dear Howard! Oh, you dear man!
- Oh, hi. Hi, hi.

70
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,013
I'm so, so sorry.

71
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,641
You think you'll get used to it,

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,102
used to the idea of loss.

73
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,356
When you see it this far
over the horizon...

74
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,361
It's like that shot
in Lawrence of Arabia,

75
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:42,908
you know, the little speck
that gets closer and closer.

76
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,916
I learned a lot.

77
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,503
I changed a lot.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,173
I learned Patience, humility.

79
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,550
I learned...

80
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,803
To enjoy lattes.

81
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:08,517
Some of you know that Joyce
just loved her afternoon lattes,

82
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,394
and she got me addicted
to them as well.

83
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,525
Sometimes I... think
I can still hear her say...

84
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,530
"Howie! Go to the cafe
and get some lattes, will ya?"

85
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,163
I met Joyce in New York.

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,584
We were married...

87
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,420
Seven months after we'd met.

88
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,009
And I have no regrets.

89
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,222
None.

90
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:55,188
Darling, I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...

91
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,107
Is this the wrong entrance?

92
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,067
Said "chapel" on the door.

93
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,988
- Oh...
- Howard.

94
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,282
Did I interrupt your eulogy?

95
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,076
- God, I'm sorry.
- That's all right, Evelyn.

96
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,453
It's all right, please.
Everyone, this is Evelyn.

97
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,083
Um... Evelyn was Joyce's
college roommate,

98
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,711
- believe it or not.
- Why wouldn't they believe it?

99
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,754
- That's just an expression.
- I was in the back,

100
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,882
using the restroom. It's like a maze.

101
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,301
- Understood. Yeah.
- A labyrinth.

102
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,137
Nice photo.
A bit sanitized, maybe.

103
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,015
- What?
- Well, she looks pleasant,

104
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,852
but Joyce was never just pleasant.
She was always sparkly.

105
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,897
"Sparkly"? Evelyn,
would you mind taking a seat?

106
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,022
Would you mind, please?

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,484
I'm in the middle of my eulogy to my wife.

108
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,154
My wife of 51 years has just died!

109
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,365
I understand. My friend just died.

110
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,328
My friend of 60 years. How 'bout that?

111
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,662
Isn't that something?

112
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,877
Oh, go ahead.
You were saying something about...

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,464
"No regrets," "darling Joyce,"
"bottom of my heart."

114
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,883
Yes, I...

115
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,886
I was about to say...

116
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:12,515
I admired her courage
in fighting this awful disease.

117
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,114
Evelyn! Evie!

118
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,785
It's-it's me, it's Claire.

119
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,536
Hi, Claire. I know it's you.

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,997
I haven't lost my marbles. Yet.

121
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,708
- Or my eyesight.
- Get in.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,088
- Let me give you a ride.
- Do you have a driver's license?

123
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,424
I do. I took the test two months ago.

124
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,177
And you passed?
Did you bribe the instructor?

125
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,681
I didn't have to!
I'm an excellent driver.

126
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,016
- I trust the bus more.
- Oh, get in!

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,434
I need to talk to you.

128
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,854
About what? What do you need
to talk about?

129
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,984
- Come on, move it!
- God, hold your horses!

130
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,736
What kind of person honks a horn
in a graveyard?

131
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,031
Jeez! Pass, there's room. Go!

132
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,742
- You jerk!
- Get in, Evie!

133
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,745
I... I need to talk to you.

134
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
I told him.

135
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,749
You told him what?

136
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,004
I told him I was gonna kill him
this weekend.

137
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,588
I'm gonna kill the bastard.

138
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,595
I could chat. A little bit.

139
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,889
You're not gonna kill anyone.

140
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,351
- I am.
- You always had big ideas,

141
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,645
but very little follow-through.

142
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,730
Not true!

143
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,458
Oh, what about the time you were gonna
go out in the middle of the night

144
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,485
and paint a vagina
on that fraternity house?

145
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,363
I don't remember that.

146
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,115
You talked about it for weeks,

147
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,910
you were gonna do it for homecoming.

148
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,412
No kidding! What happened?

149
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
Nothing! Nothing happened.
You never did it.

150
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,630
Or what about the time you were gonna
become a lounge singer?

151
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,382
Or drive down to Peru?

152
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:13,428
There's still time.

153
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,807
- Are you still playing?
- 'Course I'm still playing!

154
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,436
Without my cello, I'd be lost,
completely lost!

155
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,272
- Well, good for you!
- Mm.

156
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm not with the orchestra anymore.

157
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,193
I'm with a couple of ensembles.

158
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:33,239
One is devoted totally
to modern composers,

159
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,076
and the other is all bach.

160
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,328
Do-do you still have
that cute little house?

161
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,290
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful.

162
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,376
Um, so I was wondering...

163
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,004
If-if you could help me.

164
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,839
What, murder him?

165
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,842
There's a little thing called jail.

166
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,387
Nice place to visit,
but you wouldn't want to live there.

167
00:09:56,471 --> 00:10:00,350
And let's take a moment to remember
our beautiful, kind, happy friend

168
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,060
whose funeral we attended today.

169
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
I've thought about her.

170
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,232
I prioritized her happiness over mine,

171
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,567
over my-my sanity.

172
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,737
She never asked you to do anything.

173
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,824
And I told you,
I told you to go the police.

174
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,993
Yeah, you did.
They wouldn't have believed me.

175
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,203
I mean, back then?

176
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,666
"Why were you alone in that house?

177
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,168
You knew your friend was out of town."

178
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,505
"Why were you alone
in your best friend's house

179
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,132
with her husband?"

180
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,552
Mm. "Best friend." I thought
I was your best friend at that time.

181
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,012
You were both my best friends!

182
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,098
I'm just yankin' your chain.

183
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,059
It would've ruined her life
if! Had told the police.

184
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,895
We'll never know.

185
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,981
Her life might've been better.

186
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,196
What's the plan?

187
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,032
I'm gonna shoot him.
I'm gonna buy a gun

188
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,493
and I'm gonna take it to the wake.

189
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,163
- Mm-hmm.
- You wanna come with me?

190
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,917
Sure, scarface. Sounds like fun.

191
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,220
Oh!

192
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,972
Uh, hello.

193
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,808
- Hello.
- I-I'd like to buy a handgun.

194
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,728
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, something not to heavy, please.

195
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,439
- And maybe a silencer.
- Hm.

196
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,524
Well, I can't sell you a silencer.

197
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,860
You can't legally buy
a suppressor in California.

198
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,403
- Tsk.
- Oh.

199
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,905
You can wear earplugs.

200
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,741
Well, what kind of firearm
would you recommend for me?

201
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,285
I want something that's... light.

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,912
Well, what're you gonna use it for?

203
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,080
Tell 'im.

204
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,957
Sport shooting? Self defense?

205
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,167
Yea... self defense.

206
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,420
Okay, well, how about
this little Davis derringer?

207
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,671
Fits right in your pocket,

208
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,516
or your pocketbook,
right next to your keys.

209
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,842
- Oh, it's cute!
- Very!

210
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,471
.22 caliber, two shots.
Nice backup piece.

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,056
Wanna hold it?

212
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,643
- Oh, sure!
- It's used, costs about $125.

213
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,853
- It's light!
- How's the recoil?

214
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,939
Recoil?

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,359
Um, not gonna lie, it has a little kick.
Not much there to absorb the shock.

216
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,987
Do you have arthritis
in your wrists and hands?

217
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,782
A little bit in my-in my left wrist.

218
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,618
But I take medication.
Hips are my problem.

219
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,536
Mine too! I got
a hip replacement last year.

220
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,330
Oh, how'd that go for you?

221
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,959
Pretty good, thanks.
I also recommend this beretta 92.

222
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,671
Looks heavier.

223
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,799
It has very little recoil.
Very smooth, feels like a Cadillac.

224
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,970
I think that the key here is
to use a load that lessens the kick.

225
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,682
These .9mm bullets are very lightweight.

226
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,185
Hollow point for maximum damage.

227
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,187
Oh, maximum damage sounds neat.

228
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,273
Yeah, I'll take... I'll take
the smaller gun.

229
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,193
Um, okay. I'll need your California
driver'slicense or your Cal ID,

230
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,113
and you can take the handgun safety test
right here in the store.

231
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,490
I don't have a California license.

232
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,201
- You don't have California license?
- No, I live in Ohio.

233
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,163
Then I can't
sell you a gun. Sorry.

234
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,625
Well, darn it! We tried.

235
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,174
So, did you get that out of your system?

236
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,387
The whole dirty Harry,
death wishthing?

237
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,098
No, I didn't get it out of my system!

238
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,559
God!

239
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,936
I should've bought
a gun at home and brought it.

240
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,149
Couldn't have gotten it
on the plane.

241
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,986
Oh, Claire, it's been decades,
and not like a couple of decades,

242
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,031
it's been four and a half decades!

243
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,034
It was yesterday.

244
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,702
Yeah.

245
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,412
Oh, I remember.

246
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,623
The necklace Joyce was wearing
in the photo, at the funeral home?

247
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,459
I gave her that necklace.

248
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,003
- I had one too.
- Do you have any poison?

249
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,966
I have a cyanide pill in case I'm captured
by the enemy. You can have it.

250
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,802
I'm just gonna have to stab him
in the stomach.

251
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,763
Are you going to the wake?

252
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,350
No. I'll read about it
in the newspaper tomorrow.

253
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,727
I have a rehearsal.

254
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,020
You hate him too!

255
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,357
I don't hate anybody, it's too exhausting.

256
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,027
Well, let me give you
a-a ride to your house.

257
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,946
I think I'd rather take the bus.

258
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,991
Evie... Evie...

259
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,123
You're the only person I ever told.

260
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,334
Jesus! Really?

261
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,673
Well... except for a therapist.

262
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,678
I had a therapist
after my second divorce.

263
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,390
Clearly it's done wonders for you.

264
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,393
Evie... come with me.

265
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,770
Bye, Claire.

266
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,138
Hey, Ernie.

267
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,562
How's it hanging, Phil?

268
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,622
Oh, god...

269
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,336
Oh, god...

270
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,463
Oh, goddammit!

271
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,556
Yes?

272
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,478
Yes. Coming!

273
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,816
- Hi!
- Remember me?

274
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,818
'Course I remember you!

275
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,071
Are you visiting your grandpa again?

276
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,073
My parents are over there.

277
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,075
- Mm.
- I wanted to come and say hi.

278
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,204
- Well, thanks!
- Can I come in?

279
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,123
Oh, sure, for a second.

280
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,963
Aren't your parents gonna miss you?

281
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,132
They didn't miss me last time.

282
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,969
That day we played checkers.

283
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,097
Wanna play again?

284
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,975
You know, um...

285
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,520
I can't right now.

286
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,815
Um... how's your grandfather? How's Walt?

287
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,403
He wants to teach me how to throw a ball
and shoot a gun.

288
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh, does he have one?

289
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,991
He has a baseball.

290
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,411
But does he have a, uh, gun?

291
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,536
Yeah.

292
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,249
- He has a gun.
- I think so.

293
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,544
He showed it to me.
He says he wants to teach me.

294
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,545
Huh.

295
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,008
Can we do that other thing
we did last time?

296
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,427
The fashion show?

297
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,723
Well, you did look cool in those heels.

298
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,309
But I don't have time right now.

299
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,563
- Oh...
- Wait, wait. Come here, come here.

300
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,444
Tell you what, you can choose
something from this to keep.

301
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,072
- Really?
- Why not?

302
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,451
Who else am I gonna leave 'em to?

303
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,369
Oh, except you can't have this one...

304
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,873
Or this one, and this one I got in Seoul

305
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,959
when I traveled all over
with the orchestra.

306
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,796
Can I have this?

307
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,798
Your ears aren't pierced, are they?

308
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,508
- Tsk.

309
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,511
Mm... not those, but how about these?

310
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,764
These are clip-ons.

311
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,683
See, you open them like that,
and you clip them...

312
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,936
Pop 'em right onto your earlobes.

313
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,482
- They don't pinch, do they?
- No, it's fine.

314
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,025
Well, go look at yourself.

315
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,698
Wow!

316
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,201
They're... beautiful.

317
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,788
You're beautiful, kid.

318
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,926
- Better get back to your parents.
- ' [9'99'931

319
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,976
Hey... hey!

320
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,438
Bye.

321
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,375
Oh, Joyce...

322
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,963
Oh, to hell with all this!

323
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,107
May I take your coat?

324
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,031
Yes.

325
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,617
Where's the kitchen?

326
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,454
- The kitchen or the bathroom?
- Kitchen.

327
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,874
Right in there. It's pretty busy
in there right now.

328
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,333
Good.

329
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,061
- What are you doing over here?
- Oh!

330
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,712
- Looking for the bathroom?
- No.

331
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,481
That's not the right order.
I want...

332
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,091
Tomato, olive, cheese.
Tomato, olive, cheese.

333
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,637
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- No, thanks.

334
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,865
No, wait! What are you doing?

335
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,769
Those go back in there
for another five minutes.

336
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,608
I love chocolate. I just can't.

337
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,943
Oh, wait! Is that for me? Thanks.

338
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,112
Claire, have you ever met Wendy?

339
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,616
Wendy brought us
this beautiful batch of brownies.

340
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,619
- Isn't that wonderful?
- The least I can do.

341
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,954
- Your mom was so wonderful.
- Thank you.

342
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,499
I was her art teacher. She was
a very talented painter.

343
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,543
- Was she?
- Oh, yes!

344
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,838
Thank you. Would you do me a favor
and run that back to the kitchen?

345
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,549
Guys! No more sugar.

346
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,260
No, you're gonna go crazy.

347
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,957
Claire?

348
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,166
Claire?

349
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,418
It's me, Ralph.

350
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,966
Ralph! What are you doing here?

351
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,136
Oh, Howard just called me out of the blue
and invited me to the memorial.

352
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,972
I wasn't busy, so I came.

353
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,183
Well... when did he call you?

354
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,979
Afew hours ago. I hope
you don't mind that I'm here.

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,565
I was very fond of Joyce.

356
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,108
You two were great friends.

357
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,736
And he told me that you were here.

358
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,074
- You look nice, Ralph.
- Thank you.

359
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,534
I'm glad you're still alive.

360
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,161
Me too!

361
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,747
It's good to see you.

362
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,751
Why-why are you carrying that knife?

363
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,255
Oh, I was gonna stab someone.

364
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,465
Come on!

365
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,093
Crab cakes?

366
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,222
Uh, would you take this
to the kitchen for me? Thank you.

367
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,267
Uh, is that a no on the crab cakes?

368
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,769
That's a no, yes, thank you.

369
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:22,026
So... how are you? How's your husband?

370
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,323
We were divorced 15 years ago.

371
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,617
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

372
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,785
How's your wife?

373
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,455
Uh, she passed about four years ago.

374
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,459
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But she lived a good, full life,

375
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,586
and I loved her deeply.

376
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,880
Well, that's good.

377
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,674
I had no idea why I said that.

378
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,969
I mean, it just goes without saying.
I guess...

379
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,682
- Guess I'm a little nervous.
- Why?

380
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,602
Well, it isn't very often that you...

381
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,521
Not very often that you run
into your ex-wife?

382
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,357
Not very often.

383
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,818
Any kids?

384
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,948
I have one kid, two grandkids.

385
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,283
- Great-grands?
- They're not that great.

386
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,245
No, I have no great-grandkids.

387
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,914
- I have a corgi.
- Mm!

388
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,999
- Pictures?
- Of course!

389
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,518
- How could I not, right?
- Of course!

390
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,836
It's what we do these days.

391
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,631
Let me see...

392
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,550
Come on, dashiell. Come on!

393
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,010
Give me a smile.

394
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,014
- Oh, good boy!
- Cute, huh?

395
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,934
Oh, dogs always loved you, Claire.

396
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,060
Yeah. You?

397
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,607
Oh... lovely!

398
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,234
Lovely!

399
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,986
Ahem.

400
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,409
It's really nice to see you.

401
00:24:56,537 --> 00:25:00,416
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Oh, come on!

402
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,042
You're as beautiful as ever.

403
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:05,045
And you're as kind as ever.

404
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,715
Look at you two lovebirds!

405
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,134
Or "love pterodactyls," maybe.

406
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,261
Evelyn.

407
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,139
- Hi, Ralph.
- You came!

408
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,099
I didn't miss the carnage, did I?

409
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,647
I think someone
is about to give a speech.

410
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,734
Oh, good. Perfect timing.

411
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,739
I know my mother...

412
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:37,244
My mother would be... so happy
to see you all here.

413
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,248
She'd really appreciate,
I know dad and I do.

414
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,918
So please eat, drink,

415
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,005
and raise a toast to my mom.

416
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,507
The best mom in the world.

417
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,885
To Joyce!

418
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,969
Yes.

419
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:02,269
- Um, I have a few words to say.
- Please.

420
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,689
Uh, this is Evelyn,
one of my mother's oldest friends.

421
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,069
Joyce was a wonderful woman.

422
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,237
She certainly was.

423
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,989
A great cook.

424
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,075
A devoted wife and mother.

425
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,035
A doting grandmother.

426
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,456
And forjunior
and senior years in college,

427
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,002
and then six months in New York City
after graduation,

428
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,671
she was my roommate and my lover.

429
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,509
Jesus, what?

430
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,970
And this wasn't
a "gay until graduation" type of thing.

431
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,014
This was who she was.

432
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,684
But not who she wanted to be.

433
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,233
God!

434
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,193
I'm sorry, Howard. What's so funny?

435
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:56,198
You are, Evelyn. You always had
such a great sense of humor.

436
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,075
Mm, not really.

437
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:02,871
People think I'm being funny,
but I'm really just talking.

438
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,749
It's very inappropriate,
Evelyn, and untrue.

439
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,293
And not something my children
needed to hear.

440
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,003
Oh, was it?

441
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,589
Did you even understand
what I was saying, honey?

442
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,341
You said you loved grandma.

443
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,011
That's right!
That's exactly what I said.

444
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,431
Adorable grandkids.

445
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,767
She got that in the transaction, I guess.

446
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,894
She told me.

447
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,438
She told me that you were delusional,

448
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,525
that you were infatuated with her.

449
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,319
I mean, we used to laugh about it.

450
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,991
She thought you were funny.
I can tell you that.

451
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,076
She told me you were cruel.

452
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,788
My father is one
of the kindest people I know.

453
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,291
Oh, is he?

454
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,084
I think you should leave now.

455
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,004
I tend to agree.

456
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,465
Howard, you didn't deserve her.

457
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,347
Um, can anyone give me a ride?

458
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,480
So? What did you think of my big news?

459
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,858
I knew.

460
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,445
Two of you were always staring
at each other,

461
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,155
mooning over each other.

462
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,949
So why didn't you say something?

463
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,368
Why didn't you?

464
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,454
Joyce didn't want to.

465
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,125
Guess I didn't either at the time.

466
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,171
- It was a different time.
- No.

467
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,925
You have always underestimated me.

468
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,011
Here, pull over. Here, at the bus stop.

469
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,933
What gives? I can drive you home.

470
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,018
What're you afraid of?

471
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,532
Hey.

472
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,626
Ta-da!

473
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,092
Why... why did you lie to me?

474
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,594
Why-why did you say
you still had your house?

475
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,847
Well, if you thought I still had my house,

476
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,017
then for a moment there
it was as if I still had my house.

477
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,062
Yeah, makes sense.

478
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,522
Not really.

479
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,984
It just got too much to keep up.

480
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,904
I-I spent a fortune on plumbing,
the roof...

481
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,116
I didn't have the money anymore.

482
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,910
- I love these chairs!
- Aren't they good?

483
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:50,580
But didn't you get a great pension
from the orchestra?

484
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,917
Well, I have a modest pension.

485
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,044
Enough to pay for this place.

486
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,338
I'm in the independent living section,

487
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,550
- so I come and go as I want.
- Right.

488
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,845
For rehearsals and concerts and...

489
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,514
Oh, yeah.

490
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,768
Sorry.

491
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,980
Arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis.

492
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,983
My ankles are in good shape, though.

493
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,445
I still teach, from time to time.

494
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,281
I do a master class, occasionally.

495
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,284
One of my old students
teaches nearby,

496
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,288
she has me come in,
critique the sawing.

497
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,000
- Oh.
- She throws me a few bucks.

498
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,503
And the meals are included here.

499
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,965
I like eating cardboard,
so it's worked out for me.

500
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,676
I can invite a guest.

501
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,970
Wanna come to dinner?

502
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,182
Well, you-you make it sound
so appetizing...

503
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,144
Uh, no, but Ralph invited me to diner.

504
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,772
Damn, you work fast!

505
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,942
Look!

506
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,071
Look at us!

507
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,535
Look at us...

508
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,157
You were married to grandpa?

509
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,992
Yes, I was.

510
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,872
It's not polite to stare.

511
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,376
- Well, you can't blame him.
- That's true.

512
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,503
I'd stare.

513
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,089
This was before grammy?

514
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,882
Of course it was before grammy,
knucklehead.

515
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,802
- What do you think?
- Don't call him names. Say you're sorry.

516
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,762
Sorry.

517
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,681
Now tell him something nice about him.

518
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,683
You're good at roblox.

519
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,766
Now you tell your brother
something nice about him.

520
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,520
You smell funny.

521
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,399
That wasn't nice. Do another one.

522
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,402
- Uh... you're fast.
- Yes, he is.

523
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,446
- I am fast.
- Very fast.

524
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:37,289
It was a long, long time ago
when your grandfather and I were together.

525
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,458
Prehistoric times.

526
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,126
Okay.

527
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,295
How long are you in town for?

528
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,132
Just for the weekend, the funeral.

529
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,302
This is so good!

530
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,803
- You're a good cook, Ralph.
- Mm.

531
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,889
Well, I remembered you were pescatarian.

532
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,433
Still am!

533
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,634
Can I be excused?

534
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,730
- Me too, I'm full.
- What about dessert?

535
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,024
Can I take an ice cream sandwich upstairs?

536
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,233
You finish that salmon.

537
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,486
I can't, I'm full.

538
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,238
Okay, well, the garbage can
will finish it.

539
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,324
- That's me.
- Oh!

540
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,910
I eat anything they leave.

541
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,620
Oh...

542
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,955
If you both take
your plates into the kitchen,

543
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,833
wash them off and then put them
in the dishwasher...

544
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,086
Then you can take
an ice cream sandwich upstairs.

545
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,090
- There you go.
- Thank you.

546
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,548
Mm-hmm.

547
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,055
- Good kids.
- Thank you.

548
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,848
They are a pain in the butt.

549
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,769
It's nice that your father
has you here with him.

550
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,938
- It certainly is.
- Yeah!

551
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,482
Well, it's good for us,
because he's such a good cook.

552
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,651
Yeah.

553
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,572
I think I'm gonna excuse myself as well.

554
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,700
- It was very nice to meet you, Claire.
- You too, joie.

555
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,295
Um... care to have an after dinner drink?

556
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,589
Okay.

557
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,012
Claire, there's, uh...

558
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,808
There's something
I've always wanted to ask.

559
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,976
Oh, god...

560
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,395
What happened?

561
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,106
Now, don't get me wrong.

562
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,567
This is the best thing
that could've happened to me,

563
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,569
I-I moved on with my life.

564
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,406
I met zora,

565
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,533
I have kids, I have grandkids...

566
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,870
But I've always wondered.

567
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,915
Heh. So I'm gonna have
to sing for my supper, huh?

568
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,001
Oh, no, no, no.

569
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,462
You don't have to unless
you would like to.

570
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,721
You know, it would be nice
after all this time

571
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,181
to have one less mystery in my life.

572
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,310
Did you meet someone?

573
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,146
- Meet someone?
- A man.

574
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,747
Did you fall in love with someone else?

575
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,150
No, no.

576
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,319
Well, that's a relief.

577
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,070
I guess.

578
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,282
I mean, I thought maybe...

579
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,284
If-if I was to be honest,

580
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,911
I thought perhaps it was the old story.

581
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,288
What old story?

582
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,665
That I'm black and you're white.

583
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,170
And what,
and I just suddenly realized that?

584
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,381
Maybe your father got to you.

585
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,760
Oh, Ralph!

586
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,347
I loved you.

587
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,477
I loved you, Ralph.

588
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,485
And then?

589
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,616
Something happened.

590
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,660
- Something happened?
- Yeah.

591
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,119
- Something bad?
- Yeah.

592
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,960
- And you couldn't tell me?
- I couldn't.

593
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,797
I couldn't, I couldn't.

594
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,965
It made me mute.

595
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,927
I made me... deaf. It made me...

596
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,808
It made me blind to you
and to everything good in my life.

597
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,526
I just... couldn't.

598
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,864
Claire, Claire, Claire, i-i...

599
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,829
- I don't understand this.
- I know.

600
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,878
But I'm sorry.

601
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you, Ralph.

602
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,112
Not funny.

603
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,331
Walter.

604
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,917
Walter.

605
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,543
Walt!

606
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,003
What? Who is it?

607
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,756
- It's Evelyn.
- You're not the nurse.

608
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,759
No, I'm Evelyn, from the lunch room.

609
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,344
- Oh...
- Don't get up.

610
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,555
- I couldn't if I tried to.
- Oh...

611
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,808
What are you doing
at this time of the night?

612
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,560
Do you have a gun? Do you?

613
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,104
You're not allowed to have a gun in here.

614
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,690
I imagine not, but do you?

615
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,568
- Who told you I have a gun?
- Your grandkid.

616
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,403
My grandson?

617
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,823
Well, maybe, time will tell,
but let's not get into that.

618
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,491
Where is your gun?

619
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,118
You leave my gun alone.

620
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,788
- Here, in this closet?
- Don't open that closet.

621
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,414
If you do, I'm calling the nurse.

622
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,543
Okay, all right, all right.
Just relax, Walt.

623
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:03,550
Please, I would like
to borrow your gun, Walter.

624
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,009
What for?

625
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,804
Well, there... there's these thugs.

626
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,848
They're threatening my friend.

627
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,225
She lives in a rough neighborhood.

628
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,686
But if I show them this gun,

629
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,605
just kind of waved it around
and said, "hey!

630
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,110
You leave my friend alone,
you misogynist creep!"

631
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,612
Then they'd leave her alone.

632
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,740
- That sounds harebrained.
- I suppose,

633
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,451
but it's the god's honest truth.

634
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,745
Will you do this for me, Walter?

635
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,999
Will you be a hero and loan me your gun?

636
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,628
Okay... if you do something for me.

637
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,549
Anything! Well, almost anything.

638
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,842
I want...

639
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,012
Bacon.

640
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,557
Bacon? Okay.

641
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,434
Should I bring you some
from the cafeteria?

642
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,644
No, no, no, no, no,
their bacon is horrible!

643
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,980
It's a Turkey bacon.
No, I don't like it.

644
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,774
- I want real bacon!
- Ah...

645
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,153
I want crispy bacon, four pieces. Oof!

646
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,047
If you do that for me,

647
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,324
I'll give you what you want.

648
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,286
Seems fair. I'm gonna go.
But Walter...

649
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,497
This was not a dream.

650
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,500
Well, I hope not. I want that bacon!

651
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,128
Good night.

652
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,466
Claire?

653
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,513
I remember when you were
saving up to buy this.

654
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,934
Ralph!

655
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,602
Oh, my god!

656
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,521
I wrote you about it, but you said
you didn't want it anymore.

657
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,608
All of that time studying,

658
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,526
all those hours in the dark room...

659
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,653
Yeah...

660
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,657
I saved it just in case.

661
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,117
But, then again...

662
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,370
Packed up a bunch of old stuff.

663
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,208
I wanted to be dorothea lange.

664
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,545
Oh, Ralph...

665
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,804
It's, um... it's getting late.

666
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,430
- I should go.
- Don't.

667
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,058
What?

668
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,309
Dontgo.

669
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,855
Please. Stay.

670
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,027
Okay.

671
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,535
Oh, Ralph!

672
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,538
What if-what if joie catches us?

673
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,874
Claire, this is my house.

674
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,210
I can have someone in my room if! Like.

675
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,378
Right.

676
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,761
May I kiss you?

677
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,765
Why not?

678
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,619
- Oh, Ralph...
- Oh.

679
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:21,414
Gotta catch my breath.

680
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,001
I'm sorry. It's, uh, it's...

681
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,045
It's been a while.

682
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,589
I appreciate the enthusiasm.

683
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,301
One sec.

684
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,517
Viagra?

685
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,103
No, no, no.

686
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,230
It's just my statin.

687
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,317
I take it every night after dinner,
so I won't forget.

688
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,492
Where were we?

689
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,744
You brought me to your room,

690
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,330
and you were putting
the moves on me.

691
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,007
Are you fucking serious?

692
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:50,378
Well, if we're gonna do whatever it is
we're thinking of doing, um...

693
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,756
I'm gonna want to ask you
to turn the lights off,

694
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,718
but first I want to plant myself...

695
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,848
Firmly and safely in the bed.

696
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,976
Okay.

697
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,770
I'm on board. Lights out.

698
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,900
Ralph!

699
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,528
Do you have a condom?
I don't wanna get knocked up.

700
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:01,991
Hello?

701
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,618
I'm in.

702
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,911
You're in what?

703
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,997
- I'm in on the Howard thing.
- You are?

704
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,750
Well, my other murder
canceled this week,

705
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,002
so I've got time.

706
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,379
Are you still in
or do you have second thoughts?

707
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,758
- Which way is the wind blowing?
- I-I have not had second thoughts.

708
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,927
But what difference
does it make?

709
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,054
Here's the difference it makes.

710
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,513
I have a gun.

711
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,183
Or I will, as soon as I get some bacon.

712
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,601
Some bacon?

713
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,645
You think you can get a hold of some bacon?

714
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,565
Well, yeah, I... I think
I can get a hold of some bacon.

715
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:38,694
It's gotta be real bacon. Not veggie
bacon, not-not Turkey bacon.

716
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,989
Old fashioned bacon,
four slices, cooked. Get it?

717
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,116
Meet me here.

718
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,119
Ah!

719
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,175
Good morning.

720
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,135
Hi! Good morning.

721
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,595
I hope I didn't wake you up.

722
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,472
- Oh, I smelled the bacon.
- Sorry.

723
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:10,017
For what? He's a grown man.

724
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,895
Right.

725
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,398
You cooking us breakfast?

726
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,650
I smelled bacon.

727
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,819
Why don't you go back to bed?
It's very early.

728
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,570
You can have bacon later.

729
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,655
Okay.

730
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,325
Are you going to be
our new grandmother?

731
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,869
No. No, I'm not.

732
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,997
Okay. That's good.

733
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,833
Just 'cause, you know,
our old grammy.

734
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,711
I know, yeah. I bet she was wonderful.

735
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,427
- You're a big fan of bacon?
- Oh, big fan!

736
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,345
Can't start my day without it.

737
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,723
Thought you were a pescatarian.

738
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,474
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,476
Except after sex?

740
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,771
Funny.

741
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,109
Uh, do you have a-a ziploc bag?

742
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,683
- You got the stuff?
- Yeah.

743
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,978
- Crispy?
- Pretty crispy. Uh...

744
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,148
You didn't mention how crispy
it was supposed to be.

745
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,234
I'm just curious. Follow me.

746
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,656
- Walt. Walt!
- Mm?

747
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,076
Oh, I'm not dreaming!

748
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,120
I told you it wasn't a dream.
This is my friend Claire.

749
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,538
Hello, Claire.

750
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:58,626
Now I'm dreaming
two beautiful ladies in my room.

751
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,336
Well, it's very kind of you. Thank you.

752
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,005
Oh, god, you brought it. I can smell it.

753
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,549
- I told you.
- Can I see it?

754
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,052
Bring it-bring it here, please.

755
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,721
- Please!
- Oh, well, where's your thing?

756
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,057
- The firearm.
- Oh!

757
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,184
It's in the closet,
on the top shelf to the right.

758
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,019
It's in a wooden box for checkers.

759
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,729
- Checkers. All right.
- Checkers. Yes!

760
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,482
Um, you can have the bacon.

761
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,442
- Thank you. Oh!
- J' ta-da j'

762
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,985
thank you.

763
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,115
Oh, my god, this is so wonderful!

764
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,868
- Mm!
- It's not too crispy?

765
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,579
- Uh-uh. Perfect!
- Oh, good.

766
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,666
- What isn't here?
- God, you're an angel.

767
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,878
Hey, what did you mean when you said

768
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,797
"time will tell" about my grandson?

769
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,758
There's something wrong with that boy.

770
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:52,179
No, nothing is wrong with James.
You're a lucky bastard.

771
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,850
I can see the checkers,
but I can't reach them.

772
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,603
- Hi, Walt.
- Hello there.

773
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,397
Oh, hi...

774
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,399
This is Claire and Evelyn, my friends.

775
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,694
- I've met Evelyn.
- Yeah, we've seen each other around.

776
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,697
- Oh...
- Ooh, what's that you're eating?

777
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,323
Oh, it's bacon. It's delicious!

778
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,742
- Not supposed to eat that, Walt.
- Oh, come on.

779
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:17,204
Ladies, I'm going to need
to catheterize Mr. Mangopyan,

780
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,832
so I do believe the visit is over.

781
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,502
Hector, would you do me a favor?

782
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,880
There's a box up there, a checkers box.

783
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:30,176
- Can you reach it?
- Sure!

784
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,053
These ladies, they wanna borrow it.

785
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,055
Oh, it's heavy!

786
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,475
- What's in here?
- Oh, a gun.

787
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,311
You crack me up, Walt.

788
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,813
- There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

789
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,024
Happy catheter.

790
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,525
- Thank you.
- See you soon!

791
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,152
See you.

792
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,154
Walt... uh-uh.

793
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,169
Uh, what is it? Is it a toy?

794
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,672
It's a flare gun. I used to have
a flare gun on my sailboat.

795
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,467
You had a sailboat?

796
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,053
Yes, Anette and I had a sailboat.

797
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,640
- Who's Anette?
- The woman I was married to.

798
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,060
Oh! Well.

799
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,772
- Good!
- I'm glad you approve.

800
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,942
We met in 2006, married in 2009...

801
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,237
Right before she died.

802
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,657
She wanted to get married.
I did it for her.

803
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,078
2009? Wow, I'm sorry.

804
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,791
I'm sorry she died.
I'm sorry I didn't meet her.

805
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,086
That's her, in the photograph.

806
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:55,511
She was an amazing violinist.

807
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,679
Not just violin.

808
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,808
Mandolin, guitar,
any stringed instrument, she could play.

809
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,520
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Claire.

810
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,106
I want to show you how this gun is loaded.

811
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,526
You open it, press this button...

812
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,406
This is the cartridge. Red side in.

813
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,619
Shut it. It's loaded.

814
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,248
But, um...

815
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,750
You-you couldn't kill
anybody with that, could you?

816
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,837
Oh, yes! Mostly yourself,
if you're not careful.

817
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:34,633
You could burn a hole right through
someone with that.

818
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:35,926
Wow.

819
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,139
What made you decide to help me?

820
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,601
"Since I cannot prove a lover,

821
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,145
I am determined to prove a villain."

822
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,646
Excuse me?

823
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,149
Richard III, Shakespeare.

824
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,153
Only you, Evelyn.

825
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,905
I've missed you.

826
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,784
- You had my number.
- Well, you had my number.

827
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,289
So we're both lousy friends.

828
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,793
Who is it?

829
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,211
It's Ralph.

830
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,213
I slept with him last night.

831
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,174
No kidding.

832
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,177
Oh, that good, huh?

833
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,012
No, it was-it was good, I...

834
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,347
Just not...

835
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,058
What I came here for.

836
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,314
It's ringing.

837
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,362
Yeah, ho-Howard? It's Claire.

838
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,530
Hello, Claire.

839
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,116
- I wanna come over and see you.
- You do?

840
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,118
- Yes.
- Tell him you feel bad.

841
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:46,830
Yeah, I, um... I feel bad, you know?

842
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,833
Howard, I want to come over
and apologize in person.

843
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,921
Apologize for what?
Threatening to kill me?

844
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,800
Uh, yeah. For that.

845
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,969
All right, well, apology accepted.

846
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,222
I just... I feel...

847
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,560
Crazy, I've been just crazy, Howard.

848
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,020
Woman... woman...

849
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,855
A crazy woman, you know, I...

850
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,042
- Stress! Stress!
- It must be the stress.

851
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,068
I've been under a lot of stress.

852
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,404
You know, because of the traveling?

853
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,739
Oh, Jesus! Wow!

854
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,743
I wanna make friends.
I wanna make friends.

855
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,037
I hate to...

856
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:30,749
I hate... I hate to think
that I came all this way...

857
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,170
And-and to have that be the last...

858
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,756
Time that-that, you know,
that I saw you.

859
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,718
And so I think
I should come over and apologize

860
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,429
before I go home. And...

861
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:47,558
Somehow I feel that Joyce
wouldn't want it to end like this.

862
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,396
Well, look, I'm going to the park
with Allie and the kids.

863
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,858
I... I suppose you could meet us there.

864
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,193
Perfect. Uh, where?

865
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:19,798
Should-should I load the gun now?

866
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:24,470
I wouldn't. You don't want it
going off in your bag by accident.

867
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:29,099
So, what? I just take it out and load it
right there, in front of him?

868
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,018
I guess.

869
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,356
Look, you don't have to prove
anything to me.

870
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,192
I already know you're ioca.

871
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,986
No, you were right.

872
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,446
I... oh, my god!

873
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:47,034
There are so may things that I have not
ever followed through on.

874
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,037
My dad used to call me "I.L."

875
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,123
Short for "little loser."

876
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,251
How crummy.

877
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,088
I remember him,
in his uniform, at graduation.

878
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:03,342
So you'll keep Allie
and the kids occupied?

879
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,518
There they are.

880
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,299
Oh, Christ! She's got
that awful dyke with her.

881
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,844
Dad! Don't talk like that.

882
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:50,889
Well, it's unconscionable
what she said at your mother's wake!

883
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,518
Anyway, it's not even
a bad word, is it? Dyke?

884
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,104
It is when you say it, so don't say it.

885
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,277
You know, I think I'll go talk to Claire.

886
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,112
I refuse to speak to Evelyn.

887
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,905
Oh! God damn.

888
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,747
Hello, Howard.

889
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,917
A word of advice...

890
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,752
Hello, Claire.

891
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,007
I'm glad you called.
We're old friends.

892
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,302
I wouldn't want there to be
any bad blood between us.

893
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,595
Yes.

894
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,765
Should we sit down and talk?

895
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,642
Yes, just for a moment.

896
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,939
- Hi, Evelyn.
- Hi, there.

897
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,359
Bet you didn't think
you'd be seeing me again!

898
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,486
It's a surprise.

899
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,782
I supposed I should, what? Apologize?

900
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:54,119
Um, I've actually been thinking
about it a lot,

901
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,954
and I think maybe I should?

902
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,789
Guys, come here right now.

903
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,250
What's that little one's name?

904
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:03,462
- Joyce.
- Joyce, that's nice.

905
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,148
Are we gonna ride
the carrousel or not?

906
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,798
Yeah, just go line up by the gate.

907
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,473
When I said you were lying...
I knew you weren't lying.

908
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,185
I found some letters
when I went through my mom's stuff.

909
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,228
My dad couldn't do it, he was a wreck.

910
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,689
So I went through my mom's whole office,

911
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,525
and she kept some of the letters
you wrote her.

912
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,112
She did? Love letters?

913
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:33,325
They were very... frank and explicit.

914
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,118
Holy cow.

915
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,705
She kept the letters all these years?

916
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,541
Hot dog! I'm tickled.

917
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,421
We have an extra ticket. You wanna get on?

918
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,423
I'd love to.

919
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,133
Look, Claire...

920
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:52,928
I understand.

921
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,182
I understand guilt,
It's a horrible emotion.

922
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,184
It distorts everything.

923
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,729
- Guilt?
- Yes, I understand your guilt.

924
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,356
I felt it too, for many years.

925
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,649
My guilt for what?

926
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,317
What happened.

927
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,323
Our transgression.

928
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,828
Don't worry, she never knew about it.
I-I never told her.

929
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:22,040
Huh, even when I was getting sober,
when I was making amends,

930
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,876
I didn't tell her. No reason to it.

931
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,378
Would've caused too much pain.

932
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,089
- You made amends?
- I did.

933
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,675
I called the people in my life,

934
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,136
the ones I felt that I'd wronged...

935
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,264
It was very healing.

936
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,392
It changed me, you know,
the whole process.

937
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,897
Would you mind sitting with her?

938
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,400
- With joycie? Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

939
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,863
May 
?

940
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:57,492
- I get dizzy on the horses.
- Yeah, me too.

941
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,413
What, are you looking for tissues?

942
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,623
Oh! Oh! Oopsie!

943
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,000
You dropped this.

944
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,461
You know, I really better be
getting back to the grandkids.

945
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,714
I mean, oh, god! The energy!

946
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,217
What's that? The heck is that?

947
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,303
Is that a toy?

948
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:20,098
No. It's a flare gun.

949
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,516
What, for emergencies?

950
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,273
I want you to tell the truth.

951
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,985
I want you to say it.

952
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,490
I want you to say what happened.

953
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,824
What happened?

954
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,286
What happened?

955
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,164
We had sex!

956
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,249
Yeah! It may have been a bit rough,

957
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:50,045
but we had sex one drunken night.

958
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,047
Now I wish it'd never happened,

959
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,341
but I never meant to betray Joyce,

960
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,235
and I'm sure you didn't want
to hurt your friend.

961
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,636
That wasn't sex!

962
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,138
All right, stop pointing that.
I'm not joking now.

963
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,223
Sit down.

964
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,409
Don't tell me what to do.
Now I've had enough of this!

965
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,644
Sit down or I'm gonna shoot you.

966
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,312
You'll shoot me?

967
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:11,399
- What, with a flare gun?
- I'll burn a hole in you! I'll do it.

968
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,237
Listen, you're delusional.

969
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,322
I don't know what you think happened
between us...

970
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,657
Yes, you do.

971
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,660
I think you're suffering
from dementia, that's what I think.

972
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:25,747
I think you blame me for what happened
to your own marriage to Ralph.

973
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:28,125
I think you gave him a terrible time of
it,

974
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,544
because I think
you're that kind of person.

975
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:34,881
You're one of those people
who are never satisfied,

976
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,301
one of those women
who are not built for happiness.

977
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,887
- Stop lying!
- You want the truth?

978
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,223
- Stop lying!
- You want the truth?!

979
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,892
- Yes!
- I'll give you the fucking truth!

980
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,312
I'm shocked.

981
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:53,775
I am shocked by your utter selfishness!

982
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,195
I just lost the love of my life.

983
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:01,366
She was everything,
everything to me!

984
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,703
I've had my heart ripped out!

985
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,372
And you have the nerve to come here,

986
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,418
to come here
with your fucking gun and you...

987
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,633
Oh... oh... oh...

988
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,432
Ho-Howard...

989
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,978
Howard!

990
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,188
Howard!

991
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,609
Uh... help!

992
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:42,073
H-Help! Someone's...
Had-had a heart attack!

993
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,326
Giddyap!

994
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,994
Giddyap! Giddyap!

995
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:50,040
You think your sister knows
it's not a real horse?

996
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,294
Hey, come on! Come on!

997
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,981
Oh, my god!

998
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:24,241
Did you save grandpa's life?
Mom said you saved grandpa's life.

999
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,994
Yes. Apparently.

1000
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,996
Oh, we don't know that.

1001
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,582
He can still take a turn for the worse.

1002
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,174
You wanna know something amusing?

1003
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,011
Joyce kept my love letters.

1004
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:48,181
- That's amusing.
- Isn't it?

1005
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,600
- Allie told me.
- Tsk.

1006
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,687
I mean, I'm tickled.
After all those years!

1007
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,692
I wonder if Allie threw them all out.

1008
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,239
So, did your grandmother
ever talk about me?

1009
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,657
About Evelyn?

1010
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,494
Um... I... don't know.

1011
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:12,247
It's okay. I'm just wondering.

1012
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,459
He's doing okay.

1013
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,170
Thank goodness you brought
that flare with you!

1014
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,547
Why did you have that thing?

1015
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,717
Oh, she always carries one.

1016
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,344
You'd be surprised
what she fits into that bag.

1017
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,179
Was it a-a heart attack?

1018
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,223
No, they don't think
it was a heart attack.

1019
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,601
They think it could've been
an anxiety attack, possibly an ulcer.

1020
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,896
They don't know. They're keeping him
overnight to make sure.

1021
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,566
So he's not gonna die?

1022
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,278
Well, they're still running tests,
but they think he's out of danger now.

1023
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,407
They say it's really good
that he came in.

1024
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,492
He's been under a tremendous
amount of stress.

1025
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,411
Oh, stress is a killer.

1026
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,330
A slow one, evidently.

1027
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,333
You think I could see him?

1028
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,293
Oh, I think so. I think
he'd like to see you,

1029
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:01,463
but they just gave him a sedative,
so he might be sleeping.

1030
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,923
- Yeah. What room?
- 814.

1031
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,218
Claire...

1032
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,222
I'm starving.

1033
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:14,017
I think I'm gonna run the kids down
for a snack and come back up.

1034
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,894
Can I stay? I'm not hungry.

1035
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,021
No, you can come down with us.

1036
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,315
But I'm in the middle of a game.
I'm trying for a record.

1037
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,194
Can you just keep an eye on him?

1038
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,653
Sure.

1039
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:29,991
And can you not mention
anything about...

1040
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:33,411
Anything sapphic? Sure, no sweat.

1041
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,081
We'll be right back. Come on, girls.

1042
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:09,697
Oh, Christ, no...

1043
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,533
Nurse!

1044
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:19,541
Joyce was away
visiting her mother, who was sick.

1045
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:24,087
And she asked me if I wouldn't mind
dropping food off for you.

1046
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,423
She said that...

1047
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:30,218
You couldn't be relied on
to feed yourself.

1048
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,681
And she was worried about you.
She said you'd been drinking a lot.

1049
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,601
It was a mistake.

1050
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:42,105
Whatever happened between us...

1051
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,024
- It was a mistake.
- It was a mistake?

1052
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:51,531
That you grabbed my breasts so hard,
they hurt for a week?

1053
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,702
That you put your leg behind my leg
and tripped me down to the floor,

1054
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,413
and then lay on top of me...

1055
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,208
And pulled out your penis...

1056
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,629
Put your hands on my throat,

1057
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,799
and said if I screamed,
you'd choke me?

1058
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:14,137
Then you pressed
my face into the floor,

1059
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,141
And you pulled up my skirt
and you shoved it in me?

1060
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:25,023
I would never force myself on anyone.
I would never do that.

1061
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,610
You wanted it.

1062
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,321
You were always looking at me.

1063
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,657
I would catch you... staring.

1064
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,870
You had troubles
in your own marriage.

1065
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,371
You just don't remember.

1066
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,459
Oh, come on! It was 45 years ago.

1067
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,754
It was 46 years ago.

1068
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,349
What was that room number again, 814?

1069
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,479
Don't talk to any strangers.

1070
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,073
Oh, shit!

1071
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,868
Claire, no, no! No!

1072
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:28,795
Thank you.

1073
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,964
Fuck you.

1074
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,136
Claire... Claire...

1075
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:41,224
How dare you?!
How dare you stop me?!

1076
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,978
I couldn't let you. I don't want you
to spend the rest of your life in jail.

1077
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,230
Maybe that's what I want!

1078
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,857
Maybe I'd rather be in jail,
knowing he's dead!

1079
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,235
Maybe you want to go to jail,
maybe you still will.

1080
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:53,903
Attempted murder is a crime too.

1081
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,406
Oh, he's not gonna say anything!

1082
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,576
He knows it's true.

1083
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,704
He knows it's true!

1084
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:06,457
Don't you have a kid? Grandkids? A house?

1085
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,628
God, it's... Ralph.

1086
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,297
I don't know what he wants.

1087
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,007
Oh, you know what he wants.

1088
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:18,011
You think I'm getting any action nowadays?

1089
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,139
All I have is a cello
I can't play anymore!

1090
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:24,309
An option on a room in-in assisted living

1091
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,604
once I can't keep up my room
in independent living.

1092
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,564
You know what you have?

1093
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:32,859
You did what you wanted in life.

1094
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,652
That's what you have.

1095
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,988
Get in.

1096
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,578
I'll take the bus.

1097
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,613
Oh, god.

1098
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,139
What?

1099
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,308
Oh. Did I wake you?

1100
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,893
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

1101
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,855
I just wondered if you
might like a glass of vodka.

1102
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,606
I don't drink.

1103
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,317
- How about a joint?
- No.

1104
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,862
A little heroin? Some cocaine?

1105
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,326
Sorry to interrupt.

1106
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,091
Oh, you're so pretty!

1107
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,012
Hello.

1108
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,661
Claire! He's doing okay.

1109
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,206
I'm picking him up later this morning.

1110
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,373
Good.

1111
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:37,376
- You're still flying out today?
- I am.

1112
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,464
Well... it was really nice to see you.

1113
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,132
Appreciate you coming.

1114
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,344
Mom really loved you.

1115
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,388
I loved her.

1116
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,059
And your grandparents, I...

1117
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:58,147
They were really good to me
and my husband, my ex-husband.

1118
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:03,820
I'd never really seen that before,
you know, up close?

1119
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,364
A loving family.

1120
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,992
Thank you for telling me that.

1121
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,245
Uh, here they are.

1122
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,372
There's a lot of them.

1123
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,082
- Just in there.
- Thank you.

1124
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,001
Thanks.

1125
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,419
Bye.

1126
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,180
- Hey, dottie, how are you?
- Oh!

1127
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:34,016
Hello... Evelyn?

1128
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,810
I don't see you in here that often.

1129
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:39,397
Well, the cardboard gets stuck
in my teeth.

1130
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:40,857
Would you care to join me?

1131
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,441
Well, the last time we talked,

1132
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,319
you called me
"a narrow-minded philistine."

1133
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:47,530
Oh, that's a compliment, coming from me.

1134
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,740
Hm. I looked up the word "philistine."

1135
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,536
- It's not a compliment.
- Mm.

1136
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,871
Jeez.

1137
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,879
Hi! Are you visiting your grandad again?

1138
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,258
Here.

1139
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,137
No, no. Those were meant for you.

1140
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,181
No.

1141
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,642
Hey, what's wrong?

1142
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,446
James!

1143
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,074
- James!
- Is this the lady?

1144
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,202
Sweetheart, get in the car
with butterscotch.

1145
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,581
Is he okay with that dog in there?

1146
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,333
It's his dog.

1147
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,170
Listen. We're here to visit
with his grandfather.

1148
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,254
I know that.

1149
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,465
We don't come to have someone
play dress-up with him.

1150
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,134
I imagine not,
but if James wants to play dress-up,

1151
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,636
what's the harm in that?

1152
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,988
Thank you for the parenting advice.

1153
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,305
- You're welcome.
- Can we go?

1154
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:57,475
- Evelyn?
- Claire! What are you doing here?

1155
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:58,768
I brought you something.

1156
01:13:58,809 --> 01:13:59,889
Just get in the car, James.

1157
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,979
I wish I was your grandmother.

1158
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:03,689
- Well, you're not.
- I wish I was.

1159
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:06,901
I'd make you some damn cookies,
I'd buy you a sweater,

1160
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:11,614
I'd tell you every day
just how perfect you are.

1161
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,966
You'd be a terrific grandmother!

1162
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,409
- Get in here!
- Never say never, kid!

1163
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,328
- You look great in rhinestones!
- Come on!

1164
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,121
Wait, butterscotch! Butterscotch!

1165
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,414
Butterscotch! No, no, no!

1166
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,017
- No! Butterscotch!
- Oh! Oh!

1167
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,544
- Claire!
- Oh!

1168
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:29,048
Oh, my arm!

1169
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,049
Oh!

1170
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:33,302
Hang on, hang on, sis.

1171
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,390
- So how's your hip?
- My hip's fine.

1172
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:39,266
So it's just your arm?

1173
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,520
Yes, it's just my arm that seems broken.

1174
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,982
I guess that's lucky.
I mean, for your hip.

1175
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,068
Yeah. Oh, god, be careful!

1176
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,362
Oh! Ah! Oh, my god!

1177
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:57,034
- That was a stop sign.
- I can see that. Now.

1178
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,412
How long has it been
since you had a license?

1179
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,998
Um... eight years.

1180
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,625
We should've let that family drive us.

1181
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,294
And get in the car with that dog?

1182
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,469
Actually, I really could stand a latte.

1183
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,264
No, the doctor said
you couldn't have caffeine.

1184
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,765
We can get you a decaf.

1185
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:23,227
Oh, I'll be damned if I drink decaf!
It defeats the purpose.

1186
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,955
Well, you're gonna have to get used to it,

1187
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,779
'cause that's all I'm gonna have
in the house.

1188
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,401
I hope you're not gonna be ordering me
around all the time in Philadelphia,

1189
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:33,738
because if you are,
I don't think I'm moving in.

1190
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,656
Oh, man...

1191
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:37,700
It's all right.

1192
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,077
What did you bring me?

1193
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,706
The letters.

1194
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,251
Your love letters to Joyce.
They weren't thrown away.

1195
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:49,003
- Really?
- Yeah.

1196
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,338
I went to the house
and I got them from Allie.

1197
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,924
Claire, you did that for me?

1198
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:56,510
Well, I thought you'd want them.

1199
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,013
That was very thoughtful of you.

1200
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:04,143
It occurs to me,
I could've had the biltmore arms

1201
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,104
call you an ambulance.

1202
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:12,818
Oh, that was
the emergency entrance!

1203
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,987
Well, were we allowed to use that?

1204
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,615
I mean, is this an emergency?

1205
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,991
I guess not to you.

1206
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,659
Well, should I turn back?

1207
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,495
Whoa!

1208
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,083
I see you! Jeez.

1209
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,558
I'm gonna get a latte.

1210
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,228
Your mom would want me to.

1211
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,939
Look, I won't be long.
There's a cafe in the lobby.

1212
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,399
And it won't be a goddamn decaf!

1213
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:53,567
Dad!

1214
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,658
- Where the hell do I park?
- There's a place up ahead.

1215
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,702
It's right around the corner.

1216
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,788
Watch out!

1217
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,331
Whoa!

1218
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:08,707
What the fuck?!

1219
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,169
Oh... oh, my god, it's him.

1220
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,754
Oh, my god! You!

1221
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:17,550
You nearly killed me,
you fucking insane whores!

1222
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,469
_ - god!

1223
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,894
- Shit. Shit!
- Oh, my god!

1224
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,020
I didn't see him!

1225
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:32,815
Justjumped out!

1226
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,320
Oh, he's dead!

1227
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,073
Oh, my god...

1228
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,119
Fucking shit!

1229
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,003
Evie, he's dead!

1230
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,180
Ouch!

1231
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,224
Oh, I'm sorry!

1232
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,852
Oh...

1233
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,360
Oh, god! He's dead!

1234
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,654
What the fuck?!

1235
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,409
- Oh... oh...
- Oh...

1236
01:18:37,755 --> 01:18:40,216
Aren't you glad
I didn't let you smother him?

1237
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,134
Yes.

1238
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:50,976
- Hi, ladies.
- Hello, again.

1239
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,687
What a tragedy!

1240
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,314
One right after the other.

1241
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,524
Yeah...

1242
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:00,527
But I guess they're both
in a better place now.

1243
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,613
Not sure about both of them.

1244
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,075
Uh, Claire, I brought your camera.

1245
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,661
I went out and got film for it
andloadedit

1246
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:12,248
Ralph! That is... extremely sweet.

1247
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:15,167
- Thank you.
- Yeah, talk about full service.

1248
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:19,088
Would... would you...
Take a picture of us?

1249
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,548
Uh... here?

1250
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,716
Yeah, please.

1251
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,469
Well, yeah, yes, of course. Uh...

1252
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,930
I'm not very good
with the camera.

1253
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,391
Well, I'll... I'll focus it for you.

1254
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:34,019
Uh, Evie, stand... here. Stand here.

1255
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,105
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's...

1256
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,903
Okay, right here. There you go.

1257
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:44,697
Okay.

1258
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,991
Be sure you get the grave
in the background.

1259
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,242
Okay.

1260
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:49,994
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

1261
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,453
Got it!

1262
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,999
- Great!
- That is not appropriate!

1263
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:59,003
Oh, you're so nice! Thank you!

1264
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,754
- Looked good?
- Okay.

1265
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,173
Well, I'm gonna let you two catch up,

1266
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,509
or whatever it is you get up to.

1267
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:09,013
Um, Ralph. Goodbye, Claire.

1268
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,725
Uh, Claire.

1269
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,144
Would you maybe like to go to lunch?

1270
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:20,149
Nothing romantic at all,
just-just lunch.

1271
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,484
Why nothing romantic?

1272
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,653
What if I wanted to get romantic?

1273
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:27,990
- Is that an issue?
- Not with me.

1274
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,033
Okay.

1275
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,912
But I have to give you a raincheck.
I'm gonna have lunch with my friend.

1276
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,460
Oh! Oh, I like that.

1277
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,004
Evie, wait up!

1278
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:03,650
Wanna grab some lunch?

1279
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,737
Sure! How about a bacon sandwich?
