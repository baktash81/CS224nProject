1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,948
THE SPIES WHO CAME IN
FROM THE SEMI-COLD

2
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,669
Come in.

3
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,160
A new batch of exploding girls is ready,
Doctor.

4
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,680
What a fabulous machine I've invented,

5
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,400
it does everything automatically,

6
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,960
when we used to do it all by hand.

7
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
Perfect. Hardjob,

8
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
the pressure gauge, please.

9
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,516
Fantastic!

10
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,633
Let's see.

11
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,431
Plastic injection fine tuning.

12
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,112
- Check.
- Excellent.

13
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,270
Engage circuit.

14
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,915
Circuit engaged.

15
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,838
Contact!

16
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,399
They look so real, don't they?

17
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,720
In fact, they're a diabolical creation,
a product of my scientific genius.

18
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,440
Each of these beauties
is equipped with a little device...

19
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
which in our profession...

20
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
or rather, my profession...

21
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,400
is known as the Kiss of Death.

22
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,320
A touch from their lips
that has more pressure...

23
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,520
than an innocent kiss completes a
circuit and... bang!

24
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,480
A glorious explosion that will destroy
my lovely creations...

25
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,520
along with their victims.

26
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,511
Why am I doing all this?

27
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,320
It's quite simple really.

28
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,673
You see...

29
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,800
I've made a deal
with my Chinese friends,

30
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,520
we're going to share control
of the entire planet.

31
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,320
And what of America and Russia?
Two obstacles to be removed.

32
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,880
To begin with,
my lovely exploding girls

33
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,560
will eliminate
certain annoying generals.

34
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,960
Then, when the only survivor
is General Willis...

35
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,680
my plan will move into it's final phase.

36
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,912
A simple one, as the general
looks exactly like me.

37
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,393
An incredibly charming man.

38
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
We should get a move on,

39
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,078
we must go into action, duty calls.

40
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,478
- Let it call.
- Show some respect for that uniform.

41
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,200
An agent should always be ready.
- I am ready!

42
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,476
- Will you be serious!
- Leave me alone.

43
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,719
Who's that?

44
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,080
Ciccio! A Chinese man.

45
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,868
- Who, him? Just a tourist.
- He looks Chinese.

46
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,160
- Come on, let's go.
- Where to?

47
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,517
- Let's go, he's watching us.
- Is someone watching?

48
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,275
Hey, where are you going?

49
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,520
- Stop.
- What is it?

50
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,880
- I think we're being followed.
- The Chinese man?

51
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,800
Chinese or not, we have to confront him.
You remember our instructions?

52
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,156
- Of course, Orsa Major force.
- Show me.

53
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,600
The Chinese man, not me.
- Alright!

54
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,070
- Let's hide.
- You hide me, I'll hide you.

55
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,629
Come on.

56
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,516
Hear anything?

57
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,831
We must use our ears.

58
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,233
Your ears!

59
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,360
Can you hear anything?
- Chinese footsteps.

60
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
- What shall we do?
- We need a plan.

61
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,360
Which one?

62
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
- Plan 5 time 8 is 24.
- Fine.

63
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,159
Let's move.

64
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,678
Careful.

65
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,559
Be careful.

66
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,798
He's coming.

67
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,279
Let's hide.

68
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,793
Well done.

69
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,198
Mission accomplished.

70
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,116
But...
- What is it?

71
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,680
- I thought he was Chinese?
- Must be plastic surgery.

72
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,160
True, the Chinese
are masters of disguise.

73
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,760
In or out of disguise,
he's still Chinese.

74
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,833
- The countdown's over, time to go.
- Let's move.

75
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,233
After you.

76
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,000
It's 7:30. Next time you're late,
you can find another job.

77
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,949
- It's the Chinese man's fault.
- Quiet. Guests are coming.

78
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,920
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

79
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,549
- Thank you.
- The ladies' coat, please.

80
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,400
- A world of luxury we'll never know.
- We won't be doormen for ever.

81
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,720
That's why we're taking classes
in espionage.

82
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,320
Once we get that diploma,

83
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,278
we'll be able to say we're in the FBA.

84
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,720
Kidnapping, extortion, secret formulas,
Chinese spies...

85
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,200
We'll know all about it!
- Women too!

86
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,920
Women have a secret passion
for secret agents.

87
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,629
- How do you know?
- Study. Watch the movies.

88
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,360
By the way, our fourth lesson
has arrived.

89
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,680
- You didn't tell me. What does it say?
- Let me see.

90
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,840
This is a curate's pen.
- A what?

91
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,520
- Black curate, it's poison.
- You mean curare.

92
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,600
- You just press this button, and...
- Careful. You could kill me.

93
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,720
Isn't there a manual with it?
- Sure, here it is.

94
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,160
But I can't read it.
- Why not?

95
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,196
I forgot my glasses.

96
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,880
To have curare delivered to you,
send another 10,000 lire

97
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,190
enclosing a valid prescription.

98
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,869
Here I am, Dr Golfoot,
just as you ordered.

99
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,160
- Well done Fong.
- The general will be here soon.

100
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,520
We will observe him closely.

101
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,000
- She's the cloakroom girl.
- No, not at all!

102
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,399
She's a copy.

103
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,756
Your job is to take care
of the real one.

104
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,998
This way my dear.

105
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
That's right, this way.

106
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,709
Let's go.

107
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,280
Careful with the pen, it's dangerous.

108
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,918
More guests.

109
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
Welcome.
- Good evening.

110
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,833
Thank you.

111
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,430
She didn't feel a thing!

112
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,636
Where are you going?

113
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,277
I'm sorry.
Welcome, thank you.

114
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,353
Thank you.

115
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,870
- What have I done?
- I can't die by the pen!

116
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,317
The Chinese guy!

117
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,758
Stop it. Let me.

118
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,196
For you, for me? For him!

119
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,030
- The manager!
- Mission accomplished. Retreat!

120
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,360
This man is dangerous,
we must interrogate him.

121
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,114
He has to talk.
- I don't think that's likely.

122
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,796
He's faking!
We're smarter than he is.

123
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,840
We'll tie him up and
question him after our shift.

124
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,118
Good idea.
Even unconscious, he's still Chinese.

125
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,873
Thank you.

126
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,829
Do it now.

127
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,717
Quick, hurry up.

128
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,112
Time to go to work.

129
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,558
This one's so angry,
I think he's going to explode.

130
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,195
I told you!

131
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,880
This is pseudo-acrylic acid.
Dr Golfoot's favourite explosive.

132
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,440
- Who is this Coldfeet?
- The most evil man alive.

133
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,720
A heartless killer, who's already tried
to take over the world.

134
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,560
Sure. That explosion
obviously drove you mad.

135
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,600
I have to contact Colonel Benson
of the SIC at once.

136
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,960
- Hurry up, untie me.
- Who's SIC?

137
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,680
- Security Intelligence Command.
- He's a secret agent!

138
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,560
Secret agent?
How do we know he isn't Chinese,

139
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,080
disguised as an American,
so we think he's an American

140
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,840
and not Chinese
so we don't know he's an agent!

141
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,560
True! I hadn't thought of that.
Where's your identification?

142
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,917
- In my wallet. Back pocket.
- With your permission.

143
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,429
Here.

144
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,760
It's horrible!

145
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,470
- What does it say?
- I've forgotten my glasses, read it.

146
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,912
- It's true! Bill Dexter, secret agent.
- Like us!

147
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,915
Wait. Mr Agent, please!

148
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,199
Take us with you!
We'll make a good impression.

149
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,840
It's not easy being a secret agent.
You need bravery, intelligence.

150
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,960
You need to speak
four foreign languages.

151
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,111
That's me! I've studied languages.

152
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,398
I know dialects from Palermo, Catania,
Syracuse, everywhere!

153
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,080
Know why he doesn't speak Chinese?
He's never studied it.

154
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,631
He's great with disguises.
Do you remember Fregoli?

155
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,520
He's even better than him.
Show him what you can do.

156
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,752
Here I go. Attention please.
Transformation!

157
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,516
He's good, isn't he?

158
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,196
The boss will be giving you a few tips.
Pay attention.

159
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,552
They'll be of great use.
- This is it.

160
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,480
Young students, you are studying
to be secret agents

161
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,120
and to take on secret missions...
- Ask who that is.

162
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,394
Who is that?

163
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,240
He's Colonel Benson.
He runs SIC, and is an old friend.

164
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,549
I didn't understand.

165
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,430
And I say again, the future of the world
depends on you...

166
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,160
He's very good,
we've worked together many times.

167
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,639
One moment.

168
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,833
Hello there!
- Oh, it's you.

169
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,600
Still here? I thought you'd been fired.

170
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,880
Colonel, it's urgent.
I must speak with you privately.

171
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,760
I can prove that Dr Gold foot has...
- Speak up man!

172
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,036
It's rude to whisper in front of others.

173
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,991
He's still alive!

174
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,078
Dr Goldfoot?

175
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,520
Wait in my office. I'll meet you there
when I've finished.

176
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,034
Now pay close attention.

177
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,556
Is that a secret sign?

178
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,036
Head down to personnel,
they'll take all your details.

179
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,398
Here are your data cards.
Pin them to your jackets.

180
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,800
- I'd give anything to have one.
- Are they hard to get?

181
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,076
Practically impossible.

182
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,277
These are for you.

183
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,037
Students!

184
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,238
Attention! One, two, one, two.

185
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,229
We're in!

186
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,680
- What do you want, Bill?
- Four NATO generals have been killed...

187
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,753
One was blown up this evening,
I was right there!

188
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,115
I've heard, but I don't see
where you fit in.

189
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,229
You no longer work for SIC.

190
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,234
You like the ladies too much.

191
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,711
I saw Goldfoot in the same place
that the general died.

192
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
Your imagining things.

193
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,311
I'm not, colonel.

194
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,160
Is this what you came to tell me?

195
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
Yes sir, exactly.

196
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,600
It's sad, Bill. You'd do anything
to get back into the agency.

197
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,440
You'd even invent a story
about Goldfoot being alive.

198
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,000
That won't fool me, do you hear?

199
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,358
Are you mad? This is a direct line
to the president.

200
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,071
Hallo?
Yes, Mr President, it's me.

201
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,880
About the generals? Bombs?

202
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,760
Surely, it's just a coincidence?

203
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,832
Yes, sir. We're doing all that we can.

204
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,958
Yes, sir. Even the impossible.

205
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,559
Yes, president. The impossible.
As you wish.

206
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,193
I'm going to see my little friends,
it's their breakfast time.

207
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,080
How are we today, little fishes?
Are you hungry?

208
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,631
I've got a nice steak for you,
the way you like it. Rare.

209
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,909
Come on, boys. Throw it in.

210
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,840
What? Thirty seconds?

211
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,280
That's not good enough.
We'll have to starve them for longer!

212
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,354
I want them to eat that much
in the standard time, 25 seconds.

213
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,757
Please, come in.

214
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,396
Please, have a seat.

215
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,474
Gentlemen, this is...

216
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,554
perhaps I should read this.

217
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,674
This meeting is top secret.

218
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,356
This room is completely secure .
Here, we're safe...

219
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,400
from microphones, recorders,
and cunning spies.

220
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,551
No-one can observe us or eavesdrop.

221
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,156
Please turn your attention to this map.

222
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,158
There have been bombings
in all the NATO capitals,

223
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,792
the targets were all generals involved
in maneuvers this June.

224
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,072
Is there a link between these events?

225
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,672
If there is, our Secret Service
will discover it.

226
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,998
As you know, we have hundreds
of highly trained men

227
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,638
The results of years of training.

228
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,760
Highly efficient operatives,
ready for anything.

229
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,039
However, there should not be
human error in selecting agents.

230
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,312
I can make a mistake, but Rita cannot.

231
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,719
- Who is Rita?
- Rita is IBM's latest computer,

232
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,158
The pride of your industries.

233
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,309
Right.

234
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,274
Miss Rosanna, after you.

235
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,311
Gentlemen, this is Rita.
Rita, meet these gentlemen.

236
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,753
Data cards for all our agents...

237
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,311
have already been added to her memory.

238
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
In a few seconds, Rita will select...

239
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,109
their various skills and abilities...

240
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,317
deciding automatically
the best agent for the job.

241
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,913
May I? I'd like to press a button.

242
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,829
This one.
- Of course.

243
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,318
Gentlemen, we make mistakes,
but machines don't.

244
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,195
That's what he thinks!

245
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,669
Done!

246
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,711
Right, let's see.

247
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,119
477 and 478.

248
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,920
- You're here too?
- That's right.

249
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,878
There's lots of great stuff here.

250
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,755
I've heard this is great.
Have you tried it?

251
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,156
I prefer something a little lighter.

252
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,472
A grenade with a short fuse.
- The kind I like to use!

253
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,000
Would you pass me a Breda
- Which type?

254
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,231
Why, a Breda.
- You're shameless.

255
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,432
- I'll take an 84.
- With pleasure.

256
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,992
What nature creates, Ciccio takes.
- Oh, very good!

257
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,958
Now that's a gun!

258
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,193
TNT! My secret ingredient.

259
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,194
Sicilian gelatine.

260
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,194
Pistachio flavour!

261
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,549
Delicious, try some.

262
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,277
I'm so sorry! Commander, forgive us.

263
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,074
Why the dark expression?

264
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,312
Dear chaps, my thirty year career
is in your hands.

265
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,671
To think that my future depends on you!

266
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,513
For a start, no weapons.
- What?

267
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,120
Not even a machine gun?
- Nothing.

268
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,633
Come this way.

269
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,112
A true secret agent doesn't use guns.

270
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,200
The bulge in your jacket
would give you away

271
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,156
Instead...

272
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,398
A spy uses cunning.
- Cunning?

273
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,716
A bit of milk never hurt.

274
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,110
But a chop to the neck does!

275
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,511
We're the best! The wicked get no rest.

276
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,631
Excellent!

277
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,960
What's he doing?

278
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,316
Easy now, boss.
- Secret agents...

279
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,875
must know how to suffer,

280
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,431
they must be able to take pain!
- Pain?

281
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,193
I've fought with an octopus,

282
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,513
I can handle a hippopotamus.

283
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,680
- What hippopotamus?
- You! Here's my hand.

284
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,955
That tickles! Come on!

285
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,519
It's incredible! Fantastic!
Shake my hand!

286
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,155
This won't take a second.

287
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,631
- No photos!
- How dare you? My camera!

288
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,633
Give me my camera.
- Calm down.

289
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,995
- Do you know who we are?
- No. - Lucky for you.

290
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,399
Look who it is.

291
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,718
Hello there!

292
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm glad I found you.

293
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,720
Listen carefully.
We must join forces.

294
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
Only I can tell you...

295
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
where to find the bomber, Dr Goldfoot.

296
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,760
- I'd rather eat my sandwich.
- Interesting. Where is he?

297
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,360
My investigations show
that he's renting a villa...

298
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,760
on the Appian Way.

299
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,720
It has a large basement.

300
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,840
He's storing a lot of plastic materials.
You know what that means?

301
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,752
- Not a clue!
- But it's obvious.

302
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,320
All the generals were killed by
exploding plastic dummies...

303
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
that looked like real women.
Dr Goldfoot makes them in that villa!

304
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,557
We have to stop him.
- Dr Goldfoot? Exploding women?

305
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,240
You're inventing it all
so you can join the FBI.

306
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,080
- And you sound like Benson!
- He told us to speak to no-one.

307
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,548
And above all not to trust you!

308
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,840
So you won't use me on this mission?

309
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,360
- It's our case, we'll deal with it.
- We'll use ourselves!

310
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,509
Fine!

311
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll talk to Rosanna, she'll convince
Benson to give me the case.

312
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,240
I'll show you.
- Go ahead!

313
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,120
We've trained, you know!
We studied at the Post Office.

314
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,160
Enough of your distractions!

315
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,560
- Actually, he's right.
- So why didn't you tell him?

316
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,800
- The time's not right.
- I prefer The Daily News.

317
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,313
I mean timing!

318
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,635
I've memorized the map.
We'll go to the villa without him.

319
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,080
We'll stop him, reveal his identity
and arrest him.

320
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,470
Ciccio, compared to you,
I'm a small spy.

321
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,471
This Bill Dexter is making me nervous.

322
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,559
You know what?

323
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,992
I have to get my hands on this Rosanna.

324
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,436
Incredible. You have a heart after all!

325
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,640
Don't be ridiculous, Fong.
I need her so I can duplicate her.

326
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,160
- Trespassers in the garden.
- Excellent.

327
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,913
Those two idiots are just in time.

328
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,153
Chun Lai, feed the piranhas.

329
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,120
This place looks uninhabited.
Seems innocent to me.

330
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,160
- Bill said this was the place.
- So either he's wrong or we are.

331
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,840
Do you have a hypothesis?
What are you doing?

332
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,880
- I left it at home.
- Do you have any ideas?

333
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,757
Let's look for him.

334
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,195
Franco! Where are you?
What are you doing?

335
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,040
- A water feature!
- It's hardly the time.

336
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,318
I mean a pool! With water and fishes.
Come and look.

337
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,035
- Where is it?
- This way.

338
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,795
Come on.

339
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,360
Look, what a lovely pool!
The water's clean too.

340
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,000
You know what? I'm going to bathe.
- What?

341
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,160
You're mad, we're in May.
- I haven't had a bath since last May!

342
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,517
- And you caught a cold.
- Okay, I'll check the water.

343
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,757
Give me your hand.

344
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,993
Something's eaten my shoe!

345
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,949
Let me see.

346
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,675
- Who was that?
- Another bather? - Look!

347
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,479
He can't swim, he's drowning.
Let's help him.

348
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,998
Come closer, reach out your hand!

349
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,837
Ciccio! A swimming skeleton!

350
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,200
- Which way?
- Where's the exit?

351
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,430
Over that wall, come on.

352
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,240
Yikes! The Bengal Lancers.

353
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,514
Wait for me!

354
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,633
- Wait!
- We're being shot at!

355
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,480
Commander! We found the plastic villa.
The villa with the plastic!

356
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,920
And spears that come out of the wall!

357
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,960
And Chinese assassins!

358
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,032
Carnivorous fish! Look at my shoe!

359
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,560
What should we do?

360
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,676
Maybe Bill was right.

361
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,997
Red alert! Prepare all agents. Go!

362
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,039
I hope to God for your sakes
that you're right.

363
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
- Hallo?
- Road block seven here,

364
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Military vehicles are on their way,
should we open fire?

365
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,797
No, let them pass.

366
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,908
Plan four B.

367
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,555
SALVATION COLLEGE

368
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,389
Halt!

369
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,793
Just a moment! I'm in charge,
I'll shout 'halt'!

370
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,556
Company, halt!

371
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,678
Careful!

372
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,630
Prepare to attack.

373
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,717
Is this the villa?

374
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,675
It looks like a college to me.

375
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,638
- Excuse me.
- Take a break girls.

376
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,920
Good morning general.
- Good morning Mother Superior

377
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,800
- To what do we owe this honour?
- We'd like to visit the villa.

378
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,199
By all means.

379
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,160
From their clothes, I'd say
these men are archeologists.

380
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,080
If they're interested
in classic figures...

381
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,152
Not those figures. The ones up there.

382
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,240
One of the oldest buildings here,
it's from the 11th century.

383
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,916
Are you here to enroll a niece perhaps?
- Well, you see...

384
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,032
Actually, we'd like to see your pool.

385
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,633
That's it! The pool with the...

386
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,920
The pyramid fish.

387
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,354
We love our little fishes.

388
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,560
It's not the season for swimming...

389
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,315
so we keep goldfish in there.
The girls love to feed them.

390
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,631
- Yeah, with human flesh!
- Don't talk rubbish. Hush.

391
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,109
Enough of this piranha nonsense.
- Come over here, please.

392
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,320
- He's one of them!
- Oh, stop it.

393
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,520
He's the only survivor from
a Chinese convent. He was the gardener.

394
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,240
When the convent was destroyed,
he survived for 6 months eating swans.

395
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,960
Would you get in the pool, dear?
- No! - Go on.

396
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,748
- Why won't he get in the pool?
- Quiet. Behave!

397
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,714
Don't worry, I put the fish in the bath.
Go on!

398
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,236
- You see?
- Poor man.

399
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,559
Go on, get in.

400
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,270
Don't do it! Listen to me.

401
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,677
They'll eat him!

402
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,799
Be careful!

403
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,600
- They're not eating him.
- They've become vegetarian.

404
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,280
I don't get it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

405
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,920
Pity the Nuremberg trials are over,
I'd have you hanged.

406
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,514
- Such a pity.
- Silly boys!

407
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,994
Perhaps you'd like to watch
a gymnastics display by my girls.

408
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,996
They're very good!

409
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,238
Pass me the ball.

410
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,833
Excuse me.

411
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,360
What is it?

412
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,920
- Everything alright, sir?
- Get everyone ready to leave.

413
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,440
- False alarm.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,680
- Something's not right.
- Definitely suspect.

415
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,629
- Follow me, don't act suspicious.
- They mustn't suspect.

416
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,873
Very good.

417
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm not fooled by this college scam.

418
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,996
If we don't find something,
the boss is going to fire us.

419
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,839
What was that?

420
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,109
No noise!

421
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,836
Stop dancing!
This isn't a wedding.

422
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,954
- What's up?
- Come here.

423
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
What is it?

424
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,880
- An opening - On the left?
- No, in mid-field!

425
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,678
- Shall we look?
- Let's look.

426
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,908
A red light!

427
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,317
Let's take a look.

428
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,240
- Watch it!
- You watch it!

429
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,915
- Who's that?
- Someone in a hurry for a bath.

430
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,997
A dead China-man!

431
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,915
This place is a cemetery!

432
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,200
Oh, general, you're too kind.

433
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,953
- Colonel!
- Who's that?

434
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,600
- We've got proof! It's proved. Proven!
- Enough of this.

435
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,960
I'm not interested. Let's go.
- The fish! Don't go!

436
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,713
They're closing the gates.

437
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,031
They've closed them.
They're coming towards us. Run!

438
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,993
Take them to the strongroom.

439
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,280
No-one's following us.

440
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,159
At least we got out
of that horrible dark cell.

441
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,280
Stop pushing.

442
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,271
We gave them the slip.

443
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,560
- Stop turning around
- Follow me, stay close.

444
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,959
Where are we?

445
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,474
We're moving like a mad crab.

446
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,119
Big scales, little scales,
capsules, jars

447
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,080
It's all mechanical. What is this?

448
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,358
I want to know what they're making
in this college.

449
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,229
- Let's see. Ciccio!
- What is it?

450
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,880
Look at all the lovely women!

451
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,920
- What women, are you mad?
- They're beautiful, I can see them!

452
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,600
- Come on. Follow me.
- Where to?

453
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,680
- We have to get this rope off.
- Forget that, I want the girls!

454
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,955
We'll use this handle.

455
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,958
Rub against it.
Stop it! - Wait!

456
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,149
Look!

457
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,718
Look, she's got green eyes.
She's coming this way!

458
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,480
- Command me, master
- A ham sandwich. - What?

459
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,277
Untie this rope.

460
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,156
Ciccio, there's more. Still more!

461
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,360
Where are they coming from?
They're so beautiful.

462
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,760
It's like being in a doll factory.
- A supermarket.

463
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,992
- Gather round girls. We're right here.
- Easy now.

464
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,080
We're two red-blooded Sicilians.

465
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,680
Finally, we're free.
- Right let's get out of here.

466
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,432
What? Are you mad?

467
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,280
I'm staying here
to enjoy these natural splendors!

468
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,120
I'm going to marry the lot.
Do you all know how to cook?

469
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,793
Yes! We can cook, knit and dance.

470
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,080
- They even dance!
- We can't, we're on duty.

471
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,958
Duty? I'm on leave. Let's dance!

472
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,273
Would you look at all these women!

473
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,637
We're the luckiest men alive. Look!

474
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,670
It's incredible!

475
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,997
Just look at them!

476
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,240
What's going on here?

477
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,560
What is this?
- It's Goldfoot - I don't care!

478
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,840
- Control yourselves! Stop this!
- Let's blend in.

479
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,354
The party pooper's here.

480
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,753
Even machines have bad days.

481
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,989
It's a trick! Spies in the lab!
Emergency!

482
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,960
They've kidnapped Rosanna.
There was a duplicate at her house.

483
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,080
Goldfoot was trying to blow me up.

484
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,520
Did you see her in there?
- I don't know a Rosanna.

485
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,080
- And Ciccio?
I don't know anyone called Ciccio.

486
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm not going back in there!
Go and call the police.

487
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,720
- What are you talking about?
- I'm scared.

488
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,635
There's only two of us! Why risk it?
I don't know anything.

489
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,315
Dear general Willis,
you're the last one alive, for now.

490
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,196
Do you want to know why?

491
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,080
- B-b-b-bec..
- Because I need to study you in detail.

492
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,600
Every gesture and mannerism
if I'm to make good use...

493
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,160
of our physical similarity,
so I can take your place.

494
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,674
W-W-what do you intend to do?

495
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,120
V-v-v... very simple. I'm taking your
place as Air Force commander.

496
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,669
Y-y-you can't! R-r-release me at once!

497
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,275
You'll regret this! I'll h-h-have you
shot like a d-dog!

498
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,200
- Your command?
- I only clicked my fingers.

499
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,636
Your fingers speak.
How may I serve you?

500
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,240
Your target is in here. Caged.
Take care of him at once.

501
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,360
That's right. Good girl.

502
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,832
Only use half your explosive charge
while were in here. Go ahead.

503
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,758
- Oh Willis!
- But I'm a married man.

504
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,480
Command me, master.

505
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,109
Listen carefully.
I order you to stay here.

506
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,390
Kill any living creature that enters.

507
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,560
- Kill any living creature.
- I leave you to your fate.

508
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,709
Let's go.

509
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,439
Kill all living creatures.

510
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,634
A beetle!

511
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,120
- I'm going.
- Come here.

512
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,560
I'm scared!

513
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,869
- Quiet!
- I'm scared

514
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,920
The trap door is in the bathroom, right?

515
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,600
I'm going in. Watch my back.
- You're leaving me alone?

516
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,716
I'll raise the alarm!

517
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,317
Woodworm!

518
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,108
- Ciccio! You escaped. Me too!
- Tapeworm.

519
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,800
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
It's me, your little Franky!

520
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,949
Hug me!

521
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,314
You're breaking my ribs!

522
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,233
Killer! Traitor! How can you do this?
I've known you for years.

523
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,915
We're brothers in arms.

524
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,995
Don't come any closer!

525
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,680
Kill all living creatures.

526
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,636
No! Put the bar down!

527
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,434
What are you doing in there?

528
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,472
- Rosanna! - I'm Ciccio.
- I know, where's Rosanna?

529
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,240
What did they do? Are you frozen?

530
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,151
I'll defrost you.

531
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,150
Predatory male.

532
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,795
Look out!

533
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,560
Poor Ciccio.

534
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,160
Something must have driven him mad.

535
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,311
Don't worry, this is just a duplicate.

536
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,320
- Where's Goldfoot?
- I heard him use the secret passage.

537
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,632
I think it's over there,
near where I was locked up.

538
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,037
That's it! Come on.

539
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,913
You wanted to kill me! We'll see!

540
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,279
- What's happening?
- I'll kill you like a dog.

541
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,794
What are you doing? Stop it!

542
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,680
Are you crazy?
- Want some more?

543
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,760
Listen! Goldfoot's escaped by car.
We have to follow him.

544
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,435
There's no time to lose.
Hurry up, let's go!

545
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,355
- Back-stabber. I'll show you!
- Move it!

546
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,674
Here they come. Quickly!

547
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,955
Where can they have gone?

548
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,351
How did they get away?

549
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,190
- I almost had them.
- Have you got a light?

550
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,638
- They must be close by.
- They could be anywhere.

551
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,312
What do we do now?

552
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,478
- Ciccio! It's them!
- Get them

553
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,277
Mr Tall Man! Have you seen
anyone go by from up there?

554
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,680
Sorry. No speak Italian.
From giant pigmy tribe.

555
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,752
Sorry to have bothered you. Let's go.

556
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,758
Quickly.

557
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,989
This way.

558
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,515
They didn't notice.

559
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,720
Hey you! Indecent behaviour

560
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,280
I'd love to see their faces now.

561
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,078
- You really want to?
- Of course.

562
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,840
- Get off! Who's there?
- Let me out.

563
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,840
- Please, wait! You can't park here.
- What are you two doing?

564
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,638
Where are you going? Come back!

565
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,077
Quickly, get in.

566
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,629
- That's a no-parking zone!
- I'll show you.

567
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,874
You scoundrel, come here.

568
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,394
Let him go.
- Stupid fool.

569
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,355
Left hook, right hook.

570
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,911
- He got away again.
- He left his cloak.

571
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,389
Here come our guys.
- Quickly - Pass her to me.

572
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,033
- There they go.
- After them!

573
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,556
Come on, let's ride!

574
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,278
Give me a steed.

575
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,520
Take cover, they'll get you.
- I've got cover.

576
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,636
Get off.
- What next?

577
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,638
We'll get when they come round.

578
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,073
You again!

579
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,916
You can't park there!

580
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,712
We'll follow them with the express.
Get on board!

581
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,309
Stop!

582
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,680
They've gone.

583
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,680
- We've arrived.
- Oh, thanks.

584
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,352
There they are!

585
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,149
Run!

586
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,239
No parking!

587
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,033
Move your car!

588
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,077
They took the car!

589
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,360
Let's get in there,
we'll see where they're going.

590
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,352
I've got you this time. Come on then!

591
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,910
Run away! You cowards.

592
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,436
Roll up folks! Take trip in the balloon.

593
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,351
Just a moment, pay up.
- Quick, get in.

594
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,633
Move your car!

595
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,600
You're not getting away!

596
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,000
Stop right there. It's full.

597
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,877
What are you doing?

598
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,677
There they are! The car's leaving.

599
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,280
You cheating scoundrels!
- Who's that?

600
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,829
- Murderers! Swine!
- It's still him.

601
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,238
Do you have any scissors?
- Sure.

602
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,389
Here.

603
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,353
Alone at last.

604
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,194
Idiot! What have you done?

605
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,074
- I cut the rope.
- I noticed. Now what do we do?

606
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,680
- We can play cards.
- We have to find Goldfoot.

607
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,560
How are we supposed to steer?
- My cards! How could you?

608
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,712
- How do we control this thing?
- Have you got a fan?

609
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,679
Hands off!

610
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,557
- As if that's going to help.
- Which way? Over there?

611
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,433
And we're off!

612
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,357
Please fasten your safety belts.

613
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,912
"See you again, my Roman friends".

614
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,314
Oh, stop it.

615
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,517
There! He's already taking off.

616
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,319
He's done it.

617
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,636
Quick, let's follow them.
Turn the fan around. Faster!

618
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,279
Faster!

619
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,272
We've run out of juice!
How will we catch them now.

620
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,200
I know a short cut. Turn right,
then left at the crossroads.

621
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,111
He knows a short cut.

622
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,680
- Are you sure?
- We might hit a typhoon.

623
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,400
- I don't care, I've had my jabs.
- Idiot! It's not a disease.

624
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,472
- So what is it?
- It's an Asian curry.

625
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,280
- Bad weather's all we need.
- The barometer was wrong.

626
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,032
We forgot to tap it!

627
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,109
Look.

628
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,953
A pigeon. What's he doing here?

629
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,320
Shoo! Get lost, you stow away.

630
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,560
- Leave him be, he's a carrier pigeon.
- How can you tell?

631
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,080
- Look, he's carrying a bag.
- Where? Oh yes.

632
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,310
Can we get you anything?

633
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,516
Poor little thing.

634
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,078
The death of an innocent pigeon!

635
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,680
We're losing height.
We have to drop ballast.

636
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,795
Quick.

637
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,680
No time to waste.

638
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,680
- Throw out anything we don't need.
- No, just the useless stuff.

639
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,910
So what are you? Useful?

640
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,352
We're flying!

641
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:49,233
Look, the Chinese Wall!
- The Iron Curtain. Those are the Urals.

642
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,193
You again!

643
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,153
- Look who it is!
- You bastards. This isn't over!

644
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,637
In a balloon! Against the traffic!

645
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,275
Stay here! Forever!
It's what you deserve.

646
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,476
I'll be waiting for you.
You'll be seeing me again soon.

647
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,440
After this cloud, there's a bend.
We'll wait for Goldfoot there.

648
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,228
- How do you know all this?
- Oh, it's nothing!

649
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,069
Stop!

650
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,148
Look! There's the plane.

651
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,675
- Duck.
- Right, let's open the valves.

652
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,869
Who is it?

653
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,795
- Friends.
- Friends, that's nice!

654
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,713
Just a moment.

655
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,795
Quick!

656
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,233
Quickly!

657
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,832
Get off me will you?

658
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,389
I'm a contortionist.

659
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,790
Let go of my foot!
- Help.

660
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,191
Somebody help me!

661
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,397
That should do it.

662
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,989
Here I am.

663
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,638
It's not working.
- Allow me.

664
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,312
My eyes! I can't see!
- Don't worry, I'll help you.

665
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,115
This way please. Bye!
- Where's the step!

666
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,840
Guess how the Chinese man died?

667
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,391
Don't spoil the ending for me.
Where's the fun in that?

668
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,000
Farewell, my friends, farewell.
I have to leave.

669
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,357
I've taken care of everything.
The autopilot's on.

670
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,400
In precisely 16 minutes, the H bomb
on board will hit the Kremlin.

671
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,871
My plan will have its happy ending,
as I knew it would.

672
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,240
No-one beats Goldfoot!

673
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,708
Hardjob, where are you?

674
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,795
- Here I am!
- Dearest.

675
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,718
You're not Mary Poppins,
but you'll do. Come on.

676
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,749
Let go of me.

677
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,509
Blast!

678
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,149
A ghost!

679
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,395
We're safe, they've gone.
- The hell we are.

680
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,760
The controls are locked, in a few
seconds, the bomb will hit Moscow.

681
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,796
So? We're insured.

682
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,080
Benson calling Willis, do you read me?

683
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,480
I'm told you're flying over Russia,
have you gone mad?

684
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,277
Respond at once.

685
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,920
- Benson, it's me.
- Who's me?

686
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,160
- It's Bill Dexter.
- You again!

687
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,040
Your agents are with me.
They've done a great job.

688
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,000
Do you want to speak to them?

689
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
If I hear from them,
I'll have another heart attack.

690
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,240
Where is general Willis?
- Goldfoot killed him to take his place.

691
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,320
- We've dealt with him.
- Good, but you must turn around.

692
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,160
We can't, the controls are locked.

693
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,400
In eight minutes, the H bomb
will hit the Kremlin.

694
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,880
- This is terrible.
- You're telling me!

695
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,040
Right, I'm sending fighter planes
to shoot you down.

696
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,713
Are you mad? What about the bomb?

697
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,117
- True. Use my two agents.
- That's us.

698
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,280
There are instructions near the bomb.

699
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,120
Make sure you put on
protective suits before you begin.

700
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,793
Okay guys, it's all up to you now.

701
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,158
There's the bomb, get down there.

702
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,439
- Why are we wearing these suits?
- To protect you from fallout.

703
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,440
- Are we going to fall? I'm scared!
- Haven't you heard of Uranium?

704
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,195
Of course. It's what the English use
in salad dressings.

705
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,475
- No, it's a powder used in fireworks.
- Get on with it. Pass me the manual.

706
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,275
Okay, okay! Here you are.

707
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,600
If your bomb explodes accidentally
within it's first year,

708
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,880
Hydrogen Ltd will be happy
to provide you with a replacement.

709
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,677
Here, you read it.

710
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:22,394
- Have you completed the registration?
- Is this bomb rented?

711
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,634
Open panel HK carefully.

712
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,399
Can we go now?

713
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,709
Slowly turn rheostat B
from seven to zero.

714
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,474
- Which one is it? - Don't touch!
- Okay, okay!

715
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,960
- I wish you'd gone to university.
- I never had the time.

716
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,320
Be careful. We can't afford mistakes,

717
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,677
the bomb will drop in two minutes.
- Relax! We get it.

718
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,398
- Are you sure that's right?
- Stop distracting me.

719
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,160
Carefully extract the silver contact...

720
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,232
next to rheostat B. Do not allow it...

721
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,960
to touch the red or green wires.

722
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,236
Don't let the thingy touch the colours.

723
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:46,515
Be extra careful. It's at this point
the bomb is almost certain to go off.

724
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,069
There! The bomb's disarmed!
We're safe!

725
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,197
Wait! Wait for us!

726
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,669
Mummy!

727
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,153
Hold tight!

728
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,351
- What are you doing?
- Don't leave me!

729
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,913
I couldn't live without you!

730
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,315
- We're upside down.
- Don't move an inch!

731
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,873
I'm not enjoying this at all.
I have to get a grip.

732
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,837
Hold my hand tight!

733
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,151
We're going down!

734
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,440
Hallo, Benson? The bomb dropped,
but it didn't go off.

735
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,638
- Well done, Bill.
- Your agents gave their lives.

736
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,192
They sacrificed themselves
for all mankind.

737
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,840
How do we get back?
The controls don't work.

738
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,240
Didn't you know the world is round?

739
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:11,240
Keep going, you'll get back
to your point of origin. Relax!

740
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,310
Thanks, Benson!

741
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,514
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

742
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,758
- Where are we?
- How should I know?

743
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,112
It's freezing here.
- Forty degrees in the shade.

744
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,077
I can hear Russian.

745
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,120
- How can you tell?
- I had a friend from France.

746
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,395
- Look!
- Who are they?

747
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,160
Comrades!

748
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,513
Bless you.

749
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,549
Greet them, like this.
Comrades, it's us!

750
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,509
We saved the whole world!

751
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,237
The Kremlin too.
- There's two?

752
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,954
- From the H bomb!
- Oh, that.

753
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,229
Let go!

754
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,080
- You don't know who I am.
- This is Ciccio. - Thanks.

755
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,958
I have relatives in high places.

756
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,319
In 1947, my cousin
was a member of parliament.

757
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,957
I've always said Bill Dexter
was a gifted young man.

758
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,760
We'll have to make him
a secret agent with honors.

759
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,159
Cheers!

760
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,876
The President.

761
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,440
Everything's in order, Mr President.
It all went well.

762
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,840
The H bomb didn't explode.
In fact, it's buried in the snow.

763
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,040
There will be no more
mention of this incident.

764
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,880
If the Russians learn that any old
criminal can hi-jack a plane,

765
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,600
and drop bombs on the Kremlin at will...

766
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,200
the diplomatic implications
would be endless. Is that clear?

767
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,240
Of course. I understand, but...

768
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,960
I've nominated our agents
for the highest awards.

769
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,120
You see...
- Cancel all that.

770
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,440
Do you think this is
the time for publicity?

771
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:20,151
- No of course not Mr President.
- So this operation never happened!

772
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,791
We're innocent! We saved your lives.

773
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:33,952
It's true! We've nothing against you.
I swear on my friend's life!

774
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,636
Please forgive. I believe you say truth.

775
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,558
Please, take seat. Have food.

776
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,311
Please, sit. Eat!

777
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,670
Salmon, caviar,

778
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,880
bread, carrots, vodka.

779
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,680
Green salad.
- What, no Russian salad?

780
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,113
Never mind.

781
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,753
Excuse me.

782
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,838
The Germans!

783
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,239
Cheers!

784
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,680
This is colonel Benson.

785
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:55,360
My dear captain, the two men
I mentioned are both impostors.

786
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,319
- Is that so? Right.
- Arrest them immediately.

787
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,112
They're a threat
to international relations.

788
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,680
It's our boss. I recognise his voice.
He's inside the phone.

789
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,719
Perhaps they're arranging a celebration.

790
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,080
- In Moscow.
- No, it'll be Washington.

791
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,800
- Moscow.
- Washington.

792
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,880
Excuse me, will our award ceremony
be in Washington or Moscow?

793
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,240
Siberia!

794
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,037
I'm dying of cold!

795
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,158
Mr Russia. Can we have July, please?

796
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,116
"I hate the summer".

797
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,080
What are you up to?
- I'm cold.

798
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,480
- It's not a radiator.
- Just a little heat.

799
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,680
- I need it for the spaghetti.
- You only ever think about food.

800
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,309
What if I die of cold?
- Get out of my kitchen.

801
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,160
- What are you doing?
- It's stuffy, I need fresh air.

802
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,309
What air?

803
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,120
Close it, there's a draft!

804
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,600
Lunatic! Are you trying to kill me?
- Don't exaggerate! Go on.

805
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,272
Just a bit of heat.

806
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,555
- What's the current here?
- 125 watts.

807
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,675
Hey, we've got a visitor.

808
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,720
Good day, gentlemen.

809
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,360
- What are you cooking?
- Spaghetti, Italian style.

810
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,760
We invented spaghetti,
but here it's pronounced 'spaghyetti'.

811
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,480
If you let me taste them,
I could use my influence...

812
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,920
to get you into the Russian
secret service, the OGPU.

813
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,911
Da, da! Sure! Go ahead

814
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,357
Please, come in.

815
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,513
Excuse me.

816
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,833
Pardon me, have we met already?

817
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,800
No, I've never been here before.
You're sure they'll be good?

818
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,156
Good? They'll be perfect! Observe.

819
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,151
Close the lid! Close it, I'm freezing!

820
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,116
Close it! The film is finished!
Close it!
