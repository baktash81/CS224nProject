1
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:03,820
The subject's name is John Kramer,

2
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:06,728
a 52-year-old male Caucasian.

3
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:10,699
He's seen better days.

4
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:48,504
We have a recent
rectangular transection

5
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,700
to the left occipital lobe.

6
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,936
Some kind of backdoor
brain surgery.

7
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:27,535
Let's check the stomach.

8
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,582
What the hell?

9
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:53,695
Get homicide here, now.

10
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:02,940
Where is it?

11
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,704
It was in his stomach.

12
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,046
Cut it out.

13
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:44,482
Are you there, Detective?

14
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:46,744
If so, you are probably

15
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:49,116
the last man standing.

16
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:51,587
Now perhaps you will succeed

17
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:54,090
where the others have failed.

18
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,060
You think you will
walk away untested?

19
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:58,925
I promise

20
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:01,431
that my work will continue.

21
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,492
You think it's over
just because I'm dead?

22
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,537
It's not over.

23
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:09,165
The games have just begun.

24
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:25,215
What the fuck? What the fuck?

25
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:28,226
What the fuck?

26
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,091
My eyes!

27
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:33,528
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

28
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:35,998
What the fuck is this?

29
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,174
Who's that?

30
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:51,013
Talk to me.
What are you doing?

31
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:53,050
Talk to me.

32
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,691
Talk to me.

33
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:16,665
Stop it!

34
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,666
Stop.

35
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:27,911
Stop it.

36
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,437
What are you doing to me?

37
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,945
What did I do?
Help!

38
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:57,379
Help!

39
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,883
Who's doing this to me?

40
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,666
Just get away from me!

41
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,199
What did I do?

42
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,929
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

43
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,267
Clear.

44
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,708
In position.
Standing by.

45
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,748
Hold right there.

46
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,117
I see movement.

47
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:21,050
We have a device.

48
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,593
You get eyes in there
before you go in.

49
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,890
Get some eyes in here.

50
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,931
Moving now.

51
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,076
The doorway is clear.

52
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,046
It's Kerry!

53
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:23,485
- Rigg!
- Don't do it! We're not secure!

54
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:25,523
- Rigg, I said no!
- Kerry!

55
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,785
- Stop him!
- Do not go through that door.

56
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,795
Kerry!

57
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,830
Shit.

58
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,422
- Get me the coroner's office.
- Copy.

59
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:00,457
Somebody get those rats off her.

60
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,162
Let's get the light on this.

61
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,527
Cut her down.

62
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,436
You know I can't do that.

63
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,974
I said cut her down.

64
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,607
Please.

65
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,084
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

66
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,423
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

67
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,359
I thought she was still alive,

68
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,057
thought I could save her.

69
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,201
Did you ever think
that we would end up here

70
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,237
when we first started?

71
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:49,999
No.

72
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:52,474
I didn't see it
happening like this.

73
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,070
Why the hell do we still do it?

74
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,708
It's in our nature to save them.

75
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:02,480
- It's what we do.
- Right.

76
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:05,886
"Cherish Your Life."

77
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,754
- What?
- The fucking motto.

78
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,953
We're supposed to cherish
our lives.

79
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,587
How the hell are we
supposed to do that

80
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:14,632
when this is our life?

81
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,761
We chose this.

82
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:22,703
- You go home.
- Hoffman, there are two agents

83
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:25,174
- here to see you.
- Copy.

84
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,241
- Detective Hoffman?
- Yes.

85
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,681
I'm special agent Lindsey Perez.

86
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,513
This is special agent Peter Strahm.

87
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:36,644
How can I help the FBI?

88
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:40,088
We're here about Detective Kerry.
She was our liaison.

89
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:41,887
"Open the door
and you will find me."

90
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:44,451
What?

91
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:51,294
- What's this?
- The key that came

92
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,269
with out last message
from Detective Kerry.

93
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,829
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

94
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,534
No.

95
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,311
Where's the body?

96
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,877
The crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

97
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:13,082
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

98
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:15,125
Run it for prints.

99
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,396
Give us the room for a minute,
would you? Thanks.

100
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,575
The lock was open.

101
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:34,076
She couldn't get out.

102
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:38,047
It was constructed for her execution.
Betrayed the rules.

103
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,845
Not a Jigsaw trap then?

104
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,408
No, Amanda Young,
the accomplice...

105
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:45,217
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

106
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,553
Detective Kerry weighed
approximately 130 lbs.

107
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,593
Amanda Young's arrest report
has her at 107.

108
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,855
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

109
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,397
The bedridden cancer patient?
He's brains, not brawn.

110
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:56,592
He was also an engineer.
He could have rigged pulleys...

111
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,727
Or someone else
could have helped him.

112
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,864
Special agent, if you're here for any
other reason than just to assist...

113
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,431
We're here to find the person
your department couldn't, Detective,

114
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,273
the one helping Jigsaw
and Amanda Young.

115
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:10,314
Excuse me.

116
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:19,313
We found a harlequin doll in your
possession. What's that about?

117
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,585
It's a toy.
The kids play with toys.

118
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,093
That's all it is.

119
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,256
How about the tricycle?

120
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,424
The tricycle is from John's youth.

121
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,560
A grown man has
a tricycle his whole life?

122
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:34,832
I'm sure you've kept things
that were important to you.

123
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,999
Look, Ms. Tuck,

124
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:39,043
is there any reason
we should be concerned

125
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,169
for your safety?

126
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,577
Perhaps you should be
more concerned for yourself.

127
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,616
Why don't you tell me
everything you know about John?

128
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,173
And let's start at the beginning.

129
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:50,914
John's life defies chronology
and linear description.

130
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:54,321
So why don't we start at the end
and work our way backwards?

131
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,950
I represent Ms. Tuck.

132
00:15:58,262 --> 00:15:59,991
She knows something.

133
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,123
I thought you were going home.

134
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,897
You have vacation time, right?
Take it.

135
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,302
Finish the remodeling,
spend some time with Tracy.

136
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,840
- She understands.
- Then don't take her for granted.

137
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:15,209
- Eric is still out there, man.
- Eric's been missing for six months.

138
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,271
Kerry was gone for four days.
I can only be as optimistic

139
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:20,817
- as the facts allow.
- Yeah, well, I'm in it till I find him.

140
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:22,682
Finding his body is not gonna
vindicate us.

141
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,618
Finding him alive will.

142
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:26,816
It's time to let go.

143
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,825
I want you to go home.

144
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:31,691
I'll call you later to make sure
everything is okay.

145
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:37,829
Who's he?

146
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:39,665
Lieutenant Rigg,
our SWAT commander.

147
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:43,104
- What's his problem?
- Everyone around him keeps dying.

148
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:06,596
What's it say?

149
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:09,724
It says, "I tried calling you
four times."

150
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,132
It says, "Dinner is in the fridge."

151
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:17,305
And at the bottom it says,
"I love you."

152
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,434
I need to help my mom

153
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,740
for a few days.

154
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,643
Just...

155
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:26,808
come with me, okay? Now.

156
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,818
I can't.

157
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,754
You can,

158
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:35,223
but you won't.

159
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,557
What you can't do

160
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:39,823
is save everyone.

161
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,870
Tracy.

162
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:53,536
Tracy, please listen to me.

163
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:09,760
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal Group.

164
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,920
No irony in that, huh?

165
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:14,055
What was Rigg watching?

166
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:18,033
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex. It's old.

167
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,070
Why is a SWAT guy watching that?

168
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:24,039
Strahm, I really think
we should tell Hoffman

169
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:26,042
what Detective Kerry said
in her last message.

170
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,409
She said two officers
might be in danger,

171
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,471
but until we know who,
we're not causing a panic.

172
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:34,017
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else
in this precinct is in danger,

173
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:35,916
- I think they should know it.
- Not your call.

174
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,689
Making any progress?

175
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,987
We're fine, thanks.

176
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:48,793
Hey, boss, looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

177
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,800
- Maybe it's...
- Thanks.

178
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,836
I'll check it out.

179
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,872
If you need me, call my cell.
Coffee machine is around the corner.

180
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,408
- A boy or a girl?
- A girl.

181
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,068
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not.

182
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:02,669
It's a short story, believe me.

183
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,236
Tracy.

184
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:42,847
Tracy?

185
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,860
Hello, Officer Rigg.

186
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:31,918
Welcome to your rebirth.

187
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,190
Fuck.

188
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:35,562
For years you've stood by
and witnessed

189
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,601
as your colleagues have fallen.

190
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:40,262
You have remained untouched

191
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:42,771
while Eric Matthews
has disappeared.

192
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,866
But with your survival
came your obsession...

193
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:47,911
obsession to stop
those around you

194
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:50,037
from making the wrong choices,

195
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:53,140
thus preventing you
from making the right ones.

196
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:55,185
You wanted to save everyone.

197
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:57,379
Tonight I give you
the opportunity

198
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,083
to face your obsession.
Look closely.

199
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:03,320
Eric Matthews is still alive.

200
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:06,090
- Eric.
- The block of ice he stands upon

201
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,994
is melting.

202
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,125
He has but 90 minutes
to save himself.

203
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:15,195
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked
to Eric's survival.

204
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:18,435
Heed my warning,
Officer Rigg.

205
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,670
Their lives hang in the balance

206
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,712
of your obsession.

207
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,977
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

208
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,314
The choice is yours.

209
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:05,417
Don't fucking move.

210
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,235
Jesus.

211
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:23,899
Take off the mask.
Put your hands in the air.

212
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:26,340
I can't!

213
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:40,490
Officer Rigg, your first test.

214
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,891
The person in front of you
is in desperate need of help.

215
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,521
But it is not your job
to save them.

216
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:48,497
You view this person as a victim.

217
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,557
But if you want to see what I see,

218
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:53,194
beneath the mask lies a criminal

219
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,238
undeserving of the life she leads.

220
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,842
Your obsession tells you
to save the victim.

221
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:09,079
I tell you to walk away.
The choice is yours.

222
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:12,381
- Are you a cop?
- What?

223
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,583
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah, I'm a cop.

224
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:20,755
What is that?
What did you do?

225
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,070
- They're in the gears.
- What's in the gears?

226
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:35,441
The combination.
Get me out.

227
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:40,039
Cut my hair. Just get me out.
Cut my hair.

228
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,584
- Relax, relax.
- Hurry!

229
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:45,587
Fucking cut my hair, please.

230
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,146
Get me out!

231
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,751
Please.
Where are you going?

232
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,093
Wait wait wait wait.

233
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,064
Wait wait.

234
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,191
- Shit.
- Wait!

235
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:00,198
Stop!

236
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,603
Fucking let me out!

237
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:06,108
Get back here, you fucking...!

238
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:10,544
Okay, I'm sorry.
Please come back.

239
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,930
Where the hell is the combination?

240
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,834
Shit. Shit.

241
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:40,910
Hold on! Hold on!

242
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:46,247
I got one.

243
00:25:46,316 --> 00:25:48,682
I got one. Hold on!

244
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,913
- Hold on.
- Hurry!

245
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:55,320
Oh, God.

246
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:01,023
- Yeah?
- We pulled a print off that casing.

247
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,066
We've got a match.

248
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,601
Jesus. Did you check this?

249
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,727
Twice.

250
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,340
Come on, come on, come on.

251
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,206
I got another one. Hold on!

252
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:18,010
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Hurry!

253
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:20,209
I got it. 617. 617.

254
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,252
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

255
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:31,126
Go!

256
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:34,062
Shit.

257
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,565
Okay okay okay, listen,

258
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,760
stay here. Don't touch anything.

259
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:03,085
What the fuck?

260
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:08,331
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

261
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:09,695
Drop the fucking knife!

262
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:11,632
- Please.
- Put the knife down.

263
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:13,670
Put the knife down.

264
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,331
I just saved your fucking life.

265
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,609
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Drop the knife.

266
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:32,185
Hey, these prints just came in.
They're from Officer Rigg.

267
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:33,848
- Fisk.
- Not now.

268
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:36,552
We just got a call of "shots fired"
from 23 Park Place.

269
00:27:36,627 --> 00:27:39,027
That's Rigg's apartment.

270
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,104
Hello, Brenda.

271
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,197
I want to play a game.

272
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:53,141
An officer will try to save you.

273
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,976
If he is successful,
then your game begins.

274
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:59,515
This man will use these photos

275
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:02,211
to sentence you for your crimes.

276
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:04,254
And the only way to stop him

277
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,312
is taped underneath the TV.

278
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,493
Let him save your life

279
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,927
and accept your fate
to rot in prison,

280
00:28:12,996 --> 00:28:15,464
or kill him

281
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,762
and guarantee your freedom.

282
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:20,201
Make your choice.

283
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,502
I'll fucking kill you,

284
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,004
you fucking bitch!

285
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,288
Rigg!

286
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:30,061
- Rigg, you in here? Rigg!
- Go! Move move move!

287
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:33,937
Christ.

288
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,972
I got one.

289
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,776
I got one.

290
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,788
It's started.

291
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:55,982
An APB has been issued for Rigg.
Everybody's looking.

292
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,085
- He has a wife. Where is she?
- We haven't located her yet.

293
00:30:59,162 --> 00:31:01,824
Strahm...

294
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:04,264
two detectives. You see this?

295
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,133
Hoffman... you got a 20 on him?

296
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:08,535
Not yet.

297
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,163
- Hoffman.
- Calling.

298
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,333
How do you explain
Detective Matthews?

299
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:14,240
- He's alive.
- Six months.

300
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,439
- Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.
- No one but Amanda Young.

301
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:20,347
You think he's been fixed?

302
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,248
Why these six?

303
00:31:26,223 --> 00:31:28,885
Hoffman's a decorated lieutenant.
He doesn't fit the profile.

304
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,928
That's what you see.
But what does he see?

305
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,391
- Rigg trying to save his two friends.
- Maybe.

306
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,899
You got names and locations
on any of these people?

307
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:39,833
- Working it.
- This is overkill.

308
00:31:39,903 --> 00:31:42,531
It's a setup to announce
Rigg is the accomplice.

309
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:45,473
Or a setup for his alibi.
Everyone around him keeps dying.

310
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,272
Where is he to tell us he's innocent
or what the hell these photos

311
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:51,473
are doing in his apartment?
Look there.

312
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:55,485
Move, please.

313
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:57,747
"Four Walls Build a Home."

314
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:59,789
What does he want us to see
on these walls?

315
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,790
The victims?

316
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:04,622
One of these pictures
doesn't belong.

317
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,636
This is who we're looking for.

318
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,264
Let's talk to her, now.

319
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,414
Jill Tuck... where is she?

320
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:35,349
Have them turn off the air in there.

321
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:43,957
Ms. Tuck,

322
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:47,094
I'm special agent Perez.
This is special agent Strahm.

323
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,695
I'd like to apologize for pulling
you out of your place of work.

324
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:51,365
What more do you think
I can offer you?

325
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:54,308
My 100 hours of interrogation tapes

326
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:56,607
and the volumes of evidence
taken from my house

327
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,012
weren't enough for you
to understand John?

328
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,052
Actually, it's not John we want
to talk about, Ms. Tuck. It's you.

329
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,610
Me?

330
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:07,248
Why do you want to talk about me?
This isn't about me.

331
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:10,157
So stop wasting both of our time
and get to the real reason

332
00:33:10,227 --> 00:33:12,627
why you've brought me here.

333
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:39,822
Hey, you.

334
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:48,029
Let me go!

335
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,827
Hey!

336
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:54,295
You hear me?

337
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:56,134
You fucking hear me,

338
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:59,004
you fucking motherfucker?

339
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:17,753
Who's my girl?

340
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:22,932
What the fuck are you looking at?

341
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,728
Huh? What the fuck...?

342
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:27,201
Hey, you!

343
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,864
Sir, sir,

344
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,965
sir, can I help you?

345
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,544
Hello, Officer Rigg.
In order for you

346
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,806
to fully understand my way,

347
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,338
you must...
feel what I feel.

348
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,783
The photo before you is of a man

349
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:53,152
- in desperate need of help.
- Sir?

350
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:56,818
In the next room are the tools
to his salvation.

351
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,555
His life is in your hands.

352
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:02,962
But in the end
only he can save himself.

353
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:08,129
Be careful.
There are cameras watching...

354
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:13,171
and you must hide your identity.

355
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,802
Make your choice.

356
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,939
- Sir?
- What the fuck's he doing?

357
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:22,143
I don't know. You're gonna have to...
Look, look,

358
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:24,209
- you're gonna have to go.
- People are trying to sleep.

359
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:26,721
Yeah, I know people are
trying to sleep. You're the one...

360
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,156
Yeah, you can't sleep here.
You have to go.

361
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:31,557
Yeah, well, you can't sleep
in here, okay?

362
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:33,994
That's not a bed.
No, you've got to go.

363
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,328
No, you can't use the bathroom.
Look, look, no.

364
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,832
You're gonna have to go.
All right...

365
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:46,065
Chance, here, girl.

366
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:53,138
Chance. Chance.

367
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:57,279
Chance.

368
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:00,856
What are you doing?
Come on.

369
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:02,892
Chance.

370
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,931
Chance, come here.
Come here.

371
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,601
What you got there, huh?
What you got?

372
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,045
Come here. Come here.
What do you got there?

373
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:38,524
Okay, "Four walls build a home."

374
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:41,826
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

375
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,991
On what your photos are doing
at the crime scene.

376
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,331
"Four walls build a home"
ring any bells?

377
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,608
"Cherish your life"?

378
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:56,946
"Cherish your life"
is the concept

379
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,981
that this whole clinic
was built on...

380
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:01,073
cherish your life... your life.

381
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:04,018
- That's his motto.
- No, it's your motto...

382
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:06,783
of the clinic you run.

383
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:10,155
Fuck, man.
I've been here for three fucking hours!

384
00:38:10,226 --> 00:38:12,626
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

385
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:14,458
Are you out of your fucking mind?

386
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,522
Hey hey.

387
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,499
Hey, guys, come on.
Calm down.

388
00:38:18,568 --> 00:38:20,593
Cecil!

389
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,797
Stop it, Gus.

390
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:25,170
Knock it off now, please!

391
00:38:29,913 --> 00:38:31,778
You don't want to do that.

392
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:34,009
- What the fuck is your problem?
- You're my problem.

393
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:37,952
You're becoming
everybody else's too.

394
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:49,521
How do you feel about a husband

395
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,124
who takes a motto
from your drug clinic,

396
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:54,500
designed to help people,
and twists it

397
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:57,631
into some manic torture mantra?

398
00:38:57,707 --> 00:39:01,234
That part of John
has nothing to do with me.

399
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,348
Look, Ms. Tuck,
I just left a room

400
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,384
with more blood on the walls
than paint.

401
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:11,284
Two officers are missing and
there's a growing pile of bodies

402
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:14,790
in their wake.
And every detail we unearth

403
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:17,520
about your Hall of Fame
psychopath husband...

404
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,221
- Ex.
...points to you

405
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,092
as a possible accomplice.

406
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:24,429
I am just curious as to why.

407
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,526
You know, there's a lot of people
out there

408
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:28,571
looking for answers,

409
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:30,868
wanting to place blame
on someone.

410
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,773
That person is you.

411
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,936
But you know
what the best part is?

412
00:39:36,012 --> 00:39:38,242
I don't have to
convince everybody.

413
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,509
Just 12 people.

414
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:45,982
Okay, tell me
about his workshop.

415
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:54,394
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

416
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,266
Wow, it's big.

417
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:02,566
This is exactly
what you've been looking for.

418
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,901
Nice, huh?

419
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:06,701
Ta-da!

420
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:10,371
This is the clock?
What's so special about it?

421
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:12,607
Except for the fact
the whole deal hung on it?

422
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,582
The mechanism inside it.

423
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,881
It's 300 years old.

424
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,887
Still ticking.

425
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,947
Withstood the test of time.

426
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:27,453
Wait till you see this space.

427
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:34,601
I've got a surprise for you.

428
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:50,953
Why are you doing this?

429
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:54,690
Why?

430
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:00,588
This was... this was a mistake.

431
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:04,099
It happened a long time ago.
And I paid for this.

432
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,964
Just let me...
just let me go, okay?

433
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,469
What's behind that door?

434
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,874
"One saves a life.
One takes it away."

435
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:19,381
Try that on the door.
Try that.

436
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,079
- Oh, no no.
- Get back. Get back. Get back.

437
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:28,748
Let's go. Go.

438
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:05,219
Eric. Jesus.

439
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:08,058
- Help! Help me!
- Get away from there.

440
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:12,701
What do you know about the guy on TV?
What do you know about Eric Matthews?

441
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,737
I don't know who that is.

442
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,934
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

443
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:25,373
What are you gonna do to me?

444
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:30,609
If you are playing this tape,
then you are one step closer

445
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:33,815
to truly understanding
how to save a life.

446
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,688
As an officer of the law,
you find yourself torn...

447
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,454
- Who is that?
- Shut up.

448
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:41,691
- Is the man before you a victim
or a perpetrator of violence?

449
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:44,966
You sick fuck.

450
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:47,264
His salvation is out of your hands.

451
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:51,937
It is your choice, if you wish,

452
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:53,976
to put it into his own.

453
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:56,011
Once this lesson is learned,

454
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,070
you will find yourself
one step closer

455
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:00,707
to truly saving Eric Matthews.

456
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:03,752
Without you this man's game
cannot begin.

457
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,347
Force him into position
to face his demons

458
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:10,415
and let him make the decision.

459
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:19,092
Shh. Don't wake up our neighbors.

460
00:43:21,437 --> 00:43:24,531
Fuck. Is this what you do
with your spare time, huh?

461
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:25,733
No.

462
00:43:25,808 --> 00:43:28,606
Take it all, little girl.
Be a good little whore.

463
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:31,340
Get on the fucking bed.
Get on the bed!

464
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:33,780
Move!

465
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,410
Strap yourself in.
Strap yourself in.

466
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:38,613
Please don't make me do this.
I know...

467
00:43:38,688 --> 00:43:40,849
I know I was wrong.
I know.

468
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,952
Hurry up. Hurry up.

469
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:47,860
Put your fucking hands up.

470
00:43:49,232 --> 00:43:51,427
I don't know. I don't know.

471
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,832
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:43:57,073 --> 00:44:00,133
Listen, I'm really sorry.

473
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:03,337
What does that say?
What does that say?

474
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,511
What is that?

475
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,818
- Take them.
- Why?

476
00:44:17,093 --> 00:44:19,459
Hello, lvan. As a voyeur,

477
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:22,225
you've kept photos of those
you have victimized.

478
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:25,234
- Let me go!
- Can you see the pain

479
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:27,269
you have brought them?

480
00:44:27,336 --> 00:44:29,531
You have torn apart their lives.

481
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:33,302
You have used your body
as an instrument of abuse.

482
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:35,708
Now I give you the chance
to decide

483
00:44:35,778 --> 00:44:38,747
what is more important...

484
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:42,182
your eyes which have led you
blindly astray

485
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:44,549
or your body

486
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,588
which has caused those around you

487
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:49,056
endless suffering.

488
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:52,185
You have been handed the tools
which can save your life.

489
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,059
Decide quickly, though.
In 60 seconds

490
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:58,828
the choice will be made for you.

491
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:13,079
I can do it. One more.
I can do it.

492
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,047
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

493
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:48,550
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

494
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,316
Was this an accident or did someone
do this to you on purpose?

495
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:57,519
You can stop it from happening
if you tell me the truth.

496
00:45:58,628 --> 00:46:00,892
Take a seat, please.

497
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:02,658
I want to go home now.

498
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:09,835
The son of a bitch is lying.

499
00:46:09,906 --> 00:46:12,739
He's done this before.
She's allowing it.

500
00:46:12,808 --> 00:46:16,300
The child's story doesn't corroborate.
What can I do?

501
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:18,813
Jane, I can't let you go home
right now, okay?

502
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:20,644
Go back to class, honey.

503
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:22,843
I told you, Officers,
sometimes these kids...

504
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:25,012
they just get out of control.

505
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,055
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, take it easy.

506
00:46:27,123 --> 00:46:28,920
Rigg! Rigg!

507
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:32,757
No. Get out. Get out now.

508
00:46:32,828 --> 00:46:35,023
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life.

509
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:36,860
You hear me?
I will take him

510
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:39,629
for everything he's got,
that fucking cocksucker.

511
00:46:40,736 --> 00:46:42,704
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck,

512
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:45,673
but if you love the guy so much,
why leave him?

513
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:48,403
- He left me long before I left him.
- Okay, people break up.

514
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:50,604
Relationships end.
It's called life.

515
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,342
I mean, he started
massacring people.

516
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:55,884
- Gideon meant everything to him.
- Gideon? I'm sorry, who?

517
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:58,944
Do you know anything
about the Chinese zodiac?

518
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:01,046
Aw, Jill, no no.

519
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:03,091
I didn't just get pregnant.

520
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,127
It was carefully planned.

521
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:08,186
Everything with John was.

522
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,591
- Thanks.
- See you.

523
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,636
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Let me get that for you.

524
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:17,400
Thank you.

525
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:19,634
- Thanks. Have a good night.
- You too.

526
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:21,301
- Good night.
- Good night.

527
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:28,711
Hey, honey,
you want some company?

528
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:31,412
What are you doing?

529
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:33,455
You know what this building is?

530
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:38,856
It's a health clinic.

531
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:41,829
You're a beautiful girl.
Go home.

532
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:50,268
My jacket.
I forgot my jacket.

533
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,307
- I forgot my jacket.
- Cecil, no.

534
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,070
Oh, please please, Jill.
It's right there.

535
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,544
Look, it's right there.
Please please. Come on.

536
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:00,549
Thank you.

537
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:10,592
Thanks.

538
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:14,589
Listen to me.
I don't want to hurt you, all right?

539
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:16,221
You're gonna open up
that fucking door.

540
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:18,766
Open that fucking door.
Open it.

541
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,132
Open it.

542
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:23,933
Fuck!
What fucking key?

543
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:26,133
- What key?
- That one.

544
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,971
Fuck.

545
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:31,938
Fucking stay there.

546
00:48:35,251 --> 00:48:37,219
Cecil?

547
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:59,371
Don't cry.
No no, hey, you're gonna be okay.

548
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:04,446
Fuck.

549
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,853
I need some help here.

550
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:20,987
Orderly.

551
00:49:21,063 --> 00:49:22,792
This is my wife.
She's pregnant.

552
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,663
- How far along is she, sir?
- Seven months.

553
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:09,276
All I wanted to do was help them.

554
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:13,014
You can't help them.

555
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,118
They have to help themselves.

556
00:50:26,996 --> 00:50:30,124
Okay, let's review:

557
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:32,167
Girl loves boy.
Boy loves girl.

558
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:36,170
Boy gets girl pregnant.
Girl loses baby.

559
00:50:36,238 --> 00:50:39,435
Boy turns into a serial killer.

560
00:50:39,508 --> 00:50:42,636
Jill, I'm not buying it.

561
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,806
You're gonna want
to take a look at this.

562
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:47,849
All right, she doesn't leave.

563
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:02,159
He's been identified
as lvan Landsness.

564
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:04,256
Acquitted of rape three times.

565
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,359
Had to gouge out his own eyes
in order to release himself.

566
00:51:08,604 --> 00:51:11,664
How does something like this
get into a motel room undetected?

567
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,708
Piece by piece.

568
00:51:13,776 --> 00:51:15,801
The room's been rented
for the past six days

569
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:19,177
to a lawyer named Art Blank.
Get this: He went missing two weeks ago.

570
00:51:19,248 --> 00:51:20,943
Run his name.
Get his addresses.

571
00:51:21,016 --> 00:51:24,452
Two out of five people on Officer Rigg's
apartment walls are dead.

572
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,387
Every partner
he's ever worked with... dead.

573
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:30,755
Rigg didn't kill lvan.
Ivan made his own choice.

574
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:32,760
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

575
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:34,625
This wasn't about lvan.
It wasn't his test.

576
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:37,632
It was about Rigg.

577
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,793
Look at these photos.
Tell me how you feel.

578
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:41,665
Look at these women and tell me
how you feel.

579
00:51:41,737 --> 00:51:43,728
- Angry. Enraged.
- Exactly.

580
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:47,970
The pimp, the rapist...
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

581
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:51,376
He wants him to feel what he feels.

582
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:53,813
This wasn't about Rigg
saving his friends.

583
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:56,646
He's being recruited.

584
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,688
Thanks. Art Blank's got
a bunch of properties.

585
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:02,121
Last known address
is a couple of blocks from here.

586
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,691
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

587
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:13,496
- Clear.
- Clear.

588
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:15,537
Clear.

589
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,090
What does this mean?

590
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:39,957
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

591
00:52:53,742 --> 00:52:55,710
Fuck you.

592
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:02,817
Hey.

593
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:06,844
Hey. Hey.

594
00:53:22,905 --> 00:53:25,703
Hey, asshole,
you jump off that block,

595
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:27,298
you electrocute him.

596
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:30,834
If that ice had melted more,
he'd be fried. You understand?

597
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:32,881
Listen to him.

598
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:44,051
You just made the biggest
mistake of your life,

599
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:45,423
- cocksucker!
- Calm down.

600
00:53:45,494 --> 00:53:47,553
We'll get somebody to take
a look at it, all right?

601
00:53:47,629 --> 00:53:50,860
My client has a broken nose
and a fractured cheekbone.

602
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:54,630
Administrative leave with pay
is not acceptable.

603
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,337
The IA investigation is underway.

604
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:02,370
Into this precinct? Wow.
What's that gonna get me, huh?

605
00:54:02,444 --> 00:54:04,639
- The truth.
- I'll tell you what the truth is.

606
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:07,273
The truth is,
I have an eyewitness.

607
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,977
The man's wife? She stands to gain
as much as he does

608
00:54:10,052 --> 00:54:12,020
if there were to be
a financial settlement,

609
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:13,748
which is not gonna happen
because he's lying.

610
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:15,790
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

611
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:17,826
That's according to whom?

612
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:20,259
Me. I saw the whole thing.

613
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,523
You want to testify
before the grand jury?

614
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,898
I've already signed IA's affidavit.
The charges are being dismissed.

615
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:29,199
Oh, you guys are... you're good.

616
00:54:29,271 --> 00:54:32,240
You know, you're obviously as thick
as thieves in this precinct.

617
00:54:32,307 --> 00:54:34,605
But it'll come back to you.
You know that, right?

618
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:37,372
I mean, one day someday it will.
It will come back to you.

619
00:54:45,587 --> 00:54:47,555
You understand?

620
00:54:47,623 --> 00:54:49,147
Motherfucker.

621
00:54:49,224 --> 00:54:51,454
Hey, do you understand?

622
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:56,622
Okay.

623
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:03,600
Motherfucker.

624
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:20,945
You're gonna have to tell me
how you got

625
00:55:21,023 --> 00:55:24,322
those bruises on your hand
and your neck.

626
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:17,637
Rigg! Rigg!

627
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:42,666
I did it! I won!

628
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,365
What the hell did you do?

629
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:46,703
L...

630
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,218
What's happening?

631
00:57:00,923 --> 00:57:03,585
The human body is
a fascinating organism.

632
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,889
It can withstand
the most brutal injury...

633
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:10,023
and yet repair itself miraculously.

634
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:12,066
But you know this all too well.

635
00:57:12,134 --> 00:57:14,125
How many broken bones
have you suffered

636
00:57:14,202 --> 00:57:16,830
at the hands of your husband?

637
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:19,635
How many flesh wounds
have you endured?

638
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:20,970
Help!

639
00:57:21,043 --> 00:57:24,911
With time, the bruises have healed,
but your pain has not.

640
00:57:27,816 --> 00:57:31,912
Today I empower you
to take control of your life.

641
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:34,046
Can you disconnect
from the one thing

642
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:36,886
that has brought you and others
so much pain?

643
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:39,393
With time your wounds will heal.

644
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:43,154
His, however, will not.

645
00:57:47,636 --> 00:57:50,434
Remove the ties that bind...

646
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:51,631
Get me out of here!

647
00:57:51,707 --> 00:57:53,937
...or bleed to death
from you inactivity.

648
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,977
The choice is yours.

649
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,774
Okay.
Okay okay!

650
00:57:58,847 --> 00:58:00,178
Here we go.

651
00:58:04,152 --> 00:58:06,677
I'm sorry.

652
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:12,989
Morgan, Morgan,
what the fuck are you doing?

653
00:58:45,394 --> 00:58:48,625
Help me.
Please help me. I can't do this.

654
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:50,790
- Please help me!
- Calm down.

655
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:52,993
No, don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Wait for me.

656
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:55,059
Please get me out.
Please get me out.

657
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:57,731
Don't. Don't go. Don't leave me here.

658
00:58:57,806 --> 00:59:00,707
Help me down.

659
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:03,745
Hello, Officer Rigg.
What have you learned thus far?

660
00:59:03,812 --> 00:59:06,144
Experience is a harsh teacher.

661
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:08,205
First comes the test.

662
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:10,979
Second comes the lesson.

663
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,521
If you are to save as I save

664
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:16,386
then you will see
that the person before you

665
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:18,016
is but a student.

666
00:59:18,093 --> 00:59:20,823
So I ask you, Officer Rigg,

667
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:22,864
has the pupil learned her lesson?

668
00:59:22,931 --> 00:59:26,367
Has she been taught
the error of her ways?

669
00:59:26,435 --> 00:59:28,130
Does she now

670
00:59:28,203 --> 00:59:30,194
- view the world differently?
- Please help.

671
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,671
Officer Rigg,
the key to this person's freedom

672
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:37,576
lies in the palm of your hand.

673
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:40,046
But only after she has done
her own part

674
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:43,642
can you play your role
in her salvation.

675
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:46,017
Once judgment has been made,
though,

676
00:59:46,088 --> 00:59:48,750
the key to finding
your next destination

677
00:59:48,824 --> 00:59:51,190
is just off the map.

678
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:54,353
- Who did this to you?
- I don't know.

679
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:57,694
Help, please.
Help, please.

680
00:59:57,766 --> 00:59:59,893
Stay still.
I'm gonna try to take this out.

681
01:00:12,114 --> 01:00:13,308
Thank you.
Thank you.

682
01:00:13,381 --> 01:00:15,349
Oh, fuck.

683
01:00:16,451 --> 01:00:19,147
That's it.
"Just off the map."

684
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:21,189
Just off the map.

685
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:25,085
Tracy.

686
01:00:27,162 --> 01:00:28,493
"Go home."

687
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,061
Where is she?

688
01:00:33,135 --> 01:00:35,831
I'm so cold. Please.

689
01:00:43,145 --> 01:00:45,113
I want to live.

690
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,018
You have to save yourself.

691
01:00:55,023 --> 01:00:56,786
Don't leave me.
Please don't leave.

692
01:00:56,858 --> 01:00:58,883
Help me, please.
Don't leave.

693
01:01:03,899 --> 01:01:05,992
I want to stop playing.

694
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:11,932
Why don't you fucking kill me?

695
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:13,838
No.

696
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:19,874
- Shut up!
- I don't want to play anymore.

697
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,418
"Save as I save."

698
01:01:24,486 --> 01:01:26,613
So what did he do,
free her and let him die?

699
01:01:26,688 --> 01:01:28,849
This guy didn't have a chance.
He's got rods going through

700
01:01:28,924 --> 01:01:31,620
every major artery in his body.
"Your life is in her hands."

701
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:33,661
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

702
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:36,663
She identified Officer Rigg,
said he saved her.

703
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:38,392
- Saved?
- Yeah.

704
01:01:38,466 --> 01:01:41,026
She passed Rigg's judgment,
got fixed and got her freedom back.

705
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:47,705
- Yeah.
- Second address?

706
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:52,876
Really? Okay, yeah.
That's good. Good.

707
01:01:52,948 --> 01:01:55,246
But I still need that address.
Text me.

708
01:01:55,317 --> 01:01:58,548
I just found out something interesting
about the three people in the traps.

709
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,021
They were all represented by a lawyer
named Art Blank.

710
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,320
- He got them all off?
- Yeah. But wait, it gets better.

711
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:05,825
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

712
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:09,095
Look out!

713
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:16,261
- The lair... where's the lair?
- Raided. It doesn't exist.

714
01:02:16,338 --> 01:02:18,898
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.
Where's the new game being played?

715
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:20,407
We find that place... we find Rigg.

716
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:22,841
We got a second address.
There's a co-owner.

717
01:02:22,911 --> 01:02:24,242
- Who?
- Jill Tuck.

718
01:02:24,312 --> 01:02:27,110
- Jill Tuck? Where's the building?
- Here. This building.

719
01:03:36,284 --> 01:03:38,013
Hello, Agent Perez.

720
01:03:38,086 --> 01:03:41,920
And welcome to the world
that you have long studied.

721
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,821
Your partner Agent Strahm

722
01:03:43,892 --> 01:03:47,521
will soon take the life
of an innocent man.

723
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:50,086
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

724
01:03:50,165 --> 01:03:53,328
Your next move is critical.

725
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:55,369
Open the door...

726
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:00,107
What is that?

727
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,688
I got you.

728
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:19,856
Paramedics!

729
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,828
Help!

730
01:04:23,198 --> 01:04:25,530
Stay with me.
Okay, come on.

731
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,568
Shallow breaths. Come on.

732
01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:29,159
Stay with me. All right.

733
01:04:29,237 --> 01:04:31,637
All right. You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

734
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:04,768
Hey.

735
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:07,775
Hey, you. Come here.

736
01:05:07,842 --> 01:05:09,400
Look.

737
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:12,310
Hey. Hey.

738
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,007
Come on.

739
01:05:14,082 --> 01:05:16,949
Hey. Hey.

740
01:05:18,253 --> 01:05:19,686
Fuck.

741
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,954
- Stop. Stop.
- Son of a bitch!

742
01:05:27,028 --> 01:05:28,791
Fuck.

743
01:05:31,499 --> 01:05:33,831
Stop. Fuck.

744
01:05:33,902 --> 01:05:35,699
Hey.

745
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,398
Listen to me. I'm not the one
you've got to worry about.

746
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:41,271
You understand me? I'm not
the one you've got to worry about,

747
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,469
asshole.

748
01:05:43,545 --> 01:05:46,878
As a matter of fact,
I recommend you stay alive

749
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:50,440
until the fucking clock
counts down.

750
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:55,521
Here's the good news:
If this other guy passes his test,

751
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,787
the three of us can go free.

752
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,725
Hey, look at me.

753
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:02,626
Look at me.

754
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:05,791
If you don't stay on the block,
your partner gets electrocuted.

755
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:08,131
Now for my final task.

756
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:12,471
There you go.

757
01:06:13,608 --> 01:06:15,508
Live or die.

758
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:17,340
You make the choice.

759
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,114
Mrs. Perez?

760
01:06:21,182 --> 01:06:24,879
Hi. This is Peter Strahm.
I work with your daughter Lindsay.

761
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:27,979
Yeah.
I have some bad news.

762
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,386
See that, Jill? That's a federal fucking
indictment. It's got your name on it.

763
01:07:08,463 --> 01:07:11,557
Wanna put somebody else's name on it?
You start talking to me, okay?

764
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:13,328
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

765
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:15,699
Who were John's business associates
before he went insane?

766
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,863
He wasn't the associate type.

767
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:20,841
Where the hell is Art Blank?

768
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:23,002
Obstruction of justice.
Aiding and abetting.

769
01:07:23,077 --> 01:07:25,341
Conspirator to murder.

770
01:07:25,413 --> 01:07:26,744
Talk to me!

771
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:29,840
In 15 minutes, more people
are gonna die, Jill... police officers.

772
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:31,681
He's a business partner.
He's a friend.

773
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:33,948
He's the accomplice
we have been looking for

774
01:07:34,022 --> 01:07:35,751
and he is your fucking lawyer.

775
01:07:38,026 --> 01:07:41,120
You see this?
This is my partner's blood.

776
01:07:41,196 --> 01:07:43,562
She's fighting for her life right now

777
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:46,725
because of your lunatic husband.

778
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:49,531
What happened between Jigsaw
and Art Blank?

779
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:51,572
John?

780
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,809
John.

781
01:07:57,378 --> 01:07:59,346
I guess he's not here either.

782
01:07:59,414 --> 01:08:02,781
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

783
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:10,751
- Don't be mad.
- What?

784
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:16,920
Hey, are you all right?

785
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:20,866
You weren't returning
my calls, buddy.

786
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:24,735
Listen, John, l...

787
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:26,774
I'm sorry.
I understand.

788
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:29,742
What happened was a tragedy.

789
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:32,439
But I gotta tell you...

790
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:34,947
listen, John, I gotta tell you,
those buildings we're working on...

791
01:08:35,016 --> 01:08:36,984
You take 'em.
You give my share to Jill.

792
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:40,111
That's not the way it works, John.
You see, we're partners.

793
01:08:40,188 --> 01:08:42,622
Your designs will make
those buildings special.

794
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,158
We've got 40 families ready to move in...
40 families, John,

795
01:08:45,226 --> 01:08:47,421
low-income families.

796
01:08:47,495 --> 01:08:49,224
You can't just walk away.

797
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:51,265
You're their savior, John.

798
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:53,391
Get the fuck out of here.

799
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:55,663
Who are you talking to like that?
It's me, John.

800
01:08:55,737 --> 01:08:58,467
- Did you hear what I said?
- Oh, I heard you, John.

801
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:03,911
Get the fuck...

802
01:09:05,913 --> 01:09:07,574
You heard me.

803
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:14,115
Okay, John.
You take good care of yourself.

804
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:18,182
Gimme a call
when you're feeling better.

805
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,945
He blamed me.

806
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:41,607
I don't think he could
ever forgive me.

807
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:44,151
In his mind
our time was over.

808
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,786
He was diagnosed with cancer
soon after that.

809
01:09:58,232 --> 01:10:00,564
Did you try to contact him again?

810
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:02,330
I tried.

811
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:06,006
But a different person
crawled out of the wreckage.

812
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:08,406
Someone else survived.

813
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:41,772
- I asked you not to come here.
- I need to talk to you.

814
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:43,811
John, John,

815
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:47,075
look at this.
What is this, hmm?

816
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,116
Why do you have Cecil's picture?

817
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:51,151
What have you done to him?

818
01:10:51,219 --> 01:10:55,747
I told him not to take life
for granted.

819
01:10:55,823 --> 01:10:57,791
I want to play a game.

820
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:00,885
Your life is a lie.

821
01:11:00,962 --> 01:11:02,930
Now comes your moment of truth.

822
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,965
As a drug user and a hustler,

823
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:08,365
you've played roulette
with other people's lives.

824
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:10,631
Today you play with your own.

825
01:12:14,402 --> 01:12:16,370
Fuck.

826
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:23,200
Fuck!

827
01:12:28,516 --> 01:12:30,484
Hey, it's you.

828
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:32,109
You did this to me.

829
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:35,155
No, you did this to yourself.

830
01:12:36,557 --> 01:12:38,923
Your greed took the life
of an innocent child.

831
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:42,019
Could you give me time
to explain, please?

832
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,690
I can't give you time.
No one can.

833
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:46,255
Time's an illusion.

834
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:49,565
Look, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

835
01:12:49,637 --> 01:12:51,662
I forgive you, Cecil. I do.

836
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:53,536
Addiction has ruined your life.

837
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:55,303
I'm bleeding, man.

838
01:12:55,376 --> 01:12:57,844
Please just let me go.

839
01:12:57,912 --> 01:13:00,039
I could let you go.

840
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:03,015
That wouldn't serve you.

841
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:07,111
I'll tell you what I will do, though.
I'll give you a tool

842
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:10,157
to reclaim your life,

843
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:13,421
to discard the vices that have
so corrupted your soul.

844
01:13:13,494 --> 01:13:15,462
I don't have a fucking soul.

845
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,521
Maybe you will in the next life, Cecil.

846
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:19,896
You see, things aren't sequential.

847
01:13:19,967 --> 01:13:22,595
Good doesn't lead to good,
nor bad to bad.

848
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,365
People steal,
don't get caught,

849
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:26,406
live the good life.

850
01:13:26,474 --> 01:13:28,533
Others lie, cheat

851
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:30,543
and get elected.

852
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,239
Some people stop
to help a stranded motorist

853
01:13:33,314 --> 01:13:37,011
and get taken out
by a speeding semi.

854
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,450
There's no accounting for it.

855
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,785
How you play the cards you're dealt...
that's all that matters.

856
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:45,189
Look at me.

857
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:47,090
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

858
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:49,823
Oh, yeah.

859
01:13:49,897 --> 01:13:52,024
I understand.

860
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:55,267
You're fucking nuts!

861
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:11,775
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

862
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,983
It's the tool...

863
01:14:15,056 --> 01:14:16,956
the tool that's going to
save your life.

864
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,851
I want to play a game.

865
01:14:21,162 --> 01:14:23,687
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

866
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,995
Now comes your moment of truth.

867
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:30,003
As a drug addict and a thief,

868
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:32,232
you've preyed on the kindness
of others

869
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:34,297
to fuel your addiction.

870
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:36,707
Today we're bringing

871
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:39,371
the ugliness inside you
out into the open.

872
01:14:39,447 --> 01:14:41,574
Now in order for you
to stay alive

873
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:44,117
we have to match your face

874
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:46,983
with the ugliness of your soul.

875
01:14:48,356 --> 01:14:52,656
Just lean forward into the knives
with your face.

876
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:54,957
Press hard enough

877
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:58,055
and you'll release
the arm and the leg restraints

878
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:00,566
that bind you.

879
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:02,626
Press hard, though.

880
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:05,800
And you'll be free.

881
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:08,603
You sick fuck! Fuck you!

882
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:13,613
Or you can sit idly
and bleed out on the floor.

883
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:16,947
Live or die, Cecil.

884
01:15:17,018 --> 01:15:18,986
Make your choice.

885
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:31,228
Fuck you, you sick fuck!

886
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:32,856
Help!

887
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,051
You're dead.

888
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,748
You're fucking dead.

889
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:32,384
Fucking dead.

890
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:47,941
What's happened to you?

891
01:16:50,511 --> 01:16:52,979
What's happened to me?

892
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,878
What's happened
to me?

893
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:05,516
Now you don't come back.

894
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:09,324
You do it for yourself
if you can't do it for me.

895
01:17:10,831 --> 01:17:12,799
I lost him too.

896
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:51,036
"Four Walls Build a Home."

897
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:01,610
Your son was named
after John's first building, right?

898
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:03,980
- Yes.
- Where is it?

899
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:06,611
Where is it?
Where is it?

900
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:09,247
Where is it?

901
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:31,434
What the fuck does that mean?

902
01:19:24,999 --> 01:19:29,060
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

903
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,600
You'd better hope he doesn't
come through that door.

904
01:19:34,675 --> 01:19:37,769
Who? Who's coming
through the door?

905
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,683
Who is it?

906
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:19,849
Where the fuck are you?

907
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,583
Gideon Meat Packing,
11235 Blake Drive.

908
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,625
I don't have two minutes.

909
01:21:27,121 --> 01:21:29,555
Who's coming through the door?

910
01:21:40,968 --> 01:21:42,936
Fuck.

911
01:22:02,423 --> 01:22:04,516
Congratulations, Art.

912
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,656
Who is it?

913
01:22:43,664 --> 01:22:46,155
Who's coming through the door?

914
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:48,793
Here he comes.

915
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:49,995
Who the fuck is it?

916
01:22:51,505 --> 01:22:54,338
Shit.

917
01:22:57,344 --> 01:22:59,141
Shit.

918
01:23:01,115 --> 01:23:03,515
Fix me, motherfucker!

919
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:08,786
I'm standing right here.

920
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:12,548
Your time's running out.

921
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:14,651
Please think about
what you're doing.

922
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:22,058
Think about
what you promised me.

923
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:23,603
Think about tomorrow.

924
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,638
Lynn?

925
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:30,410
Lynn! Lynn!

926
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,321
Who is it?

927
01:23:50,797 --> 01:23:52,924
What is that?

928
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,992
This will release us
when the timer's up.

929
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:02,773
Release me!

930
01:24:07,514 --> 01:24:09,482
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

931
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,518
Live or die, Jeff.

932
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:13,678
You've got a choice.

933
01:24:13,754 --> 01:24:15,449
I forgive you.

934
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,458
Jeff.

935
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:20,493
Jeff!

936
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:26,698
- Eric!
- Don't open the door!

937
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:28,632
What the fuck?

938
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:32,132
Shit.

939
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,577
"Open the door and you will find me."

940
01:25:26,526 --> 01:25:29,324
- Let me see your fucking hands.
- Where is my daughter, you mother...?

941
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:32,858
Fuck.

942
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,335
Jesus.

943
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:57,480
- Fuck!
- Aw, you stupid motherfucker.

944
01:25:57,557 --> 01:25:59,582
- What did you do?
- I had more time.

945
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:03,289
- I still had fucking time.
- Why did you open that door?

946
01:26:03,363 --> 01:26:05,058
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

947
01:26:05,132 --> 01:26:09,193
No, Jigsaw's testing you,
you fucking piece of shit.

948
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:11,863
Put your fucking hands
where I can see them!

949
01:26:11,938 --> 01:26:14,202
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you.
- Don't fucking move!

950
01:26:18,145 --> 01:26:19,942
Hello, Officer Rigg.

951
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:22,641
If you are hearing this,
then you have reached

952
01:26:22,716 --> 01:26:25,514
Detective Matthews
and Detective Hoffman

953
01:26:25,585 --> 01:26:28,053
in under 90 minutes,

954
01:26:28,121 --> 01:26:30,214
resulting in their deaths.

955
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:32,485
The rules were clear.

956
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:34,424
You were warned.

957
01:26:34,494 --> 01:26:36,223
- It's Kerry!
- Do not go through that door.

958
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:39,231
You know never to go
through an unsecured door, ever.

959
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,732
Tonight you face your obsession.

960
01:26:42,803 --> 01:26:45,567
What you can't do
is save everyone.

961
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:47,664
Will you learn how to let go?

962
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,269
- Eric is still out there, man.
- It's time to let go.

963
01:26:51,345 --> 01:26:53,813
Detective Matthews has
but 90 minutes.

964
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,144
I recommend you stay alive

965
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,309
until the fucking clock
counts down.

966
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:00,376
They had to save themselves.

967
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:03,218
Take 'em.

968
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:08,988
Their salvation was
out of your hands.

969
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:11,030
Time was on your side,

970
01:27:11,098 --> 01:27:13,794
but your obsession
wouldn't let you wait.

971
01:27:13,867 --> 01:27:16,734
Instead of saving
Detective Matthews,

972
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:18,771
you cost him his life.

973
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:20,966
You failed your final test.

974
01:27:28,715 --> 01:27:31,741
What I don't understand is
how the hell could Jigsaw do all this?

975
01:27:31,818 --> 01:27:33,752
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

976
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:35,788
I'm not so sure he did.

977
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:44,726
- This wasn't done by Amanda Young.
- Excuse me?

978
01:27:44,798 --> 01:27:46,789
- She couldn't get her up there alone.
- John Kramer was...

979
01:27:46,867 --> 01:27:48,596
He's brains, not brawn.

980
01:27:48,668 --> 01:27:51,603
We're here to find the person
helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

981
01:28:01,848 --> 01:28:04,078
Looks like another doctor
went missing from the hospital.

982
01:28:08,155 --> 01:28:09,417
You go home.

983
01:28:12,426 --> 01:28:14,018
We chose this.

984
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:33,279
Game over.

985
01:29:01,308 --> 01:29:03,640
You feel you now have control,
don't you?

986
01:29:05,745 --> 01:29:08,339
You think you will
walk away untested?

987
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:19,125
I promise that my work
will continue.

988
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:22,320
That I have ensured.

989
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:24,727
By hearing this tape
some will assume

990
01:29:24,798 --> 01:29:26,595
that this is over.

991
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:29,999
But I am still among you.

992
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:33,335
You think it's over
just because I am dead?

993
01:29:33,406 --> 01:29:37,206
It's not over.
The games have just begun.
