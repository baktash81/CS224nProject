00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,816
Diablos!

3
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,269
{\an8}<i>Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team.</i>

4
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team.
Do you copy?</i>

5
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,113
<i>Storm incoming. Zero visibility.
Request immediate support.</i>

6
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,618
<i>Falcon Main, something's in here with us.
Send immediate support.</i>

7
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,336
<i>Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team.
Send immediate support.</i>

8
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,088
Ma'am. Ma'am.

9
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,717
- Marshall.
- Link found something half a klick ahead.

10
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,302
- Bravo Team?
- Think so.

11
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:44,970
Axe.

12
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,514
- With Steeler. Man the 50.
- Yes, boss.

13
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,099
All right, ladies.

14
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,058
Saddle up.

15
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,439
She's a woman, but she still manages
to make that sound like an insult.

16
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,107
Get used to it.

17
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:21,840
Captain.

18
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,510
- You see those markers?
- Yeah, I see them.

19
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,679
Do you have any idea what they are?

20
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:30,724
Sergeant Davis, I'm a Ranger,
not an archeologist.

21
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,101
Copy that.

22
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,525
- Axe!
- What?

23
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,820
- What are you listening to?
- George Jones.

24
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,281
Who the hell's that?

25
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,326
You're a philistine, Steeler.

26
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,869
Yes. Yes, I am.

27
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,415
Damn, Marshall. You got hella reflexes.

28
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,875
Fifteenth casualty today.

29
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,962
- Killing them.
- Take no prisoners, Davis.

30
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,314
- Link, what'd you find?
- It's definitely Bravo Team.

31
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,526
But the tracks end here.

32
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,906
- What were Bravo Team traveling in?
- Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV.

33
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,703
That's ten tons of armored vehicle.
They don't just disappear.

34
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,496
Boss, we've got something.

35
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,665
Incoming. On your 12.

36
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,213
- Where did that come from?
- Came out of nowhere.

37
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,799
Bravo Team reported a storm
in their last transmission.

38
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,552
- Hostiles using it for cover?
- An ambush. Like in Helmand?

39
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,553
Let's not find out.

40
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,064
<i>REDCON-1.</i>

41
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,233
If there are hostiles hiding
behind that storm,

42
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,568
<i>things might get kinetic.</i>

43
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,861
Copy that.

44
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,709
Marshall, what are you doing, bro?

45
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,213
In case I get my head blown off,
they can still tell who I am.

46
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,257
Hardcore shit, <i>cabr√≥n.</i>

47
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,687
Damn!

48
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,525
Goddamn, that shit's close.

49
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,529
Link, you ever seen lightning
like this before?

50
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,239
No. Never.

51
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,450
But I feel pretty secure here
in this big steel box,

52
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,494
holding my metal gun.

53
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,671
Dash, on your 12!

54
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,339
Look at those markers!

55
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,927
What the hell is that?

56
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,763
- Watch out!
- Damn it!

57
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:16,723
Brace yourselves!

58
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,658
Shit!

59
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,539
Where the hell are we?

60
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,917
And what happened to the storm?

61
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,127
What the hell just happened?

62
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,133
- Hey!
- Guys!

63
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,635
You okay?

64
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,888
- I'll survive.
- Did we just get hit by lightning?

65
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,767
- Steeler, you good?
- Never better.

66
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,437
Where did all this sand come from?

67
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,567
This isn't right, none of it.

68
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,779
What the hell is that?

69
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,076
I don't see any structures or mountains
marked on this map.

70
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,497
According to this,
the nearest sand dune is 20 klicks away.

71
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,749
- How's that possible?
- Where the hell are we?

72
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,877
- How did we get so far from the road?
- I don't know.

73
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,380
Axe, get on one of those dunes

74
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,132
- and set up an observation point.
- Yes, boss.

75
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,303
- Steeler!
- DPV will run. She's had worse.

76
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,764
- Marshall?
- GPS is fried, boss.

77
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,058
Radio and sat. All I get is static.

78
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,769
Even the compass is screwed up.
Must have been the lightning.

79
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,646
Well, what do you wanna do?

80
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,317
Go analog. Navigate by the sun.

81
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,695
Make it back to base.
We hoof it if we have to.

82
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,029
Boss, that's a long hike.

83
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,198
Yeah, well,
we keep going till we get comms.

84
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:42,077
Then AWACS will call in support.
They'll send helos, maybe armor.

85
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,498
- Nice.
- Back in business.

86
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,584
- <i>Boss.</i>
- Send it.

87
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,294
<i>There's something you got to see.</i>

88
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,185
Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV.

89
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,770
It's Bravo Team.

90
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,316
V-formation. Move out.

91
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,035
What do we do about them?

92
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:27,164
When we get comms, we'll call in
recovery assets to retrieve the bodies.

93
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,335
- What happened to them?
- Flamethrowers.

94
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,003
I don't think so.

95
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,299
Never seen a flamethrower
do this to a man.

96
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,677
- Not even napalm burns that hot.
- Ma'am?

97
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,102
It's glass.

98
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,313
Glass?

99
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,857
When sand melts, it turns to glass.

100
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,234
How do you melt sand?

101
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,319
I don't know.

102
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,990
This shit is officially above
my pay grade.

103
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,035
Looks like they made a stand.

104
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,831
- Let off a lot of rounds.
- They didn't hit anything.

105
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,667
There's no bodies.

106
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,586
Maybe they took the bodies with them?

107
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,339
- I've seen that before.
- Yeah.

108
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,926
- Well, that's just the thing.
- What do you see, Link?

109
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,095
Nothing.

110
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,014
No tracks anywhere.

111
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,225
Whoever did this,
they didn't leave a mark.

112
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,938
We need to get moving. Move out!

113
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,536
Dark Star to Falcon.
Dark Star to Falcon, over.

114
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,707
Damn it. Lightning really messed up
the electronics, huh?

115
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,959
Not just electronics.

116
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,171
- What do you mean?
- This isn't right.

117
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,922
Nothing about this is right.

118
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:02,092
That lightning, it did something to us.

119
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,345
Captain knows what she's doing, all right?

120
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:20,194
<i>They say that in the army
The pay is mighty fine</i>

121
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:24,573
<i>They say that in the army
The pay is mighty fine</i>

122
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,994
<i>They give a hundred dollars
And take back 99</i>

123
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:33,665
<i>They give a hundred dollars
And take back 99</i>

124
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,084
<i>Oh, how I wanna go</i>

125
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,337
<i>But they won't let me go</i>

126
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,799
<i>Home</i>

127
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,906
<i>They say that in the army
The shoes are mighty fine</i>

128
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:10,744
<i>You ask for size 11
They give you size nine</i>

129
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,457
<i>You ask for size 11
They give you a size nine</i>

130
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:20,170
<i>Oh, Lord, I wanna go
But they won't let me go</i>

131
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,841
<i>Home</i>

132
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,680
Jesus.

133
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,275
- It has to be a dinosaur, right?
- Saw a dinosaur in a museum one time.

134
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,110
It wasn't that big.

135
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,391
Hostile, 12 o'clock, 300 meters!

136
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,813
Cease fire! Cease fire!

137
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,482
- What's going on?
- It's just chalk.

138
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,905
Chief?

139
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,494
Diablos.

140
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,581
On our 6!

141
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,171
What the hell is that?

142
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,840
Link, back in the vehicle.

143
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,301
Dash, Steeler, move, move, move!

144
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,520
Fire!

145
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,372
It's gaining on us!

146
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,570
You're caught.

147
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,707
- Come on, get out of here!
- No way!

148
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,458
- One...
- Holy...

149
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,585
...two, three!

150
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,383
Fire!

151
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,302
Give me your hand. Come on!

152
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,358
Dash! Come on!

153
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,359
I'm trying!

154
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,072
Steeler!

155
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,370
- Got it, got it, got it!
- Marshall, get in!

156
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,082
Let's go, big boy!

157
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:47,836
Give me your hand!

158
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,632
Get inside!

159
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,929
Link, get the RPG!

160
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,264
Oh, my God.

161
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:59,074
Fall back! Fall back!

162
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,075
Run for cover!

163
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,624
Captain.

164
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,835
Come on!

165
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,298
Come on, boss!

166
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,575
I got it, I got it! Move, move!

167
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:47,748
Reloading!

168
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,484
What was that thing? What is that?

169
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,570
I told you. I told you.
That light, it took us somewhere.

170
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,572
We need to get back.
We need to get back home.

171
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,492
- Stow it, Sergeant Davis.
- Oh, my God. We're gonna die here.

172
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,953
Shut that shit up right now, soldier.
That's an order.

173
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,956
- You see what it did to Steeler and Axe?
- Dash, hey.

174
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,208
I got three. You?

175
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,876
- What?
- Three mags left.

176
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,753
What does it matter? Did you see that?

177
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,382
It matters because we're soldiers.
And this is what we do. We fight.

178
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,801
- Am I right?
- Rangers lead the way.

179
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,387
- You with me?
- Always, boss.

180
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,555
You're all crazy.

181
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,225
You know, I don't care
what the hell that thing is.

182
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,895
We do what we do best.
We fight and we survive.

183
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,606
No matter what the odds. You got it?

184
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,983
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

185
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,568
You got it?

186
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:00,863
Loud and clear, ma'am.

187
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,866
Now, I got three left. What about you?

188
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,051
Med pack!

189
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,389
- CPR, Marshall.
- On it.

190
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,351
- It's too late.
- Bullshit!

191
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,936
Don't die on me, Ranger. Come on.

192
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,939
- Lack of pulse.
- Unacceptable. Try it again.

193
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,359
- I'm sorry.
- Shit! There's more of them!

194
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,821
Come on! We have to go!

195
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,240
They're everywhere!

196
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,325
I'm sorry.

197
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,534
Master sergeant!

198
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,704
- Link!
- All right, on me!

199
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,497
Let's move out!

200
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,833
Fall back, fall back!

201
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:40,963
Dash!

202
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,632
Come on! Keep moving!

203
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,968
Marshall!

204
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,225
Go, go, go!

205
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,065
No!

206
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:32,639
Link.

207
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,016
Dash.

208
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,868
Dash.

209
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,455
Dash.

210
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:41,059
Come on.

211
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,025
- You're alive.
- Link.

212
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,487
What is it? What is it?

213
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:16,989
Pain in my chest!

214
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,115
I can't feel my arm.

215
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,449
Some sort of poison.

216
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:23,620
You just gotta work through it.
Come on. Let's move. Come on.

217
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,373
All right.

218
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,592
Oh, God.

219
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,970
Oh, no.

220
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,183
Captain.

221
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,770
All right, it's just a little further.
Let's go.

222
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,234
I can't move.

223
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,278
Okay, let me see.

224
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:57,779
Let me see what it is.

225
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,621
Go!

226
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,046
Oh, my God!

227
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,259
God, Link! No!

228
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:20,928
You gotta go!

229
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:27,935
Link!

230
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:35,914
Damn you.

231
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,670
Damn you!

232
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,512
But I'm coming home.

233
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,853
Nerscylla.

234
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,943
- Nerscylla!
- Get off me.

235
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,231
Nice life you've...

236
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,023
See how you like it.

237
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:11,615
Cheers.

238
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,956
Oh, you spiteful little bastard.

239
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,426
Hey. How about that?

240
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,556
Yeah. You don't like that, huh?
Not so funny now, huh?

241
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,321
I'll kill you.

242
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:24,831
Come on!

243
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:28,335
Push! Push!

244
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:57,906
Here.

245
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:03,287
I'm not your enemy.

246
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:07,791
Wait, wait. Wait.

247
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,172
One second. Look. Look.

248
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:14,798
Here.

249
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,092
Food.

250
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:21,972
Food. Here. Take it.

251
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:30,564
Here, give it to me.

252
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,441
Look, look.

253
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:37,279
So good.

254
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,458
It's good, right?

255
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:55,130
Slow down. Okay, it's good.

256
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:57,132
It's chocolate.

257
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,135
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate.

258
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,386
Yeah, chocolate.

259
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,804
Chocolate.

260
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:07,392
Chocolate.

261
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,520
- Choco...
- Chocolate!

262
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:13,106
- Chocolate!
- I don't have any more.

263
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,527
No, no more, no more, no more.
Look, look. Nothing.

264
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:18,445
I'm sorry.

265
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:35,212
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

266
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:41,593
Thank you.

267
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,098
Hey.

268
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,352
Wait! Where are you going?

269
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:55,941
Wait!

270
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:23,051
Me and you go out there?

271
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:28,056
Yes. That lightning,
I think that's what brought me here.

272
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,185
I need to go there. I need to get home.

273
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,314
That thing is still out there.

274
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,151
- Diablos.
- Diablos.

275
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:47,409
Hey, over there...

276
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,578
I have weapons.

277
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,082
Diablos...

278
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:58,420
What?

279
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:16,897
<i>Ni trovi</i> Nerscylla.

280
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,025
- What?
- Nerscylla.

281
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,695
No. We don't need to go back in there.

282
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:28,659
We need to go out there. Diablos.

283
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:32,663
Diablos.

284
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,039
Diablos.

285
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:35,999
Nerscylla.

286
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:39,419
Diablo...

287
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,008
We poison it.

288
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:49,638
Smart.

289
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,933
To kill a monster, you need a monster.

290
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:57,437
But how are we gonna get
one of those things?

291
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:06,697
What?

292
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:12,536
<i>They say that in the army
The coffee's mighty fine</i>

293
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:17,791
<i>It looks like muddy water
And tastes like turpentine</i>

294
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:24,631
<i>Oh, Lord, I wanna go
But they don't let me go</i>

295
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:29,011
<i>Home</i>

296
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:34,183
<i>They say that in the army
The men are mighty fine</i>

297
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:39,062
<i>To me they look like hunchbacks
And sound like Frankenstein</i>

298
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:44,484
<i>Oh, Lord, I wanna go
But they won't let me go</i>

299
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:48,614
<i>Home</i>

300
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,185
Come on!

301
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,991
Yes! Got it!

302
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,374
Next time, you're bait!

303
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,316
"Ranger."

304
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:09,611
That's me.

305
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,200
Ranger.

306
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:17,244
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:26,753
Hunter.

308
00:51:26,837 --> 00:51:28,005
Hunter. Ranger.

309
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:30,382
- Yeah. Yes.
- Hunter?

310
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,099
Velcro.

311
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,185
Velcro.

312
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:42,144
Yeah.

313
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,736
Velcro. Velcro.

314
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,908
Okay. All right, all right.
That's enough. That's enough.

315
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,245
Oh, man.

316
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,374
Really trying to get in here, huh?

317
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,024
Is that your family?

318
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:40,035
Are you gonna see them?
Are you gonna go home?

319
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:44,456
Home?

320
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:05,561
I'm sorry.

321
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:23,745
Rathalos.

322
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,489
Let's do this.

323
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,622
Never mind. Let's go.

324
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:25,682
Ready!

325
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,394
Yeah!

326
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,230
What is that?
You gotta tell me about that.

327
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:58,734
You can't just do that to somebody.

328
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,552
Any second now.

329
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:29,366
Stop!

330
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,223
Bait!

331
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:32,906
Shit!

332
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:05,554
Come on!

333
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,938
Watch over him!

334
01:05:14,665 --> 01:05:15,958
You're welcome.

335
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:32,075
Apceros.

336
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:34,786
Apceros.

337
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:47,841
- Apceros.
- Yeah.

338
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:51,136
Okay. Okay. They eat grass.

339
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:57,392
Water. Water.

340
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:13,450
Bait.

341
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:17,371
Bait?

342
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:19,957
You're funny.

343
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,503
Know what I'm gonna do
next time you're dying in the desert?

344
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:26,839
Nothing.

345
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:42,229
That smells good.

346
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:46,733
- Catch Cephalos.
- I'll eat anything at this point.

347
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,327
Home.

348
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:00,873
Yeah. My way home.

349
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:02,541
I hope.

350
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:10,340
Chocolate.

351
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:17,221
Chocolate.

352
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:24,979
So good.

353
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:33,447
What's that?

354
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:40,495
All right.

355
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:48,377
Chocolate.

356
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:49,837
No, no, no.

357
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:54,009
- Chocolate.
- Not chocolate.

358
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:47,479
- What's going on?
- Rathalos.

359
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:52,234
You said that before.
What the hell is a Rathalos?

360
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:32,459
Thank you.

361
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,088
Thank you.

362
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:38,507
Don't thank me yet.

363
01:11:57,651 --> 01:11:58,735
Enjoying the show?

364
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:17,963
This one must have come from the sky.

365
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,307
What?

366
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:02,150
What is that?

367
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:04,236
Palico.

368
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,415
My friend tells me I misjudged you.

369
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,168
I may even owe you an apology.

370
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,671
Just don't hold your breath.

371
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,051
Why did you put me in chains?

372
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:29,595
What are you so afraid of?

373
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:30,888
Your world...

374
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:33,390
and what it could do to mine.

375
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:37,561
You aren't the first to cross over
from your world. There were others.

376
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:39,646
Long time ago.

377
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,356
That's how you speak my language?

378
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:45,444
- I made a study of it.
- What happened to me?

379
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,113
How did I get here?

380
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:51,783
I believe that the answers
we both seek lie here.

381
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:57,748
At the peak of that mountain lies
the Sky Tower.

382
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:02,294
Remnants of an ancient civilization.

383
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,756
Very advanced. Very dangerous.

384
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:11,470
It is said that the Ancients knew
how to travel between both worlds.

385
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:14,139
I believe that is the purpose
of the Sky Tower.

386
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:17,309
That is what brought you here.

387
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,437
What happened
to this ancient civilization?

388
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:25,734
They destroyed themselves.
Their technology turned on them.

389
01:15:25,817 --> 01:15:28,111
You think my world had something
to do with it.

390
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:32,199
I suspect. But an open gateway
between our two worlds

391
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:34,159
was catastrophic once.

392
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,787
I intend to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

393
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:39,706
We were on our way
to investigate the Sky Tower

394
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:41,875
when we strayed into the Diablos.

395
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,086
That's where I lost my friend here.

396
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:47,881
Tending to the wounded and repairing
the ship was our first priority.

397
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:50,342
But now we resume our mission.

398
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:57,057
The Ancients would guard their technology
with the most fearsome of creatures,

399
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,975
a Rathalos.

400
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:01,603
Almost impossible to kill.

401
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,773
Their only weakness is
just before they breathe fire.

402
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:09,653
You help us with the battle ahead,
perhaps we can help you get home.

403
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:18,036
What's the matter?

404
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,081
You don't have cats in your world?

405
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:25,294
Hey!

406
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:28,714
You been drinking from my mug again?

407
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:38,765
We leave at dawn.

408
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,601
And don't keep me waiting.

409
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:41,810
I hate waiting.

410
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:12,758
So? You ready?

411
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:16,178
We got a hard climb ahead of us.

412
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:30,025
Come on!

413
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:23,745
We believe that the lava powers
the machinery within the tower.

414
01:18:26,456 --> 01:18:28,041
It's controlling the storm.

415
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:32,713
Exactly.

416
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:40,637
It's creating a gateway to your world,
but it looks unstable.

417
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:44,808
Let's go.

418
01:19:08,248 --> 01:19:09,541
It's glass.

419
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,295
<i>Estas bone</i> Rathalos.

420
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,215
Rathalos.

421
01:19:31,188 --> 01:19:35,651
Prepare yourself. Remember, they're weak
just before they breathe fire.

422
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,107
Hey, ugly!

423
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:01,041
It's okay! It's okay.
You're safe now! Get the medic!

424
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:06,296
Captain Artemis?

425
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,676
Let's get her inside! Up!

426
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:13,595
Let's go! Let's go!

427
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:23,063
Captain, we've been searching for you.

428
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:28,026
What the hell is she wearing?

429
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:46,962
Falcon Main, this is Red Wolf.

430
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,716
<i>We've made contact with Dark Star.</i>

431
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,217
We have a lone survivor.

432
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:57,264
<i>I say again, a lone survivor.
Ground forces are securing the area.</i>

433
01:24:57,347 --> 01:24:58,348
Copy that, Red Wolf.

434
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:05,731
Captain.

435
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:08,400
Can you hear me?

436
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,652
Can you hear me?

437
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:12,446
Captain?

438
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,156
Captain Artemis?

439
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:17,326
Where are the rest of your men?

440
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:20,329
- My men?
- Yes.

441
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,165
Where are the rest of Alpha Team?

442
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:26,251
<i>Copy that.</i>

443
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:35,719
We're under attack!

444
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:16,969
Aim for the belly!

445
01:26:28,105 --> 01:26:28,939
<i>A Rathalos.</i>

446
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:04,391
Load!

447
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:06,810
Fire!

448
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:26,330
No! No!

449
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:50,187
No!

450
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,440
It's coming right for us!

451
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:55,317
Evade!

452
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:09,790
<i>We're on Channel 5. Interference is...</i>

453
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:16,463
My God.

454
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:30,662
Come on!

455
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:21,672
I got you.

456
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:33,994
My friend.

457
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:40,250
Thought you might need a little help.

458
01:31:41,335 --> 01:31:42,169
Yeah, I...

459
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:44,296
still don't understand you, man.

460
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:48,550
Oh, yeah.

461
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,262
Friends.

462
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:57,935
Yeah, thank you.

463
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:00,646
<i>Min misa</i> chocolate?

464
01:32:02,439 --> 01:32:03,857
I don't have any more chocolate.

465
01:32:07,778 --> 01:32:08,612
Think fast.

466
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,449
- You're here.
- We came to help.

467
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:15,202
We can't have monsters from my world
attacking yours.

468
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:19,957
It's starting again.

469
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:27,172
We don't have much time.

470
01:32:28,048 --> 01:32:29,716
There's going to be another attack.

471
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:41,103
We have to get back.

472
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:43,647
We have to shut the Sky Tower down.

473
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:47,276
- Let's try to live through this first.
- Copy that.
