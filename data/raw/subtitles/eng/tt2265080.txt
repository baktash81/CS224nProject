1
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,731
hi there.

2
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,333
Who are you?

3
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,904
where'd you come from?

4
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,739
I didn't do anything.

5
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,909
I can see that.

6
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,878
Who do you belong to?

7
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,413
I don't know.

8
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,918
what's your daddy's name?

9
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,357
I don't know.

10
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,592
What about your mama?

11
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,695
She's over there.

12
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,363
Oh.

13
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,998
Your mama's renting the trailer
for my husband.

14
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,768
I didn't know
she had a little boy.

15
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:56,937
You're from mason, aren't you?

16
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,339
I don't know.

17
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,374
You don't know much, do you?

18
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,579
oh, Johnny's crying.

19
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,481
Is there a baby in there?

20
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,067
aww!

21
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,538
oh, there, there, Johnny.
Come here.

22
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,841
Oh, did you think mama
had left you?

23
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,745
No, mama wouldn't do that. No.

24
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,780
I keep telling you
you're gonna spoil that baby.

25
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,749
You ought not pick him up
every time he cries.

26
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,551
Don't you know
they're just testing you?

27
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,386
He's just a baby, momma"b."

28
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,720
Yeah.

29
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,489
A little crying clears out
their lungs.

30
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,890
Oh, no.

31
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,831
oh, look what you did!

32
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,800
What a sweet boy!

33
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,836
Would you like some lemonade?

34
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,573
Okay, come on.

35
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,998
that the renter's kid?

36
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,839
Do you want some more?

37
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,040
Don't you be
inviting him into the house

38
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,710
and giving him stuff.

39
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,680
He'll be hanging around here
the whole time.

40
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,616
Now go on. You had enough.

41
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,952
Go on, get!

42
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,905
thank you.

43
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,751
try your applesauce, honey.

44
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:28,456
Mmm. Yum.

45
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:33,594
the rain came last night,
soaked all the hay.

46
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,567
God is good. God is great.
Let us thank him for this meal.

47
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,934
Amen.

48
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,503
Amen.

49
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:48,809
now your applesauce. Here.

50
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,214
oh.

51
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,218
Shouldn't we, um,
put him to bed?

52
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,821
Uh, in a while.

53
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,708
don't spend it all
in one place, Maddie.

54
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,880
how much would these be, hazel?

55
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:35,155
hi. I'm Maddie. Carl's wife.

56
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,826
Oh, yeah.
Uh, uh, come on in.

57
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,634
I ain't had time
to fix things up.

58
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,237
I've been looking for a job.

59
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,772
We lost all our stuff
in the fire.

60
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,774
This is all we could save.

61
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,808
In the fire?

62
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,611
At our apartment i-in mason.

63
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:01,615
The guy next door, um,
fell asleep smoking a cigarette,

64
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,050
and the whole place burned.

65
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,819
Oh, that's terrible.
I'm so sorry.

66
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,121
Uh, I bought your boy
some boots.

67
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,559
I hope you don't mind.
I got 'em on sale.

68
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,093
I didn't know his size.

69
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:17,130
Francis?

70
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,199
Look at these boots

71
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,034
ain't they nice?

72
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,870
Try 'em on.

73
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,547
They're a little big.
But he'll grow into 'em.

74
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,816
I only had him two years,

75
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,218
and he shot up twice his size
in that time.

76
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,153
He's adopted?
No.

77
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,989
I can't adopt him.

78
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,592
Then I wouldn't get
the reimburse.

79
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,728
State give me $375 a month
to look after him.

80
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,631
I'm his foster mother.

81
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,005
Francis, stop that silliness
and thank the lady.

82
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,743
Thank you, ma'am.

83
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,679
You're welcome.

84
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,880
Where was he before?

85
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,616
Year here, year there.

86
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,018
That's how they do, you know?

87
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,221
He been with me
longer than anybody.

88
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,089
Last place beat him.

89
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,291
That's where he picked up
them scars.

90
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:22,095
Some folks are just taking kids
for the money, you know?

91
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,833
Francis is a good boy, too.

92
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,836
He does as he's told.

93
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,270
And why isn't he in school?

94
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,039
He could've started this year.

95
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,141
For a while, I wasn't even sure
he could talk,

96
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,310
but he understands all right.

97
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,779
He'll start in the fall.

98
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,082
I made some peach cobbler.

99
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,085
Um, I thought he might have
a sweet tooth.

100
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,887
I'll just put it
in the refrigerator.

101
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,121
You can have it after supper.

102
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:08,275
well, let me know
if you need anything.

103
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,210
I sure thank you, miss Blanton.

104
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,681
Please call me"Maddie."

105
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,683
*...A warrior bold

106
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,285
* shy, little maid of old

107
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:23,190
* brave and gay, he rode one day
to a battle far away *

108
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,695
* now the moon shines tonight
on pretty red wing *

109
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,999
Francis?

110
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,433
Come sit, honey.

111
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,206
where's your mama?

112
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,808
Work.

113
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:45,212
Well, sit down.

114
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,281
Look at that.
You got Johnny to stop crying.

115
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,950
Are you proud of that?

116
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,887
look at that.

117
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,923
I think he's jealous
of your new boots.

118
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,397
* tonight on pretty red wing

119
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,738
Francis, it's okay!
It's just Carl!

120
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,525
and he sure can ride, can't he?

121
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,795
He ain't afraid of falling.

122
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,396
He'll never get hurt.

123
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:15,068
He's a weed,
just keeps growing and growing.

124
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:19,339
And all the time, what you
planted, took care of...

125
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,142
It dies off.

126
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,544
You know, he's darkened up
so much in the sun,

127
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,514
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was part mexican.

128
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,549
Oh, hell, mama.

129
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,251
He ain't mexican.

130
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,519
Anybody can tell that
just by looking in his eyes.

131
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:37,324
We don't know where he's from.

132
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,525
He doesn't say hardly a word.

133
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,295
never know what he's thinking.

134
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,399
I don't trust him.

135
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,071
he's a good boy, momma"b."

136
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,207
You ever talk to him,
you'd know that.

137
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:03,450
she comes home ever payday,
buys something for that boy.

138
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,155
she's just being nice.

139
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,823
We got enough, momma.

140
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:13,160
We won't soon enough.

141
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,394
Hmm.

142
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,515
hey, blake! Quitting time!

143
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,184
Got to get these planks
moved over here.

144
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,052
You boys get going.

145
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,221
I ain't never knowed you to work
a minute longer than you had to.

146
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,389
I was day-dreaming.

147
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,490
Mm-hmm,
I bet I know what about --

148
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,592
pretty, young girlfriend
of yours.

149
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,227
She ain't too hard on the eyes.

150
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,996
Hey, Carl!

151
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,264
Well, you know, Maddie
was real babe back in her day,

152
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,600
so I ain't crying on my beard
for you.

153
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,936
What do you mean?
She's only 25.

154
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,238
She is?

155
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,607
Yeah.

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,077
Damn.

157
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:07,247
She sick or something?

158
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,917
No. Why?

159
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,386
She just needs some meat
on her bones is all.

160
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,322
I guess being married to you,

161
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,057
you don't put your ears
on a woman,

162
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,591
makes her, uh,
lose her appetite.

163
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,421
you getting out?

164
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:52,625
I don't know.

165
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,362
Something wrong?

166
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,072
You know, if you lost
any more weight...

167
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,539
You'd blow away.

168
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,310
I'll be back later.

169
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,429
* wadded-up clothes
it's good to come home *

170
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,065
hey, vera,
you still making hay?

171
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,266
You buy it, I'll make it,
larry.

172
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,270
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, you tell him, vera!

173
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,540
I haven't seen you in here
in a long time.

174
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,442
Thought you were a married man.

175
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,744
And, what, a married man can't
have a drink once in a while?

176
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,413
Bird dog!

177
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,350
He can have as many as he wants
as far as I'm concerned.

178
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,526
I heard that, uh,
you and bob broke up.

179
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,661
Mm.

180
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,331
got a letter
from his lawyer today.

181
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,732
Mm.

182
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,135
The bastard. Suing me
for half the business.

183
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,704
well, I ain't worried
about old bob.

184
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,240
Mm.

185
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:18,211
He ain't no match for you.

186
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,513
I'm beginning to wonder
if anybody is.

187
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,750
You starting
to get lonely out there?

188
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,718
All alone
in that big, old house.

189
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,122
it is a big house.

190
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,091
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

191
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,226
Big, secluded house.

192
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,332
remember those parties
we used to go to in high school?

193
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,700
Mnh-mnh.
Mm-hmm.

194
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,136
Mnh-mnh.
Down by the river.

195
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,137
On my property.

196
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,074
Mm-hmm.

197
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,709
Well, I think about those
nights sometimes.

198
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,248
* Wine glasses
crashing around *

199
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,184
* since the first day we met

200
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,125
* feel I'm losing my grip

201
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:08,328
you're ready to give it a go?

202
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,663
* Supper to the floor

203
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,400
* no more regrets

204
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,806
come on!
Before I get out!

205
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,525
don't let him do that, Francis.

206
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,228
If you lay down,
people will walk all over you.

207
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,462
Sooner you learn that,
the better.

208
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,632
He didn't hurt me.

209
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:49,702
Besides, I'd rather put up
with other people's bad ways

210
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,671
than start some of my own.

211
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:00,413
he ain't home yet.
It's almost 10:00.

212
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,549
You get on home, boy.

213
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,217
Last thing we need

214
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,153
is for Carl to see you
sitting here on the porch!

215
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,288
Now get out of here!

216
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,262
you didn't have to run him off.

217
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,863
You better worry
about your husband

218
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,598
rather than
that little ragamuffin.

219
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,336
If you want a playmate
for your Johnny,

220
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,771
you have another child.

221
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:28,141
Stop dragging in strays
off the street.

222
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,748
night, mommy.

223
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,320
Night-night, sweetie.
I love you.

224
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,256
I see how that child
looks at you.

225
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,325
What do you mean?

226
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,228
I'm talking about Francis.

227
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,298
You think it's right for you
to lead him on like that?

228
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:55,835
He has feelings for you.
Anybody can see it.

229
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,737
W-what's wrong with that?

230
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,808
Those kind of people, they're
here today and gone tomorrow.

231
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,212
Isabelle could take a notion
and up and leave,

232
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,414
and what would
happen to him, huh?

233
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,915
It's plain as day.

234
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,384
He has more feelings for you
than he does for her.

235
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,221
Now, you need
to think about that.

236
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:32,205
you all right?
I was worried about you.

237
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,473
Did something happen?

238
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,743
like what?

239
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,745
Let's just get some sleep.

240
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,380
No. No, no, you finish it up.

241
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,614
What do you want to --

242
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,416
what do you
want to accuse me of?

243
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,486
I wasn't accusing you.

244
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,326
Carl.

245
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,271
all right, boy,
go get you some of that mud.

246
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,972
No!

247
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,007
don't tell me no.
I'm your daddy.

248
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,478
I'll make you eat that mud.

249
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,516
whatcha doing, grandma?

250
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,750
Whatcha giving my baby?

251
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,619
What'd you put in there?

252
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,690
I know. He's like,"I'm gonna
have this in a bottle."

253
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,559
That's what you did
when you were little.

254
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:43,510
oh, little Johnny,
that's not a good toy.

255
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:49,816
Francis, come play!

256
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,653
sweetie? Oh, no.
Is she okay?

257
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,721
Yeah, I think she's fine.

258
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:32,058
Oh, no, sweetheart,
nothing to cry about.

259
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,926
No, you look beautiful.
Come on, let's go inside.

260
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,328
Watch out, guys.

261
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,463
So, come on, you guys,

262
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,730
let's go inside.
We're leaving?

263
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,098
Yeah, maybe.
Let's get her cleaned up.

264
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,481
who told you
you could come over here?

265
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,717
you are nothing but trouble.
Now get.

266
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,812
they're all gone.

267
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,415
I didn't push her.

268
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,716
I know.

269
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:44,063
I can't do that, miss Blanton.

270
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,065
It'd break the boy's heart.

271
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,900
People always think
they're more important

272
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,368
than they really are.

273
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,708
He might could find
a nice family --

274
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,910
a mama and a daddy.

275
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,780
I take good care of him.

276
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,551
He too old
for a family to adopt now.

277
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:08,488
Now, you don't know that.

278
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,491
Look, I got nothing
against the boy.

279
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:15,628
None of this is his fault.

280
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:19,666
But I seen it too many times.

281
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:25,438
The apple
don't fall far from the tree.

282
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:30,109
And whoever his parents are...

283
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,780
We know they must've been
good for nothing...

284
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:37,149
To not even want
their own flesh and blood.

285
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:52,164
my son said that you haven't
paid your rent in three months.

286
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,088
come on, let's get in line.

287
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,224
Where are we going, mama?

288
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,227
I told you.
I got an appointment.

289
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,167
you're taking me back?

290
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,069
Shh!

291
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,239
Calm down, Francis.
It's for your own good!

292
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,709
I'm getting old,
and my health's not so good.

293
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,778
They'll place you
with a nice, young family

294
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,279
that'll take better care of you!

295
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,849
But, mom, i-i can

296
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,984
I can help you
with anything, everything!

297
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,185
Don't, Francis!

298
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,922
Please let me stay!

299
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,057
Francis!

300
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,525
Francis!

301
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,661
That boy okay?

302
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,262
Is he okay?

303
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,100
Maddie! Maddie!

304
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,737
Francis, are you okay?

305
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:05,772
He's fine.

306
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:06,939
W-what have you done to him?

307
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:10,076
I didn't touch him!
He fell!

308
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,544
Don't let her send me away!

309
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,179
What?!
She wants to give me back!

310
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:16,883
Is that true?!
I have to! I said I would!

311
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,886
Why, mom? What did I do?

312
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,024
I'll help you with Johnny,
and I'll help you with the farm.

313
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,660
Okay, okay. Oh, y-you're not
going anywhere, okay, Francis?

314
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,728
You belong with us.

315
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,762
I'll take him.

316
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:30,963
Please let me stay!

317
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,765
I ain't gonna send him away!

318
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,606
okay, it's okay.

319
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,575
okay.

320
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:45,344
We got to leave whitewright,
though.

321
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,746
Momma"b" don't like the boy.

322
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,681
Did she put you up to this?

323
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:54,553
I'll talk to her.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,304
Johnny? Johnny?

325
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:15,041
What's going on?!

326
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,610
What's going on?
Are you all right?

327
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,613
Where's momma"b"?

328
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,991
What's going on?

329
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,125
Uh...

330
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,260
What?

331
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:38,865
Mrs Blanton?

332
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,233
What?

333
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,202
She's had a severe stroke.

334
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,405
she's unable to talk.

335
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,007
We don't know
how much she can understand.

336
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,713
it doesn't look good.

337
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,849
"lord is my shepherd.

338
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,117
"I shall not want.

339
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,986
"When we make the lord
our shepherd,

340
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,320
"we want for nothing.

341
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,023
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

342
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,392
"He leads me
beside the still waters.

343
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,960
"He restores my soul.

344
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,029
"He leads me
in the paths of righteousness

345
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,931
"for his name's sake.

346
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,801
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

347
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,169
"i will fear no evil.
For you are with me.

348
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,405
"Praise god.
The lord can be with you.

349
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,241
"Surely, goodness and mercy
shall follow me

350
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,976
"all the days of my life.

351
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,947
And I will dwell in
the house of the lord forever."

352
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,850
And for momma"b," there's
no difference in that one.

353
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:33,319
Lord, we thank you for today.

354
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,895
I suppose you're glad now.

355
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,131
You can have everything
the way you want it.

356
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,265
What?

357
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:49,936
Yeah, now that momma's gone.

358
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,739
You don't mean that.

359
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:56,208
Do you want to go for a ride?

360
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,245
We haven't done that
in a long time.

361
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,347
Isabelle can watch Johnny.

362
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,882
My mom was born in this house.

363
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,183
She spent her whole life here.

364
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,018
The farthest she ever went
was Dallas.

365
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,219
She didn't want to go anywhere.

366
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,755
How do you know
what she wanted?!

367
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,457
Don't go, Carl, not tonight.

368
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:28,174
come here.

369
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,778
What are you doing up?

370
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,979
Nothing.

371
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:42,121
how come Mr. Blanton
doesn't come at night anymore?

372
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,779
how are you feeling, mama?

373
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:08,547
Can I get you anything?

374
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,817
Get me some ice, honey.

375
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,102
Thank you.

376
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:33,973
I'm gonna go help Maddie now,
unless you need me.

377
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,909
No, go on. I'll be all right.

378
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,380
Hey, Maddie.
Is Carl doing all right?

379
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,049
You know, wade said

380
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:46,285
that he didn't show up
to work yesterday.

381
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,553
Or the day before.

382
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,456
He didn't? Oh.

383
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,191
Hi, Francis!

384
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,259
Hey, there!

385
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,427
How was school?

386
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,096
I didn't know
you had two boys, Maddie.

387
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,599
Oh, um, this is isabelle's son.
They live behind us.

388
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,203
Oh, that's right.
He's that orphan boy.

389
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,538
My, fine-looking young man.

390
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,113
mm.

391
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,984
Thank you, Francis.

392
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,134
yeah, oh!

393
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,206
such a gentleman.

394
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,307
Daddy!

395
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,842
Johnny!

396
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,896
Maddie, Maddie,
mama can't breathe!

397
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,614
That was the sheriff.

398
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,583
They're gonna put Francis
into a foster home.

399
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,454
unless we want him.

400
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,522
Carl?

401
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,325
forget it.

402
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,669
What if he did more chores
in the evening?

403
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:47,206
You've seen how good he is
with the animals.

404
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,109
Never find anybody better.

405
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,413
Besides,
Johnny's crazy about him.

406
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,951
Break his heart
for Francis to go.

407
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,719
Well, he ain't no kin to me,

408
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,023
and I ain't running
no mission here.

409
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:08,327
I could move my salon
out into the trailer,

410
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,262
and Francis
could have that room.

411
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,331
No, we still
got to rent that out.

412
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,366
Old what's-her-name is gone.

413
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,536
We still got to have
some rent coming in.

414
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,478
There's a stipend
for foster parents.

415
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,516
How much?

416
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,330
hey.

417
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,566
I brought you some supper.

418
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,767
Why don't you
save that for later?

419
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,636
This is already hot.

420
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,281
Thank you.

421
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,550
I talked to the sheriff today.

422
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,654
Um, did you talk about
where I was going next?

423
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,622
We talked about that.

424
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,459
What if you could
stay here with us?

425
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,361
Until I get a foster family?

426
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,763
What if we were
your foster family?

427
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:21,333
You and Mr. Blanton?

428
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:24,670
You'd have to keep up with your
chores around the farm, and...

429
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:29,275
And you'd stay living out here
in the trailer.

430
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,310
But you'd have supper
with us every night,

431
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,745
and you'd keep going to school,

432
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,282
and everything would be
just like it is now.

433
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,816
Except for isabelle, I mean.

434
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,152
Y-you don't have to
decide right now.

435
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,154
You can take your time,
and you can think about it.

436
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,255
No, I know already.
I want to stay.

437
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,723
Are you sure?

438
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,793
Mr. Blanton is not
the easiest man to be around,

439
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,296
and Johnny can pester you
to death.

440
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,164
It's the best place
I've ever been.

441
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,067
Nobody has treated me
nicer than you.

442
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,123
excuse me, sir.

443
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,325
What?
Can I give it a try?

444
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,528
yeah.

445
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,196
Be my guest.

446
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,840
lemonade?

447
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,443
Francis, get me a beer
out of the truck.

448
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:38,844
No, I'll get it.

449
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,779
I said Francis.
He's not your servant, Carl.

450
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,549
He lives on my land.
He's whatever I say he is.

451
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,185
I said go!
Don't push him!

452
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,798
go on inside, Francis.

453
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,668
He's not gonna hurt me.
It's just talk.

454
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:03,869
Go on.

455
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,147
I went to the bank and talked
to Mr. Seymour today.

456
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,615
What?

457
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,350
He called.

458
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:20,719
He said he wanted both of us,
but you weren't here.

459
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:24,423
A-anyway, he said we hadn't
made any payments since march.

460
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,661
them bastards, it ain't enough
I can't just work the farm.

461
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:30,729
I got to work another job.

462
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,899
Still, it ain't enough.

463
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:37,903
Wade's wife said
you didn't go in last week.

464
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,639
You know, I knew I should never
have let you start cutting hair!

465
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,873
Ain't a business!

466
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,575
That's just an excuse

467
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,677
for women in this town
to get together and gossip!

468
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:46,878
What are we gonna do
now that we have to

469
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,580
make payments
on the truck, too?

470
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:50,716
You don't worry about it.
I'll take care of that.

471
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,484
How?

472
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,654
Did you not hear what I said?!
I'll take care of it!

473
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,291
Don't you be taking anymore
bank meetings without me!

474
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,526
This is my farm.

475
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,528
Been in my family
for over 100 years,

476
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:03,929
and I can take care of it
without you.

477
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,631
I don't need you
telling me what to do.

478
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,561
you graduate yet, Francis?

479
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,564
Uh, uh, yes, ma'am,
uh, just this past may.

480
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:39,931
Guess you'll be going off
to college then.

481
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,800
Fort worth maybe?

482
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,504
No, no, gonna stay on the farm
and work with the Blantons.

483
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,339
Stop calling me"ma'am."

484
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:52,478
You'll make me feel like
an old lady.

485
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,779
Is this second cutting?

486
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,347
Kind of looks like first.

487
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,016
Oh.

488
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,418
That's the wrong stuff.

489
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,919
That's maynard's hay.

490
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,823
This is yours over here,
just waiting for you.

491
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,926
All right.

492
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,766
you got any more
little jobs for me?

493
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,403
You're just as lazy
as mazy grace over there.

494
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,371
Oh, mazy grace is no fool.

495
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,939
Slow as molasses, too.

496
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,742
You should've been done
two hours ago.

497
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:24,910
Look what I got you.

498
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,578
What?

499
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,320
think she likes you.

500
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:37,022
Oh, it tickles.

501
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,991
tickles!

502
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,882
Francis, we're gonna need to
get in there and tie him

503
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,651
to get him weighed and tagged.

504
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:07,619
Yes, sir.

505
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:10,689
you're not gonna sell brownie,
are you?

506
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,992
did you hear that?

507
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,961
You made that kid soft.

508
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,079
hey, billy!

509
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,947
Let's go, boy! We're leaving!

510
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,758
Francis!

511
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,460
I'm so glad you're here.

512
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,896
I think I locked my keys
in the car.

513
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,564
uh, uh-oh. Um...

514
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,567
maybe we could find
a coat hanger or something.

515
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,369
No, no, no.
Don't worry about it.

516
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,837
Raoul will get it tomorrow.

517
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,038
Right now, I just --

518
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,374
I want to get out
of these clothes

519
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:03,775
and take a nice hot bath.

520
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,844
Would it be...

521
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,780
Out of your way
if you drove me home?

522
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:11,550
Oh, no, no.
N-no problem at all.

523
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,519
It's all good?
Yeah.

524
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,588
I can't believe you're just 18.

525
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,157
Yep, turned 18 in april.

526
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,692
Mm!

527
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,663
My ex-husband bob's birthday
is in april.

528
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,097
Taurus the bull.

529
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,936
that's him, all right.

530
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,972
Francis?

531
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,941
You drive like an old lady.

532
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,510
Come on, let's see
what this old truck can do!

533
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:39,811
I like a good breeze!

534
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,880
It's kind of old.
It can't really do much.

535
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,583
You might be surprised.

536
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,823
Um, you got any cigarettes?

537
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,825
Uh...

538
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,927
Uh, no, I don't --
I don't really smoke.

539
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,163
Ah. I quit.

540
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,532
so...

541
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,468
Is this -- is this you?
That's it.

542
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,179
how about a beer
for your trouble?

543
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,048
Oh, uh

544
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,217
look at you.

545
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,753
I didn't think there were boys
out there that still blushed.

546
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,722
I'm not blushing.

547
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,791
I'm not.

548
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,628
you got a girlfriend, hon?

549
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,798
No.

550
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:36,234
Well, I'll bet
you could have your pick.

551
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,838
There was a time
when I had my pick, too.

552
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,140
I picked bob.

553
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,614
You have
the most beautiful eyes.

554
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,749
What color are they?

555
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,485
Um...

556
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,753
Green.

557
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:59,858
Um, i-i should
probably get going.

558
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:00,859
Okay.
Yeah.

559
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:05,897
yeah, it's late.
Um...

560
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,567
Good night.

561
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,037
good night.

562
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,579
I don't care.

563
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,881
You said it would be here.
Now get it here.

564
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,117
do not sugarcoat it for him,
darling.

565
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,688
any good at the auction today?

566
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,724
hell, Francis brought back
a couple of herefords,

567
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,526
and they are beauties, too.

568
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,295
I'll tell you what, he may
shape up to be a decent hand.

569
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,567
Well, he's all hands
if you ask me.

570
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,201
What?

571
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,876
Did -- did Francis
make some kind of move on you?

572
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:54,546
Does he still live in
that trailer behind your house?

573
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,715
Yeah. Why?

574
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,083
Well, now I know why Maddie

575
00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,951
doesn't mind you being gone
all the time.

576
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,690
What did you say?

577
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,692
Nothin'.

578
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:09,695
No, say it.

579
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,564
Look, I got to get some work
done around here.

580
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:48,867
where's Francis?

581
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,002
You sent him for supplies.

582
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,741
All done.

583
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:58,710
It looks great.
Thank you, Maddie.

584
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,178
You're welcome.

585
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,282
Thank you.

586
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,290
is something going on?

587
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,860
I don't know.

588
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,629
Why don't you tell me?

589
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,834
I-i don't know what you mean.

590
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:29,808
I think it's time
Francis moved along.

591
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,679
M-moved along? Why?!

592
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,816
he's old enough.
Make his own way.

593
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:40,351
Francis is keeping this farm
going, Carl!

594
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,256
I keep this farm going.

595
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,792
I know that.

596
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:48,026
It's just that he's
such a hard worker.

597
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,394
What has he done?

598
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,997
You seem to want him
to stay pretty bad.

599
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,899
He's lived with us
since he was a boy.

600
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:54,900
He's family!

601
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,134
No.

602
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,436
He's not family.

603
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,773
And now...

604
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:02,974
He's history.

605
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,342
I won't let you do this!

606
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,411
We can't just send him away
for no reason!

607
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:07,846
He'll be devastated!

608
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:10,015
Why are you doing this?!

609
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,350
Do you hear yourself?

610
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,985
Look at you.

611
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:20,058
I think you're in love with him.

612
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,760
What?

613
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,864
where are you going with that?

614
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:29,334
Don't -- I'll -- I'll tell him
he has to go!

615
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,370
I'll tell him to go. He'll go.

616
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,807
He best be gone
come the morning.

617
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:39,965
you have to go away.

618
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:42,333
What?

619
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,871
Why? Wh --
what did I do?

620
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:50,275
You didn't do anything.

621
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,879
It's him, isn't it? It's Carl?

622
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,416
what if I just work
for room and board?

623
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,418
That'll just make it worse.

624
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:05,023
Look, I know this is hard
to understand right now,

625
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,892
but later, you're gonna see
it's for the best.

626
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,362
you need to find your own way.

627
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,064
Is farming even
what you want to do?

628
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:14,933
Maybe you'd rather
live in the city.

629
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:17,102
You're young, and you shouldn't
feel tied down to anything.

630
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,405
I don't feel tied down.
I want to stay.

631
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,073
We've all come to rely on you
too much,

632
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:26,077
and maybe I've been
the most guilty of that.

633
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,020
do you trust me?

634
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,655
More than anyone.

635
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,358
Then do this for me
and know it's the right thing.

636
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:45,230
Here, take this.
I don't want it.

637
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,465
Please take it.
I don't want your money.

638
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:13,291
* lost inside
this starry night *

639
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:19,597
* these walls
are dark and gray *

640
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,168
* paralyzed and caught inside

641
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:28,039
* it never goes away

642
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:30,675
* ooh, ooh, ooh

643
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:33,311
* colors fade
to black and white *

644
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,346
* ooh, ooh, ooh

645
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,183
* somehow I know
it'll be all right *

646
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,385
* ooh, ooh, ooh

647
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:45,190
* if only I could
turn back time *

648
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,959
* ooh, I've tried

649
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:52,697
* I'm not gonna say goodbye

650
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:58,569
* I'm not gonna say goodbye

651
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:02,673
* this emptiness is deafening

652
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:08,579
* how long will this take?

653
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,617
* Is this what you thought
it'd be? *

654
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,285
* I'm about to break

655
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,488
hot today now.

656
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:27,965
you're a little quiet
this morning.

657
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:31,502
Couldn't help but notice

658
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:34,239
that Francis was headed
for town.

659
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,075
Any ideas
where he might be going?

660
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:45,383
Oh, I guess it doesn't
really matter anyway.

661
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,585
I figure what I'll do...

662
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:51,389
I'll just put me in
a ad for a new hand.

663
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:53,758
Of course,
I wouldn't go expecting

664
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,627
another young, pretty one
was I you.

665
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,764
how dare you say that to me,
Carl!

666
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,499
What?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

667
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,801
How dare you say that to me!
Hold up, hold up!

668
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,438
Wait, I am sorry. Okay?

669
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:14,145
look, hey.
I won't ever say it again.

670
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,254
* ooh, I've tried

671
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:27,492
* I'm not gonna say goodbye

672
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:34,465
* I'm not gonna say goodbye

673
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:38,203
* this emptiness is deafening

674
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:44,242
* how long will this take?

675
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:47,812
* Is this what you thought
it'd be? *

676
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:52,850
* I'm about to break

677
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,420
* ooh, ooh, ooh

678
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,123
* the colors fade
to black and white *

679
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,790
* ooh, ooh, ooh

680
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:02,827

it'll be all right *

681
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,495
* ooh, ooh, ooh

* ooh, ooh, ooh

684
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,637
* god only knows
that I've tried *

685
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,705
* ooh, ooh, ooh

686
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,508
* this life we live
is paper-thin *

687
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,744
* ooh, ooh, ooh

688
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:22,513
* wonder what it could've been

689
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:24,549
* ooh, ooh, ooh

690
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:30,221
* I'm too afraid
to choose a side *

691
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,357
* I can't lie

692
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,727
* not gonna say goodby-y-y-y-e

693
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:41,566
* I'm not gonna say
goodby-y-y-y-e *

694
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,437
* I'm not gonna say
goodby-y-y-y-e *

695
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:51,742
* I'm not gonna say goodbye

696

* ooh, ooh, ooh

697
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,481
hi. Uh, how are you doing?

698
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:59,217
I'm -- I'm here to see
Mr. Verret about the ranch job.

699
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,253
Oh, uh, daddy's
up at north end.

700
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,790
He'll be back at noon
if you want to wait.

701
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:09,527
Uh, maybe I'm just gonna
head that direction.

702
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,303
* know there's reasons
in this life *

703
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:24,542
* that'll never be explained

704
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:27,945
* when the colors fade
from black to white *

705
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,615
* it'll never be the same

706
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,787
well, this guy
looks like he needs a job.

707
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,856
Never seen him before.

708
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,227
can I help you?

709
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,595
I'm looking for
a Mr. Jim verret.

710
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:47,398
Well, you found him.

711
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:50,601
I'm Francis riley.
I'm here about the ranch job.

712
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,904
This is my foreman,
luis alvarez.

713
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:55,773
Where are you from, Francis?

714
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,408
Whitewright.

715
00:52:57,442 --> 00:52:59,344
It's outside of sherman.

716
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:02,480
I worked on a small ranch
out there.

717
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,814
How many head?

718
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,783
Uh, 10, sir.

719
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,555
well, son,
we got over 1,000 here.

720
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:13,558
I'm a hard worker, sir,
and a fast learner.

721
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,698
why'd you leave where you were?

722
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,934
A personal matter.

723
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,503
I assure you,
it had nothing to do

724
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,937
with the quality of work
I was doing.

725
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:38,383
I'll tell you what.

726
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,452
Let's try each other out
for a few days, see how it goes.

727
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:43,654
Pay's $150 a week,
plus room and board.

728
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:47,592
There's a bunkhouse you'll share
with the other hands.

729
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,995
It's not too private,
but it's air-conditioned.

730
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:53,998
That sounds just fine, sir.
Thank you.

731
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,500
Why don't you
throw your stuff in the back?

732
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,336
We'll give you a ride.
Yes, sir.

733
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:08,913
whitewright.

734
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,444
yah!

735
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:39,163
* now the moon shines tonight
on pretty red wing *

736
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,632
* the breeze is sighing

737
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,735
* the night bird's crying

738
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:49,440
* for afar 'neath his star,
her brave is sleeping *

739
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:52,009
* while red wing's weeping

740
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,178
* her heart away

741
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,080
Francis.

742
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:33,751
What are you doing out here?

743
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,721
Figured you'd be in town
on your day off.

744
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:39,590
Yeah, I was just checking out
this little patch of land here.

745
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,859
it's a nice piece of land.

746
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:46,030
bet you got all sort of plans
for it, huh?

747
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,499
Not really.

748
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:53,070
Sometimes I just come out here.
Place to think.

749
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,239
I had a place like that
back home.

750
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:58,643
Down by this creek.

751
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,845
You know, I was wondering, uh...

752
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,713
Figuring those, uh,
pecos melons --

753
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:05,215
I mean, they bring in
some pretty good prices,

754
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,685
and, uh, I mean,
I've seen what they do,

755
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,655
and, uh, the river's close
enough where you can build

756
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:12,957
an irrigation system
right through here.

757
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,093
Hell, you're talking about
a lot of work.

758
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:20,164
I'd only fool around with it
when I was done with my chores.

759
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:23,267
I mean, maybe we could split
the profits one way or another,

760
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,870
oh, however you think fair.

761
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,772
I'll tell you what.

762
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,940
You do the work on your own
time, and you can keep it all.

763
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,843
Thank you, sir.

764
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:34,679
Not gonna leave you
much time for recreation.

765
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,682
I don't really like having
any free time on my hands.

766
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,686
yeah.

767
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,187
You know,
when gina's mother died,

768
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,291
I worked this ranch
every day from sunup to sundown.

769
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:51,295
I hit that pillow,
and I'd fall asleep right away.

770
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:54,264
Didn't want to lie there
thinking about anything.

771
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,905
your folks live in whitewright?

772
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:05,175
Uh, I don't really have
any folks.

773
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:09,947
I had a, uh, family I was
living with before I came here.

774
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,752
Uh...This woman, Maddie...

775
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:18,689
Her son, Johnny, husband, Carl.

776
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:20,157
Guess they were
about the closest thing

777
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,092
I've ever had to family.

778
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:27,732
uh, things change.

779
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,900
That they do.

780
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:42,106
thank you.
Come on back.

781
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,341
Yes, sir.

782
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:57,354
* smile, a smile to remember *

783
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:04,895
* a spark before the ember *

784
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:08,165
* no *

785
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:15,305
* it cannot have,
it cannot hold *

786
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,474
* realize we're all alone *

787
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,843
hi.

788
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,244
Uh, uh, i-I'm sorry.

789
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,047
I didn't mean to bother.
I just heard the music.

790
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,481
You like it?
* Reds and greens *

791
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,885
yeah
* and blues and yellows *

792
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:30,120
it's pretty.

793
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:33,057
* Were fallin'all around *
sad, though.

794
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,893
I like being sad sometimes.

795
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,494
* Felt the air *

796
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,898
* was cool with springtime *
so, um...

797
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,833
What were you thinking about...

798
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,902
* Well, I couldn't
hear a sound *

799
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,103
...Standing there
with your eyes closed?

800
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:47,404
You...

801
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,506
Shouldn't ask questions
like that.

802
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,276
* Wait *

803
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,511
unless you...

804
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,148
Really want to know the answer.

805
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:02,019
* Hold it in in company *

806
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,287
it's none of my business.

807
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,423
No, no, it's all right.

808
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,093
* No *
just surprised is all.

809
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:10,394
Most of the time,

810
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,296
I can barely get two words
out of you.

811
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:14,164
Well, most of the time,
it takes me till the next day

812
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,933
to think what I ought to say.

813
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:24,108
* it doesn't matter anyway *

814
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:28,178
* reds and greens
and blues and yellows *

815
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,348
when I was standing here
with my eyes closed...

816
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,318
* Were falling all around *

817
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,054
* felt the air *

818
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:43,928
* was cool with springtime *
I was thinking about you.

819
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,462
* I couldn't hear a sound *
I should probably go.

820
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:49,033
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah.

821
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:14,458
hey.

822
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:15,893
Hi.

823
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,095
Looks like
you got a green thumb.

824
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,900
yeah, they're doing all right.

825
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:27,137
Have you thought about
what I said the other night?

826
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:30,474
Well, you could say that.

827
01:03:30,507 --> 01:03:32,176
Haven't really
thought about much else.

828
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:45,555
* I couldn't hear a sound

829
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:54,364
* it was such a perfect plan

830
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:59,937
* it was such a perfect plan

831
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,872
it's okay.

832
01:04:01,906 --> 01:04:04,041
* Only you could understand
I don't need to know now.

833
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:12,049
* It was such a perfect plan

834
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:17,587
* it was such a perfect plan

835
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:23,660
* could've slipped
right through my hand *

836
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:28,933
* reds and greens
and blues and yellows *

837
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:32,469
* were falling all around

838
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:38,542
up to more than $9,000.

839
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,344
What are your plans
with that money?

840
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:41,678
'Cause we have some investment
opportunities you could...

841
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,515
You all done?

842
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,417
Never mind.

843
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,019
I think I know.

844
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:50,620
Uh...

845
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,354
all those got the pinkeye.

846
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,625
Francis. Dude.

847
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,394
What are you doing here?

848
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,597
Well, Mr. Smith's getting in
the angus business.

849
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,299
So, uh,
you working out here now?

850
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,067
Yeah, yeah, a little ways
outside of town.

851
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:40,304
How is everything at home --
you know, wife, kids?

852
01:05:40,337 --> 01:05:43,673
Oh, yeah, man, it's good.
Really good.

853
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,343
Guess you heard about Carl?

854
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,511
No. What?

855
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,379
Bought it, man.

856
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:52,182
Driving half drunk,
flipped the car twice.

857
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,584
Out on the curve on 297.
You remember.

858
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:55,752
He's dead?

859
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,487
Yeah.

860
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,689
Was anybody with him?

861
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,258
Maddie.

862
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:05,295
She's all right, man.

863
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:06,530
A.J., We got to go!

864
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:19,709
what are you
doing back so soon?

865
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:22,179
What is it?

866
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,148
Um, i-i think
I need to go home.

867
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:25,715
Home?

868
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:28,218
Maddie was in an accident.

869
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,254
Is she all right?

870
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,156
I-i don't know.

871
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,590
I mean, Carl's dead.

872
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:36,660
Well, you go ahead then.
Take the truck.

873
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:41,531
Uh, i-i don't know if I'm gonna
be back in a week or six months.

874
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,200
I'm real sorry
to leave you shorthanded.

875
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,269
I won't say
I don't mind losing you,

876
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,703
but you do what you got to do.

877
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,338
You always have a place here.

878
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,806
Just bring the truck back.

879
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,542
Call us and let us know
everything's all right.

880
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,378
Yes, sir.

881
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,124
uh...

882
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:12,062
Guess you heard?

883
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:14,198
I'm gonna miss you, gina.

884
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:17,367
I'd wait for you...

885
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,836
If I thought you wanted me to.

886
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:25,609
don't.

887
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:28,745
I took something
that wasn't mine.

888
01:08:10,354 --> 01:08:13,123
uh, yeah, cindy,
I'll call you back.

889
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,759
Someone's here.

890
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,228
I-I'm looking for Maddie.

891
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:24,201
Maddie Blanton
and her son, Johnny.

892
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,635
And who might you be?

893
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:31,241
Where is she?

894
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:32,442
Maddie?! Maddie?!

895
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:33,810
Mary ann --
kathy.

896
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,312
Oh.

897
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:36,880
is Maddie okay?

898
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,149
Francis?
I hardly recognized you.

899
01:08:39,183 --> 01:08:40,150
Is she dead?

900
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:41,418
No.

901
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:46,190
She's better.
She's in the hospital.

902
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:47,924
And Johnny -- is Johnny okay?

903
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,560
Johnny's fine.
He wasn't even in the car.

904
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,337
I'm sorry if I was rude.

905
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,439
I just didn't know what to think
when I saw a stranger here.

906
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,674
Mary ann's no stranger, Francis.

907
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,411
You remember here --
Carl's niece.

908
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,380
The girl that did cartwheels.

909
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:14,851
Mm-hmm.

910
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,292
mm.

911
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:23,560
Mm.

912
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:31,835
Um, i-I'm looking for
Maddie Blanton.

913
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,970
She's in this room
right here, sir.

914
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,208
Thank you.

915
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,503
Francis?

916
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:15,979
You came.

917
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:20,517
Don't move.

918
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,819
Don't move.

919
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:27,791
are you hurt bad?

920
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,893
A few broken ribs.

921
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:33,530
Oh, you'll mend up just fine.

922
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,565
I'm real sorry
to hear about Mr. Blanton.

923
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:45,342
Tell me about
what you've been doing.

924
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,611
Where you've been staying.

925
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:55,685
I'm working on a ranch
in pottsboro outside of denison.

926
01:10:55,719 --> 01:11:02,459
Let me bring these closer.

927
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,628
Are people nice at the ranch?

928
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:05,795
Yeah.

929
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,731
Yeah, they've been
real good to me.

930
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,966
Can you stay a few days?

931
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,901
Oh, more than that.

932
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,803
Stay as long as you want me to.

933
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:24,381
Hey, mama, I --

934
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,749
Francis?

935
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,351
So you haven't forgotten
your old buddy?

936
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,420
how can I forget
your ugly, old face?

937
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:33,423
Well, uh, I'm back and ready
to carry out all your wishes.

938
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,525
Just like I used to.

939
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:38,428
hey, mama.

940
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,833
You have mama laughing again.

941
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:46,703
That's good enough for me.

942
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:47,971
I'm real sorry about your dad.

943
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:55,379
oh, he was drunk.

944
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:57,414
You know...

945
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:58,982
When it happened...

946
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:01,985
I'm just glad it was him
that died and not mama.

947
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,794
There's mary ann.

948
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,462
That's her friend cindy.

949
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:16,600
The guy she's with,
her boyfriend, ricky.

950
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,535
What's wrong with ricky?

951
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,837
Ah, he's all right, I guess.

952
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,139
And how long
has she been living with y'all?

953
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,574
About a year maybe.

954
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,075
She wouldn't get along
with aunt betty,

955
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:30,046
so they asked daddy
if she'd stay with us a while.

956
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,981
He got her a job
at miss vera's place.

957
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,889
how you doing, Mr. Dyre?

958
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:22,225
You back
at the Blanton's place?

959
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:23,627
Uh, yes, sir.

960
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,829
shame about old Carl.

961
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:27,497
I'll put this on their account.

962
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:29,198
Uh, actually,
I'm gonna take care of it now

963
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,199
if you don't mind.

964
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:32,168
Don't mind a bit.

965
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:15,912
you've been busy.

966
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:18,281
No, just trying
to make the place look nice

967
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:19,849
for when Maddie comes home.

968
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:21,951
They say when?

969
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:25,689
Uh...

970
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:29,225
Just a few -- few more days.

971
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:33,029
You're gonna stick around
for a while?

972
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,530
Long as I can be of help.

973
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:50,346
I'm sorry, Francis.

974
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,917
It's just business is business.

975
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:57,286
We've been carrying this loan
for a long time.

976
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:03,960
You know, now with Carl gone...

977
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:09,833
well, I'm sorry...Francis.

978
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:50,774
you're home.

979
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,258
Thank you.

980
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,227
For what?

981
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:15,665
Making everything so nice.

982
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,802
Being here makes me feel like
everything's gonna be all right.

983
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,837
Everything
is gonna be okay, Maddie.

984
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:26,442
Doesn't matter anymore anyway.

985
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,878
Bank's gonna own everything
come the first of the month.

986
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:36,219
Let 'em have it.
But this farm is Johnny's due.

987
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:39,388
I don't have any choice,
Francis.

988
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:43,026
I can't pay it.

989
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:46,863
I can.

990
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,398
I did.

991
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:51,267
What?

992
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,902
While I was away, I saved up.

993
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,738
And you gave up
all your savings for this farm?

994
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:57,040
Not all of it.

995
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:59,208
Just paper was due --
brought it up to date.

996
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:01,110
And what about next month,
Francis?

997
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:02,378
I can't run this farm!

998
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,113
I don't want to
run this farm alone!

999
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:05,982
You don't have to
run this farm alone.

1000
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,052
I'll be here.

1001
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:11,755
You shouldn't have done that
without talking to me first.

1002
01:18:11,788 --> 01:18:13,256
I'm the only one
that has a right

1003
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:16,760
to make a decision like that
for Johnny and me!

1004
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:19,729
Oh.

1005
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:21,197
Welcome home, aunt Maddie.

1006
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,834
Mary ann.

1007
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:57,133
I know that --
I shouldn't --

1008
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:02,405
I know that you had
the best intentions

1009
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,240
and you were
just trying to help.

1010
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:07,376
Oh, you know, I shouldn't have
gone and took over like that.

1011
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,047
It wasn't my place.

1012
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,482
It's just that I can't
let myself be dependent on you.

1013
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:16,319
That's not fair to anybody.

1014
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:18,221
Besides, you need to be thinking

1015
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,024
about having
your own house someday.

1016
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:23,827
Your own farm
and your own family.

1017
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,528
Well, I guess I kind of...

1018
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:27,530
Thought of you and Johnny
as my family.

1019
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:31,067
Oh, Francis...

1020
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,169
Can't you see
how easy it would be

1021
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,204
for me to just
let you take over?

1022
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:37,006
And how unfair that would be?

1023
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,475
Why is that unfair
if that's what I want?

1024
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,078
Because you need to have
your own life.

1025
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,080
And I need to learn
how to live mine

1026
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,082
without depending
on someone else.

1027
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:50,553
Okay.

1028
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:53,022
Let me just help you
get back on your feet.

1029
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,158
Just till then.

1030
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:10,073
I'd better go.

1031
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:25,254
hey.

1032
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:26,890
What are you still doing up?

1033
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:28,391
I want to talk to you.

1034
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,961
Oh.

1035
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,434
I see.

1036
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:41,037
I want to ask
your help around the house

1037
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,507
while Maddie's getting well.

1038
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,476
I'm gonna see to the farm,
but I can't do it alone.

1039
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,645
Well, you stay out late,
and you sleep till noon.

1040
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,514
That leaves
all the work for her.

1041
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:55,451
Look, I'm not asking for myself.

1042
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:59,388
I'm asking for her.

1043
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:02,058
Can I count on you?

1044
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:06,896
Are you always this...

1045
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,298
Serious?

1046
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:11,968
look at that.

1047
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,236
He smiles.

1048
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:16,039
You know, I'm not trying
to be a hard-ass.

1049
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:17,640
I just --
okay.

1050
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,578
you know...

1051
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,680
I remember you...

1052
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:30,319
When I used to come up here
with mama and daddy.

1053
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:35,591
Even as a little boy,
you were always so...

1054
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,293
Solemn.

1055
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:38,561
And you were always

1056
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:39,929
either giggling
or crying your eyes out.

1057
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,567
well, I guess nothing much
has changed then, huh?

1058
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,602
Guess not.

1059
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:54,643
you know, it's getting late.
We'd better get to bed.

1060
01:21:54,677 --> 01:21:58,014
Yeah.

1061
01:21:58,047 --> 01:22:00,249
Well, good night.

1062
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,432
oh, oh!

1063
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:18,334
Come on, I'm coming for you.

1064
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:22,271
Francis!

1065
01:22:22,305 --> 01:22:24,373
Damn it!
You're a cheater!

1066
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:30,446
wait, what about...

1067
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:07,183
mary ann.

1068
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:09,518
Vera.

1069
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:11,320
Well...

1070
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:13,122
Howdy, stranger.

1071
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:15,091
Long time, no see.

1072
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:16,192
You got that hay?

1073
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:19,295
It's out back.

1074
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,398
Raoul will help you with it.

1075
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:34,310
Funny how he shows up
right after Carl,

1076
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,212
right after the accident.

1077
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:37,546
What do you mean?

1078
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,515
With Carl out of the way,

1079
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:43,052
he and Maddie
can carry on all they want.

1080
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:44,787
Francis and Maddie?

1081
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,523
Why else would he
pay off her debts?

1082
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:49,225
She's too old for him.

1083
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:51,560
Not all men still like 'em
in their diapers, honey.

1084
01:23:51,594 --> 01:23:55,764
You can't blame him.

1085
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:59,768
Look, your uncle,
he was good to me.

1086
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:03,672
I miss him like the dickens,
but he led Maddie a dog's life.

1087
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:08,777
I do not blame her for giving
a second look at Francis.

1088
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:11,147
I looked him over myself once.

1089
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:18,387
so that's why he's not
interested in anything else.

1090
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:23,058
Here you go.

1091
01:24:36,272 --> 01:24:38,507
hey.

1092
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,609
Vera keeping you busy
down there?

1093
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:43,146
Busy enough.

1094
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:46,349
Vera told me
why you had to leave.

1095
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,352
She said uncle Carl
found out about you and Maddie.

1096
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:50,753
What about me and Maddie?

1097
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:56,492
Just that now that uncle Carl's
out of the way you're --

1098
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:58,794
all right, that's enough!
Let go of me.

1099
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,696
You listen to me.

1100
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,232
Look, I know why vera's
got a grudge against Maddie.

1101
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,368
I mean, you, I don't understand.

1102
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:08,404
Maddie treats you
like her own daughter.

1103
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,239
Now, you say whatever
you want about me,

1104
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:14,243
but you leave Maddie out of it.

1105
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:17,413
Mary ann?

1106
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:21,717
what's wrong?

1107
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,486
Nothin'.

1108
01:25:23,519 --> 01:25:26,255
Were you and mary ann arguing?

1109
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:30,726
No, we were just
discussing something.

1110
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:34,563
I think I know what's going on.

1111
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:36,932
Nothing would make me happier
than if you and mary --

1112
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,667
that is not what's going on.

1113
01:25:38,701 --> 01:25:41,470
I seen the way
you are with her, all gruff,

1114
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,272
and I know it's just a cover.

1115
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:45,908
I know you too well.

1116
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:48,311
Sometimes I catch her...

1117
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:49,545
Looking out of the window
at you, day-dreaming.

1118
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:51,414
Look, mary ann...

1119
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:53,516
She's not my type.

1120
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:57,920
So if she's interested in me,
that's her tough luck.

1121
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,785
oh, you're up early.

1122
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:39,962
You'll be happy to hear
that you and Francis...

1123
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:44,833
And Johnny will have the house
all to yourselves soon.

1124
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,469
I'm moving out.

1125
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:50,239
Moving? Where?

1126
01:26:50,273 --> 01:26:53,442
Ricky wants us to get married
and move to corpus.

1127
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:57,680
He put a deposit down
on an apartment over there.

1128
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:00,949
It's right by the water.

1129
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:02,818
We're gonna move in may.

1130
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:04,687
You're marrying ricky?

1131
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,389
Why do you say it like that?

1132
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:07,823
Something wrong with ricky?

1133
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:10,493
No, honey. It's just so sudden.
I thought that --

1134
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:24,840
mary ann?

1135
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:28,477
I'm in here.

1136
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:30,646
Oh. Hello, Maddie.

1137
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,348
Vera.

1138
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:34,350
What do you think of
mary ann's dress, miss Blanton?

1139
01:27:34,383 --> 01:27:37,720
Isn't it pretty?

1140
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,422
It's lovely.

1141
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:41,557
What's that?

1142
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,826
Oh, um...

1143
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,462
I thought maybe Mrs. Duval
could sew your dress.

1144
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:48,364
I didn't realize
you already bought one.

1145
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,833
Vera got it for me in Dallas.

1146
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,835
Oh.

1147
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,940
Well, I got to
get back to the shop.

1148
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,508
I will see you later, honey.

1149
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:00,709
Thank you, vera.

1150
01:28:00,743 --> 01:28:03,879
Oh! You are gonna be beautiful!

1151
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:05,948
I got to go, too.

1152
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:07,916
Bye.
Call you later.

1153
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,021
could you, um...

1154
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:15,324
Unzip me?

1155
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:24,099
This must've been
so expensive, mary ann.

1156
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,902
Are you sure you should
accept such a gift from vera?

1157
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,640
You'd have me wear
some old dowdy thing

1158
01:28:31,674 --> 01:28:34,477
that Mrs. Duval would sew?

1159
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,112
I wouldn't wear these...

1160
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,582
To my funeral.

1161
01:28:39,615 --> 01:28:42,551
Much less to my wedding.

1162
01:28:48,757 --> 01:28:51,494
Mary ann...

1163
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:52,961
You don't seem very happy

1164
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:55,631
for someone
who's about to get married.

1165
01:28:55,664 --> 01:29:00,603
Just because you screwed up
your life, aunt Maddie...

1166
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:04,773
Doesn't mean you know
anything about mine.

1167
01:29:26,962 --> 01:29:29,532
so, I heard a joke
at school today.

1168
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:32,535
A baptist preacher walks up to
a good old boy from texas

1169
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:35,103
and says,"sir, do you believe
in infant baptism?"

1170
01:29:35,137 --> 01:29:36,872
He says,"believe in it?

1171
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:38,006
Hell, I've seen it done."

1172
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:44,179
what?

1173
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,482
Forget it.

1174
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:57,092
What were you and mary ann
arguing about

1175
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,160
the other day in the yard?

1176
01:29:58,193 --> 01:29:59,695
Nothin'.

1177
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:06,469
there's been some talk.

1178
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,773
about you and me.

1179
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:15,911
That's why Carl sent me away,
isn't it?

1180
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:17,179
He heard something.

1181
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:19,047
I don't care
what other people say.

1182
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,483
You and I know what's true.

1183
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:28,056
I got to go put this out.

1184
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:40,603
* we pushed the lumber
through the ripping saw *

1185
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:44,740
* we checked the folks out
at the shopping mall *

1186
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:48,777
* we put the primer
on the rich man's deck *

1187
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:52,648
* we hanged the dry wall
like the contractor said *

1188
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:56,685
* the days go by,
and the children grow *

1189
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,889
* we've got ahold,
but sometimes we let go *

1190
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:04,627
* but now and then,
you got to let the reel unwind *

1191
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:08,597
* and meet your buddies
on a saturday night and say *

1192
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:10,566
* hey, y'all

1193
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:13,068
* hey, y'all

1194
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:16,805
* it's good to be here

1195
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:18,240
* hey, y'all

1196
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:21,544
* hey, y'all

1197
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,546
* I'm happy that we're

1198
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:24,947
* hanging out

1199
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,883
* ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1200
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:32,788
* yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

1201
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:36,825
* let's get the grill out,
pour the fluid on *

1202
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:40,162
* let's get the girlies
dancing to their song *

1203
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:44,266
* let the kids go crazy
like a bunch of wild injuns *

1204
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:48,771
* it's been too long since
we had this little bit of fun *

1205
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:52,741
* it ain't that often
god makes days like these *

1206
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:56,679
* the breeze goes easy
through the swaying trees *

1207
01:31:56,712 --> 01:32:00,883
* the trucks pull up
all full of our old friends *

1208
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:04,086
* they all pile out
laughing and then say *

1209
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:06,589
* hey, y'all

1210
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:09,592
* hey, y'all

1211
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,327
* it's good to be here

1212
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,962
* hey, y'all

1213
01:32:13,996 --> 01:32:16,965
* hey, y'all

1214
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:20,102
* so happy they're there

1215
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,940
ladies, it is time
for the bouquet!

1216
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:33,115
come on, Maddie.

1217
01:32:33,148 --> 01:32:35,083
Oh, no, I'm not.

1218
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:40,823
* let the ladies sing to us

1219
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:45,027
* everybody's
just gonna throw *

1220
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,764
* like before we were born,
after we are gone *

1221
01:32:48,797 --> 01:32:50,999
* you'll have the chance
to sing on this fine day *

1222
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,639
* makes you want to stand up
on the trailer and say *

1223
01:32:56,672 --> 01:32:58,373
* hey, y'all

1224
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,309

* I'm not the kind of guy *

1240
01:33:47,856 --> 01:33:52,027
* who looks into
a crystal ball *

1241
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:56,331
* well, your kiss
has changed it all *

1242
01:33:56,364 --> 01:33:58,734
this is silly --

1243
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,969
a woman my age with all these
beautiful, young girls around.

1244
01:34:01,003 --> 01:34:02,771
* And the stars *

1245
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:04,006
they don't
hold a candle to you.

1246
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:06,408
* Are there for the light *

1247
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:13,882
* and they all line up
when I'm holding you tight *

1248
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:20,155
* you take me to a world
full of make-believe *

1249
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:27,963
* and my heart is telling me

1250
01:34:27,996 --> 01:34:35,337
* you're my cinderella dreams
come true *

1251
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:42,845
* there's no one on earth
to compare you to *

1252
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:49,952
* at the stroke of midnight
you'll be here by my side *

1253
01:34:49,985 --> 01:34:58,293
* my cinderella dreams
come true *

1254
01:35:08,804 --> 01:35:14,476
* once upon a time

1255
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:16,812
excuse me.

1256
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:18,413
Hey.
What?

1257
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:21,116
How dare you on my wedding day.

1258
01:35:21,149 --> 01:35:22,117
What?!

1259
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,285
You and Francis.

1260
01:35:23,318 --> 01:35:25,253
What, you think
nobody noticed

1261
01:35:25,287 --> 01:35:27,322
how y'all were
looking at each other?

1262
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:28,523
Wh-what do you mean?

1263
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,259
You know exactly what I mean.

1264
01:35:31,293 --> 01:35:34,096
And so does everybody else.

1265
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:37,399
You know, aunt Maddie...

1266
01:35:37,432 --> 01:35:40,803
I used to think
you were so good.

1267
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:42,337
You had everybody fooled.

1268
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:43,872
That's enough.

1269
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:45,107
You don't ever talk that way
to Maddie again.

1270
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,143
You hear me?

1271
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:51,013
Now we're going home.

1272
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:53,248
Johnny, we're going.

1273
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:31,219
think I'm going away
for a while.

1274
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:34,923
For my sake?

1275
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,893
Maybe for my own.

1276
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:17,165
I got it, teresa.

1277
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,870
Brought your truck back.

1278
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,943
I see that.

1279
01:37:27,976 --> 01:37:31,947
You back for good?

1280
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:33,281
No, just back.

1281
01:37:33,315 --> 01:37:35,517
You know,
when we didn't hear from you,

1282
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,219
we didn't know what to think.

1283
01:37:37,252 --> 01:37:40,222
I thought
you were gone for good.

1284
01:37:40,255 --> 01:37:43,391
I'm sorry.

1285
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,427
Is, uh...

1286
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,963
Gina home?

1287
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:49,597
She's out back.

1288
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:54,336
Francis.

1289
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:58,006
My daughter's not as tough
as she makes out to be.

1290
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:59,341
I understand, sir.

1291
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:02,210
I hope you do, son.

1292
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:05,914
She means the world to me.

1293
01:38:16,524 --> 01:38:19,694
look at her -- such a flirt.

1294
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:30,973
I'm sorry about the way I left.

1295
01:38:34,376 --> 01:38:38,280
Thought about calling you
a hundred times.

1296
01:38:38,313 --> 01:38:41,083
I never meant to hurt you.

1297
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,091
I know.

1298
01:38:49,124 --> 01:38:50,993
Is Maddie all right?

1299
01:38:51,026 --> 01:38:54,029
Yeah. Yeah, she, uh...

1300
01:38:54,062 --> 01:38:57,399
She held up real good.

1301
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,968
What are you doing here?

1302
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:04,539
I don't -- I don't know.

1303
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:11,079
Think your dad
will take me back on?

1304
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:12,314
He'd love it.

1305
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:14,282
You know that.

1306
01:39:14,316 --> 01:39:16,151
What about you?

1307
01:39:20,488 --> 01:39:25,293
Yeah.

1308
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:30,532
Yeah, I'm thinking of heading
out to marfa, alpine maybe.

1309
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:39,674
why are you
running away from her?

1310
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:42,044
Away from who?

1311
01:39:42,077 --> 01:39:44,612
Does she know?

1312
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:50,552
does Maddie know
that you're in love with her?

1313
01:39:54,256 --> 01:39:56,024
are you ashamed?

1314
01:39:56,058 --> 01:39:58,593
No. No, no.

1315
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:06,101
She raised me, gina.
She's like my mother.

1316
01:40:06,134 --> 01:40:08,070
But she's not your mother.

1317
01:40:12,274 --> 01:40:14,076
I don't think other people
see it that way.

1318
01:40:14,109 --> 01:40:16,010
Who cares?

1319
01:40:18,546 --> 01:40:23,151
Have you asked her?

1320
01:40:26,421 --> 01:40:29,191
Ask her.

1321
01:40:35,597 --> 01:40:37,765
thank you, gina.

1322
01:40:37,799 --> 01:40:40,768
I mean that.

1323
01:40:40,802 --> 01:40:43,438
Good luck.

1324
01:40:43,471 --> 01:40:45,640
I mean that.

1325
01:41:13,668 --> 01:41:15,437
you hear we're going to a game
on friday in mason?

1326
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,472
They're gonna
take us on the bus.

1327
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:18,673
They're a"aaa" school,
so technically,

1328
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:23,811
we shouldn't even
be playing 'em.

1329
01:41:23,845 --> 01:41:26,648
You heard from mary ann?

1330
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:28,516
They got a place in corpus.

1331
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:31,319
She got a job
at the dry cleaner's.

1332
01:41:31,353 --> 01:41:32,854
She like it?

1333
01:41:32,887 --> 01:41:35,523
I think she's glad
to be away from here.

1334
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:41,363
Oh, no, no.
Save that for later.

1335
01:41:41,396 --> 01:41:45,267
I want to talk to you
about something.

1336
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,402
Come take a walk with me.

1337
01:42:06,188 --> 01:42:09,224
this is where I saw you
for the first time.

1338
01:42:09,257 --> 01:42:14,362
remember?

1339
01:42:14,396 --> 01:42:16,431
That's where we were when
you told me I had to go away.

1340
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:27,942
I don't ever want to
leave you again, Maddie.

1341
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,344
Francis, you --

1342
01:42:29,377 --> 01:42:32,447
wait, d-don't shut me up.

1343
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,916
I might not ever be able to
get up the courage again.

1344
01:42:37,352 --> 01:42:39,454
I've been in love with you
my entire life.

1345
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:46,661
I mean, I didn't even know it
myself till I heard it said.

1346
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:48,663
I think you're just
feeling indebted to me.

1347
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:49,964
You're mixing up duty and love.

1348
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:52,567
I know the difference.

1349
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,302
If it's the gossip --

1350
01:42:54,336 --> 01:42:58,573
I don't give a damn about
what anybody else thinks.

1351
01:42:58,606 --> 01:43:00,808
The way I feel about you...

1352
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:05,280
Has nothing to do with duty,
with h-honor, with anybody else.

1353
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:10,952
I love you, Maddie.

1354
01:43:10,985 --> 01:43:14,222
I love you
the way a man loves a woman.

1355
01:43:14,256 --> 01:43:16,424
And I want to marry you.

1356
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:19,961
I want to
take care of you and Johnny.

1357
01:43:24,299 --> 01:43:26,000
you think you'd ever
love me that way?

1358
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:29,837
Oh, Francis. Are you sure?

1359
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:38,280
Oh, I'm sure.

1360
01:43:38,313 --> 01:43:40,982
You might regret it later
when I'm old.

1361
01:43:41,015 --> 01:43:46,020
How could I ever regret
loving you?

1362
01:43:49,624 --> 01:43:50,792
you love me, too,

1363
01:43:50,825 --> 01:43:52,660
or you wouldn't be crying
right now.

1364
01:44:08,943 --> 01:44:12,414
mama and Francis
got married at the creek.

1365
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:14,048
And I was the best man.

1366
01:44:15,317 --> 01:44:17,519
people talked for a while.

1367
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:18,853
It was unusual.

1368
01:44:18,886 --> 01:44:23,558
But they forgot about it
pretty soon.

1369
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,993
They went back
to their own lives.

1370
01:44:29,664 --> 01:44:31,966
After a while...

1371
01:44:31,999 --> 01:44:35,303
It seemed to everybody
like Francis and Maddie

1372
01:44:35,337 --> 01:44:37,772
had been husband and wife
forever.

1373
01:45:06,868 --> 01:45:14,742
* there once
was an indian maid *

1374
01:45:14,776 --> 01:45:21,816
* a shy little
prairie maid *

1375
01:45:21,849 --> 01:45:29,824
* who sang a lay,
a love song gay *

1376
01:45:29,857 --> 01:45:36,964
* on the plains
she'd while away the day *

1377
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:44,606
* she loved a warrior bold

1378
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:52,046
* this shy
little maid of old *

1379
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:59,086
* but brave and gay,
he rode one day *

1380
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:05,993
* to a battle far away

1381
01:46:09,731 --> 01:46:17,472
* now the moon shines tonight
on pretty red wing *

1382
01:46:17,505 --> 01:46:20,908
* the breeze is sighing

1383
01:46:20,942 --> 01:46:25,580
* the night bird's crying

1384
01:46:25,613 --> 01:46:32,720
* for afar 'neath his star
her brave is sleeping *

1385
01:46:32,754 --> 01:46:44,799
* while red wing's weeping
her heart away *

1386
01:46:44,832 --> 01:46:53,040
* she watched for him
day and night *

1387
01:46:53,074 --> 01:47:00,682
* and kept all
the campfires bright *

1388
01:47:00,715 --> 01:47:07,689
* and under the sky
each night she would lie *

1389
01:47:07,722 --> 01:47:15,463
* and dream about his coming
by and by *

1390
01:47:15,497 --> 01:47:22,637
* but when all the braves
did return *

1391
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:29,911
* the heart
of red wing yearned *

1392
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:37,485
* for far, far away
her warrior gay *

1393
01:47:37,519 --> 01:47:44,692
* fell bravely in the fray

1394
01:47:44,726 --> 01:47:51,799
* now the moon shines tonight
on pretty red wing *

1395
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:55,503
* the breeze is sighing

1396
01:47:55,537 --> 01:48:00,074
* the night birds crying

1397
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:07,782
* for afar 'neath his star
her brave is sleeping *

1398
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:20,995
* while red wing's weeping
her heart away *

1399
01:48:21,028 --> 01:48:25,166
* mm-mm-mm
