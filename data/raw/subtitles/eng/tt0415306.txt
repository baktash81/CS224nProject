1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,900
-Guess how fast we're going now.
-I don't care, I'm having a baby!

2
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,100
Hundred and five miles an hour,
you believe that?

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,100
Reese, you just passed the hospital!

4
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
-The baby's coming, he's coming now!
-All right, all right, hold on.

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,100
-Okay, but I think he might be stuck.
-Grab onto something. Ready?

6
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,300
One, two, three!

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,100
It's a baby boy.

8
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm happy that Waffle House
was okay with me coming here...

9
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,600
...to talk to y'all about
my day-to-day.

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
And, y'all, that's pretty much,
in a shell...

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,100
...what it's like to manage
a Waffle House.

12
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,700
Ma'am, I don't know what else
you want me to say to them.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,300
And I'm also gonna need to know
where your commode's at.

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,200
Okay, let's give him a round
of applause. Thank you.

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.
Ricky, is your father here?

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,700
No, ma'am.
I haven't seen my daddy in years.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,100
But my mama say he's out
racing cars...

18
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,500
...and, well, dipping his wick
in anything that moves.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Okay, kids, that's enough.
We're gonna move on to Brennan.

20
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,200
Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.

21
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,800
Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.
You'll be my best friend forever.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,700
--his job is like as a prison guard.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Excuse me, darling.
I'm Reese Bobby.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,300
I'm here for career day
with my son, Ricky.

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
-Dad!
-Hey there, boy!

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,200
Man, you got big. How long's it been?
Three, four months?

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,300
-Ten years.
-Ten years?

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,700
Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Mr. Bobby,
there's no smoking in here.

30
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Okay, I am a semi-professional
racecar driver...

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
...and an amateur tattoo artist.

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,500
And the first thing you gotta learn
if you're gonna be a racecar driver...

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,100
...is you don't listen to losers...

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,700
-...like your know-it-all teacher here.
-Okay, I think that's enough.

36
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Your teacher wants you to go slow,
and she's wrong...

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,600
...because it's the fastest who gets paid
and it's the fastest who gets laid.

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,200
Oh, yeah.
You know what I'm talking about.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
You people are in the wrong
on this one!

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
So in the wrong!

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,100
This is egregious,
do you hear me? Egregious!

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,700
We were cellmates together, Andy.
You got payback coming!

43
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,300
Dad!

44
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't listen to these people, Ricky.
You're a winner.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,100
You got the gift. Always remember,
if you ain't first, you're last.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,900
lf you ain't first, you're last.

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,100
-See you when you're grown up.
-Dad! Come back, Dad!

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,900
It's a hot one here in Talladega...

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,700
...and this crowd of over 1 80,000
is enjoying one heck of a day.

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.
Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.

51
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
All right, fellas, let's go.

52
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,700
Looking good. Yes, come on.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,100
Keep it up, baby.

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
-All right, way to go.
-Go, way to go.

55
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,200
Nice jack work, Ricky.

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.

57
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
-Shake and Bake!
-Terry, it's all on you, bro. You go.

58
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,800
Go, baby, go.
Wait, what are you doing?

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,700
-I gotta take a piss.
-Go, go, go!

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
lt doesn't matter, Lucius.
We're in last place. Relax.

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,500
Jeez, I gotta go take a whiz.
Get off my ass.

62
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,600
You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

63
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,300
That's why this group right here
is the laughingstock of NASCAR.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,200
Face it, we suck.

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,100
It's not always bad to be in last place.
Here's some things we can focus on:

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,300
One, we tried hard.
And two, we're still dear friends.

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,900
Glenn, shut up.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,700
I see Terry.
He's having a chicken sandwich.

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,700
Hey, fellas! These are really good.
You should try one.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
That place actually makes
a nice sauce.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
Let me eat this,
then I gotta make a phone call...

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,100
-...then I'm coming back, all right?
-This is the bottom line.

73
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
lf we don't get that car
back on the track...

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,900
...our sponsors are gonna
shit a chicken.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,100
Now, is there anyone out there
who wants to go fast? Anybody?

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,300
I wanna go fast.

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,200
Hey, get him a suit. Hurry up,
make it snappy. Let's go.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
-Hustle up, hustle up.
-Hey, man!

79
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Remember when we got kicked out of
biology for playing with Matchbox cars?

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,000
-Yeah!
-Who's retarded now?

81
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,300
-Yeah.
-Hey, what are you doing after this?

82
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,900
-After the race?
-Yeah.

83
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I don't know, but it feels like
we're wasting a lot of time.

84
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,300
No, I know, I know.
I'm just excited, man!

85
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,900
-Yeah, I know. Yeah.
-Hey! I love you!

86
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,600
-What?
-Nothing.

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Shake and Bake! Get some!

88
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,000
You're my best friend!
You're my best friend!

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,900
-Okay, then!
-I'm in there with you!

90
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,900
-I gotta get going!
-Go, go!

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
-Yeah!
-That's Ricky, baby!

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,700
That's my boy, Ricky!

93
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,200
Hey, Ricky,
just remember one thing:

94
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,400
lf you wreck that car,
that's 200 grand out of your pocket...

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
...so let's take it nice and slow, okay?

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,500
With all due respect, Lucius,
I'm gonna do some driving.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,300
Excuse me, coming through.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,700
Apparently, we've got a situation for
the Laughing Clown, number 26 car.

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,700
Terry Cheveaux is refusing to drive.
One of his crew members...

100
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,200
...has taken the wheel.

101
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,500
Hey, just wanted to share a little piece
of personaI information with you.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
I got a chubby right now...

103
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,300
...because this is one of the most
awesome experiences of my life...

104
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
...because I'm getting to
drive a racecar!

105
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,900
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,300
Wow, that was cool.

107
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Come on, come on.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
The big story from Talladega:

109
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,700
Little-known jack-man Ricky Bobby
places third in the Dennit machine.

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,100
Ricky, first of all,
where did you learn to drive like that?

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,300
ln a car.
Car handle really good. Yeah.

112
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Can you speak up, Ricky?

113
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,300
A car.
lt handled reaI good.

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,900
So, what do you think, Mr. Dennit?
He sure can drive.

115
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,500
He's got guts.
Dennit Racing needs a racer like him.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Come on, Dad.
He's just a stupid cowboy.

117
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
Look how bad he is
in that interview.

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,200
Junior, driving has got nothing
to do with interviews.

119
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
I just wish to hell you had
a little more stupid cowboy in you.

120
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,100
I felt like I was on a spaceship and....

121
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm not sure
what to do with my hands.

122
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,900
Be good to hold them down
by your side.

123
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,100
We're really happy
with what was going on.

124
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,200
And at the end of the day, you know,
you gotta be happy.

125
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,300
-What did you say his name was again?
-His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Ricky Bobby?
He's got two first names.

127
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Whatever his name is,
let's get him over here.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,700
Everything ended up fine.

129
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,100
Yeah, okay, everything was fine.
Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.

130
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,600
Ricky Bobby, a force to be
reckoned with, possibly...

131
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,100
...in the near future.

132
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Ricky Bobby with yet another
impressive win.

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
He is dominating NAS CAR.

134
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,100
First or last, baby, you know it!

135
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I've never seen a driver who
wants to win more than this guy.

136
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
I could get used to
this winning thing!

137
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,500
Dennit Racing lncorporated
has decided to field an additionaI car.

138
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,600
And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby...

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,900
...who's been like a son to me,
only better...

140
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,500
...I'm naming CaI Naughton Jr.
as the driver.

141
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,100
All right.

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,100
-CaI Naughton.
-Hey...

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,900
...we just want to say to all
you other drivers out there...

144
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
...if you smell a delicious,
crispy smell after the race...

145
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,500
...it's not your tailpipe,
it's a little bit...

146
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
...of shake....

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,700
And then bake.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Shake and Bake!

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
-That's our nickname.
-Get used to hearing it.

150
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,000
And Ricky Bobby wins...

151
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
...with CaI Naughton Jr.
finishing second.

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
-Yeah!
-Hey, man!

153
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,400
-Shake....
-And bake!

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,100
Hey, driver! Drive these.

155
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,100
Please be 1 8.

156
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,500
You want to make this out
to Charlotte?

157
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Hey, excuse me, Ricky.

158
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
-Hey, Dale.
-Hey, can I get your autograph?

159
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,500
-Sure. Who do I make this out to?
-It's for me. I think you're awesome.

160
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
-Don't tell the other drivers.
-I'm not gonna tell anyone.

161
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,700
I'll see you out there.

162
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Absolutely, ma'am,
I'd love to sign your baby.

163
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
You're not gonna wanna wash
that forehead.

164
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,100
-That's right, Powerade's number one.
-Not just for hydration, for vitamin.

165
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,700
No, it's me,
it's me, Susan, your assistant.

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Gotta watch it when I get into
autograph mode.

167
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,100
I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,
I shouldn't have been standing.

168
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm Ricky Bobby.
Christmas is right around the corner...

169
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,000
...and what better gift
to give a loved one...

170
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
...than the Jackhawk 9000?

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
Available at Wal-Mart.

172
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,900
When you work on
your mysterious lady-part stuff...

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,500
...you should have the right tools too.
So that's why you should use...

174
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,600
...Maypax, the officiaI tampon
of NASCAR.

175
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm Ricky Bobby.

176
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
lf you don't chew Big Red,
then f*** you.

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,600
Prune candy.

178
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,200
-You happy?
-I'm very happy.

179
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,900
-Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
-And I'm CaI Naughton Jr.

180
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,300
Urging you never to travel
to Tijuana.

181
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,300
Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

182
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,600
Okay, I'm starting to get sick.

183
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,500
Dick Berggren in Las Vegas,
Victory Lane, for Fox Television.

184
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Ricky Bobby, today's big winner.
Heck of a win for you today...

185
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,900
...but it seems as if you either win
or crash the car trying to win.

186
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,200
Well, Dick, here's the deal.
I'm the best there is, plain and simple.

187
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,700
I mean, I wake up in the morning
and I piss excellence.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,900
And nobody can hang with my stuff.

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,200
You know, I'm just a big, hairy,
American winning machine.

190
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,300
lf you ain't first, you're last.
You know what I'm talking about?

191
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,900
That phrase is trademarked...

192
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,500
...not to be used without permission
of Ricky Bobby lnc.

193
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Supper's ready! Come on, y'all!
I've been slaving over this for hours!

194
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,200
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

195
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,800
...or as our brothers
to the south call you, Jesus...

196
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,100
...we thank you so much for this
bountifuI harvest of Domino's, KFC...

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,201
...and the always delicious Taco Bell.

198
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,200
I just want to take time to say
thank you for my family...

199
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,900
...my two beautiful, beautiful,
handsome, striking sons...

200
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,500
...Walker and Texas Ranger...

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,700
...or T.R., as we call him...

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
...and of course,
my red-hot smoking wife, Carley...

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,700
...who is a stone-cold fox.

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Who if you were to rate her ass
on 1 00, it would easily be a 94.

205
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,100
Also wanna thank you for
my best friend, CaI Naughton Jr...

206
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,100
...who's got my back
no matter what.

207
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,300
Shake and Bake.

208
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,600
Dear Lord baby Jesus, we also
thank you for my wife's father, Chip.

209
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,100
We hope that you can use
your baby Jesus powers...

210
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,100
...to heaI him and his horrible leg.

211
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,900
And it smells terrible and
the dogs are always bothering with it.

212
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,700
Dear tiny infant Jesus, we--

213
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Hey, you know, sweetie...

214
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
...Jesus did grow up.

215
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,300
You don't always have to
call him ''baby.''

216
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,100
It's odd and off-putting
to pray to a baby.

217
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, I like the Christmas Jesus best
and I'm saying grace.

218
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
When you say grace, say it to
grownup Jesus, teenage Jesus...

219
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,700
...bearded Jesus,
whoever you want.

220
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,200
You know what I want?

221
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,900
I want you to do this grace good,
so that God will let us win tomorrow.

222
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,900
Dear tiny Jesus...

223
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,900
...in your golden-fleece diapers,
with your tiny, little, fat, balled-up fists...

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,500
-...pawing at the air....
-He was a man. He had a beard.

225
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,100
Look, I like the baby version the best,
do you hear me?

226
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,100
I win the races and I get the money.

227
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,900
Ricky, finish the damn grace.

228
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,900
I like to picture Jesus
in a tuxedo T-shirt...

229
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,700
...because it says, like,
''I wanna be formal...

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,700
-Right.
-...but I'm here to party too.''

231
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,200
Because I like to party,
so I like my Jesus to party.

232
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I like to picture Jesus as a ninja
fighting off eviI samurai.

233
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I like to think of Jesus,
like, with giant eagle's wings.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,300
And singing lead vocals
for Lynyrd Skynyrd...

235
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
...with, like, a angel band.

236
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,200
And I'm in the front row,
and I'm hammered drunk.

237
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,200
Hey, Cal?
Why don't you just shut up?

238
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,300
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Dear 8-pound, 6-ounce,
newborn infant Jesus...

240
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,100
...don't even know a word yet...

241
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,300
...just a little infant and so cuddly,
but still omnipotent...

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,100
...we just thank you for all the races
I've won and the 2 1 .2 million dollars--

243
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Love that money!

244
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,600
--that I have accrued
over this past season.

245
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,000
Also, due to a binding
endorsement contract...

246
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
...that stipulates I mention
Powerade at each grace...

247
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,100
...I just wanna say that
Powerade is delicious...

248
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,400
...and it cools you off
on a hot summer day.

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,300
And we look forward to Powerade's
release of Mystic Mountain Blueberry.

250
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Thank you for all your power
and your grace, dear baby God. Amen.

251
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,200
-Amen.
-Amen.

252
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,700
Let's dig in!

253
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
That was a hell of a grace, man.
You nailed that like a split hog!

254
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm not gonna lie to you, it felt good.

255
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Dad, you made that grace your bitch.

256
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,300
Hey, boys, I wanna see
some napkins in the lap.

257
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,900
Boys, how was schooI today?

258
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I threw a bunch of Grandpa Chip's
war medals off the bridge.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,700
Sounds like a good day.
Texas Ranger, how about you?

260
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Well, the teacher asked me what
was the capitaI of North Carolina.

261
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
I said, ''Washington, D.C.''

262
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
-Bingo.
-Nice.

263
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
She said, ''No, you're wrong.''
I said, ''You got a lumpy butt.''

264
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,100
She got mad at me and yelled at me
and I pissed in my pants.

265
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,100
And I never did change
my pee pants all day.

266
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm still sitting in my dirty pee pants.

267
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,800
I wet my bed untiI I was 1 9.
There's no shame in that.

268
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,400
I get emotionaI because
you guys are working so hard.

269
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm just so proud of you.
You remind me of me...

270
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,400
...precocious and full of wonderment.

271
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
Tell you what, Ricky,
you are truly blessed.

272
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,100
-These two are two in a million.
-I am.

273
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,300
Just like Carley's tatas.

274
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
You won't find another rack like that,
I guarantee.

275
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,500
Thank you, Cal.

276
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,200
That's reaI sweet of you, Cal.

277
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,200
That's reaI nice. That's one of
the nicest things you've ever said.

278
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
-Well, I mean it.
-Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

279
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,900
lt comes from my heart, that's why.

280
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,100
I can't hold my tongue.

281
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,700
These kids are my grandchildren,
and you are raising them wrong.

282
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,200
They are terrible boys.

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Shut up, Chip,
or I'll go ape-shit on your ass!

284
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm gonna scissor-kick you
in the back of the head.

285
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,800
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Turn up the heat.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Go on and get some, boys.

287
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm 1 0 years old,
but I'll beat your ass.

288
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,800
Chip, I'm gonna come at you
like a spider monkey.

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
Like a spider monkey! Go on.

290
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,100
Chip, you brought this on.

291
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
The greatest generation, my ass.

292
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Tom Brokaw is a punk.

293
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
What is wrong with you?

294
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
Chip, I'm all jacked up
on Mountain Dew.

295
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I love that.

296
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
I sure as hell am, Chip.
I love the way they're talking to you.

297
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,200
They're winners.
Winners get to do what they want.

298
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,900
Hell, you're just a bag of bones.

299
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,800
Only thing you ever done with your life
is make a hot daughter.

300
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,000
That's it. That is it!

301
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
We wanted us some wussies...

302
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,300
...we would've named them Dr. Quinn
and Medicine Woman, okay?

303
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,600
I work too hard for your bull, Chip.

304
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Come here.
You make me hot. Come here.

305
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,100
Everyone just keep eating.

306
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,800
-It's on.
-Come here. Come here.

307
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
All right.

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll hold your hair.

309
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
-Hey, Stephen.
-Hey, Ricky.

310
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
Got those two tickets
for my speciaI friend?

311
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,100
Yeah, sure do. You know I do, Ricky.
Got them right here, buddy.

312
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,500
Great. Hey,
how's your mama's hip?

313
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,800
She's gonna be all right,
thank you for asking.

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,100
-Appreciate it. Hey, good luck today.
-Thanks.

315
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
That's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

316
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
That boy leaves two tickets
for his daddy at every race...

317
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,100
...and he never shows up.

318
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
That's a shame.

319
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,200
The human heart is such a mystery.

320
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,700
-Let's sell these bitches, huh?
-Hell, yeah.

321
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
-Beer money, huh?
-There you go. Yes.

322
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
As the laps wind down,
Jamie McMurray is the leader.

323
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,600
CaI Naughton in second.
Ricky Bobby in third.

324
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,300
What's up, Cal? You ready
for a little Shake-and-Bake-age?

325
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,300
-Hey, buddy.
-Naughton Jr. is letting Ricky Bobby...

326
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,100
...draft up to him to make
that slingshot move past McMurray.

327
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,900
Can you believe that he would do that
for his teammate?

328
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,700
Set him up that way?

329
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Slingshot, engage.

330
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,100
And there goes Ricky Bobby
on the outside!

331
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,300
That's how we do it.

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,100
Makes his move.
Naughton's giving him plenty of room.

333
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,800
What in the hell is he doing, guys?
Get him off of me.

334
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,100
They touch! They spin!

335
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
Snap!

336
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,400
Come on, man!

337
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,500
See you, wouldn't wanna be you.

338
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,800
Look at that! Ricky Bobby's gonna
try to win the race in reverse.

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
Man, he wants this win bad!

340
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Ricky Bobby wins it in reverse!

341
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,500
Unbelievable!
I love that! That is cool!

342
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,700
Jamie, losing's never fun, but here's
something to pick your spirits up.

343
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,500
It's reaI nice.
I got it at Target. It's on sale.

344
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah!

345
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,900
-That's it. Another one. Another one.
-All right, man. We did it!

346
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,500
I don't wanna be raining on
your parade, but I gotta tell you...

347
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,700
...that was some of the dumbest driving
I have ever seen in my life.

348
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
-Thank you.
-And I know you won the race...

349
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
...but you're not gonna live forever.

350
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm not stupid, Lucius.
No one lives forever. No one.

351
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,900
But with advances in modern science
and my high level of income...

352
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,700
...I mean, it's not crazy to think
I can't live to be 2 45, maybe 300.

353
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,300
I just read in the newspaper they
put a pig heart in some Russian guy.

354
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,900
Know what--? I mean,
do you know what that means?

355
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,700
No, I don't know what that means.
I guess, longer life.

356
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,700
-Well, no, he didn't live.
-He didn't live?

357
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,500
No. It's just exciting
that we're trying things like that.

358
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,300
-Ricky?
-Hey, Mr. Dennit.

359
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

360
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,200
-She already wasted?
-Celebrating.

361
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,500
She's celebrating.
You feel pretty good today, huh?

362
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,700
Look, Ricky,
early word out of NASCAR...

363
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,700
...is your little obscene gesture's
gonna cost you 1 00 points.

364
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,200
You know how much that costs us
in sponsorship dollars?

365
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,100
With all due respect, Mr. Dennit...

366
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,300
...I had no idea you had experimental
surgery to have your balls removed.

367
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,500
What did you say?
What was that?

368
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
Well, what?
I said, ''With all due respect.''

369
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,500
That doesn't mean you get to say
whatever you wanna say to me.

370
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
-lt sure as heck does.
-No, it doesn't.

371
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,200
It's in the Geneva Convention.
Look it up.

372
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,600
I remember your daddy
used to love it.

373
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,500
-This is not my dad-- This is my team--
-Used to love it when I used to win.

374
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Now, I suggest you and your wife,
Mrs. Jim Beam...

375
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,400
...you guys go take a chill pill.
Enjoy the win!

376
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
-Come on, man!
-Yeah, Ricky. Okay.

377
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,200
Baby, photo op, photo op.
Come on.

378
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
Come on, number one.

379
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Hold my hand, baby.

380
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll tell you what, though, guys,
that was a hell of a race today.

381
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,200
-Shake and Bake in full effect.
-It's always been like that.

382
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Me and Ricky,
since we were little kids, man.

383
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,500
We go together like Chinese food
and chocolate pudding. Let's face it.

384
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,300
Yeah, but those are two things
that don't really go together.

385
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,100
We go together
like cocaine and waffles.

386
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,000
No, like, for instance,
if I say peanut butter and....

387
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,500
-Ladies, right?
-Yep.

388
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,900
-No, jelly.
-Am I right?

389
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,200
-Jelly?
-You like to put jelly on a lady?

390
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm gonna settle this thing.
Let's just get ourselves...

391
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,300
...a whole mess of cocktails,
get drunk and work this thing out.

392
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
-Work this thing out.
-That's right.

393
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,100
So I was talking to Nana on Saturday,
and her birthday's coming up...

394
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,500
...but I don't know what to get her.
She's gonna be 88.

395
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,300
Get her a coffin.

396
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,200
Hey, Cal, I'm sorry
about wrecking you today.

397
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,300
-I mean, but that was for the team.
-No, that's cool. That's cool, I know.

398
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,900
I was thinking, though, one time...

399
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,700
...it would be really awesome if, like,
you could slingshot me in for a win.

400
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,400
Yeah, but-- Okay, but if you won...

401
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,000
-...how am I gonna win?
-Yeah.

402
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,700
-Think about it.
-No, I was thinking about it.

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,100
I mean, it's not like
you're finishing 1 8th.

404
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,200
-There's nothing wrong with silver.
-Nothing wrong with silver at all.

405
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
I'm just kidding you, man.
I don't wanna win.

406
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,500
I'll just bury it down inside.

407
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,400
Bury it deep down in there,
and never bring it up again.

408
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,900
It's painful, and I love you!

409
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,900
Get her a gigolo.

410
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,800
-What?
-A guy to have sex with her.

411
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,900
No, she's gonna be 88 and....

412
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,700
You don't stop liking sex
when you're old.

413
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Well, I was thinking
more along the line of....

414
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,900
-Like, she likes afghans and quilts.
-She's probably got a million of those.

415
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,100
How many dudes does she have
coming over to have sex with her?

416
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,400
-None.
-Exactly.

417
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Be thoughtful, Glenn.

418
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,700
Don't stop.

419
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,500
What is that?

420
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Someone made a tape of
something dying or something.

421
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Hey, turn that crap off.
What's going on?

422
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,400
I want this music out of my head.

423
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
Hey, turn that off!

424
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,600
Turn that off right now!

425
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,900
Why did you stop the jazz music?

426
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,900
Was it not pleasant for you?

427
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,000
No one plays jazz here
at The Pit Stop, okay?

428
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
So why is the song on the jukebox?

429
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
We keep it on there
for profiling purposes.

430
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,200
We also got
the Pet Shop Boys and Seal.

431
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,000
My name is Jean Girard...

432
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,700
...and I am a racing-car driver
just like you...

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
...except I am from Formula Un.

434
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,500
I am the greatest one
in the whole world.

435
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,100
I have been following your career
with great interest, Monsieur Bobby.

436
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,900
I can't understand a word
you've said the whole time.

437
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,900
Did you eat peanut butter
or something?

438
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,100
You sound like a dog with peanut butter
on the roof of your mouth.

439
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,800
I think what you are hearing
is my accent.

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
I am French.

441
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,200
You say you're French?

442
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,200
We? No, we are not French.

443
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,600
We're American,
because you're in America, okay?

444
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,300
Greatest country on the planet.

445
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,300
Well, what have you
given the world...

446
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,500
...apart from George Bush, Cheerios,
and the ThighMaster?

447
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,700
-Chinese food?
-Chinese food.

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
That's from China.

449
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,500
-Pizza.
-ltaly.

450
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,100
-Chimichanga.
-Mexican.

451
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,100
Really, smarty-pants?
What did French land give us?

452
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,400
We invented democracy,
existentialism...

453
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,900
...and the blowjob.

454
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,000
-Those are three pretty good things.
-Hey.

455
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,700
Well, that last one's pretty cool.

456
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,600
You know, the 69 with
the head near the-- That bit.

457
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,100
We came up with it.

458
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,600
We created the missionary position.

459
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,400
-You're welcome.
-Ricky Bobby...

460
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,700
...I have come here to defeat you.

461
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,700
Oh, well, there's strikes two and three
right there.

462
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,900
Did you hear what he just said?

463
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,400
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

464
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,500
You are fast, Ricky Bobby...

465
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,900
...but I am faster.

466
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,800
All right, you let go of me,
you Formula One jazz nutjob!

467
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,500
Like the frightened baby chipmunk...

468
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,500
...you are scared by anything
that is different.

469
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,100
I will let you go, Ricky...

470
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,500
...but first I want you to say:

471
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,400
''I love crepes.''

472
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Don't you say it, Ricky.
These colors don't run.

473
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,000
-I'm not gonna say it.
-Good.

474
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Hey, look, Frenchy,
I thought about it.

475
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,700
So why don't you go ahead
and break my arm?

476
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,100
I do not want to break your arm,
Monsieur Bobby...

477
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,800
...but I am a man of my word.

478
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Here's the deal.
He's not gonna break it...

479
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
...because I'm gonna slip
out of it right now. Houdini.

480
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Get down, you little pancake.

481
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,900
Someone get me a beer
while I'm here.

482
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
But you have forced me to do this.

483
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,200
You are now mocking me
and making me look ridiculous.

484
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
Just say, ''I love crepes.''

485
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,100
You know, just to put this in there, I had
a whole mess of crepes this morning.

486
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
They're like pancakes,
maybe even better.

487
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,200
-Are they the really thin pancakes?
-Yeah.

488
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
They are the really thin pancakes.
It's just a French word for them.

489
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,100
-My God, I love those.
-Put any syrups you want on them.

490
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,100
-I'm saying, think about it.
-They come with cheese sometimes?

491
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,000
Yes, of course,
a fromage-crepe.

492
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
Well, why didn't someone
yell that right away?

493
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,100
You know what's in
the crepe suzette?

494
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
-Oh, I love the crepe suzette.
-With the sugar...

495
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,100
-...and lemon juice, Grand Marnier.
-Sugar and lemon juice.

496
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,900
I wish I could crawI into
one of those right now.

497
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,700
-I'd eat my way out from the inside.
-They are tasty.

498
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,300
Either way this goes, could we
get some after we're done?

499
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,200
-Absolutely. We're gonna do that.
-So, what if you just said:

500
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,700
''I love really thin pancakes''?
That is a fair compromise, no?

501
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
-That is a fair compromise.
-Very fair, actually.

502
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,000
No! Because then everyone
would know I really meant crepes.

503
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,700
That's a pretty good compromise.

504
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,800
Why do you want me
to break your arm so badly?

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,100
You don't understand
because you don't understand liberty.

506
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
You don't understand freedom.

507
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,100
So you put a crack in my arm
like the crack in the Liberty Bell.

508
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
Hey. This is just
between you and me, okay?

509
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,600
I mean, forget all these other guys.

510
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,500
But he did give you a pretty
decent out. But it's your call.

511
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
What do you think?

512
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,100
-Don't say it.
-Yeah. I'm not gonna say it.

513
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,700
Break it, Pepe Le Pew.

514
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,300
As you wish.

515
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
-He actually did it!
-All right. You did it. Back off.

516
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,700
-I didn't say it!
-No, you did not.

517
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,300
Your injury is one
of ignorance and pride.

518
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Hold it right there,
Mr. Fancy Pants Foreigner.

519
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,800
You just broke my bro's arm.

520
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,500
Now you're about to get Tasered.

521
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,700
-Say hello to Dr. Watts.
-Get him, Cal.

522
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,100
I need you all to step away...

523
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,500
...from my driver.

524
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,700
The hell you talking about, ''my driver''?
What are you doing with a gun?

525
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,300
Don't you worry about my gun, Ricky.

526
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,400
Jean Girard is my new boy
at Dennit Racing. He's here to win us...

527
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,300
...an overall-points championship,
something you apparently...

528
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,300
...have no interest in.
He's gonna usher in a new era.

529
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,100
Mr. Dennit, with all due respect--

530
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,500
And remember,
I'm saying, ''with all due respect.''

531
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,200
--that idea ain't worth a velvet painting
of a whale and a dolphin getting it on.

532
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,500
That's good. That's good fun.
That's good fun, Ricky...

533
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,600
...but that doesn't bother me anymore
because Jean is the future...

534
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,100
...Ricky, the past.

535
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
So, Jean, introduce me
to your new teammates.

536
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Everybody,
this is my husband, Gregory.

537
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,200
What?

538
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,900
See you at the track.

539
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,000
Did he just say ''husband''?

540
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,600
Sweet Lord. Dennit hired a gay
Frenchman as your teammate.

541
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,200
The room's starting to spin reaI fast.

542
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,700
Because of gayness.

543
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,700
-Cal, I love you.
-Ricky? Ricky! Oh, God!

544
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,700
Fans and NASCAR, everyone is talking
about this new driver, Jean Girard.

545
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,300
Let's find out a little bit more about him
from our reporter, Davey Wesling.

546
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,200
Talented. Eccentric. Dominating.

547
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,900
These are the words
that define Jean Girard.

548
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,000
Before each race, Jean Girard spends
time with his world-class horses...

549
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,300
...who are also gay.

550
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
Jean's days are filled
with sun-drenched walks...

551
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
...with his beloved husband, Gregory.

552
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,000
Though Gregory is
no stay-at-home spouse.

553
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,100
He's a world-class trainer
of German shepherds.

554
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,500
Rolfe, the Nazi boyfriend.
Up on top!

555
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,100
Very nice. Very nice.

556
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,300
Only time will tell if Jean's foray
into NAS CAR...

557
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,600
...will end up in Victory Lane.

558
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,500
Well, kiss my ass on Sunday.

559
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,700
-Lucius, what the hell is going on?
-The man can drive.

560
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,700
And check out his crew chief
over there.

561
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
Won the Nobel Prize
for physics back in '93.

562
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a new track record.

563
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,200
As it stands now, Jean Girard is sitting
on the pole, which is, of course...

564
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,500
...a statement of fact
and in no way a comment...

565
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,500
...on the driver's sexuaI orientation.

566
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,500
Put a smile on your face?
That's the future of Dennit Racing.

567
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,200
-That make you happy?
-I'm just thrilled, Mr. Dennit.

568
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,300
I love seeing some French guy
break my record...

569
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,400
...while I got my arm wrapped up
like a fricking gordita.

570
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,100
Hello, Ricky Bobby.

571
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,600
What happened last week was
very regrettable and unfortunate...

572
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,400
...and, as a gesture, I would like to...

573
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,200
...sign your cast, please.

574
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
Hell, you know what,
get my car off the trailer, guys.

575
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Baby! That's my baby!

576
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,200
Hold on, Ricky. Ricky, Ricky, Rick.
What are you talking about?

577
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Look. I wanna drive. My arm's fine.
So let's get the car off the trailer.

578
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,100
Don't look at me.
Get it off the trailer!

579
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Even with a healthy arm, you don't
have a chance against Jean Girard.

580
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,600
All right, fellas. You heard the man.
Get the car off. Let's go.

581
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,300
You guys heard it.

582
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,100
-What's going on?
-Soon you will know what it is like...

583
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,800
...to be defeated by the hands of
somebody who is truly better than you.

584
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,400
As William Blake wrote,
''The cut worm forgives the plow.''

585
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,500
Well, let me just quote the late,
great Colonel Sanders...

586
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,200
...who said,
''I'm too drunk to taste this chicken.''

587
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,300
What's that got to do with this?

588
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,100
I got a message for all of them.
Ready? Shake and Bake!

589
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,900
What does that do? Does that
blow your mind? That just happened!

590
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,300
What is that, a catch phrase
or is that epilepsy?

591
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,100
-Shake and Bake. Shake and Bake.
-What?

592
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Listen, you better be carefuI because
tomorrow you're going to get beaten.

593
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,200
Beaten reaI bad, cowboy.

594
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,900
-Really?
-Yes!

595
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
-I don't want to know.
-That's news to me.

596
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,700
-Tomorrow you'll be in trouble.
-I'll rip you a new one.

597
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
There's going to be a croissant
I'm going to take away.

598
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,500
I play for keeps!

599
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,900
I give you one option,
Monsieur Bobby.

600
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
As a sign of humility,
if you kiss me on the lips now...

601
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,100
...I will return to Paris and you will
never see me again in NASCAR.

602
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,600
The answer is never!

603
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
-I close my--
-Do you hear me? Never ever!

604
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,300
-Well, yes or no?
-That's sick.

605
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,300
Let me tell you, hold on.
Shake and Bake.

606
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,600
Yeah!

607
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,600
What does that mean?
lt makes no sense!

608
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,500
This ''Shake and Bake,''
it's nonsense.

609
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,100
-Hey, baby. You guys are so smooth.
-Thanks, darling.

610
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Cal, you could say that 1 0,000 times
and it still wouldn't be enough.

611
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,700
-lt fires me up.
-I love it. Say it one more time.

612
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
-Shake and Bake!
-Doesn't that feel good?

613
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah! lt rhymes,
they're both verbs. It's awesome.

614
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,700
NAS CAR on Fox welcomes you
to Lowe's Motor Speedway...

615
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
...where tonight we'll go 500 miles.

616
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,900
The big stories tonight
are at both ends of the grid.

617
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Up front, Larry, the surprising French
Formula One driver, Jean Girard.

618
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,800
And at the opposite end of the grid,
Darrell, Ricky Bobby.

619
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,100
I saw Ricky Bobby last night walking
around with a cast on his arm.

620
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,300
Now, I don't know who he conned
into letting him start this race.

621
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,100
Just keep a camera on him
all night long.

622
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,300
I am so excited.

623
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,100
This is a new era
for Dennit Racing, huh?

624
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,100
So serious all the time
about your big race team.

625
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,800
-Who cares?
-But this is my life. This is my life.

626
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,500
You know what? There's only one
good thing about coming to the races...

627
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,500
...and that is
the vibrations from the cars.

628
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,600
Oh, I love when them cars whiz by.

629
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,300
Can feel the motor...

630
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,800
...running up my legs.

631
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,900
Ricky Bobby, who never met
a sponsor he wouldn't push...

632
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
...has a Fig Newton sticker
on his windshield.

633
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Think NAS CAR will
black-flag him for that.

634
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
He sold the windshield!

635
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,500
This sticker is dangerous and
inconvenient, but I love Fig Newtons.

636
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,200
Ricky Bobby started this race
in the back...

637
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,700
...but he's making no friends
on the way to the front.

638
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm all about getting to the front tonight,
Lucius. Let's go! Let's move it!

639
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,700
Well, he's driving
like a man possessed.

640
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,700
I'm not even sure he realizes how
much damage he's doing to his car.

641
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,900
Hey, Ricky. You know you're driving
like a pissed-off teenager, okay?

642
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,800
Where is that Frenchy?

643
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,000
I got you, Pepe Le Bitch.

644
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,300
Oh, Ricky Bobby.

645
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Hey, it's me, America.

646
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,800
Yeah, I'm here.

647
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,400
You have spilled my macchiato.

648
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
Look at Girard in the 55.

649
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,500
He's made that car three lanes wide,
but he's still fast.

650
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,400
No, no, no, my friend.
This way also closed. Not this way.

651
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,300
Lucius, what's he doing?
He's everywhere at once.

652
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Guy's dangerous, Ricky.
He's like a cobra. Back off!

653
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Where's Cal?
I need a little support here!

654
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,700
Tell Ricky I'm on my way.

655
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,900
Damn it!

656
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
Hey, Ricky, listen.

657
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,900
CaI blew out his engine.
You have no backup. Back off!

658
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I ain't backing off.
I'm Ricky Bobby, I'm the best there is.

659
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,100
He's too good, Ricky. Lay off!

660
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Bobby's boxed in.
There's nowhere to go there.

661
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,100
He's gonna try the outside move again.
I don't know if it's gonna work.

662
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,900
Come on, Daddy!

663
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
Come on, Daddy! Whoop his butt!

664
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,500
Send that weird man
back to lndonesia.

665
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,200
-Come on!
-Bobby moves to the outside.

666
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,200
Not a lot of room. He's in the wall!

667
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,500
Bobby is sliding,
slamming into the wall.

668
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,500
He's airborne!

669
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,100
Yep. I'm flying through the air.
This is not good.

670
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,900
-Ricky!
-Cool!

671
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,800
Ricky!

672
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,200
Peaches and cream!

673
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,300
The car comes to rest
in a big cloud of smoke.

674
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,400
Ricky Bobby appears to be okay...

675
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,100
...but that Wonder Bread car is toast.

676
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,000
Fantastic.

677
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,800
Oh, my God! Ricky!

678
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,100
Hakuna matata, bitches.

679
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,600
It's okay, guys, it's just a wreck.
Ricky can handle it.

680
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,200
Now, that's one of the nastiest wrecks
you'll ever see.

681
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,500
Oh, no, no, no.

682
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,700
It's all right. You're safe.

683
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,800
-You're safe.
-We got you. We're here.

684
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm on fire.

685
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,800
It's all right.
It's all right, you're not on fire!

686
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,800
-You're lying! I'm on fire!
-There is no fire.

687
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,500
-I'm on fire. I don't wanna die.
-Come back here.

688
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,300
But something looks wrong. I mean,
he's running around like he's on fire.

689
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,200
Oh, my God! Help me!
I don't wanna die! Stop, drop, and roll!

690
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,900
-You're not on fire, Ricky Bobby!
-I'm on fire!

691
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,500
You're not on fire.

692
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
But I'm not even sure he even knows
where he's at right now.

693
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,100
This makes us all realize the kind
of pressure these drivers are under.

694
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,700
Mr. Bobby, come on down here.

695
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,500
Help me, Jesus!
Help me, Jewish God!

696
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,300
Help me, Allah!

697
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,100
Help me, Tom Cruise!

698
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,800
But how did he get down
to his underwear that fast?

699
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,300
Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft on me
to get the fire off me!

700
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,700
Look. Here, help's coming.

701
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,700
-Wait a minute!
-It's CaI Naughton.

702
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,100
Oh, God! Please don't let
the invisible fire burn my friend!

703
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,700
I got you!
I got you, man! I'll help you!

704
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,700
He's jumping on Ricky, trying
to put the nonexistent fire out.

705
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,400
Now, that's a teammate right there.

706
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,200
This is going downhill fast.

707
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,200
lt would be a great time
to go to commerciaI break.

708
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,500
Help me, Oprah Winfrey!

709
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,300
You know, Larry, there's good days
in racing, and there's bad days.

710
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,800
Ricky Bobby just had himself
a bad day.

711
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,800
He's suffering from catatonic shock.

712
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,500
His injuries are minor, but right now he
can't deaI with the trauma of the wreck.

713
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,900
Golly, this is a hard decision.

714
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,000
But I have thought about it,
and I want the plug pulled.

715
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,500
Yeah.

716
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,000
Ma'am, your husband's not dying.

717
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,400
He's just taking a nap.

718
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,900
-Just look at him.
-No, I'm not lying.

719
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,300
I've never seen him
make that noise. Ever.

720
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,000
Got more plugs in him
than a Circuit City.

721
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,900
Oh, baby.
Mama loves you so much.

722
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,100
Hey, Ricky. It's me, Cal.

723
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,700
Just want you to know,
I got your back, bro. No matter what.

724
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,100
There's something
I want to get off my chest...

725
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
...and it's about that summer when
you went away to community college.

726
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,900
I got a offer to do PlaygirI magazine...

727
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,500
...and I did it.

728
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,900
I did a full spread
for PlaygirI magazine.

729
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,300
I mean spread, man.
I pulled my butt apart and stuff...

730
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,900
...and I was totally nude,
and it was weird.

731
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,800
You probably didn't hear about it...

732
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,200
...because I went under the name
of Mike Honcho.

733
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,100
But I just wanted you to know that.

734
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,100
lf you could hear me,
if it got into your brain somehow...

735
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,500
...that I spread my butt cheeks
as Mike Honcho.

736
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
''Are you there, God?
It's me, Margaret.

737
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,700
Gretchen, my friend, got her period.
I'm so jealous, God.

738
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,900
I hate myself for being so jealous,
but I am.

739
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,200
I wish you'd help me just a little.

740
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,000
Nancy's sure she's going to
get it soon too. And if I'm last....''

741
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,200
Hey, Ricky. Ricky!

742
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,400
Come on, man, wake up.

743
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
Are you faking it?

744
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,100
Are you faking it? Fake it!

745
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,100
I don't know how much longer
I can take seeing you like this.

746
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,700
I am not gonna let you die here...

747
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,900
...like some kind of vegetable.

748
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,300
I'm gonna put an end to this
right now.

749
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
Get all this crap off you.

750
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
You don't need any of this crap.

751
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,900
This is it. This is how it ends.

752
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,600
This is how Shake and Bake ends.

753
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,500
It's shadow time, buddy.

754
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,500
It's time to go home to Jesus.

755
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,300
Goodbye, buddy.

756
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,200
Oh, wow, you definitely--

757
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,800
You definitely
still got some fight in you.

758
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,300
Okay, maybe we give this
another day.

759
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,100
Middle. I'll go up to the middle.
Let's play some defense!

760
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,100
I just wanna say thanks, doc,
for taking care of our boy here.

761
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,500
-Oh, shit.
-That's a foul! That's a foul!

762
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,200
Doc, give it to me straight.

763
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,600
ls he ever gonna be able
to walk again?

764
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,700
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought someone
had told you. He's fine.

765
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,600
He found that wheelchair
in the hallway.

766
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,700
His paralysis is
entirely psychosomatic.

767
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,500
But we all need to go along with this,
because he's in a delicate state.

768
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,100
So when you say psychosomatic,
you mean, like...

769
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,900
...he could start a fire
with his thoughts?

770
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
No, not at all.
lt means it's all in his mind.

771
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm saying, sometimes you get a knock
on the head, you get speciaI powers.

772
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,500
lt happens all the time.
Read a comic book, okay?

773
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,300
Everyone's reaI friendly.

774
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
lt doesn't hurt being Ricky Bobby.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

775
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,100
So how's the physicaI therapy going?

776
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,200
Oh, I gave that up.
Yeah, I gave that up...

777
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,500
...after maybe the first day.
Within the first hour, I gave that up.

778
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,800
I'm through lying to myself,
you know?

779
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,400
It's time to be mature about this
and just face facts.

780
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,100
I bought myself
a hundred-thousand-dollar...

781
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
...handicap-accessible van...

782
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,500
...with the captain's chairs and the DVD
plasma screens in the back for the kids.

783
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,100
-You all paid up on that?
-Yeah. That's all paid in full.

784
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,300
It's parked out there.
And then the next thing I gotta do...

785
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
...is I just gotta have a sit-down
with Carley and just let her know...

786
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,700
...that it's okay for her to seek
the comfort of other men.

787
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,000
Because she's gotta run wild. You
can't keep something like that back.

788
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,500
Hold on, man. Hold....

789
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,000
-We gotta tell him.
-Now?

790
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,000
No, I don't care what the doctor said,
we gotta tell him now.

791
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,700
Ricky, the doctor told us...

792
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,700
...that we should let you work it out
in your own sweet time...

793
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,100
...but, Ricky, you can walk.

794
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,200
What did you just say?

795
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,400
He's telling you the truth, man.
It's all in your head.

796
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,100
You sick sons of bitches!

797
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,100
I mean, you walk in that door...

798
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,800
...on your two legs,
all fat and cocky...

799
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,500
...and looking at me in my chair,
and you tell me it's all in my head?

800
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I hope that both of you have sons.

801
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,900
Handsome, beautiful, articulate sons
who are talented and star athletes...

802
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,000
...and they have their legs
taken away!

803
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,100
I pray you know
that pain and that hurt.

804
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,500
Don't you put that eviI on me,
Ricky Bobby!

805
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,200
Don't you put that on us!
You are not paralyzed!

806
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,100
I am so paralyzed!

807
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,700
-No, no, no! No, he needs to know!
-Getting a little rough on him.

808
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,200
-He's always crying!
-Tough love, it is. Tough love.

809
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,300
- Wake up, idiot!
-You wanna know what I am?!

810
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,800
You wanna see what my life is?!

811
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Don't do it.

812
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,400
-You wanna see what's going on here?
-Don't you stick that knife in your leg.

813
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,700
-Man!
-Hold on, hold on.

814
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,300
-Hold on, now. Walk it off.
-Oh, that hurts.

815
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,700
-Oh, my--!
-Walk it off.

816
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,700
Stretch, stretch. Stretch it out.

817
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,300
Hey, man.
You can walk! You can walk!

818
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,200
I can walk!

819
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,300
-I think I touched a nerve.
-Right there.

820
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,200
All right, we got it, we got it.
Hold it right there.

821
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
Maybe don't touch it.

822
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,700
-Can you feel it?
-I can!

823
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,200
We'll use this knife to pry it out.
We'll pull it out.

824
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,100
-Now we got two in there.
-Just don't think about it.

825
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,500
-We're going down a bad path.
-Cut around the meat.

826
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,400
I'll cut right here.
Stretch it out.

827
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,900
Just take out a plug of meat.
Just like a deer.

828
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,900
We gotta wiggle it a little bit. That's it.
Can you feel that?

829
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,900
-Yeah, I feel that.
-You are back!

830
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,600
I love you guys!

831
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,000
Hey, I'm sorry, guys. I mean,
I hope your boys don't lose their legs.

832
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,300
-Thanks, buddy.
-So when do I get to drive again?

833
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Well, that's the thing. The doctor
said you suffered major trauma...

834
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,200
...and he thinks you should
take it slow for a while.

835
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,100
Yeah, so, I was thinking, like,
while you're resting up and stuff...

836
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,100
-...maybe you could let me win a few.
-Well, there you go.

837
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,100
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

838
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Yeah. I'm Ricky Bobby.
I mean, you know how I play it.

839
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,100
-Yeah.
-First or last, right, baby?

840
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,600
-Don't know what I was thinking.
-Besides...

841
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,700
...Dennit Jr. must be freaking out.
All the money he's losing?

842
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,400
Without me on the track?

843
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,900
I mean, I just laugh...

844
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,000
...thinking about him whining
all the time, bitching and moaning:

845
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,100
''Damn, I wish Ricky was here.''

846
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,900
You know what I mean?

847
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
What?

848
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,400
Frenchy can drive.

849
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,500
Oh, no.

850
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,100
Very good.

851
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,500
C'est la vie and que sera, sera.

852
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,800
lt looks like the NASCAR
has gone French.

853
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,700
Well, in other news, Ricky Bobby...

854
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,000
...is going to be running some test laps
this weekend at Rockingham...

855
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,400
...in an attempt to come back
from his grisly crash.

856
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,100
It's one of the hardest things
to do in racing.

857
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,000
To try to bounce back after
a devastating, violent wreck.

858
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,500
Ricky Bobby was traumatized
during the incident.

859
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,100
All right, baby.
Come on, now.

860
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,500
But today he gets to strap back into
a racecar for the first time since...

861
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,900
...to try to show he can still
get the job done.

862
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,300
-He's gonna be great. Yep.
-He's gonna be great, sure.

863
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,200
Would you stop staring at me like that,
Susan? I swear...

864
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,000
...you are the weirdest little girl
I've ever seen.

865
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,900
Okay, I'm really gonna open it up!

866
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,200
I missed you, Mama Speed.
Ricky Bobby's back.

867
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,100
Wait, how fast is he going?

868
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,800
Twenty-six miles an hour.

869
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,600
What were those things?
Were those the other cars?

870
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,600
Oh, God. So fast.

871
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,500
Go, baby! There you are.

872
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,500
Am I on fire? I'm on fire.

873
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
-No, no, you're not on fire.
-Stretch it out.

874
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,400
-It's okay, baby.
-Take it easy.

875
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,700
-Oh, God, I'm gonna get sick.
-Oh, God.

876
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,700
-Oh, he's in his underwear again.
-Ricky! Please put your clothes on.

877
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,100
He's in his underwear again.
Go get him, fellas.

878
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,600
Oh, Lord.

879
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,700
You know who's gonna be
number one at Dennit Racing?

880
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,300
-Not Ricky?
-I'm gonna windmill you.

881
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,200
Mr. CaI Naughton Jr.

882
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,100
-Come back at him. It's the only way.
-Who are you?

883
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,900
-Number one.
-No.

884
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,500
-Oh, yes, ma'am.
-Ricky! Come on, man!

885
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,300
It's embarrassing.

886
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,100
The ninjas are trying to get me.
The ninjas are trying to get me.

887
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,200
-Oh, my God.
-What happened?

888
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,700
What happened? He's done.
He's done.

889
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,400
That's what's happened.
It's over. He's finished.

890
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,200
What's gonna happen to me?

891
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,400
I feel like I was riding inside
an asteroid or a comet or something.

892
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Yeah, you were going fast.

893
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,000
-Look at that.
-What are we gonna do?

894
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,700
This is ugly.
This is bad for all of us. Look at that.

895
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,900
-I gotta go check on cuckoo bird.
-No, cuckoo's okay.

896
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,800
Why don't you get over there
and settle down Carley for me?

897
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,100
-Could you do that for me?
-Yes, sir.

898
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,700
There you go.

899
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,100
What began as a day
of hope and optimism...

900
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,500
...for Ricky Bobby and his race team
has ended here in sad disappointment.

901
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,000
There we go, boy.

902
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,100
-I lost all muscle control.
-Yeah, you did.

903
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,600
-He just lost his muscle controI is all.
-I lost my muscle control.

904
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,300
He's fine.
He just can't controI the muscles.

905
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,200
-Thanks for the lift, Hershell.
-Yeah, no problem.

906
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,300
Jenga!

907
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,600
I love you, Cal.

908
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,400
-Good one, kiddo.
-What the hell's going on?

909
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,800
Hey, Ricky, nice of you
to stop by for a visit.

910
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,800
What do you mean, a visit?
This is my house.

911
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,500
Baby...

912
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,900
...shoot. I'm so sorry.

913
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,200
I really--
I didn't want it to be this way.

914
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,900
Hey, what happened
to the family portrait?

915
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,800
You just crudely pasted
your face over mine.

916
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,900
We're getting married, Ricky.

917
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,500
And we're getting matching
leprechaun tattoos.

918
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,600
lsn't that cute?
With a little pot of gold.

919
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,100
ls this some kind of joke?
You guys putting me on?

920
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,100
I was gone three hours.
Dennit just fired me from the team.

921
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,300
Ricky, you and l...

922
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,200
...we both know that this marriage
has been over for a long, long time.

923
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,100
No! I honestly did not know that!

924
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,000
Ricky, you can't race no more.

925
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,100
I'm not going back to being poor
and dancing at the Wizard's Den.

926
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,100
You know, my old boyfriend Greg?

927
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,300
He still works there
and he was crazy.

928
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Baby, stop.

929
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,100
Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Just a second.
Let me make sure I got this straight.

930
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,800
Are you asking me for a divorce?

931
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,500
-Yay! Two Christmases!
-Yay! Two Christmases!

932
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,500
Cal?

933
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,600
How could you do this to me, man?

934
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,300
Ricky, your marriage was
a hollow shell.

935
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,200
lt was a cruel charade.

936
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,500
She just gave me the 41 1
on the whole deal.

937
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,200
And you know what else?
You never let me win one time.

938
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,700
I thought we had a good thing going.
Shake and Bake.

939
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,600
You're doing great.
You just keep it up. Keep it up.

940
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,800
And Mr. Dennit told me
that it's my time now.

941
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,100
-Oh, really?
-That Shake and Bake is dead.

942
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,700
And we just came up
with a new nickname.

943
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,300
-It's so good. It's so good.
-I got a new nickname.

944
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,400
The Magic Man.
Now you see me...

945
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,800
...now you don't.

946
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,300
That is the stupidest nickname
I've ever heard.

947
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,100
ls it, Ricky?

948
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,500
Because I think
you wish you thought of it.

949
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,200
All right. You got me.
That's an awesome nickname.

950
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,400
I've always had a lot of great ideas.

951
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,600
I also think I might design a car
that's in the shape of a rabbit.

952
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,400
lt might poop out little reaI rabbits out
the back that'll run around the track.

953
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,000
You have live rabbits
being pooped out onto a track?

954
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,900
lf I win, I might do a speciaI thing
with David Copperfield...

955
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,300
...where he hides in my car
in the passenger seat...

956
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,800
...and he just flings magic stuff
out the window.

957
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,900
Did you run any of this
by NASCAR?

958
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,700
Watch the maiI for that invitation to
the wedding, because I want you there.

959
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,200
-What?!
-I know it...

960
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,200
...that some bad stuff happened
just now, but in time--

961
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,200
The wedding's not for
a couple of weeks.

962
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,100
Why would I come
to your guys' wedding?

963
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,300
--you're gonna get over it
and be my best man.

964
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,000
I'm not gonna be your best man!

965
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,200
Baby, he's not gonna come
to the wedding.

966
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Cal, do you realize the implications
of your actions right now?

967
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,900
What's ''implication'' mean?

968
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,400
We are no longer friends.

969
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,300
-Why?
-What do you mean, ''Why?''

970
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,600
You're wrecking my life!

971
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,500
You just lost your wife.
You just lost your job.

972
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,300
Don't throw out your best friend
because of your anger.

973
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,100
-That's absolutely ridiculous, man.
-Ricky...

974
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,100
...remember, the field mouse is fast,
but the owI sees at night.

975
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,700
That's kind of creepy, ain't it?

976
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,300
-Hey, Ricky, I'll call you tomorrow.
-Shut up.

977
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,100
-Bye, kids. I'll see you next weekend.
-Bye.

978
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,400
Ricky! Boys! ls everything all right?

979
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,300
Mama, we got nowhere to go.
Carley and CaI took everything.

980
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
Well, you're home now,
and you got your mama.

981
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,900
Get in here, boys. Come on.

982
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,800
Come on. Get in this house.

983
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,900
Hey, Ricky. Are you on fire?

984
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,000
-Nice denim shorts, dude.
-Hey, shut up, man.

985
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,000
Hump me!

986
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,900
Now, you watch yourself.

987
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,300
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
I promise it won't happen again.

988
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,700
Hey, sorry, man.

989
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,100
Hey.

990
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,300
I lost my license.

991
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,600
That's why I'm on the bus.
I'm delivering pizzas.

992
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,100
Motherfucker,
what makes you think I care?

993
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,200
Shut the fuck up!

994
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,900
I was just telling you that because--

995
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,300
Like I said, I lost my license. I've
been having a lot of problems lately.

996
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,100
Problems? I don't wanna hear about
your damn problems.

997
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,900
Everybody got problems.

998
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,300
My mama got problems.
She just lost her leg.

999
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,100
My cousin Pookie just lost a testicle.
My dog threw up somebody's finger.

1000
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,900
That's a problem.

1001
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,000
I really regret opening my mouth
and talking to you.

1002
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,900
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Get out of the road!

1003
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,100
Hey, come on, man.
I'm on a bike. Relax.

1004
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,500
-Hey, shut up!
-ldiot!

1005
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,100
It's open.

1006
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,100
Hugalo's Pizza. We are pizza.

1007
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,200
-You are pizza?
-Yeah, we are pizza. I gotta say it.

1008
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,800
Either close the door or come in.
I got weed in here, cowboy.

1009
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,900
You got three pizzas that haven't
been eaten just sitting over there.

1010
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,800
I know. I've been calling them
all day trying to get you...

1011
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,300
...but they keep sending me
different delivery people.

1012
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,300
Trying to get me? Why?

1013
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,100
Because I'm your daddy, that's why.

1014
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,000
-What did you just say?
-I said, I'm your daddy.

1015
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,700
I'm Reese Bobby.

1016
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,700
Me and your mama did it in a Rustler
Steak House bathroom when I was 1 7.

1017
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,700
And then you showed up.

1018
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,300
Hey, son.

1019
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,900
-Son! Son, did this go good?
-No!

1020
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,100
-Seems to me like it went pretty good.
-You're not my dad.

1021
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,500
-lt got a little heated, but....
-Stop talking to me!

1022
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,800
Hey, is that a Huffy?
That's a nice-looking bike, boy.

1023
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,800
I can't believe it!

1024
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,200
I mean, he's been
blowing me off for 25 years...

1025
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,900
...and now he wants
to get to know me?

1026
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,000
How the hell did he even find me?

1027
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,400
I called him.

1028
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,500
Are you kidding me?
Mama, why did you go do that?

1029
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,400
Son, you need help.

1030
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,200
-I know he's a son of a bitch.
-He's scary.

1031
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,200
But you're a grown man.
You're delivering pizzas on a bike.

1032
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,100
How'd you even get hooked up
with him in the first place?

1033
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,100
You probably couldn't tell
by looking at him now...

1034
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,900
...but your daddy used to be
a reaI charmer.

1035
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,000
And that night in the ladies' room of
the Rustler Steak House, he chose me.

1036
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,800
-ln a ladies' room?
-Shut up in here! I'm trying to sleep!

1037
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,900
One of you turds is about
to get smacked in the mouth!

1038
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,400
Hey, stop yelling at me, okay?
I'm your dad. You're 7 years old.

1039
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,300
Don't talk like that.

1040
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,100
Hey. Hey there, Lucy.

1041
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,200
How you doing?

1042
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,100
Oh, hey there, Ricky. Look, son...

1043
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,300
...I know you don't
want me to be here...

1044
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,500
...but I saw what happened to you
on the television. You saw the fear.

1045
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,700
-I can help you with that, son.
-Really?

1046
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,100
What do you care about me or us?
You never even met your grandkids.

1047
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,500
-What are you looking at, Popeye?
-Shut up, you little pot-licker.

1048
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,100
I'll put you in a microwave.

1049
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,900
Now, you show me the DNA test...

1050
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,100
...and then maybe I'll say hello
to these swamp rats.

1051
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,000
You people shut the hell up! I got
a wife in an oxygen tent trying to sleep.

1052
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
You better shut up or I'll come
over there and rip a hole in that tent.

1053
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,700
Yeah, shut up, Frank!

1054
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,300
Go shave your balls,
you dusty old fart!

1055
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,000
Okay, I guess they are my grandkids.

1056
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,100
I know you, son. I know you well.

1057
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,600
You're just like me. Talladega's
coming up in a couple of weeks...

1058
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,500
-...and I know you wanna win that thing.
-No, I don't.

1059
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,800
Listen, Ricky.

1060
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,900
I'm 55 years old
and all I got to my name is a car...

1061
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,000
...and a duffle bag full of underwear,
and sweet, stinky weed.

1062
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,200
How much you selling that weed for,
old man?

1063
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,800
I know I screwed up
raising you as a boy...

1064
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,100
...but just let me help you as a man.

1065
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,800
-Do it, Dad. Get your balls back.
-Go fast again.

1066
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,100
Fine. I'll do it.

1067
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,500
-But I ain't calling you Daddy.
-Well, what you gonna call me?

1068
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,400
All right, Professor Dickweed.
What's the plan?

1069
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,700
Well, basically, what happened to you
is that you saw the fear.

1070
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,200
So before you can even think
about any reaI driving...

1071
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,200
...you gotta make friends with that fear.
So get in the car.

1072
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,700
What the hell?!
There's a goddamn cougar in the car!

1073
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I know there's a cougar,
I put it in there.

1074
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,200
You gotta learn to drive
with the fear.

1075
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,100
Ain't nothing more damn frightening
than driving with a cougar in the car.

1076
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,200
-God, where'd you get that thing?
-I trapped it.

1077
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,300
Been keeping it in my bathroom
at the motel, feeding it old pizza.

1078
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,800
-Now get back in that car, you hear me?
-No, I'm not getting in that car.

1079
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,800
Hey, listen to me. lf you're calm,
that wondrous big cat will be calm too.

1080
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,400
But if you're scared...

1081
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:10,200
...that beautifuI death machine
will do what God made it to do...

1082
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,100
...namely, eat you
with a smile on its face.

1083
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,300
God, he's just following me
wherever I go.

1084
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,000
Well, he's just looking at you.

1085
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,800
You're saying if I just calm down,
the cougar will be okay?

1086
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,300
-You got it.
-Damn it. Okay.

1087
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,300
Come on, son.
You can do it. Come on.

1088
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,100
Oh, come on.

1089
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,300
That's it.

1090
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,100
-And no sudden moves.
-Like, is this too fast? Oh, man. See?

1091
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,300
-That's a little quick.
-You see what he did?

1092
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,800
You gotta be a little more deliberate
in your movement.

1093
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,600
I'm just gonna get in there.
I'm just gonna grab the handle.

1094
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,300
I'm gonna get in and drive that car.
I'm gonna do it calm.

1095
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,100
-Calm. Piece of cake.
-I was just trying to stay calm.

1096
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,700
-Oh, man!
-Sometime today, son.

1097
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,300
Okay, here we go. I'm getting in.

1098
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,100
Oh, God, help me!

1099
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,600
-Ricky! ControI your heart rate.
-Oh, my God!

1100
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,200
Hey, Mama.

1101
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,700
Well, hey there, Ricky. How'd it go?

1102
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,300
Well, I was mauled by a cougar...

1103
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,700
...learned nothing about driving,
and my CrystaI Gayle shirt was ruined.

1104
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,700
But other than that, it went fine.

1105
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,100
Where are the boys at?

1106
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,800
I dropped them off at Sunday school
at my church about 1 0 minutes ago.

1107
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,100
Anarchy!

1108
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,500
-Anarchy! Anarchy!
-Anarchy!

1109
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,200
-There they are.
-What in tarnation?

1110
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,500
-Anarchy!
-I don't even know what that means...

1111
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,900
...but I love it!

1112
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,900
-What in the hell?
-That is it!

1113
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,800
That puts the lid right on the jar!

1114
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,900
-Mama! Mama!
-No, Ricky, no.

1115
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,500
I will not have my grandbabies
acting like shiftless, wild hobos.

1116
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,700
All right, now, you boys listen up,
and you listen good.

1117
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,300
Now, I am declaring Granny Law.

1118
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,300
And if you do not obey Granny Law...

1119
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,900
...I will paint your back porch red.

1120
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,300
Sorry, Granny,
but you're shit out of luck.

1121
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,900
We make the rules, not you.

1122
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,100
Hey!

1123
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,000
You're gonna break us
like wild horses, ain't you?

1124
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,300
It's the beginning of a new age.

1125
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Hey, Derek, it's Ricky.

1126
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,800
Just wondering
if you can ditch school...

1127
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,800
...and take over my shift
at the pizza place...

1128
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,200
...because I got strep throat.

1129
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,900
And it's bad. I don't wanna
give it to everyone else.

1130
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,300
So call me back.
You know the number.

1131
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,700
Hello.

1132
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,000
Hey, man. How's it going?
You wanna come over and party?

1133
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,600
Did you just say ''party''?

1134
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,300
You know what? No.
Because I still hate you, okay?

1135
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,600
-What are you so mad about?
-What do you think I'm mad about?

1136
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,100
Come on, man, that was last week.

1137
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,900
What about the time you ran over
my leg with a car?

1138
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,800
-I let that go that day.
-Yeah, I remember.

1139
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,800
Wind is kicking up.

1140
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,300
Are you in the hot tub?

1141
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
Answer me this:
When you're in spa mode...

1142
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,900
...how come the water level
drops in the spa?

1143
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,600
Are you pressing the buttons
in the back panel or in the kitchen?

1144
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,100
-I just started pressing stuff.
-Hey, don't press all those buttons.

1145
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,800
I'm getting bored. You wanna
come over and play G.l. Joes?

1146
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,600
I would love to. No!

1147
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,800
Come on. You know what?
Screw you, man.

1148
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,700
Ricky, man, you gotta
cross over the anger bridge.

1149
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,800
Come back to the friendship shore.

1150
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,600
-''Cross over the anger bridge''?
-Yeah, that's where you're at.

1151
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,500
You're stuck on an anger bridge.

1152
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,500
Can you not see why
I'm stuck on the anger bridge?

1153
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,200
Look, I don't know why I'm talking
to you, okay? What is it?

1154
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,800
They got bottomless nachos
at Bennigan's.

1155
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,700
God, a whole mess of nachos
sounds good right now.

1156
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,300
I don't have a car no more.
Can you come get me?

1157
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,200
I'll get you. Which one of your cars do
you miss the most? I'll bring that one.

1158
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
-I miss the Hummer.
-I'm coming in the Hummer.

1159
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,200
-Are you ready?
-Yeah. No, wait.

1160
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,900
Okay. Our friendship is done.
All right?

1161
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,100
-You hear?
-You wanna hang out in your house.

1162
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,300
-Come on.
-Screw you, dude. I'm hanging up.

1163
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,400
Okay, that's it. Bye.

1164
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,900
Oh, man, this is absolutely crazy.
I mean, this is borderline reckless.

1165
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,700
Don't you get it? You don't drive with
your eyes, you drive with your heart.

1166
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,800
This is just dumb.
I can't see a thing.

1167
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,900
You gotta feel the road.
You gotta let it live inside you.

1168
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,700
-Are you feeling anything now?
-I'm feeling a little bit.

1169
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
What do you feel?
Tell me what you're feeling.

1170
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,100
I'm feeling the worn wood
of the steering wheel.

1171
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,200
-Yeah. What else?
-A little bit of heat.

1172
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,700
That's you and the car
melded together.

1173
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,300
Yeah, now I'm really feeling it.
I feel like the car could drive itself.

1174
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,400
I bet it could. Start her up.

1175
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,600
I'm gonna start this car up.

1176
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,100
Attaboy. All right, son.

1177
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,100
Drive.

1178
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm embarrassed.
I really thought I could feel it.

1179
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,300
You know what? We better hightaiI it
out of here. Frank's gonna be pissed.

1180
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,200
All right.

1181
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,800
No, no, Ricky. No blindfold.

1182
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,200
Get this highway clean, come on.

1183
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,200
I gotta tell you, Granny, this blows.

1184
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,800
-How much more of this?
-I don't know.

1185
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,700
How many more times are you gonna
toss me the radio in the bathtub?

1186
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,500
-Hello?
-Hey, man. You up?

1187
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,100
-No.
-Wake up. I need to talk to you.

1188
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,000
I think your house is haunted.

1189
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,300
Hey, come on.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

1190
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,000
I can't sleep in here, man.
I'm scared.

1191
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,800
Look, there's nothing to be scared of.
It's a new house...

1192
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,300
...there's a lot of creaks and moans
and groans in it.

1193
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,400
-Put on-- You got your TV on?
-Well, yeah, I fell asleep with it on.

1194
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,400
-Turn on channel 42.
-Forty-two?

1195
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,900
-Look at them buns.
-Well, that is a set of buns.

1196
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,900
And down, and down, and--

1197
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,500
What's she doing exercising
at 2:30 in the morning?

1198
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,600
Oh, yeah, that's a really good point.

1199
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,200
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
Do you remember that I hate you?

1200
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,900
Hey, man, you know what
I was thinking?

1201
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,700
-You're lucky.
-I'm lucky?

1202
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,800
-How so?
-Well, check it out.

1203
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,600
I'm sitting here in this enormous
haunted mansion, can't sleep.

1204
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,100
You're hanging out at your mom's.
That's awesome.

1205
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,100
-That's, like, the opposite of awesome.
-Well, this is like a hotel room...

1206
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,000
...with someone else's junk in it.

1207
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,500
Okay, yeah, well, that someone else's
junk, that used to be my stuff.

1208
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,300
I'm just having a hard time, man.
I'm just calling up for some support.

1209
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,400
Do you--? Do you know
how crazy that sounds?

1210
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,300
-Hey, one more thing.
-Yeah?

1211
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,900
When you have the stereo on
at the same time as the TV...

1212
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,100
...how do you controI the volume
on the TV?

1213
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,000
Why do you want to listen to the TV
with the stereo on?

1214
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Because I like to party.

1215
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,100
Why am I still talking to you?

1216
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,100
Come on.
We were doing good there, man.

1217
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,400
I'm taking care of your house good.

1218
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,900
I keep snapping back into it.
It's like a trick you're pulling on me.

1219
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,200
-All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
-All right, man. Talk to you tomorrow.

1220
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Shit.

1221
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,100
Get out.

1222
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,100
Where did stock-car racing
come from?

1223
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,300
What?

1224
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,600
-Hey, stop doing that.
-How did stock-car racing get its start?

1225
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,500
Bootleggers in Prohibition had to have
cars fast enough to outrun the Feds...

1226
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,400
-...then they started racing each other.
-That's right.

1227
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,800
lf I was right, why'd you throw
another bucket on me?

1228
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,800
I filled up three. Now, there's nothing
like driving to avoid jail.

1229
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,600
Nothing hones your mind
and your instincts like necessity.

1230
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,100
So I taped a kilo of cocaine underneath
the car and called the boys in blue.

1231
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,100
Now, the way I figure it,
you got about two minutes...

1232
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,800
...before they show up
and you do five to 1 0.

1233
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,800
So, what's it gonna be?
Fear or prison?

1234
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,300
-What the hell are you talking about?
-ReaI simple, son.

1235
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,600
Cops are coming.

1236
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,900
There's a kilo of Colombian bam-bam
under the car. Time to be a man.

1237
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,100
-You got hair on your peaches or what?
-You're not kidding, are you? Man.

1238
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
You crazy creep!

1239
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,800
Come on, son.
What's it gonna be?

1240
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,700
Speed or jail?

1241
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,800
Grandpa, would you like
to take us fishing...

1242
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,300
...and tell us life lessons and stories
about your childhood?

1243
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,900
I got a better idea.

1244
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,900
Why don't you boys go dig a hole
and I'll get another beer?

1245
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Someone didn't love you enough
when you were little, did they?

1246
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,200
Good call.
Here, that's worth a nickel.

1247
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,500
Tragic.

1248
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,500
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch,
son of a bitch.

1249
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Oh, man. Oh, man!

1250
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,100
One-sixteen. One-sixteen!

1251
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,800
I'm going fast again!

1252
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,200
Pull over! Pull over!

1253
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,200
Pull over?
I'll pull over for you. How about this?

1254
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Where are you?

1255
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,700
Gotcha.

1256
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,000
''Feels good going fast, doesn't it?

1257
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,100
By the way, don't try and snort
these Lucky Charms. Reese.''

1258
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,700
Okay.

1259
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,200
Okay.

1260
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,200
There you go, little man.

1261
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,500
Hey, Ricky!

1262
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,100
How you doing?

1263
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,100
-Oh, Nana, not my prison shank.
-ln the can.

1264
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,900
There's your
mother-flipping driving test.

1265
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,000
Mr. Bobby, you are magnificent.

1266
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,900
Down, Karen! Get down!
Get down, Karen!

1267
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,800
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

1268
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,100
Well, son, you are looking good
behind that wheel.

1269
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:17,100
Thanks, Daddy. I gotta tell you,
I feel good. Heck, you know what?

1270
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,100
Let's go out tonight, you know,
the whole family.

1271
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,500
I'm talking about sitting down,
enjoying a gourmet meal...

1272
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,100
...at a place that's reaI special.

1273
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,500
-Hi. Those plates are hot. Enjoy.
-You got your own skillet.

1274
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,200
-Be back to check on you in a minute.
-Thank you.

1275
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,600
Oh, gooder than grits.

1276
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,200
Let us pray.

1277
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,900
Dear Lord baby Jesus...

1278
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,100
...lying there
in your little ghost manger...

1279
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,600
...just looking at your Baby Einstein
developmentaI videos...

1280
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,900
...learning about shapes
and colors and....

1281
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,500
We just have so much
to be thankfuI for.

1282
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,100
First off, my sons no longer act...

1283
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,400
-...like retarded gangbangers.
-Amen.

1284
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,200
Also, I got my balls back
behind the wheel of a car.

1285
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,400
And most importantly,
we thank you...

1286
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,600
...for bringing back our nasty,
delinquent, pot-dealing daddy to us.

1287
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,800
For he was lost,
but now he is found. Amen.

1288
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,200
-Amen.
-Amen.

1289
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,900
Son, that was lovely.

1290
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,900
-What a lovely meal.
-lt sure is.

1291
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,200
lt certainly does look delicious.

1292
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,500
I gotta tell you, this is about
a damn perfect evening right now.

1293
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,300
lt is, isn't it?

1294
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,500
You know what we should do?

1295
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,700
Every week, we should come back
to this Applebee's...

1296
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,200
...and sit at this table,
and have a family meal.

1297
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,700
-That's a great idea, Mama.
-And order the same stuff.

1298
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,900
-That would be great.
-And I would be delighted, Reese...

1299
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:42,100
...if you would accompany me to
ballroom dancing on Tuesday nights.

1300
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,200
-Tuesday night?
-It's a lot of fun.

1301
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,000
-I think you'd have a good time.
-How's everybody doing here?

1302
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,200
-Dolly, it's so good.
-Oh, it's really, really good.

1303
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,800
You know, I just--
I hate to be a pain, darling...

1304
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,300
...but I asked for no onions
on my Bourbon Steak.

1305
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,800
I am so sorry.
I thought you asked for onions--

1306
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,900
Okay, okay,
maybe don't interrupt me.

1307
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,200
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
-Yeah, well, I think you did mean to...

1308
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:12,300
...and I also think that you meant
to put the damn onions on my steak.

1309
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,500
-Okay, Reese.
-Grandfather...

1310
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,700
...can't we resolve
this conflict without anger?

1311
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,300
-I'm a veteran and a diabetic!
-Dad!

1312
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,500
-Dad! Why are you doing this?
-Applebee's has rats!

1313
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,900
I found a whole rat
in my Cobb salad!

1314
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,400
Dad, where are you going?

1315
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,900
Come on, frat boy, you wanna go?

1316
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,400
-What's going on, man?
-Ricky, let him go!

1317
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,100
-Things were going good, weren't they?
-That's exactly why I had to blow it up.

1318
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,200
I don't know what organ or bone
people have...

1319
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,300
...that makes them act right,
but I was born without it. I'm no good.

1320
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:50,000
All those races I won,
that was for you, you know that?

1321
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:54,900
I did just like you told me:
''lf you ain't first, you're last.''

1322
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,800
What the hell are you talking about?

1323
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,600
What you told me
that day at schooI for career day.

1324
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,100
You came in and you said,
''lf you ain't first, you're last.''

1325
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,900
Oh, hell, Ricky,
I was high when I said that.

1326
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,800
That doesn't make any sense at all.

1327
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,000
''You're first or last.'' You can
be second, you can be third, fourth.

1328
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,000
Hell, you can even be fifth.

1329
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,700
What are you talking about?
I lived my whole life based on that.

1330
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,100
Well, now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

1331
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,400
Well, that's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

1332
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,100
Good luck to you, son.

1333
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,600
Hey, Dad!

1334
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,400
Where are you going?

1335
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,300
Does it matter?

1336
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,800
Here we go.

1337
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,100
Hey, don't bump me.

1338
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,700
Oh, man, I'm flying.

1339
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,200
Game over. Come on, reset.

1340
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,100
Boy, you are a terrible driver, no?

1341
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,000
How'd you get on a video game
so fast?

1342
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,900
ls your name, by chance,
Ricky Bobby?

1343
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,200
Hey, screw you, man!
I got nothing because of you!

1344
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,500
-I hate you!
-Hey, Ricky.

1345
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,700
I am on fire. I am on fire.

1346
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,700
Susan?

1347
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,800
And so then I got a marketing
job with NASCAR.

1348
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,000
-Really?
-Yeah, it's great. It's great.

1349
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,800
Well, gosh, you look fantastic.

1350
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,400
-Thank you.
-I mean, you've always looked good.

1351
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,200
I mean, I'm just-- I'm happy for you.

1352
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,400
Thank you.

1353
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,300
But what about you?

1354
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,500
How have you been?
What have you been doing?

1355
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,400
Well, they want me to race at Talladega
next weekend, but I'm not gonna do it.

1356
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,200
Because I'm done.
I'm done with the racing, with driving.

1357
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,300
-Why would you do that?
-Because I've really moved on.

1358
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,900
I've sent in my application to
The ReaI World...

1359
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,500
...so I'm hoping to hear back.

1360
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,300
I'm putting a lot of my eggs into
that basket, the MTV basket.

1361
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,700
I'm also thinking about getting a gun
and dealing crack.

1362
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,700
Being a crack dealer, but not like
a mean crack dealer, but like a....

1363
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,000
You know, like a nice one.

1364
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,300
Just kind of friendly, like, ''Hey...

1365
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,700
...what's up, guys?
You want some crack?''

1366
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,200
I'm just waiting on those two things
to kind of flesh themselves out.

1367
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,300
You know what, Ricky?

1368
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,500
I have kept my mouth shut
for a really, really long time.

1369
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,200
And I just don't think that I can
keep it shut anymore.

1370
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,200
I just have to tell you that I think
you are making a big mistake.

1371
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,200
-Really?
-Yes.

1372
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,800
Why is it that you always fall
for people who leave you?

1373
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,900
Have you noticed that?

1374
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:19,200
Like Carley and your dad
and your sponsors.

1375
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,000
And you always have
to prove yourself. Wh--?

1376
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,300
Well, you gotta listen
to me here, okay?

1377
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:31,300
You gotta win to get love.
Everyone knows that.

1378
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,100
I mean, that's just life.

1379
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,200
Look at Don Shula,
legendary coach.

1380
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,700
Look at that Asian guy
who holds the world record...

1381
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,800
...for eating all those hot dogs
in a row.

1382
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,700
Look at Rue McClanahan
from The Golden Girls.

1383
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,900
All three people,
all great champions, all loved.

1384
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,600
Do you wanna know why I think
that you should race again?

1385
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,900
Sure. Why?

1386
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,100
Okay. It's because
it's what you love, Ricky.

1387
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,500
lt is who you were born to be.

1388
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:10,100
And here you sit, thinking.

1389
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:15,200
Well, Ricky Bobby is not a thinker.
Ricky Bobby is a driver.

1390
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,800
He is a doer.
And that's what you need to do.

1391
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,900
You don't need to think,
you need to drive.

1392
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,900
You need speed. You need to go out
there, and you need to rev your engine.

1393
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,200
You need to fire it up.

1394
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,100
You need to grab hold of the line
between speed and chaos...

1395
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,000
...and you need to wrestle it
to the ground like a demon cobra.

1396
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,000
And then, when that fear rises up
in your belly, you use it...

1397
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,100
...and you know that fear is powerful
because it has been there...

1398
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,200
...for billions of years! And it is good,
and you use it, and you ride it.

1399
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,300
You ride it like a skeleton horse
through the gates of hell...

1400
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,100
...and then you win! You win!

1401
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,000
You don't win for anybody else,
you win for you. You know why?

1402
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,300
Because a man takes what he wants,
he takes it all.

1403
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,100
And you're a man, aren't you?
Aren't you?

1404
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,100
Susan, I've never heard you
talk like that.

1405
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,500
Are we about to get it on?

1406
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,500
Because I'm as hard as a diamond
in an ice storm right now.

1407
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,300
-This is awesome.
-Yes, it is.

1408
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,400
-Are you climbing on the table now?
-Yes, sir.

1409
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,300
I can't believe this.

1410
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:28,300
This is like that Whitesnake video
where the girI crawls on....

1411
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,400
Yeah. Just like that.
What's her name?

1412
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,700
Tawny Kitaen. She's really good.

1413
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,900
-She's great.
-She's fantastic.

1414
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,600
Everyone, turn away.

1415
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,800
Things are gonna get crazy.
We're gonna make animaI noises.

1416
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,300
-Looks good, damn good.
-Yeah. That's good, guys.

1417
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,300
Yeah, Ricky, it's good to be back.

1418
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,100
-Talladega.
-Talladega.

1419
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,300
I missed you dudes.

1420
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,800
Even you too, Glenn.

1421
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:35,600
I didn't have a whole lot of money left,
but what I did I put into the car.

1422
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,700
We got some lower-end sponsors,
so it's nothing to shout about...

1423
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,100
...but at least we got
something to run in.

1424
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,600
Let's see what we got, guys.

1425
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,200
What are we looking at?
''Julio's thongs for men''?

1426
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,400
Come on, what kind of dude
wears a thong?

1427
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,600
Yeah, that's messed up.

1428
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,200
Perverts, you know?

1429
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,200
It's not the best car, but it'll move.

1430
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,200
Hold on, now, baby. Let's just see
what this thing's got under the hood.

1431
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,000
-There she is.
-Looks like the Pep Boys threw up.

1432
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,000
-Damn.
-Like I said, work in progress.

1433
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,800
All right, I tell you what we gotta do.
Since we got no corporate money...

1434
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,900
...we have to build this
engine ourselves.

1435
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,100
I want you to hit up every independent
driver out there for spare parts.

1436
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,300
Yeah, Lucius, that's crazy.

1437
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,800
Well, crazy is all we got
right now, okay? So do it.

1438
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Now, where you going?

1439
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,700
I wanna tell Gerard Depardieu
we're coming for him.

1440
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,500
There you go, baby. Give him hell.

1441
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,100
Get this engine built. Get it built.

1442
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,400
I have not finished.

1443
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:54,100
Monsieur Girard,
Ricky Bobby is here to see you.

1444
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,100
This is the one I was talking about,
Ricky Bobby.

1445
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,900
Thank you, Bacco. Go.

1446
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,000
You're a tough man to find.
You know that, buster?

1447
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,700
I prefer solitude
the day before a race.

1448
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,900
I am being so incredibly rude,
Monsieur Bobby.

1449
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,500
Let me introduce you
to my lunch guests.

1450
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,100
This is my dear old friend
Elvis Costello.

1451
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,000
DelightfuI to meet you, Mr. Robert.
I thought you were dead.

1452
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:27,700
And next to him is hip-hop artist,
poet and my brother-in-law, Mos Def.

1453
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,600
I like your driving style.
I'm more of a Tony Stewart man...

1454
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,300
...number 20 car, myself.

1455
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,500
How he gets into
those straightaways.

1456
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,200
Gets it in the paint. Get her done!

1457
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,200
And across from Monsieur Def...

1458
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,500
...is Breeze.

1459
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,900
Hey. You're Breeze or you're Breeze?
Which one of you is Breeze?

1460
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,500
Together we are Breeze.

1461
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,500
They are like twins,
born from different wombs.

1462
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,400
-Right.
-They are God's most...

1463
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,900
...beautifuI mistake.

1464
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,700
They do everything together.
Everything.

1465
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,200
They read the same books.

1466
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,300
They do Pilates together.

1467
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,700
They walk, talk, sleep...

1468
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,900
...even go make toilet.

1469
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,000
Okay, you're starting
to creep me out, man.

1470
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,700
A single plop.

1471
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,500
One single plop.

1472
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,100
I don't need to hear about
doing a toilet.

1473
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,900
You want more examples?

1474
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,100
-No, you listed like 8000.
-Less than that.

1475
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,200
-It's none of my business.
-More like...

1476
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,200
...I don't know, between five and 1 0.

1477
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,300
Look, I need to talk to you.

1478
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,200
Walk with me, Ricky Bobby.

1479
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,700
-You have a good lunch.
-Take care, man.

1480
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,500
-Goodbye, Ricky.
-Goodbye.

1481
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,600
Holding hands with a man
makes me terribly uncomfortable.

1482
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,900
lt is a sign of friendship
in many countries.

1483
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,800
Well, not in ours.

1484
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,600
There's nothing sexuaI about it.

1485
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,100
Please don't be worried at the fact
I have an erection.

1486
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,100
-lt has nothing to do with you.
-Hey, come on.

1487
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,200
Look. Here's the deal.
I came here to tell you one thing.

1488
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,100
All right?
Tomorrow, I'm coming for you.

1489
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,200
Do you know why I came to America,
Ricky Bobby?

1490
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,100
Public schools, health-care system,
giant water parks.

1491
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,400
I mean, the same reason
anyone comes to America.

1492
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,100
I came here for you to beat me.

1493
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,700
-What the hell are you talking about?
-My husband, Gregory, and l...

1494
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,700
...wish only for that
which every other couple wishes for:

1495
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,900
To tame Komodo dragons
in Sri Lanka...

1496
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,200
...and teach them
to perform Hamlet.

1497
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,900
But before I can do that....

1498
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,600
-That's dumb.
-It's not dumb.

1499
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,700
-lt is dumb.
-Why is it dumb?

1500
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,800
-I don't know.
-But before I can do that...

1501
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,100
...I must be beaten by a driver
who's truly better than me.

1502
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,800
So you're gonna lose to me
on purpose?

1503
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,700
-No.
-No?

1504
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,100
No!

1505
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,000
I will battle you with the entirety
of my heart.

1506
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,000
And you will probably lose.

1507
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,000
But maybe, just maybe...

1508
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,000
...you might challenge me.

1509
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,700
God needs the devil.

1510
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,900
The Beatles needed
the Rolling Stones.

1511
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,500
Even Diane Sawyer
needed Katie Couric.

1512
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,500
Will you be my Katie Couric?

1513
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,200
I feel like I'm in Highlander.

1514
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,900
What's the Highlander?

1515
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,200
It's a movie.

1516
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,300
-Any good?
-Very good.

1517
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
-lt won the Academy Award.
-Oh, for what?

1518
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:35,300
For best movie ever made.

1519
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,700
I just want you to know I came here
today to tell you one thing.

1520
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,700
That come race time tomorrow,
I'm coming for you, all right?

1521
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,800
-May God be with you.
-Yeah.

1522
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:48,100
Because although
today I am friendly...

1523
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:53,700
...tomorrow will be war!

1524
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,700
All right.

1525
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,600
Ladies and gentlemen, pull up a chair,
drop the kids off with their aunt...

1526
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,600
...and take the phone off the hook
because it's race day here...

1527
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,000
...at the Talladega Superspeedway.

1528
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
Hey, guys.

1529
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,500
-Why so down?
-Ricky...

1530
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,200
...we were up all night
working on the car.

1531
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
And then something happened.
There was a fire.

1532
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,200
Did you say ''fire''?

1533
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,800
Glenn is dead, Ricky.

1534
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:39,200
I mean,
he died last night in my arms...

1535
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,900
-...as I held him.
-Oh, man.

1536
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,700
He was so scared,
because you know how little he is.

1537
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,200
And death was coming for him,
and he stood there...

1538
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,900
...and with a tear coming out his eyes,
he said, ''Tell Ricky, win for me.''

1539
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,800
That's all that little bastard wanted,
was for you to win.

1540
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,200
I wish you could've seen him.

1541
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,100
I wish you could've felt
his little heart fluttering.

1542
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,600
Sweet Jesus.

1543
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,100
Poor Glenn.

1544
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:06,300
Hey, what the hell, man.
Hey, Glenn. Glenn!

1545
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,000
-I see you.
-Glenn, what did I say?

1546
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,800
-I said, ''Wait till after the race.''
-Was he crying?

1547
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,400
I'm sorry, Ricky. We were just trying to
give you a little extra motivation.

1548
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,400
Well, that is just sick, guys.

1549
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:24,600
It's okay, Susie.
I appreciate it, guys.

1550
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,300
Just trying to help out...

1551
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,200
...even though
it was weird and perverse.

1552
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,700
They're just trying to help, Ricky.
We're a team here.

1553
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,200
-I appreciate it.
-Let's see what's under the hood.

1554
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,400
All right, let's have a look.

1555
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,400
Hot dog. I mean, that's like looking up
Bridgette Wilson-Sampras' skirt.

1556
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,000
We were up all night working on it.
Like I said, a lot of teams gave parts.

1557
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,300
Nice work, guys.

1558
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:54,200
And your sponsors weren't doing
very much, so...

1559
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
...well, we repainted the car.

1560
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,700
Well, take a look. Come on, guys.

1561
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,800
Well, I like the cougar,
but what company is ''M.E.''?

1562
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,200
''Me'' is you...

1563
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,200
...because it's just you out there.

1564
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,300
We don't have
any corporate sponsors.

1565
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,500
We don't have
any fancy team owners.

1566
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,300
We have you...

1567
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,400
...and this car, and this cougar...

1568
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,500
...which symbolizes the fear
that you have overcome.

1569
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,500
It's all there for you.

1570
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,100
Ricky, this car is like your Excalibur,
the mighty sword King Arthur used...

1571
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,700
...to bring together
the Knights of the Round Table...

1572
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:37,600
...untiI Lancelot betrayed him by laying
with his queen, in the biblicaI sense.

1573
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,400
Okay, Glenn.

1574
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,700
Everything cooI that Susan said,
you wrecked it.

1575
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,600
Guys, let's go win ourselves
a race, all right?

1576
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,900
-There you go. Yeah!
-Right?

1577
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,400
Let's get out there and win a race.

1578
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,100
From Provence, France...

1579
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,900
...driver of the number 55
Perrier car...

1580
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,200
...Jean Girard.

1581
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,100
From West River, North Carolina...

1582
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,400
...driver of the number 47
Old Spice car...

1583
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:30,900
... CaI Naughton Jr.

1584
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,800
Hey, Carley.

1585
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,500
-Hey, Ricky.
-Carley! Hey, baby.

1586
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,100
Baby.

1587
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,100
Oh, hey, Ricky.

1588
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,100
Hey, man.
We missed you at the wedding.

1589
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:57,100
-You missed me at the wedding?
-Oh, man, it was so classy.

1590
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,800
We had a Styx cover band
and a nacho fountain.

1591
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Check it, it was a nacho fountain
with six kinds of cheese on it.

1592
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,300
-Liquid cheese? lt cascaded down?
-Yeah.

1593
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,700
-Are you serious?
-Amazing. Six different kinds.

1594
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,300
Swiss, Havarti.
What was the other one?

1595
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,700
-Gouda.
-Cheddar, Gouda.

1596
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,800
That's the greatest thing
I ever heard of.

1597
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,900
Bean buffet in front of it.
lt was awesome.

1598
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,300
Don't listen to him. And remember
one thing, he's the competition.

1599
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,300
You're not very focused right now.
I need you to focus.

1600
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,000
-Hey.
-What?

1601
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,300
-I'm the Magic Man now. Okay?
-Yeah, I know.

1602
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,500
So get ready for some tricks up
these sleeves, all right?

1603
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,100
Watch your buns, pal.

1604
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:35,100
Baby, that is reaI good talk.
Like we practiced last night.

1605
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:37,600
I got something to tell you,
you mangy piece of trash.

1606
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,400
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1607
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,100
I took you for granted, Cal, and you
were a really good friend to me...

1608
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,500
...and I never gave you your due.
lt was my fault.

1609
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,100
I'll tell you the truth.
I'm a little confused by your tactics.

1610
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:57,200
-Tactics?
-Yeah. I'm gonna keep acting tough...

1611
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,400
...untiI I figure it out. All right?

1612
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,900
See you on the track.

1613
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,400
-Come on, baby.
-I love you.

1614
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,200
I love you too. Come on.

1615
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,400
Abracadabra, homes.

1616
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,200
Hi, Bill Weber, along with
Wally Dallenbach and Benny Parsons.

1617
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:19,200
Thanks for having us. Today,
Talladega, NASCAR's biggest track...

1618
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,200
...where the big concern
is the big wreck.

1619
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,400
And it's not if it happens,
it's where and when.

1620
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,800
We have a guy in the race today
that'll probably cause it, Ricky Bobby.

1621
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,100
Starting in the rear of the field,
underfunded...

1622
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,800
...and the last time we saw him,
he caused a big crash.

1623
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,400
A lot of big stories and some
big questions here at Talladega.

1624
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,400
All right, go get them.

1625
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,400
You must decide, Ricky Bobby.

1626
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,300
ls it foolish pride,
or is it greatness for you?

1627
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,200
-Hey, Jarvis!
-Go ahead, Cal.

1628
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,600
lf you slept with
your best friend's wife...

1629
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,400
-...why would he apologize to you?
-Yeah, I know. That's weird.

1630
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:32,300
That's what I'm saying.
My head's all tied up like a pretzel.

1631
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,100
I got a pretzel in my head.

1632
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,400
-Ricky!
-Come on, Dad!

1633
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,200
I've got some big investors
coming by.

1634
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,300
These guys are
big-money power players.

1635
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:14,700
lf things go right, they could have us
owning half the cars in NASCAR.

1636
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,700
So I want you--
No, I want you to behave.

1637
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,200
-Oh, really?
-Quiet.

1638
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,600
Should I not tell them
after 1 4 years of marriage...

1639
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,900
...you're still afraid
to let me see you naked?

1640
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,100
That's not a fear thing,
it's a trust thing.

1641
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,500
Hey! I was wondering
where you guys got off to.

1642
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,900
Baby, this is Ted Beamen
from Halliburton.

1643
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,200
-Nice to meet you.
-Over here...

1644
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,200
...is Dick Tangfield
from Dynacorp.

1645
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,200
-Back there is....
-You have beautifuI teeth.

1646
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,300
Yes, he does.
Get yourselves down there.

1647
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,100
-Adorable.
-Make yourselves at home...

1648
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,700
-...grab something to eat, over here....
-Sweetheart, sweetheart.

1649
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,300
You're a sweetie pie.

1650
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,200
She's very affectionate.
She suffered a recent loss--

1651
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,800
You taste good too.

1652
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,900
--so she's a little emotional.

1653
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,100
Okay, that's fine. Go ahead, find a seat.
Can we get these guys something?

1654
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:01,800
Jean Girard started from the pole
and is out to a big lead.

1655
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,300
As you know, Bill,
he's been doing that all year.

1656
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,400
Where are you, Ricky Bobby?
Come face your destroyer!

1657
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,200
''Come face your destroyer''?
Listen to how I sound.

1658
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,100
I sound like a massive prick.

1659
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,900
Come on, baby! Yeah, that's it.

1660
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,000
All right, Lucius.
Time to let the cougar loose.

1661
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,100
Here we go, boys.

1662
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:37,300
Ricky Bobby, in the 6 2 car,
on the move.

1663
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,700
He's gone from 26th to 1 8th place.

1664
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,500
Now let's go to John Hannafin, in the
stands with a country-music legend.

1665
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,000
Thank you, Sean. I'm here with one
of the greatest country-music stars...

1666
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,900
...of all time, Kenny Rogers.

1667
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,100
-What do you think of the race so far?
-It's good. They're going really fast.

1668
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,300
John, that's not Kenny Rogers.

1669
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,100
ln the song ''The Gambler,''
you sang:

1670
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:01,300
''You gotta know when to walk away
and know when to run.''

1671
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,100
Should Ricky Bobby have
stayed away from racing?

1672
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:09,300
Mr. Bobby's very competitive.
lf he wants to race, he should race.

1673
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,500
Well, this is John Hannafin with Kenny
Rogers. And now back to you, Bill.

1674
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,600
Well, that, of course,
was not Kenny Rogers.

1675
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:16,800
Not even close.

1676
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:20,000
Ricky, you've got Brian Wavecrest...

1677
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,600
...the guy that replaced you
at Dennit, dead ahead.

1678
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,500
Bobby working really hard to pass
the Wonder Bread car.

1679
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,500
That's his old ride, of course.

1680
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,400
We've passed the halfway mark
with Ricky Bobby...

1681
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,700
...now three car lengths
behind the leader.

1682
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,100
Maybe subconsciously
you slept with Ricky's wife...

1683
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,000
...as a way of getting back at him...

1684
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,000
...for making you
come in second all those years.

1685
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:52,300
I know one thing, Carley was definitely
unconscious every time we had sex.

1686
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:56,300
Lucius, I got CaI Naughton
dead ahead of me.

1687
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,300
Hey, Cal, you should pay attention.
I think he's passing you.

1688
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,700
ls Ricky passing me
in my subconscious?

1689
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,800
No, he's actually passing you.
That's happening right now.

1690
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,500
Go, Ricky! Go!

1691
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,200
Let's go back to our
John Hannafin...

1692
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,000
...who's in the stands
with an NBA legend, Larry Bird.

1693
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:18,600
Folks, I'm here with one of the great
NBA superstars...

1694
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,500
...a reaI legend, Larry Bird.

1695
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:23,900
I almost didn't recognize you with
the sunglasses. What are you up to?

1696
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,700
Come on, John, pay attention.

1697
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,100
I'm concerned.
He might have had a stroke.

1698
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,800
Didn't Ricky Bobby used to
drive for you?

1699
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:33,000
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-He's doing quite well.

1700
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Richard!

1701
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,400
Get CaI Naughton's crew chief
on the radio right away.

1702
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:45,200
I believe you have some tickets waiting
for me. My name's Reese Bobby.

1703
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:47,100
Reese Bobby.

1704
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:52,200
Mister, these tickets have been waiting
for you for a long time.

1705
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,500
Who needs two? I got tickets!

1706
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,900
Tickets, right here, 60 bucks a pop.

1707
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:15,200
All right, Girard, I found you.
Now let's see where this goes.

1708
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,300
Bobby's gotten around Naughton...

1709
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:21,000
...and now he's right behind Girard,
but Girard's gonna block the track.

1710
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,300
Man, he's scary good.

1711
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:25,500
Ah, Ricky Bobby.

1712
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:30,200
Now we shall dance,
and yes, it will be a slow jam.

1713
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,900
Damn it. Come on, man.

1714
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,300
I was wrong about you, Ricky Bobby.

1715
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,800
You are not the one to defeat me.

1716
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,000
I can't get around him, man.

1717
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,600
You tell CaI Naughton
to take Ricky Bobby out.

1718
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:02,900
Hey, Cal, listen. I hate to add
to your tremendous moraI confusion...

1719
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,400
...but I just heard from Dennit.

1720
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:07,700
He said to take Ricky Bobby
out of the race or you're fired, buddy.

1721
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,300
What are you talking about?

1722
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:13,100
Tell him if he doesn't do it, he's done.
That's right, he'll be driving a tour bus.

1723
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,900
Well, you tell Mr. Dennit that
Ricky Bobby is my best friend.

1724
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,900
-And it's Shake and Bake time.
-Cal, I don't like the way...

1725
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:24,500
-...you're talking out there.
-Damn the torpedoes!

1726
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,700
Come on, man, slingshot it.
Slingshot, come on.

1727
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:40,100
I can't believe it.
lf it isn't Mike Honcho himself.

1728
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,800
Shake and Bake, buddy!

1729
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,900
Shake it before you bake it.

1730
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,300
Here I come. Slingshot engaged.

1731
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,100
Yeah!

1732
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,300
I love you, Cal!

1733
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,300
-What are you doing?
-Can't believe it. Now I've seen it all.

1734
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,300
CaI Naughton from Dennit Racing just
helped a rivaI driver pass a teammate.

1735
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:09,600
Darrell, you tell Brian Wavecrest
to take out CaI Naughton right now.

1736
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,100
Right now, you do it. You do it!

1737
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,100
Yes, sir.

1738
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,900
And the 26 car just ran Naughton
into the wall.

1739
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,400
Oh, man.

1740
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,300
Damn you, Wavecrest!

1741
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,900
The entire field was in that wreck,
and we've only got six laps to go.

1742
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Only Ricky Bobby and Jean Girard
got away clean.

1743
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,200
It's just Jean and Ricky.

1744
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:05,200
And now the matador shall dance
with the blind shoemaker.

1745
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:10,300
Race officials have completed
an extensive cleanup of the track.

1746
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,200
We're ready to get back to racing.

1747
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:15,700
The 200,000 fans are on their feet,
and the green flag is in the air.

1748
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,500
Bobby and Girard are
dueling each other for the lead.

1749
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,100
No one seems to have the edge.

1750
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,300
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go!

1751
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the finaI lap.

1752
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,200
By the way, Ricky,
I watched the Highlander movie.

1753
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:43,900
lt was shit.

1754
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:48,100
Hang on, baby Jesus,
this is gonna get bumpy.

1755
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I've seen a lot of big crashes
at Talladega...

1756
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,100
...but this is the longest one
I've ever seen.

1757
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:22,100
Let's take a quick commerciaI break
and we'll be right back.

1758
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,200
Hungry for both steak and shrimp?

1759
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,900
Welcome back to Talladega,
where the long one continues.

1760
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,200
No, no! Jean Girard and Ricky Bobby
have wrecked in the last lap...

1761
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,200
...on the straightaway.
What a shame.

1762
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,200
Oh, God.

1763
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:56,200
lt looks like neither Girard or Bobby
will finish this race.

1764
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:59,500
We'd like to thank you for joining us
for NBC's coverage of NAS CAR.

1765
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:02,700
Coming up next,
it's lce Dancing to the Hits of Motown.

1766
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:25,100
Wait a minute, there's something
going on on the track down there.

1767
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,600
Oh, my God,
they're racing each other on foot.

1768
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,100
These men will not quit.

1769
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,500
Go! Go!

1770
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,800
Ricky, Ricky. He's going,
he's going, he's going. Look!

1771
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,100
He did it!

1772
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,800
Well, I'll be damned.

1773
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
Good for you, Ricky Bobby.

1774
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,300
Yeah! Yeah!

1775
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,900
Ricky Bobby wins!

1776
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:40,600
You'll never see anything like that
in a hundred lifetimes.

1777
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,400
lt was completely illegaI and in no way
will count, but that was something.

1778
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:47,100
lt was. That was really good.

1779
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,300
Monsieur Bobby,
by defeating me today...

1780
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:55,900
...you have set me free.

1781
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,500
And for that, I thank you.

1782
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:04,100
I will never shake your hand, ever.

1783
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,200
But I will give you this.

1784
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:34,300
Sir, you taste of America.

1785
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,500
Thank you.

1786
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,600
No, once was good. Once was good.

1787
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,000
Boy, that Halliburton.
Halliburton's taken off, haven't they?

1788
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,500
Yeah, yeah, we're doing well.

1789
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,400
Now there's some stock
I'd like to get my hands on.

1790
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:59,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
NASCAR fans...

1791
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:02,400
...your eyes on Talladega's
famed Victory Lane...

1792
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,500
...as we get ready
for trophy time here...

1793
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:07,900
...following an exciting running
of the Talladega 500.

1794
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,300
First, a very brief explanation.

1795
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:15,100
Because the drivers that finished
first and second got out of their cars...

1796
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,700
...they have officially
been disqualified.

1797
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,600
So now the winner, he was third,
he's now number one:

1798
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,700
CaI Naughton Jr.!

1799
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,500
Yeah, come on, guys!

1800
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,200
-Give me that thing.
-Cal, you're number one!

1801
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,900
I've been waiting a long time for you
to say my name, man.

1802
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:40,100
I know it's a technicality,
but I tell you what...

1803
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:43,600
...you try to take this away from me,
I'll sock you in the face.

1804
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:45,600
Ricky.

1805
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,500
Give me that thing.

1806
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:53,500
I can't believe it. I can't believe it!

1807
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:57,100
-Cal!
-Put me down.

1808
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,900
I'm proud of you!

1809
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:02,600
Get up here, man.
No, you come up here.

1810
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,100
You come up here.

1811
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,800
-CaI Naughton! CaI Naughton.
-Oh, my God.

1812
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:12,900
For this to happen....
Am I dead, man?

1813
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,300
You won the Talladega 500,
all right?

1814
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,300
I owe you an apology.

1815
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,200
-Come on.
-Man, I'm sorry about Carley.

1816
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,300
She walked straight up to me
and grabbed me in the crotch.

1817
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:28,100
-It's like a tractor beam of hotness.
-I know.

1818
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,300
Shake and Bake?

1819
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:35,900
No. Never again.

1820
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:41,900
You're right.
I was a totaI dick, man.

1821
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:44,400
From now on...

1822
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,900
...it's Magic Man...

1823
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:49,500
...and EI Diablo.

1824
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,200
What's ''Diablo'' mean?

1825
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,700
It's like, you know....

1826
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:56,100
It's like Spanish for,
like, a fighting chicken.

1827
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,700
-That's awesome.
-I know.

1828
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:01,000
-With the claws.
-With the claws and the beak.

1829
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:02,500
Where did you think of that?

1830
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,300
You just-- Sometimes things click.

1831
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:07,400
-I love you, bro.
-I love you too.

1832
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,900
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

1833
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:17,200
Excuse me, guys. Nice job.

1834
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,700
Hey, Ricky.

1835
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:20,400
Hey, Carley.

1836
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:24,300
I've decided I can love you again.
You're a winner.

1837
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:27,200
-Yeah, I don't think so.
-Really?

1838
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:32,300
Are you prepared to walk away
from these pearls...

1839
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,900
...of delight?

1840
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,000
Well.... Yeah, this is tough.
How would it work?

1841
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,900
-Would CaI move out?
-Yep, gone.

1842
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,100
Kids move back in?

1843
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,500
-Can I just have a little refresher?
-Of course, baby.

1844
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,100
This is why you fell in love,
don't forget.

1845
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,500
Yeah, I'm in.
I'm moving in right now.

1846
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:58,600
I'll drive 1 00 miles an hour
to your house.

1847
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,500
-Our house. Our house.
-Our house, yeah.

1848
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,100
No, I'm not. Come on.
It's gonna be awkward.

1849
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,800
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

1850
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,700
Wait a minute.

1851
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,200
You are ready to walk away...

1852
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:16,000
...from FHM magazine's
number seven hottest ass...

1853
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:20,000
...for the girI who forgets
to get your dry cleaning?

1854
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:21,600
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1855
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,500
-Yeah.
-Good luck, weirdoes.

1856
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,500
-Carley, come back here.
-Yes, Susie Q?

1857
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:29,700
There's something I've wanted
to tell you for a really long time.

1858
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,200
Thank you. Maybe one together?

1859
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:38,100
-Susie Q, are those real?
-Yeah.

1860
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:41,200
Well, girl, you got some game.

1861
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,100
-We'll see you on down the road.
-Yeah.

1862
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,100
-You seen Cal?
-He's somewhere around here.

1863
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:50,200
Hey, Cal! Baby, I'm coming.
Thanks, baby.

1864
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,900
-Maybe one more?
-Oh, boys.

1865
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,500
-She's crazy.
-Oh, thank you.

1866
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:57,300
-You did good.
-Thanks, Mama.

1867
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,100
He's amazing.

1868
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,200
That was one heck of a day,
I gotta say.

1869
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,200
That's some nice driving there,
cowboy.

1870
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,200
-Hey, Daddy.
-Well, hello, Reese.

1871
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:12,100
Well, if it isn't our old
mangy, transient grandfather.

1872
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:15,200
Well said, grandson.
Take that as a compliment.

1873
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:18,400
Hey, Ricky,
let me ask you a question.

1874
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,200
Who did you win that race for?

1875
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,400
Well, I sure as hell didn't
win it for you.

1876
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:27,500
I like hearing that.

1877
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,200
I guess if I really gotta think about it...

1878
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,200
...I just went out there and drove.

1879
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,700
And knew that no matter
what happened...

1880
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:42,900
...my boys, my mama,
and my lady would love me.

1881
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:47,200
Hi, I'm his lady, I'm Susan.

1882
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:50,100
I painted the car, l....
We had sex.

1883
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,100
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

1884
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,300
Well, I wish I could've
been there for that.

1885
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,100
Son, I'm proud of you.

1886
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:03,000
Yep. Yeah, I think....
I guess things are...

1887
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,100
...just pretty much perfect right now.

1888
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
It's making me a little itchy.

1889
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,100
Well, what do you say
we get thrown out of an Applebee's?

1890
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,800
-That sound like a good idea?
-You read my mind, son.

1891
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:20,500
-You can cuss at Applebee's.
-Everybody pile in.

1892
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,500
How does one get thrown out
of Applebee's?

1893
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:25,100
-You're about to find out.
-Okay.

1894
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:27,300
Watch, the doors actually open.

1895
01:52:58,700 --> 01:53:01,100
-Hey, I'm Ricky Bobby.
-And I'm CaI Naughton Jr.

1896
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,700
We just want to take a moment to talk
to you about snow blindness in cats.

1897
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,100
It's affecting more and more cats
every year.

1898
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:10,000
And it scares the living shit out of us.

1899
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:14,100
Ninety-eight percent of us will die
at some point in our lives.

1900
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:17,200
The darkness is creeping towards you,
whether you know it or not.

1901
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,900
A little planning can go a long way.

1902
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,100
Listen, leaving
your big old corpse behind...

1903
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,300
...for your loved ones to deaI with
ain't cool.

1904
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:26,000
That's why you should call
McCreedy FuneraI Service.

1905
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:30,000
McCreedy's.
They'll find the hole and build the box.

1906
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:33,500
Bodies that look so good,
you're gonna wanna talk to it.

1907
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,300
We like to have a lot of laughs
on the racetrack...

1908
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,900
...but today we wanna talk
about something serious:

1909
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:46,100
Packs of stray dogs that control
most of the major cities.

1910
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:52,300
That's packs of wild, vicious dogs
that are controlling most of....

1911
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,300
Sorry.

1912
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:56,900
I like to picture Jesus
like a mischievous badger.

1913
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,200
Like a muscular trapeze artist.

1914
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:02,800
Like a shapeshifter or a changeling,
like that guy.

1915
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,600
You ever hear of
that TV show Manimal?

1916
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,900
I like to think of Jesus
as a figure skater...

1917
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,800
...who wears, like, a white outfit...

1918
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,400
...and he does interpretive ice dances
of my life's journey.

1919
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,600
Like a dirty old bum.

1920
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,100
He comes up to me, I'm about to sock
him one because he's a dirty old bum.

1921
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,700
Then I said, ''Wait a minute,
I better not sock this guy.

1922
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,300
Something speciaI about him.''

1923
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:25,700
-Yeah, and it turns out it's Jesus.
-Yeah.

1924
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,100
One, two.... Oh, God.

1925
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,800
-Not again! No go. No go!
-It's stuck. It's stuck.

1926
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,900
We got two knives in my leg.

1927
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,400
I know, but one is a safety knife.
One is a safety.

1928
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:41,300
It's coming out.
It's coming out.

1929
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:42,800
I'm choking on my own spit.

1930
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:45,500
lt hurts so bad
I'm choking on my own spit.

1931
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:48,100
Good night, guys.
I'm losing a lot of blood.

1932
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,100
-Just relax, man.
-Good night.

1933
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,000
Ricky! Wake--

1934
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:59,600
Sometimes, when it's late at night,
I dress up like Donna Summers.

1935
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:04,400
You know, I put on the skirt
and the four-inch heels, man.

1936
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,100
I love it.

1937
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,600
Sorry. Sorry.

1938
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:22,500
I would be honored if you would
let me sign your cast.

1939
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,100
And I would be honored
if you'd sign my balls.

1940
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,900
-Oh, baby, that is a good one.
-Hey, what are you doing?

1941
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,700
''Don't touch a one of them.
They're mine.''

1942
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:54,200
So, what do you think
that story was about?

1943
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:57,200
Doesn't the bear symbolize
the old South...

1944
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:01,500
...and the new dog, the encroaching
industrialization of the North?

1945
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,700
Duh. But the question is, should
the reader feel relief or sadness...

1946
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:08,500
...at the passing of the old South?

1947
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,300
Well, how about both?

1948
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:13,500
Oh, I get it. Moral ambiguity.

1949
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:18,200
The hallmark of all early
20th-century American fiction.

1950
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:21,300
-Great analysis, Walker.
-Thank you.
