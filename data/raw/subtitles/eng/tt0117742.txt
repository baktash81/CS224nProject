1
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:08,861
(calming music)

2
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:28,465
- [Voiceover] There are but
a handful of individuals

3
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:30,850
in this world whom I would
consider to have been touched

4
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,754
by whomever does the touching.

5
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:37,369
Albert Einstein, Thomas
Jefferson, Sir Isaac Newton,

6
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:40,415
and Joseph Patrick Finley,
sometimes known as "Cy,"

7
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,170
after the late, great Cy Young.

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,590
Who is Joseph Patrick Finley, you wonder,

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,961
besides the son of Doctors
Archibald and Catherine Finley,

10
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,929
besides the finest friend
a friend could have?

11
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,976
Nobody special, at least not in his eyes,

12
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:59,153
which is good in one way and
a problem in many others.

13
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:02,570
Suffice it to say, his is a curious case.

14
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:06,002
(banging)

15
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:19,255
(grunts)

16
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:21,952
(laughs)

17
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:24,369
- Watch your step, cockroach.

18
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,016
(inspirational music)

19
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,048
(whoops)

20
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,146
- 15, 16, 17, 18.

21
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:33,231
56, 57,

22
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:35,856
58, 59, 60.

23
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,098
Sixty feet, six inches.

24
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,899
- Man, I was doing 120, easy.

25
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,086
Easy.

26
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,214
Man, me and that ball were neck and neck.

27
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,384
- Look, it is scientifically
impossible for that bike

28
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,747
to do 120 miles per hour.

29
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,664
- Then 100.

30
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:52,917
Then I'm right.

31
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,014
- You're never right.

32
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,008
Air confuses you.

33
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,699
- Probably more like 30, man.

34
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,965
- More like 90.

35
00:03:58,965 --> 00:04:00,689
- The ball, maybe.

36
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,179
But not the bike.

37
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:05,494
- So what do you think Cy's
rookie card will be worth, huh?

38
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,936
- Forget the card,
that's chump change, man.

39
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:08,865
It's the arm.

40
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:10,590
What do you think that
cannon will be worth?

41
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,090
10, 15 mil a year?

42
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,541
- And that's not including
endorsements or bonuses.

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,105
Innings pitched, strikeouts, E.R.A.,

44
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:21,405
all-star team appearances,
and the Cy Young award.

45
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,838
Factoring in inflation, it'll probably be,

46
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:26,235
hm, 15 to 20 mil a year by then.

47
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:27,478
- Quit dreamin'.

48
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:28,374
- Start dreamin'.

49
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:29,864
And I'm gonna be your catcher.

50
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,372
- I'm gonna be your slime-bucket agent.

51
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,836
What am I gonna do with all that green?

52
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,003
Spend it fast.

53
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:39,214
(spritzes)

54
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,735
- What are you doing?

55
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:46,902
- (coughs) Check out the first ingredient.

56
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,463
- Alcohol.

57
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:51,796
SD alcohol 38-B.

58
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,850
Are you kidding?

59
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,799
- Go ahead, it's a good buzz.

60
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,535
- You were born with a buzz.

61
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:01,629
- You can't get drunk off this crap.

62
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:02,610
(spritzes)

63
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,995
- It takes the edge off.

64
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:08,781
- Mouth, you are one scary human being.

65
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,483
- Not half as scary as you, Gump.

66
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:12,118
What's with the umbrella?

67
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:14,650
It's hot enough to grow a
cactus out of your butt.

68
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,045
- My mom said it was gonna rain.

69
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:16,878
- Oh, really?

70
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:17,711
And what'd she say

71
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,119
about the sky falling and Chicken Little?

72
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,975
- It is supposed to rain, Mouth.

73
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,927
That's what the forecast said.

74
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,807
We'll be lucky if we make it
to tryouts this afternoon.

75
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,801
- We'll get to try out.

76
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:29,729
- We better.

77
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,146
- [Boy with Glasses] We will.

78
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:36,404
- Shit.

79
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:41,316
- [Boy with Glasses]
He's in our strike zone.

80
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,931
- [Mouth] Where you goin'?

81
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,329
- Other side of the school.

82
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,790
- It sucks over there, and you know it.

83
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,134
- Come on, Mouth.

84
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,755
He won't be there later.

85
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,057
- And if he is?

86
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,358
- Other side of the school.

87
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,191
- [Mouth] And the next day?

88
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,398
- Other side of the freakin' school.

89
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,819
- You're chicken-size chicken.

90
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,323
- It's got nothing to do with that.

91
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,443
- Yeah, it's gotta do with something

92
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,739
that you've never heard of: range.

93
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,291
And I quote, "He who fights and runs away,

94
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,331
"lives to fight another day."

95
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:18,281
- And I quote, "He who fights
and runs away is a pussy."

96
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:19,443
What about your pride?

97
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,969
- I've got pride in other things.

98
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:21,969
- Like what?

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,262
Hayes doesn't give a shit about us.

100
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,865
It's a mind game, and we're
playing right into it.

101
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,977
I'm sure if we ask him
to move, he'll move.

102
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,526
- Yeah, right after he slits your throat.

103
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,481
- Then I'll slit his back.

104
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,648
- You really are a frightening
human being, Mouth.

105
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:52,190
(radio commentating baseball game)

106
00:07:27,097 --> 00:07:29,347
(whispers)

107
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:31,604
- Strike him out!

108
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:32,742
Shit!

109
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:34,683
(gasps)

110
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,001
(Bell rings)

111
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,643
- Let's go to tryouts!

112
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,435
- [Teacher] Slow down, gentlemen.

113
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:41,758
- [Boy with Glasses]
It's gonna be awesome.

114
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:43,689
- Traveling in the team bus.

115
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:45,150
- Going to road games.

116
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,921
- Hanging with the guys.

117
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:48,916
- (spits) Spittin' seeds.

118
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,441
- Chewin' tobacco.

119
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,608
- Night games.

120
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,345
- Gettin' laid!

121
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,764
- You wish!

122
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:58,270
- Psh, just 'cause you
can't even see yours.

123
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,454
- You're an asshole.

124
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:00,340
- Do I irritate you?

125
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,502
Do I noseate you?

126
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:02,835
Do I disarm you?

127
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:08,066
- Hey! Hey, where is everyone?

128
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,046
- Hey, where are the tryouts?

129
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,678
- Thursday afternoon.

130
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:25,950
But uh, we already got our bat boys.

131
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,033
- And mascot.

132
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,804
Come on, Baker, get over the plate!

133
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:34,971
- What happened to the tryouts
for the 13 and 14 year olds?

134
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,933
- Canceled.

135
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,695
- Budget cuts. (laughs)

136
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:41,361
- Yeah, diapers got too expensive.

137
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,584
(laughs)

138
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:44,667
- Very funny.

139
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,268
- So how come no one told us?

140
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,697
- Why should they?

141
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,004
- 'Cause we walk upright, that's why.

142
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,188
- Sorry, kids.

143
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,688
Them's the breaks.

144
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,801
- Them's the breaks.

145
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:02,728
Why is it always just the
little guys who lose out, huh?

146
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,680
What are we, invisible?

147
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,746
We don't count?

148
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,579
- Yup.

149
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:11,702
- Do you think we like

150
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:13,633
being the them's-the-breaks generation?

151
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,054
You think we like having
no choice in the matter?

152
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:16,887
- Yup.

153
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,692
- So, you don't think
we like playing baseball

154
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,192
as much as you do.

155
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,873
Who decides?

156
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,238
Who makes the rules?

157
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:30,838
Who makes the budget cuts?

158
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,161
Why us?

159
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,676
Why not you guys?

160
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,574
- Because we can play the game.

161
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,857
You diseases, you're
still trying to figure out

162
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,692
how to throw the ball over the plate

163
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,775
without having it bounce a few times.

164
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,529
- Is that so?

165
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,388
Well, you just practice up,

166
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:54,797
because come Thursday afternoon,

167
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,238
my friend over there is going
to blow the ball right by you.

168
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,337
(laughs)

169
00:09:58,337 --> 00:09:59,265
Laugh.

170
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,098
He throws so hard,

171
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:03,060
he'll make you look like a
ballerina in a hailstorm.

172
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,129
- That little twerp?

173
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:05,962
Tell you what,

174
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,158
why don't you go home and nurse?

175
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,325
- Ah, blow me!

176
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,481
- Whip it out.

177
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,156
- You got a forklift?

178
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,596
(laughs)

179
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:16,596
- I'll see you Thursday.

180
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,431
- No way in Hell, Book.

181
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,380
I'm not trying out.

182
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,265
- You have to.

183
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:23,098
- I don't have to.

184
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:24,121
Reason number one,

185
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,212
I'm not half good enough
to play on that team.

186
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,204
And reason number two--

187
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,037
- You're an idiot.

188
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:28,870
- Reason number two,

189
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,991
we all play together or
we don't play at all.

190
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,217
And reason number three--

191
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,455
- You're an idiot's idiot.

192
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:35,684
- Reason number three through
one thousand, my brother!

193
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,847
My brother's gonna be on that team,

194
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,257
and if he so much as finds
out we were on that field,

195
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:43,424
he'll break both my legs
off and beat me with them.

196
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,026
- You'll still make the team.

197
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,284
- Save it, Book.

198
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,564
- I'm telling you, Joseph.

199
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,164
You gotta try out.

200
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:55,839
This one is in the stars.

201
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,738
It was meant to be.

202
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:01,026
My mom always said, "Good comes from bad."

203
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,505
And I believe it.

204
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:04,769
Good always comes from bad.

205
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,269
- [Hayes] Move it!

206
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:13,421
(sorrowful music)

207
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,539
- Asshole!

208
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:35,030
(intense music)

209
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:41,674
- Wait up!

210
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,745
Wait up, guys!

211
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,249
Wait up!

212
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,996
Coming through!

213
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,993
We were mad-dogged.

214
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:12,452
Billy Hayes mad-dogged us.

215
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,106
We were mad-dogged.

216
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,013
Goddammit!

217
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:18,930
We're dead.

218
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,720
- We weren't mad-dogged.

219
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,445
- And if we were?

220
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:24,278
- We weren't.

221
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,075
- And if we were, asshole?

222
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:29,121
They may as well be
feeding us to the lions.

223
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,372
- Which brings up an interesting question:

224
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:32,372
Who is they?

225
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,105
(spritzes)

226
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,472
Take a hit, Bookie.

227
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,525
You could use one.

228
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,406
- I think you could use the hit.

229
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:40,504
- Book was right, Mouth.

230
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:41,848
That was pretty stupid.

231
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,189
- Yeah, a full-page ad
could've been more effective.

232
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,667
- Come on, you guys treat this guy

233
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,064
like he's some kind of super villain.

234
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:52,062
Trust me, we're the last
thing on Billy Hayes' mind.

235
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:52,895
Chill.

236
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:58,614
- For the first time in your
life, I hope you're right.

237
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:01,246
(spritzes)

238
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,829
- I'm always right.

239
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:05,260
- Ma?

240
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,623
Hey, Mom!

241
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:11,185
Mom?

242
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:21,492
(somber music)

243
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,661
(beep)

244
00:13:29,661 --> 00:13:31,105
- [Voiceover] Hi, guys.

245
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:32,595
(laughs) Remember me?

246
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:34,488
Um, it looks like your dad and I

247
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,952
are gonna be home late again tonight,

248
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,688
'cause the hospital's a zoo.

249
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:41,507
So you guys, the freezer's loaded.

250
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,462
Actually, I don't think it is.

251
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,907
I forgot to go to the market.

252
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,074
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,581
How was your tryout, Joey?

254
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,900
I can't wait to hear all about--

255
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,716
- [Voiceover] Dr. Pacelli to ICU, stat.

256
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:52,958
Dr. Pacelli to ICU, stat.

257
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,824
- [Voiceover] I gotta go, sweetheart.

258
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:55,966
I promise, promise, promise

259
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,747
I will make your favorite
yummy dinner tomorrow.

260
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:58,845
I love you, Joey.

261
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,233
I love you, Dale.

262
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,150
See you in the morning.

263
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,633
- Right.

264
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:12,916
- Reuben?

265
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,794
Is something wrong?

266
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:17,654
- No.

267
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,864
- Are you sure?

268
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,301
- They canceled our baseball league.

269
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,326
- They did? Why?

270
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,566
- Because you're buffoons.

271
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,832
That's why.

272
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:41,416
Everything this city
does turns into a mess.

273
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,827
Look at the parks.

274
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,025
Look at the police

275
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,224
and the schools.

276
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,094
They can't even afford
to buy their own books.

277
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,174
And that's why we're
getting you out of there.

278
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:53,097
Are your ready for your entrance exam?

279
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:54,464
- Yeah.

280
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,297
- Good.

281
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,067
- But why do I have to go?

282
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,484
- Because you do.

283
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:03,103
- Yeah...

284
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:03,936
but why?

285
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,595
- I'll tell you why.

286
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,859
Because I was never given an opportunity.

287
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,031
And because I'm working too hard

288
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:19,198
to see you wasting away in
some broken-down public school.

289
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,494
- But...

290
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,489
what about my friends?

291
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,176
- Your friends?

292
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:30,615
Huh.

293
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:39,560
Well, Reuben, your granddad
moved us when I was your age,

294
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,240
and I made new friends.

295
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,409
So you'll make new friends, all right?

296
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,086
You make friends wherever you go.

297
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,086
That's life.

298
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,796
- I have no desire to
go the creepin' school.

299
00:15:56,796 --> 00:15:58,846
And he says I have no choice.

300
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:01,064
He won't even reason with me.

301
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,184
- Then screw him.

302
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,155
Don't go. I wouldn't.

303
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:05,768
- I can't do that.

304
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,257
- Sure you can, Bookie.

305
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,792
Tell him to take a hike.

306
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,886
That's what my mom told my old man.

307
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,857
He never came back.

308
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:13,857
The asshole.

309
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,228
And then again, if that don't work,

310
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:18,222
you can always do what
that kid in Wichita did.

311
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:20,910
- Oh, and what was that, Oh Wise One?

312
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,243
- Blow 'em away.

313
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,124
(spritzes)

314
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:27,126
(upbeat music)

315
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,043
- Let's play some ball!

316
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:38,572
♫ Been such a long time

317
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:42,224
♫ Since I've felt this good

318
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:46,391
♫ Beginning to wonder if I ever could

319
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:54,051
♫ I know it sounds crazy

320
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,323
♫ But I feel my luck is changing

321
00:16:57,323 --> 00:17:00,776
♫ Yeah, I'm back again ♫

322
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,503
- You're going downtown, Finley.

323
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:03,336
Downtown.

324
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:07,669
- Stee-rike!

325
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,319
Next time. Next time.

326
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:15,946
Dos!

327
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:20,021
♫ Greeting the future face to face

328
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:23,438
♫ We're back in the race

♫ You might think that it's over

330
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:34,200
♫ I got news for you

331
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,367
♫ Don't be so quick to count me out

332
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:46,248
♫ 'Cause it's never over

333
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:49,004
♫ 'Til the walls come tumbling down

334
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,214
♫ I'm out of luck

335
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:54,297
♫ Thrown it all away

336
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,710
♫ Yeah, back in the race

337
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,321
♫ Get cooled off

338
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:04,162
♫ Livin' life like there's no tomorrow

339
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,814
♫ Back in the race

340
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:08,010
♫ To take a chance

341
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,851
♫ Greeting the future face to face

342
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:14,455
♫ We're back in the race ♫

343
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,714
(bat and ball clink)

344
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:18,518
- Home run! Home run!

345
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,008
Stop the presses!

346
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,190
I just dinged one off
the great Joseph Finley!

347
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,953
Yes! Yes! Yes!

348
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,120
- It was foul.

349
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,368
- No way, Book.

350
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:31,083
That was a home run, fair and square.

351
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,286
- My condolences, but it
went left of the tree.

352
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:35,926
- [Mouth] Yeah, well that
oak tree is fair, you puke.

353
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,709
- That's not an oak.

354
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,050
It's a Monterrey Pine, you pukette.

355
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,104
It's foul.

356
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,090
It always has been and always will be.

357
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,090
You know it.

358
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,255
- Aw, go home and molest yourself.

359
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,424
- [Joey] You guys, let's
just give it to him.

360
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:50,771
- Nah, give him nothin'.

361
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:51,916
If I can strike lightning once,

362
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,345
I can strike it again.

363
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:54,178
Fetch.

364
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:55,011
- You fetch.

365
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:55,844
You hit it.

366
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:56,677
- You're in the outfield.

367
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,510
- You hit it.

368
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,343
- You said it was foul.

369
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,176
- So what?

370
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:00,560
- I'll go get it.

371
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,776
- No, no, no, no, Joey.

372
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:02,609
I'll go get it.

373
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,442
- No, no, no, no, no.

374
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,692
I'll go get it.

375
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,766
- Shoot.

376
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,352
- Somebody lose a ball?

377
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,352
- It's ours.

378
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:15,225
Thanks.

379
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,779
- Anytime.

380
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:19,612
Take care.

381
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,355
- Yeah.

382
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:22,938
Yeah, bro, you too.

383
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,551
He ain't a bad guy.

384
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,551
- By the way...

385
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:35,681
which one of you guys called
me an asshole yesterday?

386
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,576
You know, I'm just curious,

387
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,743
'cause usually I like to look
the limp dick in the eyes.

388
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,550
But hey, I just wanna know
who's been calling me names...

389
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:50,294
behind my back.

390
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:53,911
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

391
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:57,064
Scout's honor.

392
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:00,082
You know what?

393
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:03,588
I don't ever wanna see
you guys here again.

394
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:05,534
Find somewhere else to play.

395
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,290
- Look, we don't want any trouble.

396
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,803
If you want us to do your homework

397
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,853
or make your lunch everyday, you got it.

398
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:15,576
- You called me an asshole, didn't you?

399
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:16,802
- It was me.

400
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,135
- No, I said it.

401
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,472
- Now I know it was you, you fat coward.

402
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:27,842
Do you have any idea how fat
and stupid-looking you are?

403
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:28,842
Huh? Do ya?

404
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:31,018
Greasy, four-eyed mound of blubber.

405
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,589
How do you live with yourself, huh?

406
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:33,422
Piggy.

407
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,379
I asked you a question, Piggy.

408
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:39,733
Do you have any idea how fat
and stupid-looking you are?

409
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:40,949
Huh? Do ya?

410
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:41,782
Huh?

411
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,615
Answer me!

412
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:44,901
- [Book] Yes

413
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:45,901
- Yes, what?

414
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:51,470
- [Book] Yes, I do know how
fat and stupid-looking I am.

415
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,328
- I feel a whole lot better.

416
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,426
- Are you happy now?

417
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:58,348
- Excuse me?

418
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:01,378
- I said, "Are you happy now, asshole?"

419
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:03,952
- You dumb (grunts)

420
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:06,619
(intense music)

421
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:14,695
- Ah!

422
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:51,822
(heavy breathing)

423
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,989
(barking)

424
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:16,455
(screaming)

425
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,469
- I think it's time somebody taught you

426
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,272
a little something about respect.

427
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,189
- Eat shit!

428
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:22,738
- Oh, not a bad idea.

429
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:24,329
(grunting)

430
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,162
- No! No!

431
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:27,766
No!

432
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,862
- [Hayes] You wanna be a hero?

433
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:30,855
- No!

434
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:32,557
- Here's your reward.

435
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,974
(grunting and squishing)

436
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:40,398
You now have something to wash it down.

437
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:42,348
- No!

438
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,660
(grunting)

439
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:49,485
No! No! No!

440
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:57,311
(gurgles)

441
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,959
- [Book] Joey!

442
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,089
Joey!

443
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,339
- See you in school, champ.

444
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:13,186
(coughing and sputtering)

445
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:19,895
- [Mouth] Joey, are you okay?

446
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,616
- [Book] Your arm.

447
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:42,363
(melancholy music)

448
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:26,001
- Hey!

449
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:28,869
Hey!

450
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,071
Where you going?

451
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:37,743
Oh, honey.

452
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,909
Look at...

453
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:39,826
oh sweetie.

454
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:46,452
How'd your hair get all wet, huh?

455
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,761
- Cockroach?

456
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:53,928
Did one of your water balloon
fights get out of hand again?

457
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,804
- Tell me what happened, Joey.

458
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,547
- Yeah, Joey, tell me what happened.

459
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,630
- Would you just get out?

460
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,678
- Come on, sweetie, tell me what happened.

461
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:07,428
You don't have to be embarrassed.

462
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:16,032
- I'm okay.

463
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,141
- Okay. You sure?

464
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,884
- [Voiceover] Dr. Finley?

465
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:22,806
Dr. Finley?

466
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,600
- I'm right here.

467
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,433
I have to take this, okay?

468
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,266
Just one second.

469
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:28,248
I'll be right back, okay?

470
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:31,706
You know, sometimes I
just wanna (exhales).

471
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:32,873
Okay, I'm here

472
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,331
Uh-huh. So how are the contractions?

473
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,331
Yeah, mm-hm.

474
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:41,994
(sniffles)

475
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:45,123
And how many centimeters is she dilated?

476
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,603
- Go to hell.

477
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,609
- What'd you say, you (footsteps pounding)

478
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:49,812
- Hey, hey, guys!

479
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:51,203
Guys, come on!

480
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:56,176
(grunting and footsteps pounding)

481
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:57,583
Sorry.

482
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,666
You know, brotherly love.

483
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,210
(grunting)

484
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:07,472
Dr. Frank, can I call you right back?

485
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:08,305
Just one second.

486
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,813
I'll call you right back.

487
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:11,161
- Time you learned a little something

488
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,701
about respect, Cockroach.

489
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,556
One of my buddies recognized your puny mug

490
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:15,791
from the field yesterday.

491
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,515
Don't go near it!

492
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm warning you!

493
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,595
You're just a little bug who
thinks throwing a tennis ball

494
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,783
against the wall is baseball.

495
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:23,616
It ain't.

496
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,438
It's babyball.

497
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:27,881
- [Dr. Finley] Joey? Dale?

498
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,964
- Smarten up.

499
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:34,317
- I wanna talk to you.

500
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,150
- Mom, I didn't touch him.

501
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,983
I didn't--

502
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,983
- I want to talk to you.

503
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,823
Joey, your brother's
just a great, big bully.

504
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,394
And someday, somebody his own size

505
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:50,559
is gonna set him straight,

506
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,142
and I hope I'm there to see it.

507
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:59,608
Honey, until then though,
just ignore him or something.

508
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:00,642
Don't provoke him.

509
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:03,475
It just plays into his hand, okay?

510
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:07,855
(sobbing)

511
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,550
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

512
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:23,486
Honey, I promise, everything will be okay.

513
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:28,944
You just take your time.

514
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:29,981
Take all the time you need.

515
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,314
And then when...

516
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,617
when you're ready, you just come down

517
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,998
and have dinner with me, okay?

518
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,498
Be waiting downstairs for you.

519
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,956
You know, sweetheart, this is
all just part of growing up.

520
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,623
And sometimes it just isn't fun.

521
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:54,301
I love you.

522
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,927
I'm gonna take care of Dale.

523
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,760
Dale?

524
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:02,849
Dale?

525
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:07,016
Get outta your room and come
down to the kitchen now.

526
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,269
(crickets chirp)

527
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:31,423
They're at each other night and day now,

528
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,369
and I don't know what
we're gonna do about it.

529
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:35,356
- Honey, they're brothers.

530
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:37,119
I went through it, and I survived.

531
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,426
And so will Joey.

532
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,176
They'll manage, okay?

533
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:56,514
- I'm going to the Principal's.

534
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,237
- Don't even think it, Bookie.

535
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,263
Come on, he'll only mess things up.

536
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:01,611
- What then?

537
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:02,685
- Go to your locker.

538
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:03,699
What's he gonna do?

539
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:06,366
Knife you in broad school light?

540
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:08,532
Come on.

541
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:10,143
Follow me.

542
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:14,310
(students chatter and lockers bang)

543
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:27,259
- Citizenship in Athens.

544
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,106
The democracy of Athens opened
participation in government

545
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:31,439
to all citizens.

546
00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:34,767
However, citizenship
was a privilege reserved

547
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,189
for relatively few people.

548
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:41,293
Only men over the age of
18 could become citizens,

549
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,593
and except under special circumstances,

550
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,245
a man became a citizen

551
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:49,328
only after his father had
already been a citizen.

552
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:00,843
- Hey, where you guys going?

553
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,061
- [Joey] Home. Come on.

554
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,513
- I'm supposed to get picked up by my mom.

555
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,743
My exam, remember?

556
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:08,587
- So what?

557
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:10,547
You want us to stay and hold your hand?

558
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,786
- Hey, why are you such a jerk?

559
00:30:12,786 --> 00:30:15,486
- Probably 'cause my dad
left the house when I was 10,

560
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:17,610
after throwing one too many right hooks.

561
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,527
How's that?

562
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:21,212
- I'll stick around.

563
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:23,078
I got a few minutes.

564
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:25,319
- [Mouth] All right, I'll hang.

565
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,402
Chicken shit.

566
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,559
- So, what time are you
supposed to be there?

567
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,838
- Half hour.

568
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:35,222
Four.

569
00:30:35,222 --> 00:30:37,111
I don't know why I'm going.

570
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:39,258
I'll be miserable there
for the rest of my life.

571
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:41,018
- You're going because you're
more afraid of your parents

572
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:42,778
than you are of Hayes.

573
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:43,945
- Hey, Reuben.

574
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,320
Glad I caught you.

575
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:54,242
- My mom.

576
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:58,215
She can't pick me up.

577
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:02,382
- Yeah, she's probably
getting her mustache waxed.

578
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:06,042
- How am I gonna get there now?

579
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:06,875
- Walk?

580
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,118
- You guys wanna walk with me?

581
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:13,060
- Sorry, Bookie.

582
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,360
I gotta get home and babysit my siblings.

583
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,556
I'm late already.

584
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:17,871
- Joey?

585
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:20,347
- I gotta get home to let the plumber in.

586
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,264
Sorry, man.

587
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,498
Hey, hey, why don't you run?

588
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:27,856
You'll be there before you know it.

589
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:28,689
- Yeah, Bookie.

590
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:29,522
Hayes isn't around.

591
00:31:29,522 --> 00:31:30,660
You'll be okay.

592
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,740
- You think so?

593
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,702
- Yeah.

594
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,262
Hayes lives in the other direction.

595
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,512
You'll be fine.

596
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:38,674
- All right.

597
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:39,507
Wish me luck?

598
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:40,340
- Good luck.

599
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,507
- Break a nut.

600
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,047
Buck says he collapses
before he turns the corner.

601
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,521
Should be okay.

602
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,771
- Yeah. He'll be all right.

603
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:09,289
- Dude, I can't join them.

604
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,286
I'm not going.

605
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:11,929
And don't ask me any questions.

606
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,451
I don't wanna hear a word about it.

607
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:15,284
- Okay.

608
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,306
- Oh man, my dad's home.

609
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,679
He's gonna kill me.

610
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,826
- [Mouth] Nonsense. Just
tell him you forgot.

611
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:25,891
And don't say a word about Hayes.

612
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:27,382
You know your psycho dad.

613
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:28,707
He'll freak.

614
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:32,239
And Bookie, don't forget
my English homework, okay?

615
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,800
And my math.

616
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,050
And my biology.

617
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:40,618
- (laughs) What do you mean, you forgot?

618
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:42,530
- I forgot.

619
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,387
- You never forget anything.

620
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,407
How could you forget this?

621
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:55,907
You've been studying for it night and day.

622
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,917
Did you forget?

623
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:00,750
- Paul.

624
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,220
- Yes, I know.

625
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:12,155
I'm going to ask a question.

626
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:14,933
I would like a straight answer.

627
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,183
Did you forget?

628
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,565
- No.

629
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:26,105
Mom was supposed to pick me up.

630
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,468
- Well, you could've walked.

631
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,333
Why couldn't you walk?

632
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,269
What's the matter?

633
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:38,177
You got a big pair of strong legs on you.

634
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:39,010
Come on.

635
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,973
If you try and throw your education away,

636
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:46,306
you're gonna end up a loser.

637
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:50,505
You're not gonna be on anyone's team.

638
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,572
Honey, why don't you talk to him?

639
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,405
- I will.

640
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:05,817
- You listen to your mother.

641
00:34:12,272 --> 00:34:13,105
- I hate him.

642
00:34:13,105 --> 00:34:15,077
- No, you don't.

643
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:16,244
No, you don't.

644
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,093
Your dad just wants what's best for you.

645
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:23,890
We both do.

646
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,809
Reuben, sweetheart,

647
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,545
I know you wouldn't have missed that exam,

648
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:31,712
unless you had an awfully good reason.

649
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,781
Reuben, what's going on?

650
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,368
- You have to promise you won't tell Dad.

651
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,368
- I promise.

652
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:52,552
(exhales)

653
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:54,007
- [Mouth] You sure you didn't tell him?

654
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:55,825
- No way. I stonewalled him.

655
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,785
Told him I forgot.

656
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:58,864
Here's your English.

657
00:34:58,864 --> 00:34:59,861
How's it look?

658
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,058
- Not bad.

659
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,032
- So how's the arm?

660
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,487
Ready for tryouts?

661
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:05,095
- Don't waste your breath, Book.

662
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:06,655
- You sure you didn't tell him?

663
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:09,377
Are you absolutely positive
that you didn't say anything?

664
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:11,112
- Are you questioning my integrity here?

665
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:12,743
- No, I'm not questioning your integrity.

666
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,891
I was just wondering if you said anything.

667
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:15,724
- Well, I'm just wondering

668
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,003
if you're questioning my integrity.

669
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:18,235
- Oh really, are you wondering?

670
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,068
- Morning.

671
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:25,263
So, how we all doing today?

672
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,565
Everyone okay?

673
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,065
Ready for tryouts?

674
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,831
Nice hat, Piggy.

675
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,081
I think I'll...

676
00:35:35,574 --> 00:35:36,407
take it.

677
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,213
- Hey!
- [Book] Dad?

678
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:41,046
- [Book's Dad] Bully, come here!

679
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:41,946
Come here. Come here.

680
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:42,910
Come here. Come here.

681
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,743
Come here.

682
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:48,211
Listen.

683
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,250
If you so much as look
at my kid ever again,

684
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,116
I'll break every bone in your body.

685
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,545
And if you don't believe
me, you just try me.

686
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:56,795
Huh, tough guy?

687
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:00,707
A real hero picking on
guys half your size.

688
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:02,937
How do like it, being on the other side?

689
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,004
You like it?

690
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:05,004
Do you? Huh?

691
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,859
Do I make myself clear this morning, son?

692
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:10,857
- [Hayes] Yes.

693
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:11,690
- Do I?

694
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,607
- Yes, sir.

695
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,245
- Don't you forget it.

696
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:16,995
I'll be watching you.

697
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,103
Get out of my sight.

698
00:36:20,103 --> 00:36:21,020
Go, go, go!

699
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,772
Cheer up, guys.

700
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:34,136
Come on, Reuben.

701
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:35,473
Smile.

702
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:36,306
It's gonna be a long time

703
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:39,357
before that dirt bag bothers anybody.

704
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:40,787
Now let me take you to school.

705
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:41,620
Let's go.

706
00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:05,570
- Messed up big time, Book

707
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,745
- I told you, my mom gave me her word.

708
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:09,989
I trusted her.

709
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:12,497
- You need to stop trusting her.

710
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,771
- She was probably worried about me.

711
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:19,285
(whistle blows and Book slams)

712
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:21,278
- She should be.

713
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:22,528
- Ahh, my back.

714
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:25,937
That hurt.

715
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,770
(showers running)

716
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,809
(door slams)

717
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:54,043
(door slams)

718
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:01,481
- [Hayes] Here, Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy.

719
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:02,314
Oh, Piggy.

720
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,909
Here, Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy.

721
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,409
(students chatter)

722
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:27,064
Come on, Piggy, let's
go for a little ride.

723
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,281
(grunting and yelling)

724
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,114
Let's go.

725
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:32,632
- Ah! Get off me!

726
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,064
Let go of me!

727
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:36,897
Let go!

728
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:39,364
Let go of me!

729
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,934
- Where's your punk-ass
bitch now, huh Piggy?

730
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,465
(yelling)

731
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,798
- Get off of me!

732
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:06,952
(grunting)

733
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:21,748
- Thank your old man
for this one, dough boy.

734
00:39:23,688 --> 00:39:25,855
You won't be needing this.

735
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,812
- Let me in!

736
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:37,645
Let me in!

737
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,833
(fire alarm dings)

738
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:51,702
(students chatter)

739
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,883
(students chatter and laugh)

740
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:13,831
(sobbing)

741
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,605
- Get out of the way, move.

742
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:20,605
Come on, coming through.

743
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:26,955
I'm so sorry, man!

744
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:27,788
I'm so sorry.

745
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,881
I've never been sorrier in my life,

746
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,001
I swear it.

747
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:33,001
We should never have left you alone.

748
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:36,142
- I'm gonna kill him.

749
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:39,616
- Excuse me.

750
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:41,012
Let me through please.

751
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:42,222
Excuse me.

752
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:45,156
Jesus, what's going on here?

753
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,323
Oh, good Lord.

754
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:54,127
You sure I can't get
you something to drink?

755
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:55,044
Some water?

756
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:02,138
I'm sorry this happened, guys.

757
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,070
If only you would've
come to see me earlier.

758
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,236
We might've been able to
avoid this whole thing.

759
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,748
It's all in the past now.

760
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,415
What's done is done.

761
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:16,606
Now, the question that is before us,

762
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:18,599
what to do next.

763
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,432
Any ideas?

764
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,827
- Hire a hit man.

765
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:29,620
- I think it's time that I sit
down with that boy's father.

766
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,037
How's that sound?

767
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:36,060
Guys, I've been down this
road hundreds of times.

768
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,546
If he sees that you're
not afraid to get help,

769
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:39,796
he'll back off.

770
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:45,255
Bullies are really just cowards at heart.

771
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:49,366
That's why they pick on someone smaller.

772
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:51,034
Let me talk with his dad.

773
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:53,218
Now, I've chatted with him in the past.

774
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:54,786
It's always helped.

775
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:57,369
I know this will change things.

776
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:04,956
Don't worry, Reuben.

777
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,456
The worst is over.

778
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:10,421
And I will take care of Mr. Hayes.

779
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,644
- A chat with Hayes' dad?

780
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,108
Oh, yeah. That oughta do it.

781
00:42:31,108 --> 00:42:33,012
Principal Dick.

782
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,278
What a dick.

783
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,207
His old man's a dick.

784
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:36,719
His old lady was a dick.

785
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,377
His brother and sisters were dicks.

786
00:42:38,377 --> 00:42:39,844
They're all dicks.

787
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:40,863
They eat dick for dinner.

788
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:42,297
They sleep on dicks.

789
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:43,495
They drive dicks to work.

790
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:45,354
They brush and pick
their teeth with dicks.

791
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,187
They di--

792
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:47,020
- Shut up.

793
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,853
Shut up, already.

794
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:48,813
- Dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick.

795
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,335
- Dude, don't you ever stop gabbing?

796
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,903
Maybe talking to Hayes'
dad isn't such a bad idea.

797
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,124
- Bull crap!

798
00:42:56,124 --> 00:42:58,462
Not this talk to his dad shit.

799
00:42:58,462 --> 00:42:59,638
Payback time.

800
00:42:59,638 --> 00:43:00,805
Right, Bookie?

801
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,957
(telephone rings)

802
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,340
- Hello?

803
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:14,012
Speaking.

804
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,893
Principal Richard.

805
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:20,541
Fine, sir.

806
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,624
And yourself?

807
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:23,812
Good.

808
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:25,637
Good.

809
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,288
Is there a problem?

810
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,670
(video game whirs and roars)

811
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,205
- Die, die.

812
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:48,000
- No, I can't work tonight.

813
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,094
I promised my kids.

814
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,844
Yeah, I promised 'em.

815
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,708
I'm coming!

816
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,458
- Die, die, die, die.

817
00:43:57,632 --> 00:43:58,465
Get out of my way.

818
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:59,298
Die!

819
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,484
- Uh, honey.

820
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:03,534
Hey, guys, we're leaving.

821
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:04,945
- Die, die, die!

822
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:07,528
- [Mouth's Mom] Bye. Bye, guys.

823
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:10,777
Don't kill yourselves.

824
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:16,330
- So what are we gonna do?

825
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:23,224
- About your dad or Hayes?

826
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:25,273
- Forget my dad.

827
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:26,106
Hayes.

828
00:44:27,592 --> 00:44:31,321
- I was thinkin' about
that on the way home.

829
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:35,129
It all depends on how far
you guys wanna take it.

830
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:35,962
Wait here.

831
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,465
(shooting)

832
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:59,132
- Dad, they're robbing the bank.

833
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:02,312
Why don't you carry a gun?

834
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:05,720
- [Voiceover] I don't want to
fire and endanger your life.

835
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,142
- De-dum!

836
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:09,809
(intense music)

837
00:45:11,028 --> 00:45:14,042
Your basic all steel Smith and Wesson,

838
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:17,021
single-action .38 special.

839
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:21,188
Also referred to as burn,
heat, rod, steal, and juice.

840
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:24,290
- Where the hell did you get that?

841
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,698
- I won it in a poker game, Gump.

842
00:45:26,698 --> 00:45:28,232
Where do you think I got it?

843
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:31,357
My mom keeps it under
her bed for emergencies.

844
00:45:31,357 --> 00:45:33,040
- Is that thing loaded?

845
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,790
(bullets tumble)

846
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:39,604
(click)

847
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:41,104
Nope, not anymore.

848
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:45,262
Test drive it.

849
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,100
- It's okay.

850
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,767
- Let me see it.

851
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:15,569
- Hasta la vista, baby.

852
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:19,330
(click)

853
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,055
- You shouldn't point a gun at someone.

854
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:23,551
- Then what good is it?

855
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:26,801
(shooting and yelling)

856
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:37,612
Billy Hayes, there's
a new sheriff in town,

857
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:41,756
and this town ain't big
enough for the both of us.

858
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:42,663
Draw.

859
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:46,746
(gun fires, television explodes)

860
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:50,862
- Oh, man.

861
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:53,029
(panting)

862
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:13,731
- My TV.

863
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,372
What am I gonna do?

864
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,209
- Your TV?

865
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:20,956
Your TV?

866
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,873
That coulda been me.

867
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:28,769
Just put that thing away.

868
00:47:31,491 --> 00:47:34,638
- Bookie, what are you talking about?

869
00:47:34,638 --> 00:47:37,069
This is what we've been waiting for.

870
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:40,902
This hunk of metal can
solve all our problems.

871
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,750
- Excuse me?

872
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:46,970
I don't think I'm hearing you correctly.

873
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,336
Are you suggesting--

874
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,434
- Hold up here.

875
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,606
An hour ago, you said you
wanted to kill the guy.

876
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:52,850
And now?

877
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,022
I mean, gimme a break.

878
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,165
- Well that was different.

879
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,598
You know, I wasn't thinking.

880
00:47:57,598 --> 00:47:59,312
- And you're thinking now?

881
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:00,145
- I am.

882
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:03,274
Yes, clearly.

883
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:05,450
- All right.

884
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,726
Don't get so uptight.

885
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:08,014
- Well thank God I'm uptight.

886
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:09,280
You're crazy.

887
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,282
We can't just blow the guy away.

888
00:48:12,282 --> 00:48:13,278
- So what are we supposed to do?

889
00:48:13,278 --> 00:48:14,992
Just sit there and take it?

890
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:15,825
- No, no.

891
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:17,086
We have lots of other choices.

892
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:18,397
- Like what?

893
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:19,965
The school?

894
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,443
Our parents?

895
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:22,860
Your useless dad?

896
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:26,462
Don't you see?

897
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:27,595
They don't get it.

898
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:30,118
They think this is all
part of life's lessons,

899
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:31,608
part of growing up.

900
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,385
But they haven't a clue
what we're feeling.

901
00:48:34,385 --> 00:48:36,385
They don't have time to.

902
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:41,822
- We're talking about a human being here.

903
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:43,413
Not an ant.

904
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:47,624
You can't just step on
him and forget about it.

905
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:51,707
- Book, why are you such
a yellow-bellied coward?

906
00:48:52,552 --> 00:48:54,400
- If this is what makes me a coward,

907
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,567
then I'm damn proud of it.

908
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:01,008
- Why are you such a jerk?

909
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:02,508
- [Mouth] Go home.

910
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,041
- Book!

911
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:07,990
Book!

912
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,136
Wait up!

913
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:11,858
You can come to my house.

914
00:49:11,858 --> 00:49:13,025
Come on, Book.

915
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:30,609
(can rattles)

916
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:39,459
Dad?

917
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:42,819
Hey, Dad!

918
00:49:44,629 --> 00:49:46,018
Hey, Dad!

919
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:47,866
- Hey, big guy!

920
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:49,983
Oh! All right, that hurts.

921
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:51,204
That hurts quite a bit.

922
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:52,884
Down, boy, down.

923
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:54,010
Oh.

924
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:54,843
There he is.

925
00:49:54,843 --> 00:49:55,717
How you doing, buddy?

926
00:49:55,717 --> 00:49:56,939
(winces)

927
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:59,448
What? What's the matter with your arm?

928
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:00,669
- It's nothing.

929
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:01,919
- It's nothing?

930
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,246
(winces)

931
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:07,669
Dale do this?

932
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:09,147
- Sort of.

933
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:09,980
- Sort of.

934
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,249
Aye, aye, aye.

935
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:13,974
What a jerk.

936
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:16,931
You know, it's kind of funny
how life repeats itself.

937
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:17,764
When I was your age,

938
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,664
I had the same kind of
deal with my brother.

939
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:21,389
Your Uncle Dave?

940
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:24,390
Yeah, you don't believe
me, do you? (laughs)

941
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,854
I'm telling you, this guy was crazy.

942
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:29,733
Got to the point where
I was afraid to go home.

943
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:31,659
You know what I did?

944
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:33,798
I devised a master plan,

945
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,408
and I followed it to the letter.

946
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,995
Stood right up to him.

947
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:42,870
After that it was like the
guy never even existed.

948
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,537
- What was the plan?

949
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,458
- I killed him.

950
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,497
(laughs)

951
00:50:50,497 --> 00:50:51,573
I'm kidding.

952
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:52,406
Relax.

953
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:58,372
It was just some silly kind
of kid thing, but it worked.

954
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,958
Joe, what I'm trying to say to you is

955
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:01,828
that you have my blessing

956
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:05,612
to do whatever it takes to stop him.

957
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:09,129
I'll give you one little
piece of advice though.

958
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:10,546
Pick your battle.

959
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:13,843
You'll know when it's time.

960
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:20,822
- Dad, could I ask you something?

961
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:21,964
- Sure, pal.

962
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:23,353
I'll tell you what.

963
00:51:23,353 --> 00:51:25,772
I gotta head back to the
hospital and staple somebody up.

964
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:28,022
So we'll talk this weekend?

965
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:30,936
All right?

966
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:32,224
Sunday?

967
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:33,057
- All right.

968
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,057
- All right.

969
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:35,874
Let's go!

970
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,859
- Hey, that's my glove.

971
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:40,327
- Yeah. Thanks, Joey.

972
00:51:40,327 --> 00:51:42,007
My webbing broke.

973
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:42,982
- He didn't even ask me.

974
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:44,426
- Joey, you're not using now.

975
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,259
He's late for practice.

976
00:51:45,259 --> 00:51:46,401
His tryouts are Thursday.

977
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,234
- So?

978
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:49,517
- So, what's he supposed
to use, his bare hand?

979
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:51,108
- Yeah, it's my glove.

980
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,956
- See guys, right here is the attitude

981
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:55,789
that dooms you from the start.

982
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,425
You guys have to learn to give and take.

983
00:51:57,425 --> 00:51:58,925
It's the only way.

984
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:03,541
Joe, I'll have a talk with him all right?

985
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:06,445
- Sure.

986
00:52:14,057 --> 00:52:15,199
- Listen, Dale.

987
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,881
Do me a favor and back off
your little brother, okay?

988
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:21,314
All right?

989
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:23,196
Give him a break.

990
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:24,613
- Yeah, sure Dad.

991
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,499
(beep)

992
00:52:36,499 --> 00:52:37,695
- [Voiceover] Hi, guys.

993
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:40,427
I'm stuck at the hospital again, um--

994
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,677
(whirring)

995
00:52:46,102 --> 00:52:48,496
(ringing)

996
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:49,329
- [Voiceover] Hello?

997
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:51,666
- Book. Book, listen.

998
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:52,830
Mouth's an idiot.

999
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,589
You just gotta ignore it.

1000
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,661
(dial tone)

1001
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:57,494
Book?

1002
00:52:59,808 --> 00:53:01,970
(slams phone)

1003
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,887
(slow piano music)

1004
00:53:21,222 --> 00:53:25,222
♫ If I could give you the world

1005
00:53:28,256 --> 00:53:31,621
♫ If I could end

1006
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:35,121
♫ All the hurt inside you

1007
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:41,338
♫ Nothing that I would rather rather do

1008
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:47,093
♫ Sometimes the sky

1009
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:52,480
♫ Feels awful blue

1010
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:07,472
♫ And if I could end all your pain

1011
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:14,297
♫ If I could make it feel again

1012
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:17,841
♫ Believe me

1013
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:23,554
♫ There's nothing that
I would rather rather do

1014
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:30,546
♫ But sometimes the sky's awful blue ♫

1015
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:49,604
- This work is unacceptable.

1016
00:55:05,242 --> 00:55:07,909
♫ And sometimes

1017
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:16,362
♫ Sometimes the sky

1018
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:23,622
♫ Is awful blue ♫

1019
00:55:35,991 --> 00:55:38,158
(banging)

1020
00:56:08,608 --> 00:56:12,525
(radio announcer commentating)

1021
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,761
- [Voiceover] So, here we are.

1022
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:33,129
4:45 in the afternoon.

1023
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:34,711
Bottom of the ninth inning.

1024
00:56:34,711 --> 00:56:36,735
Two outs, the bases loaded.

1025
00:56:36,735 --> 00:56:38,072
And the crowd on its feet,

1026
00:56:38,072 --> 00:56:40,881
loving every dramatic moment of this one.

1027
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:42,697
Roger Clemons is just one out,

1028
00:56:42,697 --> 00:56:46,990
perhaps one pitch away from
his sixth shutout of the year.

1029
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,278
And up at the plate,

1030
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:52,338
the menacing and always
dangerous Frank Thomas.

1031
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:54,212
Oh, does he look mean.

1032
00:56:54,212 --> 00:56:57,147
Thomas leads the major
leagues in home runs.

1033
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,183
So now we have the dramatic match-up,

1034
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:03,244
the power pitcher versus the power hitter.

1035
00:57:03,244 --> 00:57:04,911
Thomas sets himself.

1036
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,689
Clemons, staring in, getting the sign.

1037
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:13,356
The outfield is deep, very deep.

1038
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,253
Clemons rocks.

1039
00:57:18,253 --> 00:57:19,909
Strike.

1040
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:22,657
Thomas didn't even see it.

1041
00:57:22,657 --> 00:57:25,711
Well, fasten your seat belts, folks.

1042
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:28,711
Mr. Clemons is on the launching pad.

1043
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:31,452
Here comes the next pitch.

1044
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:32,369
Strike two.

1045
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,553
Thomas just staring at the catcher's mitt.

1046
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:36,927
He is stunned.

1047
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:39,177
He cannot believe his eyes.

1048
00:57:41,011 --> 00:57:42,844
So, here we go, folks.

1049
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:45,230
Two outs.

1050
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,274
The count's oh and two,

1051
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:48,568
and we have the master of the long ball

1052
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:51,794
staring down the master of the fastball.

1053
00:57:51,794 --> 00:57:55,461
Clemons looks in, Thomas
determined as ever.

1054
00:57:57,656 --> 00:57:59,323
Here is the stretch.

1055
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:03,896
And the pitch.

1056
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,417
(bang)

1057
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:07,891
(cheering)

1058
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:08,724
Fantastic!

1059
00:58:10,288 --> 00:58:13,368
Lightning right down
the middle of the plate,

1060
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:17,294
and Thomas missed it by the
proverbial country mile.

1061
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:18,211
Incredible.

1062
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,121
Twelve strikeouts for the rocket.

1063
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:24,371
(announcer trails off)

1064
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:26,567
- What's up, Bookie?

1065
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:28,248
Got a problem?

1066
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:29,818
- Look at that.

1067
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:32,151
Your pitch cracked the wall.

1068
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,492
- You're such a dreamer.

1069
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,258
- Call me a dreamer.

1070
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:37,755
You have to try out tomorrow.

1071
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:39,165
- Not a chance.

1072
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:41,386
- You have to, okay.

1073
00:58:41,386 --> 00:58:43,115
You can't miss this opportunity.

1074
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:44,832
- Look, forget it.

1075
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:46,783
It's all of us or none of us.

1076
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:48,439
- No, no, no, no, no.

1077
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:50,708
It's you and only you.

1078
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,456
Mouth and I, we're a dime a dozen.

1079
00:58:53,456 --> 00:58:55,860
But you are a once in a lifetime.

1080
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,693
Ten years from now,

1081
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:59,381
we'll probably be out
there playing slow-pitch.

1082
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:03,453
But you'll be out there
winning the Cy Young Award.

1083
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:04,570
- I can't.

1084
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,674
- It's your damn brother, isn't it?

1085
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:07,607
- Look, just drop it, Mouth.

1086
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:09,459
- You can't let him run your life.

1087
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:11,655
I mean, think about you, not him.

1088
00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,633
He's not gonna kill you.

1089
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,584
- It's worse than that.

1090
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:17,853
You don't have to live with him.

1091
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,337
You don't know what that's like.

1092
00:59:19,337 --> 00:59:20,736
- You're right, we don't.

1093
00:59:20,736 --> 00:59:23,140
But sooner or later you're
gonna have to stand up to him.

1094
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,973
Because if you don't,

1095
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:26,750
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

1096
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,234
- We talkin' about Hayes here?

1097
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,798
- Come on, Joey, you know
who we're talking about.

1098
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,798
This is your chance to
kick your brother's butt.

1099
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:40,047
- I'll think about it.

1100
00:59:40,047 --> 00:59:41,047
- All right!

1101
00:59:42,611 --> 00:59:43,646
- [Joey] I said I'd think about it.

1102
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,403
- [Book] And I said, "All right!"

1103
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:46,764
Don't you worry, Cy.

1104
00:59:46,764 --> 00:59:48,779
Your brother is all bum.

1105
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:51,696
- [Mouth] Yeah, and he's ugly, too.

1106
00:59:53,877 --> 00:59:56,544
(hopeful music)

1107
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:01,314
(banging)

1108
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:06,532
- Ooh, great!

1109
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:09,249
Now remember, you gotta keep those hips

1110
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:10,968
out in front or your shoulder.

1111
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:13,135
Feel that weight transfer.

1112
01:00:14,092 --> 01:00:16,075
I just can't believe
your brain-dead brother

1113
01:00:16,075 --> 01:00:19,825
swiped your glove in
the middle of the night.

1114
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:24,816
Ooh, he's going down.

1115
01:00:24,816 --> 01:00:26,400
(bicycle skids)

1116
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,983
- Come on, we're gonna be late.

1117
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:32,196
(whistle blows)

1118
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:33,613
- Hey, listen up.

1119
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,012
I wanna welcome all of
you to tryouts today.

1120
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:41,170
I wanna wish each and every
one of you the best of luck.

1121
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,003
So what do you say?

1122
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:42,836
Let's play some ball!

1123
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:47,003
(whistle blows and players cheer)

1124
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,187
- Now remember, hips out
in front of your shoulder.

1125
01:00:51,187 --> 01:00:52,548
Feel that weight transfer.

1126
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:53,898
Feel the weight transfer.

1127
01:00:53,898 --> 01:00:55,024
- Shut up, already.

1128
01:00:55,024 --> 01:00:55,857
I think he's got it.

1129
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:59,190
You sound like a broken record.

1130
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,023
- Damn!

1131
01:01:03,015 --> 01:01:04,798
- [Book] We're screwed.

1132
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:05,924
- Maybe next year.

1133
01:01:05,924 --> 01:01:06,757
- Forget that, man.

1134
01:01:06,757 --> 01:01:07,590
I got it.

1135
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,517
- No way, Mouth.

1136
01:01:08,517 --> 01:01:09,984
If he catches you, he'll kill you.

1137
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:11,087
He'll never touch me.

1138
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:12,084
He hasn't yet.

1139
01:01:12,084 --> 01:01:14,217
- Yet. Don't be a hero.

1140
01:01:14,217 --> 01:01:15,316
It's not worth it.

1141
01:01:15,316 --> 01:01:17,123
- It most definitely is,

1142
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:18,895
and we all know it.

1143
01:01:18,895 --> 01:01:20,728
- [Joey] Don't, Mouth.

1144
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:32,060
- Hey, asshole.

1145
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,310
Where you been?

1146
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:38,232
That's right, Hayes, I'm talking to you.

1147
01:01:44,274 --> 01:01:45,107
Man!

1148
01:01:47,184 --> 01:01:49,073
- [Joey] He's crazy.

1149
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:50,990
- Yeah, but he's right.

1150
01:01:56,664 --> 01:01:57,743
Hold on.

1151
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,576
But don't turn around.

1152
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:15,494
Cy Young, they're calling
for you from the dugout.

1153
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:16,914
- You animal!

1154
01:02:16,914 --> 01:02:18,815
- A good dog deserves his bone.

1155
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:21,482
(hopeful music)

1156
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:45,097
- Come on, boy.

1157
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:46,012
Come on, boy.

1158
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,845
Come on.

1159
01:02:56,608 --> 01:03:00,191
(baseball players yelling)

1160
01:03:08,646 --> 01:03:10,782
- Well, remember, hips out--

1161
01:03:10,782 --> 01:03:12,729
- In front of the shoulders.

1162
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:14,729
- No cherries, no hooks.

1163
01:03:15,648 --> 01:03:16,565
- Just gas.

1164
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:21,142
- Make us proud, Cy.

1165
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:24,748
- I'll try to.

1166
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:28,014
- Hey, good luck.

1167
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,197
- Hey.

1168
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,605
- Wow, lookie lookie.

1169
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:48,773
- Girls try out tomorrow, though.

1170
01:03:48,773 --> 01:03:52,640
- Cockroach, what the
hell are you doing here?

1171
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,723
- Tryin' out.

1172
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:57,372
Where's the signup sheet?

1173
01:03:57,372 --> 01:03:58,205
- Go home, Joey.

1174
01:03:58,205 --> 01:03:59,788
Don't embarrass me.

1175
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,494
Home!

1176
01:04:04,494 --> 01:04:05,827
I'm not kidding.

1177
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:10,243
Is something wrong with your ears?

1178
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:13,175
I said, "Go the hell home!"

1179
01:04:13,175 --> 01:04:14,959
(crashing and laughter)

1180
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:15,792
- [Player] Oh, man!

1181
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:16,883
Did you see that?

1182
01:04:16,883 --> 01:04:20,050
- [Player] What's going on over there?

1183
01:04:24,931 --> 01:04:26,175
- [Coach] Hey, Finley.

1184
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:27,078
- Coach.

1185
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:28,064
- What's going on?

1186
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,061
- Nothing, coach.

1187
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:31,549
Just my little brother here.

1188
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:33,919
He was on his way home.

1189
01:04:33,919 --> 01:04:34,919
Weren't you?

1190
01:04:38,366 --> 01:04:39,616
- No, I wasn't.

1191
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,730
I'm here to try out.

1192
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,980
(laughter)

1193
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:47,917
- What position?

1194
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,250
If you don't mind me asking.

1195
01:04:51,284 --> 01:04:52,117
- Pitcher.

1196
01:04:52,117 --> 01:04:52,950
(laughter)

1197
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:53,867
- Hey, hey.

1198
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:58,535
- Look, son, I know you wanna play ball.

1199
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:00,636
Heck, I did when I was your age.

1200
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:04,109
But I don't think this
is the time or the place.

1201
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,493
These guys are bigger than you are.

1202
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:07,347
They're stronger than you.

1203
01:05:07,347 --> 01:05:08,274
They play harder.

1204
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:09,142
They hit harder.

1205
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:10,832
They could slap a line
drive right through you.

1206
01:05:10,832 --> 01:05:14,165
It's not like playing with your buddies.

1207
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,291
I'm real sorry.

1208
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:21,756
Maybe next year, all right.

1209
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:24,673
I'll be looking forward to it, kid.

1210
01:05:25,663 --> 01:05:26,918
Let's play ball.

1211
01:05:26,918 --> 01:05:27,751
- Yeah.

1212
01:05:29,347 --> 01:05:30,602
- Face it, bro.

1213
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:34,205
Once a cockroach, always a cockroach.

1214
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:35,205
Now go home.

1215
01:05:39,414 --> 01:05:41,497
Take your stinkin' glove.

1216
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,264
- [Book] Here's your glove.

1217
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:00,097
Take it.

1218
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:03,569
- [Mouth] Yee-haw!

1219
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:09,731
Bye-bye!

1220
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,648
Thanks for the workout.

1221
01:06:15,022 --> 01:06:17,689
(intense music)

1222
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:48,451
(crashing)

1223
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:49,284
Ahh!

1224
01:07:02,056 --> 01:07:04,056
(grunts

1225
01:07:08,697 --> 01:07:09,917
- I'm sorry, Joey.

1226
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:10,750
I swear.

1227
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,226
- I should never listen to you jerks.

1228
01:07:12,226 --> 01:07:13,445
- How are we supposed to know?

1229
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:15,006
- You're supposed to listen to me.

1230
01:07:15,006 --> 01:07:16,590
You're supposed to clean
all the crap and gunk

1231
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,370
out of your ears and listen.

1232
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,556
- Okay, you're right.

1233
01:07:20,556 --> 01:07:21,639
We should've.

1234
01:07:24,252 --> 01:07:25,308
You still woulda kicked their b--

1235
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:26,657
- Book!

1236
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:27,877
Give it a rest.

1237
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:28,710
It's over.

1238
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,421
- You woulda.

1239
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:32,406
- Book!

1240
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:34,272
You heard what the coach said.

1241
01:07:34,272 --> 01:07:35,105
Go home!

1242
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:37,616
Just beat it.

1243
01:07:37,616 --> 01:07:38,449
Get lost.

1244
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:53,288
- Isn't that Mouth's bike?

1245
01:08:05,688 --> 01:08:06,521
- Mouth?

1246
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,608
(exhales)

1247
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:40,441
Aw, man.

1248
01:08:59,196 --> 01:09:00,029
Hey!

1249
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:11,398
- What do you faggots want?

1250
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:12,231
- You.

1251
01:09:16,303 --> 01:09:18,812
(laughs)

1252
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:19,979
- My pleasure.

1253
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,873
- Drop it! (gun clicks)

1254
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:30,035
(crashing and heavy breathing)

1255
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,240
All right.

1256
01:10:44,722 --> 01:10:46,671
Cuff him to the post.

1257
01:10:46,671 --> 01:10:50,064
- You're not cuffing me into a post.

1258
01:10:50,064 --> 01:10:51,064
- We're not?

1259
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,440
- Not a chance.

1260
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,084
- Cuff him.

1261
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,691
- Don't touch me.

1262
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:06,524
Especially you, Piggy.

1263
01:11:09,037 --> 01:11:11,704
(clears phlegm)

1264
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:15,354
(spits)

1265
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,354
Compliments of the chef.

1266
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:27,154
- Give me that.

1267
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:33,636
Back up.

1268
01:11:34,931 --> 01:11:36,589
- No, Piggy.

1269
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:37,832
- Back up.

1270
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:39,389
- No, Piggy.

1271
01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:40,442
- Back up!

1272
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:41,607
- No, Piggy!

1273
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:42,783
- Back up! (gun fires)

1274
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:43,616
Back up! (gun fires)

1275
01:11:43,616 --> 01:11:44,449
Back up! (gun fires)

1276
01:11:44,449 --> 01:11:45,282
Back up! (gun fires)

1277
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:48,365
Back up! (gun fires)

1278
01:12:04,257 --> 01:12:05,090
Why us?

1279
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:07,632
Why?

1280
01:12:09,185 --> 01:12:10,352
Why, why, why?

1281
01:12:15,602 --> 01:12:18,884
Just because someone half
your size calls you an asshole

1282
01:12:18,884 --> 01:12:20,284
from two blocks away

1283
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:22,617
that means to terrorize him?

1284
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:29,110
Who gave you the right to call me "Piggy?"

1285
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,943
Huh?

1286
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,361
Who gave you the right to
drag me out of a shower

1287
01:12:35,361 --> 01:12:38,471
and throw me into a hallway full of kids?

1288
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:39,304
Huh?

1289
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:43,112
And who

1290
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,997
gave you the right to touch anyone?

1291
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:51,596
Who?

1292
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:55,916
God dammit, who?

1293
01:12:58,335 --> 01:13:00,183
(sobbing)

1294
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:03,016
(sorrowful music)

1295
01:13:31,398 --> 01:13:32,898
- He's crying now.

1296
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,287
How does that feel?

1297
01:13:38,827 --> 01:13:40,327
Does it feel good?

1298
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,334
Does it feel anything?

1299
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:46,667
Anything at all?

1300
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:57,604
You don't feel...

1301
01:14:00,622 --> 01:14:02,372
a damn thing, do you?

1302
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:05,117
Do you?

1303
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:11,452
How's that feel?

1304
01:14:11,452 --> 01:14:12,285
And that?

1305
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,454
And that?

1306
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:15,287
And that?

1307
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:20,916
What in the world can
you possibly feel, huh?

1308
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:24,249
Your fist smashing into somebody's face?

1309
01:14:25,206 --> 01:14:29,373
Your boot pounding into
someone's ribs? (spits)

1310
01:14:30,985 --> 01:14:32,902
Do you have any idea...

1311
01:14:34,835 --> 01:14:38,087
what it's like on the
other side of the boot?

1312
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:40,587
On the other side of the fist?

1313
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:42,560
Do you?

1314
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:47,846
- Yes.

1315
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:56,034
Yes.

1316
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,497
- Yes, my ass.

1317
01:15:04,788 --> 01:15:07,913
- Where do you think I
got the black eye, huh?

1318
01:15:07,913 --> 01:15:10,634
Where do you think I got it?

1319
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:12,908
Where do you think I got the cracked ribs

1320
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,196
and the bruises

1321
01:15:14,196 --> 01:15:15,730
and the broken wrist

1322
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,586
and the half-dozen concussions?

1323
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:20,336
From Fairy Godmother?

1324
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:23,630
The Fairy Goddamn Godmother?

1325
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:27,416
No, man.

1326
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:30,573
I got it from my dad.

1327
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:35,185
My very own dad.

1328
01:15:39,217 --> 01:15:40,967
Some for my birthday.

1329
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,473
Some for Christmas.

1330
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:48,283
Some for just being there.

1331
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:54,112
My dad.

1332
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:57,897
My hero.

1333
01:16:01,063 --> 01:16:03,980
- So he beats you when you beat us.

1334
01:16:05,549 --> 01:16:06,632
That's sweet.

1335
01:16:08,718 --> 01:16:09,551
Boo hoo.

1336
01:16:14,934 --> 01:16:16,351
- Back off, Joey.

1337
01:16:20,792 --> 01:16:21,625
Back off.

1338
01:16:27,299 --> 01:16:29,517
We made our point.

1339
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:30,684
He needs help.

1340
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,397
- So let's give it to him

1341
01:16:35,397 --> 01:16:36,976
- You don't get it, do you?

1342
01:16:36,976 --> 01:16:38,893
- No, you don't get it.

1343
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,949
You don't remember how
frightened and pathetic you were,

1344
01:16:41,949 --> 01:16:44,413
curled up half-naked with
your runny nose mushed up

1345
01:16:44,413 --> 01:16:46,362
against the door,

1346
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:48,994
crying like it was the end of the world.

1347
01:16:48,994 --> 01:16:51,973
How easily you forget the pain.

1348
01:16:51,973 --> 01:16:54,650
I don't forget the pain.

1349
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,293
I don't forget your pain.

1350
01:16:57,293 --> 01:16:59,626
I don't forget Mouth's pain.

1351
01:17:02,276 --> 01:17:04,526
And I don't forget my pain.

1352
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:07,003
I'm sick of it.

1353
01:17:09,944 --> 01:17:14,166
- Maybe it's your brother
you should be knocking off.

1354
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:16,619
- Maybe you're right.

1355
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:18,536
But Dale won't kill me.

1356
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:20,576
Hayes might.

1357
01:17:50,436 --> 01:17:51,269
- Joey.

1358
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:54,501
You can't.

1359
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:58,950
This wasn't our plan.

1360
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:59,950
It's murder.

1361
01:18:06,611 --> 01:18:07,694
- Correction.

1362
01:18:09,612 --> 01:18:11,112
It's self-defense.

1363
01:18:16,411 --> 01:18:17,328
- We can't.

1364
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,163
- Let go, Book.

1365
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:21,080
- We can't.

1366
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,590
- Let go, Book.

1367
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:29,071
- We can't.

1368
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:30,164
- Let go, Book!

1369
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:30,997
- We can't!

1370
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:32,651
- What the hell's the matter with you?

1371
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:35,163
(intense music)

1372
01:18:35,163 --> 01:18:36,630
- [Mouth] Hey, stop it guys.

1373
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,627
Cool it, man.

1374
01:18:37,627 --> 01:18:38,551
Cool it! Stop!

1375
01:18:38,551 --> 01:18:40,870
What are you doing?

1376
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:41,703
Stop!

1377
01:18:43,379 --> 01:18:44,711
Get off of him!

1378
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:45,560
Stop it!

1379
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,893
(gun fires)

1380
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:50,742
- Joey?

1381
01:19:10,338 --> 01:19:12,040
- A gunshot wound to the right shoulder,

1382
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,676
clipped the brachial artery.

1383
01:19:13,676 --> 01:19:15,143
BP is seven over forty.

1384
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:16,576
He's at 130.

1385
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:17,999
Respiration is 16,

1386
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:20,776
and level of consciousness is in and out.

1387
01:19:20,776 --> 01:19:22,602
- Jesus, Joey!

1388
01:19:22,602 --> 01:19:24,428
- [Voiceover] Dr.
Rosenthall, call your office.

1389
01:19:24,428 --> 01:19:27,178
Dr. Rosenthall, call your office.

1390
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:34,944
Maintenance to third floor.

1391
01:19:34,944 --> 01:19:37,194
Maintenance to third floor.

1392
01:19:38,988 --> 01:19:40,238
- Reuben, Ryan.

1393
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:44,406
- Geez, what happened to you?

1394
01:19:45,751 --> 01:19:47,206
- I'm Officer Thompson.

1395
01:19:47,206 --> 01:19:49,039
This is Officer Maldy.

1396
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:54,058
We understand there's been a shooting.

1397
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:57,236
Tell us about it?

1398
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:06,405
Is there some kind of
problem here, gentlemen?

1399
01:20:08,374 --> 01:20:09,207
- No.

1400
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:14,032
Look, we were--

1401
01:20:15,976 --> 01:20:17,476
- [Hayes] Officer?

1402
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:20,344
- [Officer Thompson] Who are you?

1403
01:20:20,344 --> 01:20:22,261
- Um, Billy Hayes, sir.

1404
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:26,952
This has all been a big mix up.

1405
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:31,119
You see, we were all at my
house, playing with my dad's gun,

1406
01:20:32,115 --> 01:20:34,098
when it went off,

1407
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,181
accidentally.

1408
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:39,606
We had no idea it was loaded.

1409
01:20:42,453 --> 01:20:45,203
It was just an accident, officer.

1410
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,827
Just messing around.

1411
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:51,221
Just playing a game.

1412
01:20:52,622 --> 01:20:54,571
- You don't play with guns.

1413
01:20:54,571 --> 01:20:57,158
Do you understand that?

1414
01:20:57,158 --> 01:20:57,991
Do you?

1415
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,125
- Yes, sir.

1416
01:21:03,643 --> 01:21:07,060
- Somebody coulda been killed here today.

1417
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:12,012
Do you guys get that
somebody could have died?

1418
01:21:13,398 --> 01:21:14,639
(monitors beeping)

1419
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,222
- You're just fine.

1420
01:21:19,622 --> 01:21:21,491
I'm gonna stay right here with you, baby.

1421
01:21:21,491 --> 01:21:23,658
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

1422
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,707
I'm gonna stay right here.

1423
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,311
- I'm sorry.

1424
01:21:43,306 --> 01:21:44,896
- Honey, there's nothing
to be sorry about.

1425
01:21:44,896 --> 01:21:47,313
You didn't do anything wrong.

1426
01:21:49,892 --> 01:21:50,844
Where is my husband?

1427
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:53,688
Have you seen my husband?

1428
01:21:53,688 --> 01:21:55,771
Have you seen Dr. Finley?

1429
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,418
Daddy's gonna be here.

1430
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:01,176
Daddy is the best.

1431
01:22:01,176 --> 01:22:03,426
(laughter)

1432
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:07,801
Only the best for my little baby.

1433
01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:16,992
(banging)

1434
01:22:26,462 --> 01:22:28,802
- [Voiceover] So, here
we are six months later

1435
01:22:28,802 --> 01:22:32,558
and hopefully many lifetimes'
and sleepless nights' wiser.

1436
01:22:32,558 --> 01:22:35,291
Looking back, it's astounding
how a half-ounce of lead

1437
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:38,259
can so easily change
the course of history.

1438
01:22:38,259 --> 01:22:41,137
Besides our folks taking
our pulse three times a day,

1439
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:43,747
private school is out for me, thank God.

1440
01:22:43,747 --> 01:22:45,718
Mouth's mom got rid of her gun,

1441
01:22:45,718 --> 01:22:48,451
and Joey's dad cut his
patient list in half.

1442
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:49,963
And his mom's moved her practice home

1443
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:51,139
and made a ridiculous habit

1444
01:22:51,139 --> 01:22:54,308
of picking us up after school everyday.

1445
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,664
Hayes is around.

1446
01:22:55,664 --> 01:22:57,478
He keeps to himself.

1447
01:22:57,478 --> 01:22:58,990
He's kinder and gentler,

1448
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,073
but we never really know.

1449
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:04,881
As for us, someone once said,

1450
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:07,737
"You don't always pay
in cash, but you pay."

1451
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:09,395
We're still paying.

1452
01:23:09,395 --> 01:23:11,780
Not a day passes, where we don't cringe,

1453
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:15,189
ashamed of our actions that afternoon.

1454
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:17,283
It's never quite been the same.

1455
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:19,366
I wonder if it ever will.

1456
01:23:23,163 --> 01:23:24,830
As for Joey's arm...

1457
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:29,031
he's working on it.

1458
01:23:31,692 --> 01:23:34,109
- Don't worry about it, Joey.

1459
01:23:36,374 --> 01:23:38,816
- Let's go, little brother.

1460
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:40,809
I've waited long enough.

1461
01:23:40,809 --> 01:23:42,913
You and me, right now.

1462
01:23:42,913 --> 01:23:44,200
It's time.

1463
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,567
- [Book] Forget it.

1464
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,952
- Well, huh, what's it gonna be?

1465
01:23:47,952 --> 01:23:48,859
- He can't.

1466
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:50,685
He doesn't have the arm strength.

1467
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:52,735
- Aw, that's sweet, Book.

1468
01:23:52,735 --> 01:23:53,653
But he's a big boy.

1469
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,820
Let him speak for himself.

1470
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,631
- Your shoulder, Cy, don't rush it.

1471
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:01,464
- Book.

1472
01:24:14,339 --> 01:24:15,941
- It's time.

1473
01:24:15,941 --> 01:24:16,774
- Attaboy.

1474
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:19,088
One official at-bat.

1475
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:21,005
Winner rules the house.

1476
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,696
Get out of my way, T-ball.

1477
01:24:25,696 --> 01:24:27,208
- What are you doing?

1478
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,499
- Aw, man. You're crazy.

1479
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:30,171
Your arm's not ready.

1480
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:31,358
You're gonna blow it out.

1481
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,094
- He's gonna hammer you, man.

1482
01:24:33,094 --> 01:24:33,968
Don't do it, Joey.

1483
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:35,468
It's not worth it.

1484
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:39,113
- I'll be okay.

1485
01:24:39,113 --> 01:24:41,446
- No, your arm is not ready.

1486
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:43,424
- Trust me.

1487
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:46,149
It's time.

1488
01:24:47,802 --> 01:24:49,969
Just get behind the plate.

1489
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:55,631
No cherries.

1490
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:56,464
No hooks.

1491
01:24:59,087 --> 01:24:59,920
Just gas.

1492
01:25:12,793 --> 01:25:15,043
(laughter)

1493
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:20,283
- Play ball!

1494
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:21,985
- Right here, C-Roach.

1495
01:25:21,985 --> 01:25:24,068
Nice big, fat, juicy one.

1496
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:35,465
(grunts)

1497
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:37,783
- [Dale's Friends] Oo hoo hoo hoo.

1498
01:25:37,783 --> 01:25:39,363
- Oo hoo hoo hoo.

1499
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:40,953
- That's another area
code over there, buddy.

1500
01:25:40,953 --> 01:25:42,532
- Foul.

1501
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:43,365
Thank God.

1502
01:25:44,459 --> 01:25:46,376
- [Book] Stee-rike one.

1503
01:25:48,412 --> 01:25:50,047
- Was that the best you can do?

1504
01:25:50,047 --> 01:25:51,067
Huh?

1505
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:54,259
Why don't you give me a little
something with salsa on it?

1506
01:25:54,259 --> 01:25:57,014
Something other than your change-up.

1507
01:25:57,014 --> 01:25:58,764
- Blow it by him, Cy.

1508
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:13,090
- Oh, no.

1509
01:26:14,475 --> 01:26:16,725
He's taking off his girdle.

1510
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,012
Oh.

1511
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:55,437
- Yes!

1512
01:27:08,008 --> 01:27:09,016
- Oh and two.

1513
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:10,696
Time to punch out.

1514
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:11,529
- Shut up.

1515
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:16,330
- Hey, uh, I saw your girlfriend
with Scooter last night.

1516
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:18,580
She was walking real funny.

1517
01:27:24,327 --> 01:27:25,301
- Come on, Cy.

1518
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:26,301
Come on, Cy.

1519
01:27:27,966 --> 01:27:30,966
(suspenseful music)

1520
01:27:59,502 --> 01:28:01,316
- [Voiceover] We knew right then and there

1521
01:28:01,316 --> 01:28:03,556
it was Cy's last pitch.

1522
01:28:03,556 --> 01:28:07,432
His hall of fame career
was over at the age of 14.

1523
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:11,016
He had two pitches left in
that rocket of an arm of his.

1524
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:12,942
And he used them up on his brother,

1525
01:28:12,942 --> 01:28:14,947
some would say, senselessly.

1526
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:16,560
But not Joe.

1527
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,893
It was time, and he knew it.

1528
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:29,769
- Yeah!

1529
01:28:32,038 --> 01:28:35,205
(inspirational music)

1530
01:29:12,336 --> 01:29:13,169
- Truce?

1531
01:29:16,844 --> 01:29:17,677
- Truce.

1532
01:29:22,337 --> 01:29:23,504
- Lucky pitch.

1533
01:29:25,016 --> 01:29:27,266
- No, it was a great pitch.

1534
01:29:30,928 --> 01:29:31,761
Hold this.

1535
01:29:36,236 --> 01:29:37,069
Here.

1536
01:29:44,995 --> 01:29:46,245
You deserve it.

1537
01:29:52,707 --> 01:29:54,196
And so that was it.

1538
01:29:54,196 --> 01:29:55,943
An arm for some sanity.

1539
01:29:55,943 --> 01:29:57,411
A long, long road,

1540
01:29:57,411 --> 01:29:59,460
but a fair trade, I'm sure.

1541
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,308
And so, as my mom likes to say,

1542
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:02,999
good comes from bad.

1543
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:05,598
And if you really believe
good can come from bad,

1544
01:30:05,598 --> 01:30:08,622
even a tragedy can have a happy ending.

1545
01:30:08,622 --> 01:30:09,789
Let's hope so.

1546
01:30:11,164 --> 01:30:13,747
(ball banging)

1547
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:17,750
And oh yeah, Joey never did pitch again,

1548
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,161
but he did take up soccer.

1549
01:30:19,161 --> 01:30:21,177
And the man with the golden arm

1550
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:24,094
became the man with the golden leg.

1551
01:30:33,339 --> 01:30:37,212
♫ Been such a long time

1552
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:41,210
