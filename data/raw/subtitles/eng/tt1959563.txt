00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,246
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

175
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,807
[Moreno] Mr. Kincaid,
this is Interpol's offer.

176
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,102
In return for your testimony
against former President Dukhovich,

177
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,647
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions.

178
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,652
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?

179
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,013
That's mighty fucking white of you.

180
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,742
[Harr] Assuming we accept this arrangement

181
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,118
for Sonia Kincaid,

182
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,413
there's still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client.

183
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
He will receive

184
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,216
this letter recommending leniency.

185
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,384
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

186
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,887
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries.

187
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,680
Absent a legitimate deal,

188
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,266
he will never breathe free air again.
Under no...

189
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,859
Sonia goes free.

190
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,835
[Moreno] We're all set, Director Casoria.

191
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,491
Let's get this gentleman to The Hague.

192
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,576
[door buzzing]

193
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,044
[Casoria] Mr. Kincaid,
this is Agent Roussel.

194
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,272
She'll be leading a security detail,

195
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,424
which will escort you
to the International Criminal Court.

196
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,388
You know, Dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness brought against them,

197
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,391
and my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?

198
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,186
These are the most highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

199
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,938
We have taken every precaution

200
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,732
to make sure that your involvement
is completely classified.

201
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,442
It's a secret?

202
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,112
That makes me feel so much better.

203
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,724
[Garrett] Well, I can assure you,

204
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,365
even if there was an attempt,

205
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,385
we're more than prepared for any assault.

206
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,411
- [laughs]
- [grunts]

207
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,955
You prepared for that assault,
motherfucker?

208
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:12,459
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

209
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,421
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.

210
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:20,301
That gives us 27 hours to transport
you from Manchester to the Netherlands.

211
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,889
If you want to help your wife,
you should get moving.

212
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,351
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,

213
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,687
let's see what these elite troops
of yours can do.

214
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,354
Come on, guys, let's go.

215
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
[Casoria] Agent Roussel,

216
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,487
I don't have to remind
you of the importance of this.

217
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,741
- No, ma'am.
- And don't doubt what he's capable of.

218
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,491
I won't, sir.

219
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,622
[engine starting]

220
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,461
[tires screeching]

221
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,469
[indistinct radio chatter]

222
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,176
- [agent] <i>Take a left on Kirkland Avenue.</i>
- [driver] <i>Yes.</i>

223
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,694
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets,

224
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,780
buildings nice and close,

225
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,699
lots of great views
from all those windows.

226
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,326
This route's been wiped clean for us.

227
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,410
Nothing to worry about.

228
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,870
[chuckles] Is that right?

229
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,705
How's that nose of yours doing?

230
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,568
[agent on radio] <i>Take a diversion route.</i>

231
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,511
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?
Significant other?

232
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,846
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.

233
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,015
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time

234
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,226
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.

235
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:58,274
[chuckles] Relax, motherfucker.

236
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,818
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.

237
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,445
[Darius chuckling]

238
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,572
[agent on radio] <i>Two-two-one,
ten-four en route.</i>

239
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,681
- [brakes squealing]
- [agent] Fuck!

240
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,141
[in Russian] Cover me!

241
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,350
[agent] Move! Move!

242
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,982
[groans]

243
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,972
[mercenary in Russian] Cover me!

244
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,113
[indistinct yelling]

245
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,906
[distorted gunfire]

246
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,417
[shouting indistinctly]

247
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,756
[Garrett] Move! Move!
Go! Get that door open!

248
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,967
Go! Go! Alpha Squad, with me!

249
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,345
Agent Roberts, protect the witness!

250
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,518
Parker, take the left flank!

251
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,563
[gunfire continues]

252
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,783
[Garrett] Shit! We need more backup!

253
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,537
[mercenary in Russian] Follow me!

254
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,039
- [gun clicks]
- Fuck!

255
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:41,918
[tires squealing]

256
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,188
[agent] Agent Roussel!
God damn it, somebody!

257
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,564
We need backup n...

258
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,071
Turn around!

259
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,281
[in Russian] It's ready!

260
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,491
[in Russian] Come on!

261
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,420
Lay down some cover fire.

262
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,193
[groans]

263
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,448
[groans]

264
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,032
[panting]

265
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,285
Fuck! [grunts]

266
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,287
[alarms ringing]

267
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,040
[grunting]

268
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,140
- [Amelia] Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

269
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,435
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

270
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,270
Interpol's compromised. You know that.

271
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,773
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.

272
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
[groans]

273
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,446
[men shouting indistinctly]

274
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,467
[Darius] We gotta get off the street.

275
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,371
[Amelia] There's a safe house
not far from here.

276
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,412
- [helicopter overhead]
- [sirens wailing]

277
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,809
[reporter] <i>As a car bomb has
exploded in Bishopgate Green,</i>

278
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,913
<i>- near Coventry City Center...</i>
- [cell phone ringing]

279
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,675
[grunts] Don't even think
about answering that fucking phone!

280
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,558
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route

281
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,430
was if he had somebody on the inside.

282
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,642
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

283
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,602
So, if you're gonna call somebody,

284
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,896
they have to be totally out of the loop.

285
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,203
[Michael] I've had
the Black Diamond service

286
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,694
four times now, you understand?

287
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,364
Four times. The car still
smells like a cemetery.

288
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,534
Are you washing the car with old assholes?

289
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,678
- [cell phone ringing]
- Or... [stammers]

290
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,079
Just help me to understand.

291
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,790
Just a second here.

292
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,669
Hello, Amelia.

293
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,629
I'm texting you an address in Coventry.

294
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,440
You need to get there immediately.

295
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,383
Bring three units of O-negative blood.

296
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,386
I'm doing very well, thank you.
How are you?

297
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,721
[sighs] I don't have
the time for this, Michael.

298
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,431
I have a job I need you to do.

299
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,810
- Pass.
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.

300
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,353
I have a job you're going to do.

301
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,730
<i>I'm not gonna let you charm me
into this one, Amelia.</i>

302
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,232
Okay, let's be clear.

303
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,335
I'm not any happier about this
than you are,

304
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,610
but I don't have a choice.

305
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,571
Well, thank God I do.

306
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,071
<i>No, Michael, you don't.</i>

307
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,324
<i>Because if you're not
where I need you to be,</i>

308
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,410
<i>I'm going to expose
you and your work to Interpol.</i>

309
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,496
That elite Triple-A status
you want back so badly,

310
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,635
- I'll make sure you never get near it.
- You're threatening me now?

311
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,835
Not you, her. Are you threatening...

312
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,078
You can't just threaten me
into taking orders from you.

313
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,066
I guess we'll see. You're three hours
away. I'll see you in two and a half.

314
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,718
Three... Okay, okay.
I guess we will. Jesus Christ.

315
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,596
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?

316
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,247
We're gonna take the car out in the front,
and then burn it.

317
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,683
[people shouting indistinctly]

318
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,518
[agent] This place is like a war zone.

319
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,061
We got bodies everywhere.

320
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,980
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.

321
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,523
Get those guys IDed.

322
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,483
And I've got no sign of Agent Roussel.

323
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,570
Maybe 15 to 20
dead mercenaries, heavily armed.

324
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,572
Media circus is in town.

325
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,236
That's not the worst of it.

326
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,825
[camera shutter clicking]

327
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,285
Kincaid is gone.

328
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,748
Coventry, every available agent.

329
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,875
Report back to me with any updates.

330
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,208
[agent] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

331
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,877
There must've been a leak.

332
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,342
I told you, there are too many
agencies involved.

333
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,550
Get to The Hague.

334
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,405
See what you can get out of Dukhovich.

335
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,845
I'll try.

336
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,349
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.

337
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,727
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

338
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,226
Got it.

339
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,405
[door lock buzzing]

340
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,795
[guard] Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

341
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,293
Did I tell you you could turn around?

342
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,446
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?

343
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,657
Baby, baby, it's me.

344
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,951
[chuckling] My bad.

345
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,744

00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,981
Is this something
I need to know right now?

521
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,971
No, not normally.
But, yes, it should be vacant.

522
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,324
[Casoria] <i>And you believe it's not?</i>

523
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,183
[agent] <i>Well, the access code
was activated</i>

524
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,809
<i>without identity authorization.</i>

525
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,454
[Casoria]
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?

526
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,021
But it's on a revolving encryption.

527
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,399
Get a team over there. Now!

528
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,194
And where is Agent Roussel?

529
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:02,987
<i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

530
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,071
Good luck.

531
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,456
I believe I know where Kincaid is.

532
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,090
[all speaking Russian]

533
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:27,928
[driver scoffs]

534
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,861
What the fuck is all this?

535
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,112
You're a fugitive.

536
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,572
Fugitives wear restraints.

537
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,116
No, no, no, not the cuffs.

538
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:51,035
I'm talking about these whack-ass,
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

539
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,485
Yeah, luckily I brought extra.

540
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,080
[scoffs] Lucky for who?

541
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,333
Shit. Am I wearing underwear?

542
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:00,062
Those are for me too,
in case I have to change your pants again.

543
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,379
Not a fan.

544
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,631
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

545
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,650
How about we never speak of this again?

546
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,176
[phone ringing]

547
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,266
Shit. Interpol protocol.

548
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,131
When that phone rings and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers to the door.

549
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,790
- [sirens wailing]
- And there they are.

550
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,024
[tires squealing]

551
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,386
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.

552
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:26,528
Comfy?

553
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,696
[Darius] So, what happened
to little Miss Interpol?

554
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:30,146
[Michael] Agent Roussel's gone.

555
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,536
[Darius] Damn! I liked her. She's spunky.

556
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,431
This building has two stairwells,

557
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:36,724
- no fire escapes...
- No fire escapes

558
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,166
and no adjacent rooftops.

559
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,644
You know, you're not the only
observant motherfucker on the planet.

560
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,836
I go through doors first.

561
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,796
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.

562
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,673
Really? You think that's necessary?

563
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,927
- My job is to keep you out of harm's way.
- [chuckling] Shit, motherfucker.

564
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,764
I am harm's way.

565
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:56,267
[mercenaries shouting indistinctly]

566
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,977
[speaking Russian]

567
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,905
[whispers] Two hostiles, maybe more.

568
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,740
I don't suppose I could have a gun?

569
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,992
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell. Let's go.

570
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,285
Fuck!

571
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,622
[all grunting]

572
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,294
- [in Russian] It's him!
- Come on!

573
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,803
Thank God you're here.

574
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,770
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

575
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:36,349
Well done. Guess what happens now?

576
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,851
Shots fired! Shots fired!

577
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,535
<i>All units sending in nine-nine.</i>

578
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,082
Now we have a new problem.

579
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,544
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

580
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,712
[speaking Russian]

581
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:10,882
[all grunting]

582
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,973
See? Boring is better.

583
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,560
[exhales]

584
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,396
Okay. That's very loud.

585
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,565
It was empty anyway.

586
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,608
[helicopter hovering]

587
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,363
<i>We're identifying
heat signatures on the rooftop</i>

588
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,781
<i>moving in a northbound direction.</i>

589
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,867
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

590
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,246
No, no, no. No odds in that jump.

591
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,558
It beats the hell out of whatever's
gonna come through that door.

592
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,542
No. Just gotta...

593
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,753
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way...

594
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,423
[groaning]

595
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,676
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit!

596
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,096
Holy fucking shit.

597
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,266
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!

598
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,560
- They're on the north side!
- Copy that!

599
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,854
[laughing and coughing]

600
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,028
Made that jump on one leg.

601
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,697
I made that jump
without jumping. Let's go.

602
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,361
So, what's your next trick,

603
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,534
showing me how we escape without escaping?

604
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:21,258
Let's just try to get to the car
without killing anyone, all right?

605
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,624
- [Darius laughs] Is this your car?
- [Michael] One of them.

606
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,393
[Darius] I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.

607
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,294
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

608
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,295
I want you strapped in.

609
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,547
I'm more worried
about the wheels coming off this bitch

610
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,633
when you reach the speed limit. [chuckles]

611
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:35,801
Back in the day,

612
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,845
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit,

613
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,889
and we stole everything.
I remember one night...

614
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,558
I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,

615
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,662
your father in and out of prison,
you following in the same footsteps.

616
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,939
[laughs]
Did your little research, did you?

617
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,316
Prepare for a test,
there are no surprises.

618
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,277
And you grew up wanting to be a cop

619
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,363
till you found out
wasn't no money in that shit.

620
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,074
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

621
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,867
then decided to open your own shop,

622
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,911
pimp yourself out to the fat cats.

623
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,789
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.

624
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,896
It's written all over your punk-ass.

625
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,544
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next.
That's great.

626
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:12,754
You know, why don't...

627
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,318
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted.

628
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,176
Get comfortable.

629
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,553
That's a good idea. [groans]

630
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,473
[sniffing]

631
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,309
Smells like ass back here!

632
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:28,604
Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.

633
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,482
These your electrolytes?

634
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,319
[Darius laughing]

635
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,618
[laughing continues]

636
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,333
- [siren wailing]
- [indistinct chattering]

637
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,047
[both speaking Russian]

638
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,805
[Casoria] Facial recognition
identifies this man

639
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,390
as Michael Bryce.

640
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,226
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?

641
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,353
You two have a history.

642
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,439
Long time ago.

643
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,733
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house,

644
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:14,984
then brought in this...

645
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,695
Executive protection agent?

646
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:24,660
Official channels had been compromised.
What did you expect me to do?

647
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,163
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.

648
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,624
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.

649
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,251
I'm placing you on leave.

650
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,837
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.

651
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,981
- [scoffs]
- You are going to be telling

652
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,758
this story for years, Amelia,

653
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,135
from inside a very large office

654
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,387
or a very small cell.

655
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,682
Well, [sighs] I like my odds.

656
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,340
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague

657
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,298
is if they kill each other first.

658
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,190
[Foucher] Amelia.

659
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,943
She's making a mistake.

660
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,987
We need to plug our leak.

661
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,115
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?

662
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,326
With something like this, yes.

663
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:07,870
I'll speak to Casoria,

664
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,456
get her to allow you to come
to The Hague with us.

665
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,583
But no more secrets.

666
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,002
Thank you, sir.

667
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,848
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.

668
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,911
[Michael] They'll have identified the car
with the traffic cams by now.

669
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,354
And you. Welcome to fugitive life.

670
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,054
[Michael] Until I turn you in.

671
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,233
Just need to find a different vehicle,

672
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,569
older model, no alarm. Right here.

673
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,156
Luckily, I came prepared.

674
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,867
You know, if you're gonna be a while,
I can just go in there and get a room.

675
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,539
There's an art to low-impact,

676
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:54,917
high-efficiency
breaking and entering, but...

677
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,252
[groans]

678
00:38:58,963 --> 00:38:59,964
Art's subjective.

679
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,130
And you're bleeding again.

680
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,528
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,

681
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,595
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

682
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,849
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people, I protect them.

683
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,225
Hector Ramirez.

684
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,979
[chuckles] Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

685
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,397
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

686
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,399
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

687
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:19,567
And you killed him.

688
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,069
No. I saved my client.

689
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,548
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.

690
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing.

691
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,659
I was a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent.

692
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:31,162
- You just made up that Triple-A shit.
- No, I did not!

693
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,122
And if guys like you...

how does a so-called expert assassin

You're a real double threat.

Agent Roussel and I
aren't any of your concern.

She didn't dump me.

Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you.

I'm just perusing all the reasons why,

739

of those motherfuckers.

- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

I know what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply here!

And not jumping off the top of a roof,
that's logical, that's safe.

You know, wearing a seatbelt:

Let me ask you something,
how many times have you been shot?

- Counting today?
- Yeah.

746
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,253
- Too many to count. You?
- Yeah, I bet.

Zero.

This was a little flesh wound.

You never even took one for a client?

Nope. Never had to.

Yeah, but the question is, would you?

See, if I'm paying Triple-A rates,

Being prepared for everything
