1
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,814
Last tour of the day.

2
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,096
I wonder why nobody wants them.

3
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,685
Bull's-eye.

4
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,744
- Hi, super old guy!
- A museum? Again?

5
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,652
I hate stuff.

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,542
- Oh, boy.
- It's okay, Thomas.

7
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,574
I'll take them.

8
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,536
Are you sure? I think these
are the "detention" kids.

9
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:38,532
Don't you worry. I can handle them.

10
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,462
- You go take your break.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,224
Follow me, kids.

12
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,146
Yo, lady! The museum door is that way.

13
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,807
Yes, it is, but you aren't
like the other kids.

14
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:59,316
Oh, no, no, no. You need
to see something special.

15
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,567
Right through that door.

16
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,243
You're seeing things, lady.

17
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,795
Am I? Or are you not seeing things?

18
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:13,051
Come on.

19
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:26,463
Now, today is November 2nd. Does anyone
here know why that date is important?

20
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,174
- Taco Tuesday!
- No.

21
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,984
"Gorge yourself on Halloween candy" day?

22
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:35,596
Nope. Today is The Day of the Dead.

23
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:38,856
Wait. Is that national
zombie day or something?

24
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,815
You can't go this way!
You will get us both in trouble.

25
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:48,402
Ancient rules of the...
museum administration.

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,592
Well, I suppose I could
turn a blind eye, my...

27
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,493
Dear.

28
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:03,221
Behold, children,
the glorious beauty of Mexico!

29
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,013
This place is loco.

30
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,066
So many skulls!

31
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,146
At least that part isn't lame.

32
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:30,027
- What is this book?
- That is the Book of Life.

33
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,154
All the world is made of stories...

34
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,233
and all of those stories are right here.

35
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,843
This book holds many truths.

36
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,580
Some are actually true.

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,142
"The battle of Cinco de Mayo"?

38
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:48,170
Mayo! I love Mayo.

39
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,506
And some, not so much.

40
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,426
El chupacabras,
the legendary goat sucker?

41
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,436
I have to get one.

42
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,531
Now, although you may doubt
some of these stories...

43
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:02,025
there is one thing that
we know for certain.

44
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,229
Mexico is the center of the universe.

45
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,973
And long ago, in the center of Mexico...

46
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:11,043
was the quaint little town of San Angel.

47
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:14,203
Churros! Churros!

48
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,615
Frosted churros!

49
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,077
Now, naturally, since San Angel
was the center of the universe...

50
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:24,248
directly below it lay...
the Land of the Remembered.

51
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,461
A festive and magical place

52
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,420
for those who live on in the
memories of their loved ones.

53
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,432
And below that...
lies the Land of the Forgotten.

54
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,619
The sad and lonely destination
for those poor souls...

55
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,263
who are no longer remembered.

56
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,391
But before I can properly
begin our story...

57
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,603
you need to meet the two
magical rulers of these realms.

58
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,482
- Who is that?
- That is La Muerte.

59
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,318
She is made out of sweet sugar candy.

60
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,238
- She's so pretty.
- She is, isn't she?

61
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:00,576
She loves all mankind and believes
that their hearts are pure and true.

62
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,995
And that is Xibalba.

63
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:08,225
That charming rascal thinks mankind
is not so pure, just like him.

64
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:09,927
He looks spooky.

65
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:13,564
Yes, he's made out of tar and
everything icky in the whole world.

66
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,671
He's so... pretty.

67
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,767
What about the weirdo with the beard-o?

68
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,576
That is the Candle Maker.
He keeps everything in balance.

69
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:28,462
He's made out of wax and
has a beard full of clouds.

70
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,772
Clouds?

71
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,316
All right. Let me show
you something else.

72
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,318
All of these wooden figures here...

73
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,879
they represent real people in
our story, just like you and me.

74
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:44,108
And so, our tale begins on the
day the people of Mexico call...

75
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,121
The Day of the Dead.

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,974
- No retreat.
- No surrender!

77
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:54,421
On this festive, enchanted day...

78
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,424
families bring food and offerings
to the altars of their beloved.

79
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,512
- It's like a hundred birthday parties.
- Yes, it is.

80
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:06,266
And on this particular Day of the Dead
after centuries of being banished...

81
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,268
Xibalba had had enough.

82
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,975
Really, my dear you have
no idea how cold and vile

83
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:14,536
the Land of the Forgotten has become.

84
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,457
Just like your heart, Xibalba.
Just like your heart.

85
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
Why must I rule a bleak wasteland

86
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:28,455
while you enjoy the endless fiesta
in the Land of the Remembered?

87
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,165
It's simply unfair.

88
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,335
- Xibalba!
- What? It's his time.

89
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,438
- More or less.
- Not today, my love.

90
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:41,350
Come on, my dear.
Trade lands with me. I beg you!

91
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,139
You're so cute when you beg.

92
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:49,476
- I'm serious. I hate it down there.
- Hey. You're there because you cheated!

93
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,856
You made your bed with that wager.

94
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,850
You're not the man I fell in love
with all those centuries ago.

95
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,330
Let's not dwell in the past, <i>mi amor</i>.

96
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,906
Anyway, I was thinking...

97
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,075
How about another little wager?

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,285
You think you can calm the flames
of my anger with another bet?

99
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,055
What exactly did you have in mind?

100
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,618
Let's check out the
menu for the evening.

101
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:21,887
Look there, my love.
Classic mortal dilemma.

102
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,727
Two boys. Best friends, no less.

103
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,765
In love with the same girl.

104
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,665
Fear not, señorita.
Your hero has arrived!

105
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,060
Is that so?

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
How dare you interrupt a guitarrista?

107
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,949
- The girl is mine.
- Never!

108
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,709
She is mine.

109
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,970
I belong to no one.

110
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:56,994
I believe we have our wager.
Which boy will marry her?

111
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:58,294
Very well.

112
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,679
We will each choose one of
these boys as our champion.

113
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:06,470
Let's go wish them luck.

114
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,641
- Maria, weren't you grounded?
- My father is overreacting.

115
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,941
How was I supposed to know
that chickens don't like baths?

116
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,940
Don't worry. He knows a real
man is protecting you tonight.

117
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,776
- You're not even close.
- But I have a moustache.

118
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,236
Yeah, just like your grandma.

119
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,081
- Maria.
- Manolo!

120
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,592
Come, <i>mijo</i>.

121
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:41,358
Your mother would be so proud of you.

122
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,592
- You think she'll come back tonight?
- Carmen is here.

123
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,642
But it's more like...

124
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,071
like a warm feeling you get
when loved ones are with you.

125
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:57,152
All of these families have lost someone.
But as long as we remember them...

126
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:02,002
We can feel their presence with
us for one night each year.

127
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,709
I just thought I might
see her one more time.

128
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,091
She always smelled like flowers.

129
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,803
I remember her singing.

130
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,337
She was a good woman, that one.

131
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,017
I miss her so much.

132
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:30,025
Just be still, and you can feel it.

133
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:35,517
Your mother is here,
along with all our ancestors.

134
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,563
As long as we remember them,
they are with us.

135
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:44,283
The moment we forget them,
they are truly gone.

136
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,905
I can feel them.

137
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:54,197
Kind people, may I please have a
bit of your bread? I am so hungry.

138
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,897
I'm sure mama would want
you to have it. Right, Papá?

139
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:04,254
Thank you, my dear.
In return, you have my blessing.

140
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,525
May your heart be always
pure and courageous.

141
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,516
- What do we say, Manolo?
- Thank you, señora. Thank you.

142
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:17,570
Manolo. Always giving away
stuff for free. Right, Dad?

143
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,402
Joaquin's father, Captain Mondragon,

144
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,371
had passed away fighting the
fearsome bandit known as Chakal.

145
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,747
Who's in there?

146
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,632
Young sir, may I please
have some of your bread?

147
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,415
I'm so hungry.

148
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,169
This bread is for my father.
And it's delicious.

149
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,969
Well, perhaps you would
consider a trade?

150
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:51,068
An old medal? Please.

151
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:53,637
This is no ordinary medal, my boy.

152
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,907
As long as you wear it,
you cannot be hurt.

153
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:00,144
And it will give you
immeasurable courage.

154
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,740
Really? Deal.

155
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:07,109
But keep it hidden.

156
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,823
There is a bandit king who would
stop at nothing to get it back.

157
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,134
Bandit king? You mean Chakal?

158
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,232
Where did he go?

159
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,459
So, then, if my boy marries the girl...

160
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,462
I will finally rule the
Land of the Remembered.

161
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:31,312
And if my boy marries
the girl, you will...

162
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,211
You will stop interfering
with the affairs of man!

163
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:35,101
What?

164
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:39,110
I can't do that! Come on.
It's the only fun I ever get!

165
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,943
Then the bet is off.

166
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:48,076
Very well, my dear.
By the ancient rules...

167
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,195
The wager is set.

168
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,505
And, so, the greatest
wager in history began.

169
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,368
Manolo versus Joaquin
for the hand of Maria.

170
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,914
Wait. So these ancient gods
picked three little kids to...

171
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,999
Represent the whole world?

172
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:08,506
- Yeah. Pretty crazy, right?
- Yeah! Keep going, lady.

173
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,482
You're so cute.

174
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,993
Oh, no. Not on my watch.

175
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,960
We have to free the animals!

176
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,076
Come on, you guys! Let's do this!

177
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,919
- Yeah!
- Hold on, Maria. Don't!

178
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:48,127
People of San Angel, please! I beg you.

179
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,753
After the revolution...

180
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:55,063
we need more volunteers
to join this mighty brigade!

181
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:05,507
A heroic brigade to
protect us from Chakal.

182
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,702
Chakal is here!

183
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:18,255
Freedom!

184
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,165
Maria, what have you done now?

185
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,765
Freedom is coming through!

186
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,220
Stop!

187
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,284
Oh, no!

188
00:13:58,555 --> 00:13:59,655
Oh, dear.

189
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,254
- No retreat.
- No surrender.

190
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,365
<i>Toro. Toro.</i>

191
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,639
He has the gift.

192
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,246
Great form, mijo.

193
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,042
That's my son!

194
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,550
- Thank you, Manolo.
- Gracias

195
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,216
Oh, my. What did I miss?

196
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,556
You okay, sir?

197
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,790
- You have saved my life.
- And I...

198
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,532
Quiet, boy. I'm talking.

199
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:07,732
- But I...
- Quiet.

200
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,242
That girl is in so much trouble!

201
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,318
Maria!

202
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,572
I'm sorry, Papá. It's just that I...

203
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,122
Manolo's guitar.

204
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,412
Maria! This rebellious
nonsense ends now!

205
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,665
- You are going to become a proper lady.
- Why?

206
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,585
Because I said so!
I'm sending you to Spain.

207
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:39,256
The sisters at the Convent of the Perpetual
Flame of Purity will straighten you out.

208
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,841
- What?
- But, Papá!

209
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,601
No. It is decided. Now go home!

210
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,439
Joaquin, you are so
much like your father.

211
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,402
This town could use a new hero.

212
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,910
Come.

213
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,442
You are like the son I never had.

214
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,242
My boy, your father was
like a brother to me.

215
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:12,372
- <i>Epa</i>! Where do you think you're going?
- He can't send Maria away.

216
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:17,009
Well, fathers do what's best
for their children. Come along.

217
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:21,101
<i>Mijo,</i>

218
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:25,719
I saw how you fought that beast.
You made our ancestors proud.

219
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,267
- Do you think Maria was impressed?
- Maria and every girl in town.

220
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:33,352
People said I was the greatest
bullfighter in our family's history...

221
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,992
But it is you, my son, who will
be the greatest Sanchez ever!

222
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,267
They will write songs about you!

223
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,159
- And I will sing them!
- Wait, what?

224
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,334
I will sing them.

225
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,245
Son, music is not work fit
for a Sanchez bullfighter.

226
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,915
- But I want to be a musician.
- No. You must focus.

227
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:59,217
Your training begins at once. Your grandpa,
Luis, taught me when I was about your age.

228
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,313
Wait, isn't that when that
bull put you in a coma?

229
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,346
Memories. My only son fighting angry,
thousand-pound beasts.

230
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:13,398
- The family tradition continues.
- Yay.

231
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,275
And so, the day came when Maria
would leave to study abroad.

232
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,002
The three amigos would be no more.

233
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:31,172
<i>Adios, Maria</i>

234
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,750
Adios, mijita. Write soon.

235
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,843
I'm going to go over there.

236
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,379
I'm gonna miss you guys.

237
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,590
We'll be here, waiting.

238
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,550
For as long as it takes.

239
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,560
Don't ever stop playing, okay?

240
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,724
And you. Don't you ever stop
fighting for what's right.

241
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,727
I got you a present.
You should probably open it now.

242
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,857
Wait a second. We were
supposed to bring gifts?

243
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,906
I named him Chuy. He'll look after you.

244
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,616
I remember you.

245
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:14,953
I figured you needed a little
part of town to go with you.

246
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,183
Thank you.

247
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:18,665
Seriously, no one told
me about bringing gifts.

248
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,045
Can you hold Chuy for me?

249
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,261
This is to make up for
breaking your guitar.

250
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,233
All aboard!

251
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,397
I gotta go.

252
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,366
Don't forget me!

253
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,897
Maria! Your bonnet!

254
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:00,473
Maria!

255
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,880
When you come back I will sing for you!

256
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,100
And I will fight for you!

257
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,731
It would be years before
they would see Maria again.

258
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,079
I will wait for you.

259
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,120
<i>I'll be bold</i>

260
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,198
<i>As well as strong</i>

261
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,993
- One, two, three.
- <i>And use my head</i>

262
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,803
<i>Alongside my heart</i>

263
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>So tame my flesh</i>

264
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,588
<i>- And fix my eyes</i>
- One, two, three! One, two, three!

265
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:51,441
<i>A tethered mind</i>

266
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,481
<i>Freed from the lies</i>

267
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,218
<i>- And I'll kneel down</i>
- One, two, three! One, two, three!

268
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:05,063
- <i>Wait for now</i>
- Hey, Manny!

269
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,693
<i>I kneel down</i>

270
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,583
- <i>Know my ground</i>
- Yes! Just like your father!

271
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:21,835
<i>- 'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you</i>
- And that's how you finish a bull!

272
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:28,342
<i>And I will wait, I will wait for you</i>

273
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:35,176
<i>And I will wait, I will wait for you</i>

274
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,058
<i>I will wait, I will...</i>

275
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,061
- I will not wait for you!
- Papá, I was on my way.

276
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:48,201
After years of training, Manolo's father
organized his first bullfight

277
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:52,319
which, as luck would have it...
was on the day that Maria returned.

278
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,670
Wait, Papá!

279
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,024
Playing all night with
those mariachis brothers!

280
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,213
You want to end up like those bozos?

281
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,578
Okay, Manny, we'll wait outside.

282
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,856
- I don't think Mr. Sanchez likes us.
- You think?

283
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,376
Quiet, you lazy bums!

284
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,087
You live under my roof.
You live under my rules.

285
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:13,215
- You will be a matador!
- Papá, this is my life.

286
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,760
All the Sanchezes are bullfighters!

287
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,730
Every single one of us.

288
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,776
I was a beast in the arena. A beast!

289
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:30,273
It's in your blood. It's your destiny.
How many times do I have to say it?

290
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,818
This is not me. This is you.

291
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,654
My son, Joaquin may be
the hero of the town

292
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,449
but today, you will be
the hero of the ring.

293
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,827
If, for once,
you actually finish the bull.

294
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,447
But he finished the bull
the other day in practice!

295
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:46,347
<i>Venga, toro!</i>

296
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:50,919
- That did no count.
- No. Killing the bull is wrong.

297
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,299
Here we go again.

298
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,800
Kids today, with their long
hair and their no killing stuff.

299
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,735
- I'm out of here.
- Don't you love your family?

300
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:08,106
Then go get that bull, mijo.
Don't dishonor our name.

301
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:16,079
Just be a Sanchez!

302
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,116
Mijo... He no gonna do it.

303
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,127
Hey, Manolo!

304
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:27,456
- No retreat.
- No surrender.

305
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,722
The hero of San Angel returns!

306
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:33,003
Oh, come on. You didn't think I was gonna
miss your first little bullfight, did you?

307
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,473
And Maria's here, too!

308
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,441
Have you seen her? I cannot
wait to show her these babies.

309
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:41,045
- So, she's back only to see you?
- Come on. That's not...

310
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:43,680
You have your medals,
but I have the bullring.

311
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,480
We'll see which Maria prefers.

312
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,769
It's a good thing you're finally
taking bullfighting seriously.

313
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,606
You should see me in the bullring.
That's where I really do my thing now.

314
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,486
A true Sanchez man.

315
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,742
Those are some big shadows
we live under, buddy?

316
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,085
Huge.

317
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,166
Hey, brother,
may the best man win Maria.

318
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,434
Joaquin!

319
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:10,541
In honor of Maria's return from Europe

320
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,645
the town received a rare
visit from its most noble son...

321
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,914
who was now a decorated hero.

322
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:22,024
They say Joaquin goes from town
to town saving them from bandits!

323
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:38,327
Yes! That's my boy.

324
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:46,334
Afternoon, my General.
That is a mighty moustache you have.

325
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:57,504
As expected everyone in town was curious
to see how the young Maria had grown.

326
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,840
The jewel of the town has returned.

327
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,760
And she's going to be
helping at the orphanage.

328
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,764
And I hear she
reads books, like, for fun.

329
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:07,984
No way!

330
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,172
Señorita Posada.

331
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,030
Hola, Joaquin.
It's really nice to see you.

332
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:20,409
And she's so natural!

333
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,871
What?

334
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,427
And they say Manolo might be
the greatest Sanchez ever!

335
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:41,223
Yeah! That's my boy! What?

336
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:44,368
I would like to dedicate this corrida...

337
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:46,518
To miss Maria Posada.

338
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,336
welcome home, señorita.

339
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:59,254
- I'm allergic to dying!
- Especially in the face!

340
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:04,863
<i>Venga, torote. Venga.</i>

341
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:09,168
<i>Venga!</i>

342
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:21,747
Now, that's a Sanchez!

343
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,100
Manolo!

344
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,507
<i>Olé.</i>

345
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,529
That's my son!

346
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,549
<i>Olé.</i>

347
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:05,215
Manolo! Manolo!

348
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:12,231
Come on, mijo.

349
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:17,146
For me. For our family. Be a Sanchez!

350
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,220
No.

351
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,091
Killing the bull is wrong!

352
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:54,234
See? I told you he no do it.

353
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,569
Bravo! Bravo!

354
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,063
We don't have to kill the bull!

355
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,113
Oh, no. Manolo.

356
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,148
Adios, Maria.

357
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,120
Manolo. Manolo. Get up!

358
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,578
- I'm sorry, Papá.
- Do not make it worse by apologizing!

359
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:20,783
- A Sanchez man never apologizes! Never!
- Ever.

360
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:23,669
If being a bullfighter means...

361
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,921
it means killing the bull...

362
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,924
Well, then, I'm no bullfighter.

363
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:32,394
No. You are no Sanchez.

364
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,986
Victory!

365
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:53,073
That poor kid never had a chance,
my dear. Good game, though.

366
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,083
It's not over.

367
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,923
Ay, Maria.

368
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,710
<i>When you were here before</i>

369
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,551
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

370
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,723
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

371
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,400
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

372
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,480
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

373
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,991
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

374
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:33,333
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

375
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:38,131
<i>I don't belong here</i>

376
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:44,887
<i>I don't belong</i>

377
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,011
- Manolo.
- Maria!

378
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,642
What just happened?

379
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,863
You don't know women, my love.

380
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,478
That night, General Posada threw a
grand party to welcome Maria back.

381
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,981
But, you see, he had bigger plans.

382
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,483
To Joaquin!

383
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,402
A great hero!

384
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,737
Too bad you're just in
town for a few days.

385
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:17,074
If only there were something
that would make you stay...

386
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,077
like a special girl. Maria?

387
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,876
- Papá!
- What? What I say?

388
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:27,709
Oh, my father.

389
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,380
It's so wonderful to
see you again, Joaquin.

390
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,509
Look at that mustache.
And all those medals.

391
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:38,679
- What's this one for?
- Nothing! Nothing, nothing.

392
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:39,809
What? I didn't...

393
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:46,703
Why don't... Why don't you tell
me a little more about Europa?

394
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:52,664
I loved it. Such beautiful music
and art and books. It was wonderful.

395
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:58,323
Books, art, wonderfulness. You sound
like you've learned so much, Maria.

396
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:02,286
I'm sure one day you are going to
make a man very, very, very happy.

397
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,955
And I hope that man's mustache,
or his medals...

398
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:09,126
- makes you very, very, very, very happy.
- Oh, is that so?

399
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:15,411
Well, yes. Behind every man with an
amazing mustache is a beautiful woman.

400
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:21,396
Oh, yes. And I'll cook and clean
for him and be at his beck and call.

401
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:25,434
That sounds so good.
That just sounds so good.

402
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,784
- And you sound... you're just so pretty.
- Are you kidding me?

403
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,314
Oh, boy.

404
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,324
Is that how you see a woman?

405
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,292
We're only here to make men happy?

406
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,253
Yeah.

407
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,158
So, I don't know.

408
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,261
I believe I have lost my appetite.

409
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:46,989
No, please, please, stay seated.

410
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:51,168
Now, if you will just excuse me,
I must go check on Chuy.

411
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,128
That's my pig.

412
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,138
I need to spend time
with someone civilized.

413
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:58,623
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

414
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,799
You've picked yourself a feisty one.

415
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:05,974
Good one, Joaquin! Very witty.

416
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,284
I can't believe the General
invited the whole town!

417
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,448
Except for you, Manolo.

418
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:14,650
- Sorry, bro.
- He even invited us.

419
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,660
And he hates us.

420
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,196
It's hopeless. I've lost her to Joaquin.

421
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,360
Okay, okay. Listen, listen. All we got to
do is play the right song, and trust me,

422
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,261
everything will turn around
in the space of four bars.

423
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:29,573
We've already been to four bars! Twice!

424
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:32,543
Hold it. I know exactly what to play.

425
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,003
It has to be romantic and classy...

426
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,683
but with tons of dignity.

427
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:46,390
<i>You, you got what I need</i>

428
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,226
<i>But you say he's just a friend</i>

429
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,395
<i>But you say he's just a friend</i>

430
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:53,495
<i>Oh, baby, you...</i>

431
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:59,778
Wow, that totally captivated her.

432
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:03,540
- I don't get it. That one always works.
- Even on my wife.

433
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,917
Wait. You're married?

434
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:09,121
I got it! Follow my lead.

435
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:13,058
<i>If you want my body
and you think I'm sexy</i>

436
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:15,678
<i>Mami vamos, let me know</i>

437
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,227
Very romantic, Pepe.

438
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,935
- That's all I got, mang.
- Okay, my turn!

439
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:35,235
One, two, one, two, tres, cuatro!

440
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:39,703
- That girl is way out of your league, bro.
- Hey, let's eat!

441
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:13,143
<i>I love you too much</i>

442
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:16,605
<i>To live without you loving me back</i>

443
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,655
<i>I love you too much</i>

444
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:23,529
<i>Heaven's my witness and this is a fact</i>

445
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,824
<i>I know I belong</i>

446
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:30,174
<i>When I sing this song</i>

447
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:36,671
<i>There's love above love and it's ours
'cause I love you too much</i>

448
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,988
<i>I live for your touch</i>

449
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:44,483
<i>I whisper your name night after night</i>

450
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,886
<i>I love you too much</i>

451
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:51,390
<i>There's only one feeling
and I know it's right</i>

452
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,680
<i>I know I belong</i>

453
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,735
<i>When I sing this song</i>

454
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:04,485
<i>There's love above love and it's ours
'cause I love you too much</i>

455
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:12,202
<i>Heaven knows your name I've been praying</i>

456
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:18,478
<i>To have you come here by my side</i>

457
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:25,983
<i>Without you a part of me is missing</i>

458
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:32,863
<i>Just to make you my own I will fight</i>

459
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,700
<i>I love you too much</i>

460
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,733
<i>I love you too much</i>

461
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,171
<i>Heaven's my witness and this is a fact</i>

462
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:50,449
<i>You live in my soul</i>

463
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,209
<i>Your heart is my goal</i>

464
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:57,581
<i>There's love above love and it's mine
'cause I love you</i>

465
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,959
<i>There's love above love and it's yours
'cause I love you</i>

466
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,129
<i>There's love above love and it's ours</i>

467
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:08,889
<i>If you love me as much</i>

468
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:14,161
Did you think it was gonna be that easy?

469
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,319
I... I kind of did.

470
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:24,412
Manolo!

471
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:26,582
Hold on, I'm coming.

472
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:34,252
Joaquin.

473
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,967
- What are you doing?
- Maria...

474
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:41,634
Will you... Will you marry me?

475
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,054
Yes.

476
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,672
Don't worry, your father
already said you could.

477
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,222
He did... what?

478
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:53,439
Who else could protect us from Chakal?

479
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,287
What did I miss?

480
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:15,159
Wait... Wait a sec. Did he propose, too?

481
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,704
- No. Were you going to?
- What?

482
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:22,791
Well, I proposed first.
So, go fight a bull or something.

483
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,006
- You two are acting like fools!
- Wait, me too?

484
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:31,096
- You're so strong, Joaquin.
- Thanks, I work out a lot.

485
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,678
I love you, you know that.
But how are you going to protect Maria

486
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,818
if you can't even finish a bull?

487
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:39,775
Good one, Joaquin!

488
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,855
Oh, yeah? Well, you will never be
as great a hero as your father!

489
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,292
Now, that's just uncalled for.

490
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:50,002
You better get your
finger out of my face.

491
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:53,363
- You don't point at me!
- I'm the best pointer you've ever seen!

492
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:57,329
- That's so stupid, so childish.
- Joaquin!

493
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:01,093
- Come at me, bro!
- Manolo!

494
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,095
What? You wanted a banjo?

495
00:37:05,195 --> 00:37:07,818
Look at him! He got his guitar.
What are you gonna do?

496
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:11,715
- La música! I'm so scared!
- I'm gonna teach you some manners.

497
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:12,595
Joaquin!

498
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,890
Did I mention I also studied fencing?

499
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,059
Fine. We'll settle this later.

500
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,359
Any time. Any place.

501
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:25,955
Really, guys?

502
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:30,953
No! Don't go, Joaquin!
What if the bandidos come?

503
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:34,655
The bandidos are coming!

504
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:38,630
- And Joaquin is gone!
<i>- All is lost</i>

505
00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:46,208
Tremble in fear before the
might of Chakal's army!

506
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,836
Women and children, go to the church!

507
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:52,314
Men, we are going to drive
Chakal's bandits off!

508
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,894
Who is with me?

509
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,012
This is not good.

510
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:04,401
Listen up, you cowards!
These are Chakal's demands!

511
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,971
"Hand over your chickens, monies,

512
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:10,732
"bacon, jars, mustache wax."

513
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,912
This looks like "jelly"
but I think it's "jewelry."

514
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,529
Yeah, jewelry.

515
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:18,615
Anyways, if you give all this to us...

516
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,885
then maybe we won't burn your town down.

517
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:28,685
You want the town?
You're gonna have to go through me!

518
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:33,714
Hey, ugly! Why don't
you fight a real man?

519
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,759
With a really awesome mustache!

520
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:39,749
Joaquin!

521
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,155
Thank goodness you are here!

522
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:49,855
Here, hold this. And this. And this.

523
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,635
And if that's too heavy,
maybe you can just hand it to Maria.

524
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:57,988
My name is Joaquin,
son of Captain Mondragon!

525
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:03,247
Tonight, the town of San Angel
is under my protection.

526
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,087
Prepare to be beaten.

527
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,256
Get him, Plomo!

528
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,793
Joaquin!

529
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,013
Joaquin!

530
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,297
<i>Who wants some more?</i>

531
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,177
Get him!

532
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,930
Hey, girl.

533
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,888
You goofball.

534
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:28,560
All right, that's just
not hurting at all.

535
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,196
The beautiful hero!
He has the medal of everlasting life!

536
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:35,408
Joaquin!

537
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:45,487
- Retreat!
- And don't ever come back!

538
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:49,206
Yeah! You better run away!
That was incredible.

539
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:52,166
Yeah, you really are a hero.

540
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:53,836
Perhaps now...

541
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:58,346
we possibly could continue
our conversation, señorita Posada?

542
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,636
Maria, please, do it for the town.

543
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,759
Without Joaquin we are
at the mercy of Chakal.

544
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:13,105
So, why don't you tell me
about some of your medals?

545
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,058
Well, I got this one for
delivering a baby with one hand

546
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,194
while arm wrestling a bear with
the other. That's nothing, really.

547
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:22,781
Duh. Of course she's gonna go with Joaquin.
And did you see that mustache?

548
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:25,843
Are you crazy? Maria is doing
this to protect the town.

549
00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:28,593
- Putting her duty before her heart.
- Yes.

550
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,415
Life can be really tough for the living.

551
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,168
Failing in and out of the ring.

552
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:38,852
The whole Sanchez family would
be so disappointed in you.

553
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,980
Please, don't say that.

554
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:47,160
Listen. You love Maria?
Then fight for her, like a man!

555
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,809
It's too late.
Joaquin proposed to her already.

556
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,149
- Now, that's a real man.
- Quiet, Carlos!

557
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,733
Manolo, if Maria didn't
say yes to Joaquin...

558
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,583
then she said no.

559
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,670
So, what are you gonna do about it, son?

560
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:09,754
After stealing Xibalba's
magic medal in a battle

561
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:12,682
Chakal had risen to become
the king of the bandits.

562
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:17,262
But when Xibalba stole it back,
Chakal had come undone.

563
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,525
We found... We found the medal!
The medal of everlasting life!

564
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:24,785
It's in the town of San Angel.

565
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:28,472
- Are you certain?
- I swear! I swear!

566
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:33,113
A beautiful hero wears it to protect
the town! It looked just like that.

567
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:37,255
Gather my men. We ride for San Angel.

568
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:42,486
You've come back to me, medal.

569
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:44,488
I got this one for saving
some orphans from a fire

570
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,940
and then going back in for their cribs,
and then going back in for their toys.

571
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,622
And then I also saved a little puppy one
time that had a little thorn in its paw.

572
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:50,953
And this medal is for
having the most medals.

573
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,821
Well, here we are.

574
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:57,511
Thank you for this most
informative talk about you.

575
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,801
- I have something for you, Maria.
- That is so nice of y...

576
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:07,363
- I'm speechless.
- I know. Right? I get that a lot.

577
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,984
Good night, Joaquin.

578
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,756
- Wait. Maria.
- Yes?

579
00:42:14,851 --> 00:42:16,241
My bonnet.

580
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,815
You kept it all this time?

581
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,465
Well, it's what's kept me going.

582
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:28,361
About my proposal, will you
at least just think about it?

583
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,454
Good night, Joaquin.

584
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:37,040
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Joaquin, you're awesome!

585
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,540
Yes!

586
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:49,219
Meet me at the bridge at dawn.

587
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:53,219
- I can't, Manolo. My father won't...
- Please, Maria. I beg you.

588
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:04,813
If she meets him alone
I will lose the wager.

589
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:09,616
Fix this for me, old friend.

590
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,889
Manolo.

591
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:38,229
<i>Wise men say</i>

592
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:43,657
<i>Only fools rush in</i>

593
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,310
<i>But I can't help</i>

594
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,904
<i>Falling in love</i>

595
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:54,049
<i>With you</i>

596
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:58,747
<i>But I can't help</i>

597
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,148
<i>Falling in love</i>

598
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:05,890
<i>With you</i>

599
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:16,813
This is... This is what
I wanted to show you.

600
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,914
It's so beautiful.

601
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:27,190
What you're feeling... that's how
I feel every time I'm with you.

602
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:32,614
I can't offer you a ring.
I have nothing to give but my love.

603
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,324
Oh, Manolo.

604
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:39,204
I may not be the town hero, Maria...
but I swear with all my heart

605
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:42,024
I will never, ever stop loving you.

606
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,604
And I will never stop loving the
man who plays from the heart.

607
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:50,716
- Snake!
- No!

608
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,310
Maria!

609
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,353
No.

610
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,076
Help!

611
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:29,296
- What did you do, Manolo?
- There was a snake and...

612
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:32,132
She's gone.

613
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:34,184
- Why didn't you protect her?
- Maria!

614
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:38,284
Oh, no. Oh, no!

615
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,659
This is all your doing! Leave!

616
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:45,489
Or so help me, I'll...

617
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,941
My little girl.

618
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,281
What have you done, boy?

619
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,862
What have you done?

620
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:58,172
- It should have been me.
- Yes. It should have.

621
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:05,466
- No! Maria died?
- That can't be right!

622
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:08,156
What kind of story is this?
We're just kids!

623
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:12,047
As the sky cried with rain...

624
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:15,227
Manolo went back to retrieve his guitar.

625
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:19,048
I will never see her again.

626
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:21,562
Are you certain?

627
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:26,056
You want to see Maria again?

628
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,439
With all my heart.

629
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,792
Think about what you say, boy.

630
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:38,605
With all my heart.

631
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:39,961
Done.

632
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,434
Maria...

633
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:52,671
No!

634
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,008
- Manolo, too?
- What is it with Mexicans and death?

635
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,219
But it can't end like this. Can it?

636
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,519
Oh, my sweet child, this is not the end.

637
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:42,763
Welcome to the Land of the Remembered!

638
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,939
I made it.

639
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:47,101
- And on the Day of the Dead, no less.
- Where... Where is...

640
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,061
You're going to be a little
disoriented at first.

641
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:53,607
Don't try to take it all in at once.
Let's start with your name.

642
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,651
- Maria Posada!
- Really?

643
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:58,278
Parents and their crazy baby names.

644
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,281
And there's no Maria Posada on my list.

645
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:05,698
No, no. I'm looking for Maria Posada.

646
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,709
My name is Manolo Sanchez.

647
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,099
Another Sanchez?
Man, that family just keeps growing.

648
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,453
My family! They'll help me find Maria!
Can you take me to them?

649
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:17,714
I would love nothing more than
to reunite a young couple.

650
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:21,324
Just hold on!

651
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:34,284
You know, I've been down here for years
awaiting my beloved honey bunny.

652
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:35,996
Hi, honey!

653
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,914
Too soon! Go!

654
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:43,173
The Land of the Remembered
was vibrant and joyous!

655
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:46,952
Everything was like the land above...
But it was more colorful...

656
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:51,165
It was more beautiful, it was more festive!
And, on the Day of the Dead...

657
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:55,636
that place was bursting with endless
parties and spectacular parades.

658
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:58,036
There, your family is in that one.

659
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:02,673
Get in there!

660
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:11,776
- Oh, yeah! Another Sanchez bullfighter.
- You are...

661
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,688
The amazing Carmelo Sanchez!

662
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:20,029
Yes! I was famous for
fighting bulls without a cape!

663
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:23,961
Capes are for cowards!

664
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,824
Can you help me find Maria Posada?

665
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:30,094
La Muerte can help you.
She helps everyone. Hold on.

666
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:36,835
The great Jorge Sanchez!

667
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,462
At your service!

668
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:43,824
I was famous for fighting bulls
with only one arm and one leg.

669
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:47,268
Arms and legs are for cowards!

670
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:51,100
You are Manolo,
the one who plays the guitar.

671
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,826
Yeah, that's me.

672
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:57,815
You know, when I was younger,
I always dreamt of singing in the opera.

673
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:00,067
- You did?
- But as you know...

674
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:04,407
Music is not work fit for
a Sanchez bullfighter.

675
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:05,989
The same story.

676
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,849
They crushed our dreams. Hilarious.

677
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,931
- He's new.
- He reminds me of me. But less handsome.

678
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:23,632
Of course! It's Luis
"El Super Macho" Sanchez!

679
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:28,182
I was famous for fighting
three bulls at once!

680
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:33,576
One bull is for cowards!

681
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:37,895
Grandpa! It's me, Manolo.

682
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:41,358
Manolo? I'm so happy to see you.

683
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:45,279
Why you disgrace the family name?
Playing the guitar!

684
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:49,631
You couldn't finish one bull?
You were a clown.

685
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,961
Sorry, cousin Chucho.

686
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:58,204
Welcome home, mijo. Your mother
will be very happy to see you.

687
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,681
Mama?

688
00:51:09,587 --> 00:51:11,317
Manolo.

689
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:13,524
Mama.

690
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,335
Manolo!

691
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,329
I missed you so much.

692
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,863
Ay, mijo, it's been like
a hole in my heart.

693
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,713
I've waited so long for you.

694
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,703
But not long enough!
What are you doing here?

695
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:38,749
I'm here to be reunited with...
with the love of my life.

696
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:43,087
- You're going to love Maria, mama.
- I'm sure I will.

697
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:48,634
Manolo, you look just like your father.
So handsome, you turned out.

698
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:52,137
And I became a bullfighter,
just like you wanted.

699
00:51:52,237 --> 00:51:56,767
Me? Are you crazy? Haven't you learned
anything from your family's history?

700
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:59,937
- What? But Dad said that...
- That Carlos.

701
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:04,274
Wait until he gets down here.
Now, come on, mijo!

702
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:06,814
Everyone, this is my son, Manolo!

703
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:14,718
And these are your Adelita cousins.
They fought in the revolution.

704
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:16,787
- And we won.
- No way!

705
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,080
Hey, primo.

706
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,760
Being with the whole Sanchez family...

707
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:24,061
And you, mama. This is incredible.

708
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:26,971
This is La Muerte's castle.

709
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,258
I don't see it.

710
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,603
Savage.

711
00:52:32,703 --> 00:52:35,443
Come, she will help you
find my new daughter-in-law.

712
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:44,314
- It's so pretty!
- Now, this is a castle!

713
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:50,087
We were always La Muerte's favorites.
You know how bullfighters flirt with death?

714
00:52:50,187 --> 00:52:53,027
And that's why there are
so many of you down here.

715
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:05,474
La Muerte's throwing a big Day
of the Dead fiesta for everyone!

716
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,270
Savage.

717
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,266
Ask her, mijo.

718
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:22,616
My lady, could you help
me find Maria Posada?

719
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,447
No one here can help you, bullfighter.

720
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:30,892
The Land of the Remembered
has a new ruler!

721
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:39,870
- Who, you ask? Lil' old me.
- You again?

722
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,510
But La Muerte would never
hand her domain over to you.

723
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:45,799
She lost a bet.

724
00:53:46,881 --> 00:53:48,253
She would do that.

725
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,547
This land is finally mine!

726
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,183
- All thanks to you, Manolo.
- What?

727
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:56,053
La Muerte bet that
Maria would marry you.

728
00:53:56,153 --> 00:53:59,153
I bet that Maria would marry Joaquin.

729
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,185
And since you're not around anymore...

730
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:08,023
Maria is going to marry Joaquin just to,
you know, protect her beloved town.

731
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:09,733
So, I win.

732
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:14,538
No, but Maria passed away.
I saw her. Oh, no.

733
00:54:14,638 --> 00:54:17,038
Oh, yes.

734
00:54:17,649 --> 00:54:21,279
- Mijo, what is it?
- One snake bite merely put her in a trance.

735
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:24,547
My champion easily woke...

736
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,876
the sleeping beauty.

737
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:30,754
Oh, my goodness. It's a miracle!

738
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,694
<i>Thank you</i>

739
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:35,228
I'm... I'm...

740
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,553
Alive.

741
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:38,563
Cheers.

742
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:43,267
One bite? Your snake! It bit me twice!

743
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:46,535
You cheated! You will pay for this!

744
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:54,778
In all my years, no one, in any realm...

745
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:58,782
has ever talked to me
like that and survived.

746
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:02,111
So, I ask you...
Are you threatening me, boy?

747
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:06,876
I will expose you to La Muerte.
And then you and me can settle things!

748
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:13,430
You'll never reach her in her new realm.
I should know. I rotted there for eons.

749
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,860
Now, if you'd all excuse me,
I have a wedding to plan. Chao!

750
00:55:33,542 --> 00:55:35,492
What happened?

751
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,896
- Wait, where's Manolo?
- I'm sorry, Maria.

752
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:44,059
Manolo... Manolo passed away.

753
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,430
No. It can't be.

754
00:55:48,324 --> 00:55:50,594
I'm sorry, dear.

755
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:02,475
Maria, we are all sorry
Manolo is gone...

756
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,933
but Joaquin just saved your life.

757
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:09,119
You see? He will always protect you.

758
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:11,539
General, this is not the time.

759
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:17,235
Please, for everyone's sake, mija.
Make him stay.

760
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:21,972
Will you stay in
San Angel if I marry you?

761
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:26,667
- Yes, but you don't...
- I accept Joaquin's proposal.

762
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:29,835
Young love.

763
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:34,670
I have to find La Muerte!
Please. Please, help me.

764
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,981
- Mijo, stay here with us.
- No more worries.

765
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:42,085
- Epic fiestas every day.
- With the whole Sanchez family.

766
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:45,095
And all-you-can-eat churros.

767
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:50,394
Tha... thank you, guys. But, no.
I need to be with Maria.

768
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,979
It's all I ever wanted.

769
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,883
- How's Manolo gonna get back?
- He's stuck there forever!

770
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,953
And Maria is gonna marry Joaquin!

771
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:01,622
All right, do you want me to continue?

772
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:04,992
So, one thing was for sure...
Manolo needed help from his family.

773
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:08,996
- If La Muerte is where Xibalba rotted away...
- Then she's in the Land of the Forgotten.

774
00:57:09,096 --> 00:57:10,998
- No, no, no.
- Quiet, you!

775
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:15,919
Manolo, there's only one way to
get to the Land of the Forgotten.

776
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:20,357
<i>Through the Cave of Souls</i>

777
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:22,960
Going there would be certain doom!

778
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,930
Well... It's a good day for doom.

779
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:30,058
He's a Sanchez, I tell you!

780
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:33,028
A Sanchez!

781
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,939
<i>This is impossible!</i>

782
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,699
Hey! Good luck, little Sanchez!

783
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,503
The legendary Cave of Souls

784
00:57:40,603 --> 00:57:43,572
was rumored to be at the edge
of the Land of the Remembered.

785
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:48,410
Now, many had tried to reach it,
but none had ever returned.

786
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:49,990
At least, not in one piece.

787
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:59,311
Caramba, it hurts just looking at it.

788
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:03,133
Why couldn't this be
the elevator of souls?

789
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:06,904
My arthritis is killing me!
Are we there yet?

790
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,191
We made it, mijo.

791
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,455
Come on! What are you guys waiting for?

792
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,278
You are not worthy!

793
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,571
Hey! My arthritis is gone!

794
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,911
Grandpa!

795
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,380
Mama!

796
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:32,298
Manolo!

797
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:37,871
Face the labyrinth and earn
the right to be judged.

798
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:55,041
I can't see him! Lift me up! I see him!

799
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,224
Where did he go?

800
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:09,041
- What? What's happening?
- It's okay, honey. He's totally okay.

801
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:11,791
Run for your life!

802
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:36,218
Ay, that was so beautiful.

803
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:43,657
You have earned the right to be judged.

804
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:48,754
But be warned.
No mortal has ever passed.

805
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:52,925
For Maria.

806
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:55,858
Manolo!

807
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,778
Manolo Sanchez...

808
01:00:02,878 --> 01:00:07,174
your heart is pure and courageous.

809
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,934
You and yours may enter.

810
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:12,983
Ay, mijo. Don't do that again!

811
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:19,858
This is the Cave of Souls?

812
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,689
Grandpa! Show some respect.

813
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:25,234
That... was...

814
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:28,545
awesome, man! Look,
the giant boulders were like...

815
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:31,205
"Boom, boom, boom!"
And then, you were, like...

816
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:34,701
And then, the cave guardian,
he came in, and he was like...

817
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,287
"I'm going to judge you
with this giant sword."

818
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:41,792
- Excuse me? Sir!
- And then, you... you...

819
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,252
You got through.

820
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:47,314
- I have to find La Muerte.
- La Muerte?

821
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:51,600
- Sorry, you missed her, Manolo.
- Wait! You know me?

822
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,138
Yeah, man. We know everybody.

823
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:57,474
We know Luis, Carmen, and Puddle.

824
01:00:57,574 --> 01:00:59,154
How are you doing, puddle?

825
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:02,137
Hello, puddle.

826
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:05,357
It's all here in the Book of Life.

827
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:09,538
Wait, where are my manners?
Come on in, y'all!

828
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:13,795
Manolo and his family were the first
to ever see the magic waterfalls

829
01:01:13,895 --> 01:01:15,701
that linked all the realms.

830
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:20,131
Welcome to the Cave of Souls!

831
01:01:20,231 --> 01:01:22,504
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

832
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:25,335
Now, this is a cave!

833
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:29,923
You see all these candles?
Each one is a life.

834
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:33,844
And I'm your humble,
yet strikingly handsome...

835
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:36,444
Candle Maker!

836
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:43,131
- I don't get it.
- Wait, wait, wait! I didn't do the thing.

837
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:45,950
I got to do the thing. Watch this.

838
01:01:55,565 --> 01:01:58,827
Amazing? This is our work!

839
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,047
This is what we do!

840
01:02:01,672 --> 01:02:05,042
Look! That group, that's your town.

841
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:08,170
And there, that's Maria.

842
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,220
And next to her, Manolo.

843
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:14,427
One aflame with life, the other...

844
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,140
Kaput.

845
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:20,116
You see, as long as someone
alive remembers you...

846
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:24,151
you get to live in the
Land of the Remembered.

847
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:26,563
- Santa Gordita!
- What is it?

848
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:29,073
Chakal is on the march.

849
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,902
With him comes the end of your town.

850
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:35,422
And there will be no one
left to remember you.

851
01:02:35,522 --> 01:02:37,107
We would all be forgotten.

852
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:40,577
Please, Candle Maker.
Come on, help me go back.

853
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,747
I can't do that, Manolo.

854
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,292
Santa Chihuahua!

855
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:52,206
Okay, okay. Look, guys, the Book
of Life holds everyone's story.

856
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:55,056
But the pages on Manolo's life...

857
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:56,889
They're blank!

858
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:01,598
You didn't live the life
that was written for you.

859
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:05,608
You are writing your own story!

860
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:09,606
That's good?

861
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:12,116
So this means you'll
help me find La Muerte?

862
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,017
Well, I'm not supposed to interfere,
but I may be able to bend the rules.

863
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:19,950
Just a little.

864
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,036
After all, it is the Day of the Dead.

865
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,916
Right, book?

866
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:31,360
Come on, let's do this.
I'll take you to La Muerte.

867
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,547
- I'm going alone.
- Alone?

868
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,100
- Hold on, now.
- Fine. I'm going alone, too...

869
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,335
- Can I get a word in?
- ...right next to you.

870
01:03:38,435 --> 01:03:39,970
- Actually...
- We should go.

871
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,582
"We"? No! It's much too
dangerous for a lady!

872
01:03:43,682 --> 01:03:45,058
- No retreat!
- Hold on!

873
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:47,118
No surrender!

874
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,407
I tried to warn them.

875
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,420
I immediately regret this decision!

876
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,050
Are you sure we're in the right place?

877
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:11,704
You Sanchezes need to look before
you go jumping into magic waterfalls.

878
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:15,839
What if you jump into the wrong one?
You might end up in Tijuana.

879
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,674
I think I died there.

880
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,595
Welcome to the Land of the Forgotten.

881
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:23,055
Sad?

882
01:04:25,532 --> 01:04:26,767
You poor things.

883
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:30,896
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't hurry. Come on.

884
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,660
There it is, Xibalba's castle.

885
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:43,742
La Muerte! I need a
word with you, my lady!

886
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:47,204
Manolo? But how did you get here?

887
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:48,884
I had some help.

888
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:51,576
- Hey, there.
- Candle maker.

889
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:55,509
Carmen! And the head of Luis?

890
01:04:58,957 --> 01:05:01,552
Great, my arthritis is back.

891
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:04,721
I know about the wager. Xibalba cheated.

892
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:08,990
- He did what?
- Yeah! With a two-headed snake!

893
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,029
You might want to cover
your ears right now.

894
01:05:12,129 --> 01:05:16,499
Xibalba!

895
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,576
Yes, my dear?

896
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:27,244
You misbegotten son of a
leprous donkey! You cheated!

897
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:30,302
- Again!
- I did no such thing.

898
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,751
Oh, that.

899
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,262
It has a mind of its own. Or two.

900
01:05:36,362 --> 01:05:38,839
- That is unforgivable!
- Oh, please!

901
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:43,010
I never sent that snake to Maria,
and I never gave that medal to Joaquin!

902
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,095
What medal?

903
01:05:45,195 --> 01:05:47,264
The one I never gave him.

904
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,933
Ever. At all. Never.
Who is this Joaquin?

905
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,270
You gave Joaquin the
medal of everlasting life?

906
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,104
Yes.

907
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:57,107
"Medal of everlasting life"?

908
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,237
Whoever wears the medal
cannot die or be injured.

909
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:04,082
Please, can you help me up?

910
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,536
Thank you.

911
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:10,888
Can I get a slap, too?

912
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:14,838
- My son did not deserve this.
- Come on, I have to go back.

913
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,801
It's only fair.

914
01:06:20,397 --> 01:06:22,841
Please, Balby?

915
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:24,968
- "Balby"?
- No. Never.

916
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,970
- You better do this!
- No.

917
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,889
Hey, what about a wager?

918
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,976
- A wager?
- If I win you give me my life back.

919
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,687
- You have nothing I want.
- But I do.

920
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:39,258
If you win, Xibalba,
you can rule both realms.

921
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,198
You name the task, anything you want,
and I will beat you.

922
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:46,619
What? Are you afraid you might lose?

923
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:48,318
What you doing, kid?

924
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:51,764
Do we have a deal?

925
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,456
We have a deal.

926
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:57,426
Now, tell me, boy,
what keeps you up at night?

927
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,045
What eats at you from the inside?

928
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:03,495
What, do tell, is your worst fear?

929
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:06,849
Got it.

930
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,538
Manolo Sanchez!

931
01:07:17,738 --> 01:07:22,313
You will have to defeat every bull
the Sanchez family ever finished!

932
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,237
That would be thousands!

933
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:29,078
All... at... once!

934
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:33,579
If you complete this task
you will live again.

935
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:37,207
And if you fail, you will be forgotten.

936
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:40,228
- Forever.
- This is impossible. It can't be done!

937
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:42,528
<i>Vamos, toro. Venga.</i>

938
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,348
You can do it!

939
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:55,426
Are you two all right?

940
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:58,687
Chakal is coming!
With a whole army behind him!

941
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:00,990
You boys warn General Posada.

942
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,580
I will buy you some time.

943
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:07,147
Who wants to go first?

944
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:16,330
I hate bullfighters.

945
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,420
Then come and get some.

946
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:28,983
Manolo! Get out of there!

947
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,639
What is happening?

948
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,140
- Carlos!
- Carmen!

949
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,730
Manolo! Your father is here!

950
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:39,019
Papá?

951
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,869
Chakal and his men are at
the gates of San Angel!

952
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,755
Man, this is a whole lot of bull.

953
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:12,136
Maria Posada...

954
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:15,556
do you take Joaquin to be your husband?

955
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:18,392
Yes. For San Angel, I do.

956
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:22,498
And Joaquin... do you take
Maria to be your wife?

957
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:25,664
I...

958
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,991
Chakal is here!

959
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:33,766
My medal. It's on my other suit.
I gotta go.

960
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:37,716
But Joaquin is the only one
who can defeat Chakal.

961
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:45,717
We can fight them together, Papá.

962
01:09:45,817 --> 01:09:47,817
<i>Toro! Toro, venga!</i>

963
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:52,478
<i>Venga, torote. Venga.</i>

964
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:58,109
Get up and fight like a Sanchez!

965
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:01,362
Mama? What are you doing here?

966
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:03,404
Cholesterol.

967
01:10:08,858 --> 01:10:11,422
Everyone! Listen up!

968
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:16,950
I know you're scared,
but look around you.

969
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,419
- Do you know what I see?
- No.

970
01:10:18,519 --> 01:10:22,706
I see proud people ready to
fight for their beloved town.

971
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:27,886
And I see that inside each of you is
a strength that cannot be measured.

972
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,938
Yes... even in you, Pepe.

973
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:36,150
This Day of the Dead
will never be forgotten!

974
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,811
We will teach Chakal that he's
messing with the wrong town.

975
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:44,014
San Angel... I swear by those before us,

976
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:47,642
we will not fall! Not today.

977
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:49,525
Medal!

978
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,123
Not ever! Now, who's with me?

979
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:58,721
You are like the son I never had!
But much prettier!

980
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:08,335
Hey, Chakal! Why don't you
pick on someone your own size?

981
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,965
Because no one's that big, man.

982
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,292
- Where have you been?
- Thank goodness you're...

983
01:11:14,392 --> 01:11:16,720
Hey! Soldier boy.

984
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:21,446
You give me that medal. Right now!

985
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,352
All this is about a stupid medal?

986
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:29,615
- Are you kidding me?
- Not now, Maria. It's Joaquin time.

987
01:11:29,715 --> 01:11:31,535
Joaquin!

988
01:11:34,753 --> 01:11:35,873
Joaquin!

989
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,921
Hey, buddy, let's talk about this.

990
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,065
Joaquin!

991
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:50,983
Joaquin?

992
01:11:54,454 --> 01:11:56,682
<i>Toro! Venga, toro!</i>

993
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:15,537
- The beast is out!
- Time to finish this.

994
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:26,997
Yeah!

995
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,167
Finish him! Finish him!

996
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:40,148
What is he doing?

997
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:24,012
<i>Toro, I am humbled
for tonight, I understand</i>

998
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:29,143
<i>Your royal blood was never meant
to decorate this sand</i>

999
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:34,398
<i>You've suffered great injustice
so have thousands before you</i>

1000
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:39,082
<i>I offer an apology and one long overdue</i>

1001
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:45,033
<i>I am sorry</i>

1002
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:47,283
<i>Toro, I am sorry</i>

1003
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:51,770
<i>Hear my song and know I sing the truth</i>

1004
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:56,343
<i>Although we were bred to fight</i>

1005
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:03,051
<i>I reach for kindness
in your heart tonight</i>

1006
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,901
<i>And if you can forgive</i>

1007
01:14:06,021 --> 01:14:09,057
<i>And if you can forgive</i>

1008
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:13,520
<i>Love can truly live</i>

1009
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:18,876
<i>And if you can forgive
and if you can forgive</i>

1010
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:23,414
<i>Love can truly live</i>

1011
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:39,216
<i>And if you can forgive
and if you can forgive</i>

1012
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:42,245
<i>Love</i>

1013
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:47,532
<i>Love will truly live</i>

1014
01:14:50,908 --> 01:14:53,219
- He did it!
- Yes, he did.

1015
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:55,789
Yeah. I'll give him that.

1016
01:14:56,455 --> 01:15:00,122
- But how did Manolo do this?
- He's a Sanchez.

1017
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:05,906
Xibalba had been wrong.
Manolo's fear was never bullfighting.

1018
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,034
I told you, a Sanchez
man never apologizes.

1019
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:13,163
- Papá, I...
- But you just changed that.

1020
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:17,469
I should have been a better father.
I am very sorry.

1021
01:15:17,976 --> 01:15:21,392
No. You only wanted
what was best for me.

1022
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:24,019
I'm so proud of you, son.

1023
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:28,189
- I love you, Papá.
- Ay, mijo.

1024
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:32,391
And at that moment,
Manolo conquered his greatest fear...

1025
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:34,585
being himself.

1026
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:38,045
In accordance with the ancient rules...

1027
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:42,125
we give you life.

1028
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:44,235
Be careful up there, mijo.

1029
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:56,907
Please, Chakal... just don't hurt them.

1030
01:15:57,007 --> 01:16:01,849
Yes. Yes! The medal is mine!

1031
01:16:19,246 --> 01:16:20,696
What?

1032
01:16:23,075 --> 01:16:24,375
Manolo?

1033
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:38,385
Hold this for me, amigo.

1034
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:44,880
So, my father tells me
you hate bullfighters.

1035
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,590
I hate everybody.

1036
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,260
Yeah. Yeah, mang.

1037
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,230
Okay. Let's do this.

1038
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:55,663
You and what army?

1039
01:17:10,047 --> 01:17:12,277
It's the Day of the Dead, Manolo.

1040
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:15,994
And on our day,
we have a certain amount of...

1041
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,288
- Leeway.
- Good luck!

1042
01:17:18,588 --> 01:17:20,258
Thank you!

1043
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,671
- No retreat.
- No surrender!

1044
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,731
He gonna do it now!

1045
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:31,901
<i>Familia Sanchez, al ataque.</i>

1046
01:17:38,178 --> 01:17:41,902
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay</i>

1047
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:45,298
<i>Canta y no llores</i>

1048
01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:49,450
<i>Porque cantando se alegran</i>

1049
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,161
<i>Los co...</i>

1050
01:17:55,653 --> 01:17:59,902
<i>...razones</i>

1051
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:05,036
We should get that guy for the band.

1052
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:10,268
- Now, is your turn!
- Okay, I sing good, too.

1053
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:16,722
I was like, "I think you look good.
I like your hair."

1054
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,482
And he was like, "I like your hair."

1055
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,017
Are you wearing my boots?

1056
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:23,185
They look better on me.
Come here, lover boy!

1057
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:35,668
Medal!

1058
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,839
<i>Thank you</i>

1059
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:52,807
Hold me!

1060
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:57,099
Chakal! We found the medal!

1061
01:18:57,629 --> 01:18:59,848
My comrades.

1062
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,449
Unleash the fury!

1063
01:19:01,549 --> 01:19:02,258
<i>Qué?</i>

1064
01:19:06,122 --> 01:19:09,900
- I'm done playing!
- I got it. I got this.

1065
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,450
No, no, no! I got this!

1066
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,199
Did I tell you I also studied kung fu?

1067
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,669
- Enough!
- Look out!

1068
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:24,581
Let go of me!

1069
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:27,835
Get me my medal, or your woman will pay!

1070
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:29,645
Men. Typical!

1071
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,714
- Go find the medal.
- But Maria...

1072
01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:35,978
Find the medal. I'll handle this.

1073
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,448
Got it. Joaquin!

1074
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:57,605
I save you, little Sanchez!

1075
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:00,753
Good luck, Manolo!

1076
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:03,475
Kick his butt, grandson.

1077
01:20:05,694 --> 01:20:09,626
- <i>Epa!</i> Where do you think you're going?
- I have to get up there!

1078
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:14,561
I was right! You have become
the greatest Sanchez ever!

1079
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:37,583
- Care to dance, señorita?
- I thought you'd never ask.

1080
01:20:54,797 --> 01:20:58,645
Pretty good, guitarrista.
Now it's your turn!

1081
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:05,319
Watch out, sisters! Save yourselves!

1082
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:12,106
Hi, Maria!

1083
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:13,446
Hi!

1084
01:21:22,933 --> 01:21:26,343
I'm taking this whole town with me!

1085
01:21:32,443 --> 01:21:34,545
No more shadows, Dad.

1086
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:36,265
No retreat?

1087
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,427
No surrender.

1088
01:21:44,388 --> 01:21:46,858
- Manolo, the column!
- I got it.

1089
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:49,092
No. No!

1090
01:21:49,192 --> 01:21:50,492
Hey!

1091
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:54,700
- Don't stop fighting for what's right.
- Wait, what?

1092
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:56,949
Manolo!

1093
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,695
Adios, brother.

1094
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,541
What is he doing?

1095
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:08,877
Don't forget me.

1096
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,200
No!

1097
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:23,519
Chakal is defeated! Retreat!

1098
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:38,244
Manolo?

1099
01:22:43,747 --> 01:22:45,537
It's me, mi Amor.

1100
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,936
But how did you survive?

1101
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:51,046
Don't look at me.

1102
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,975
Joaquin.

1103
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,711
You gave me the medal.

1104
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:01,932
You were going to sacrifice
yourself... for me.

1105
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,481
I thought it might be time...
to be a true hero.

1106
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,272
Like you, Manolo.

1107
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,010
Are you all right?

1108
01:23:13,693 --> 01:23:16,063
I've never seen more clearly.

1109
01:23:19,983 --> 01:23:22,293
It's time to cast our own shadows.

1110
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:25,619
And write our... our own stories.

1111
01:23:26,206 --> 01:23:29,877
And so, Joaquin learned
that to be a true hero...

1112
01:23:29,977 --> 01:23:32,257
You have to be selfless.

1113
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:38,327
There is one more thing we need to do...

1114
01:23:38,936 --> 01:23:40,436
Son.

1115
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:44,691
Do you take Manolo as your husband?

1116
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:45,711
I do.

1117
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:50,030
By the power vested in
us by the Book of Life...

1118
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:53,534
We now pronounce you husband and wife.

1119
01:23:53,634 --> 01:23:54,734
You may kiss...

1120
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:57,112
The groom?

1121
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:00,318
She is gonna be a great Sanchez.

1122
01:24:01,892 --> 01:24:05,834
And today was a good day... of the Dead.

1123
01:24:07,597 --> 01:24:10,467
Well... I believe you've
won the wager, mi Amor.

1124
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:13,871
Along with my heart, all over again.

1125
01:24:14,071 --> 01:24:15,811
<i>Ay,</i> Balby.

1126
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,459
I'm so sorry, my love.

1127
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:21,628
You deserve better than me.
I know that now.

1128
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:23,668
Will you ever forgive me?

1129
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:25,681
I do.

1130
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:33,949
Husband, how about a song?

1131
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:36,929
As you wish, Mrs. Sanchez.

1132
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:40,898
<i>I will stay by you</i>

1133
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:43,468
<i>Even when we fall</i>

1134
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:50,410
<i>I will be the rock that holds you up
and lifts you high so you stand tall</i>

1135
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:54,843
<i>And I won't let you fall</i>

1136
01:24:56,513 --> 01:25:00,695
<i>I won't let you go</i>

1137
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,373
<i>No matter where you are</i>

1138
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:06,693
<i>No matter where you are
I'll be there</i>

1139
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:11,996
<i>No matter where you are
no matter where you are</i>

1140
01:25:12,096 --> 01:25:14,126
<i>I'll be there</i>

1141
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,916
<i>So tear apart these giant hearts</i>

1142
01:25:19,016 --> 01:25:21,516
<i>That beat inside us now</i>

1143
01:25:23,473 --> 01:25:27,743
<i>Let's give ourselves our promises
of our unending...</i>

1144
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:30,453
<i>Love</i>

1145
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:36,478
<i>And I won't let you fall
I won't let you fall</i>

1146
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:41,259
<i>I won't let you go</i>
<i>I won't let you go</i>

1147
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:44,795
<i>No matter where you are
no matter where you are</i>

1148
01:25:44,895 --> 01:25:46,588
<i>I'll be there</i>

1149
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:50,759
<i>I will be there</i>
<i>No matter where you are</i>

1150
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:53,679
<i>No matter where you are</i>
<i>I'll be there</i>

1151
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:56,306
<i>I will be there</i>

1152
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:59,351
<i>No matter where you are
no matter where you are</i>

1153
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,741
<i>I'll be there</i>

1154
01:26:06,892 --> 01:26:09,282
<i>I'll be there</i>

1155
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:14,867
And the world keeps spinning
and the tales keep turning

1156
01:26:14,967 --> 01:26:19,663
and people come, and people go...
but they are never forgotten.

1157
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:23,800
And the one truth we know,
it held true one more time...

1158
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,329
that love, true love,

1159
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:29,497
the really, really good kind of love...

1160
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,467
never dies.

1161
01:26:31,567 --> 01:26:36,378
- Caramba, it gets me every time.
- Okay, kids, closing time.

1162
01:26:37,514 --> 01:26:38,984
Your bus should be
outside waiting for you.

1163
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:43,648
Adios, pretty lady!

1164
01:26:44,288 --> 01:26:47,793
- Adios, Sasha!
- La Muerte?

1165
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,831
La Muerte!

1166
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:55,132
You never cease to amaze me,
mi Amor. Such passion.

1167
01:26:55,232 --> 01:27:00,404
Anyone can die. These kids,
they will have the courage to live.

1168
01:27:00,504 --> 01:27:03,334
I'll wager you are right, my love.

1169
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:11,410
Hey, write your own story.

1170
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:14,760
<i>And I won't let you fall</i>

1171
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,002
<i>I won't let you go</i>

1172
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,780
<i>No matter where you are
No matter where you are</i>

1173
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,764
<i>I'll be there</i>

1174
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,060
<i>No matter where you are
No matter where you are</i>

1175
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,900
<i>I'll be there</i>

1176
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,060
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

1177
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,340
<i>No matter where you are
No matter where you are</i>

1178
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,369
<i>I'll be there</i>

1179
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,291
<i>I'll be there</i>

1180
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,690
<i>If you listen</i>

1181
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,129
<i>To the rhythm</i>

1182
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,325
<i>Calling out in the dark</i>

1183
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,970
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

1184
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,722
<i>That's your spirit</i>

1185
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,765
<i>Just follow your heart</i>

1186
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:21,180
<i>So if you're feeling
like dancing frequently</i>

1187
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,500
<i>Just tune in the magic frequency</i>

1188
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,691
<i>Don't worry about it
'cause we're gonna burn up</i>

1189
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,620
<i>Live life like it's a song</i>

1190
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:36,608
<i>So turn it on and sing along</i>

1191
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:41,140
<i>It's all right if it goes wrong</i>

1192
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:45,843
<i>Just keep calm and carry on</i>

1193
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,607
<i>On a single note
Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1194
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,940
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1195
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,605
<i>Whoo!</i>

1196
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,620
<i>Live life like it's a song</i>

1197
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:18,482
<i>So turn it on and sing along</i>

1198
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,980
<i>It's all right if it goes wrong</i>

1199
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:27,540
<i>Just keep calm and carry on</i>

1200
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,500
<i>On a single note
Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1201
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,840
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1202
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,767
<i>Live life</i>

1203
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:14,841
<i>Toro, I am humbled
For tonight I understand</i>

1204
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,800
<i>Your royal blood was never meant
to decorate the sand</i>

1205
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:22,700
<i>You've suffered great injustice</i>
<i>So have thousands before you</i>

1206
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,483
<i>I offer an apology
And one long overdue</i>

1207
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:33,131
<i>I am sorry
Toro, I am sorry</i>

1208
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:37,042
<i>Hear my song
And know I sing the truth</i>

1209
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,980
<i>Although you were bred to fight</i>

1210
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:45,100
<i>I reach for kindness
in your heart tonight</i>

1211
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,780
<i>And if you can forgive
And if you can forgive</i>

1212
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,100
<i>Love can truly live</i>

1213
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:57,700
<i>And if you can forgive
And if you can forgive</i>

1214
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,607
<i>Love can truly live</i>

1215
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:07,540
<i>Toro, I am frightened
but I'll use my final breath</i>

1216
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,520
<i>To tell you that I'm sorry
let us end this dance of death</i>

1217
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:15,060
<i>Two centuries of agony
that to your heart we sent</i>

1218
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:19,046
<i>Here and now with my amor</i>

1219
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,803
<i>This senseless killing ends</i>

1220
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,806
<i>I am sorry
Toro, I'm sorry</i>

1221
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,860
<i>Hear my song
And know I sing the truth</i>

1222
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,380
<i>Although you were bred to fight</i>

1223
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:43,820
<i>I reach for kindness
in your heart tonight</i>

1224
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,420
<i>And if you can forgive
And if you can forgive</i>

1225
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:51,740
<i>Love can truly live</i>

1226
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,489
<i>And if you can forgive
And if you can forgive</i>

1227
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,485
<i>Love</i>

1228
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:08,450
<i>Love can truly live</i>
