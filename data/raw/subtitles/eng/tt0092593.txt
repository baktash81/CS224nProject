1
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,805
Julien, don't start this again.
Be reasonable.

2
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,171
It's naughty to cry.
You promised.

3
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,844
I'm not crying.
Really.

4
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,007
I'll see you in three weeks,
and you'll be home for Mardi Gras.

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,345
Time will fly.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,682
Why do you say that?
You know it won't.

7
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,984
Dad and I will write often.

8
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,724
I don't give a damn about Dad,
and I hate you.

9
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,925
Hi, Julien.

10
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,998
Hello, children.

11
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,603
You want to be with your friends.

12
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,640
Yeah, right.
I can't stand that idiot.

13
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,815
Still smooching?

14
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,918
A bright boy like you mustn't miss 
the train.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,112
- François, I forbid you to smoke.
- It's only corn silk.

16
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,120
- So?
- It doesn't count.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,350
Bye, Mom.

18
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,086
Be good.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,193
All aboard!

20
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,193
Go on now.

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,439
You think I like this?

22
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,011
I miss you every moment.

23
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,682
I'd like to dress up as a boy 
and join you.

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,451
I'd see you at school every day.
It'd be our secret.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,791
You know I can't keep you
in Paris with me.

26
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:45,529
Written and Directed by
LOUIS MALLE

27
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,852
- Did you have a good vacation, Julien?
- Yes, Father.

28
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,028
- Your parents are well?
- Yes, Father.

29
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,731
- What'd you get for Christmas?
- Books.

30
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,835
Just books?
That's lousy.

31
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,311
ST. JOHN OF THE 
CROSS CARMELITE CONVENT

32
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,598
Have you ever read Verne?

33
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,828
Just 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

34
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,939
Laviron, did you put your things away?

35
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,180
Ach! Black market, Mr. Quentin.
I arrest you.

36
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,192
Your jam ist konfizkated!

37
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,252
Let me go!

38
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,327
Quentin, stop it.

39
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,801
Next time I'll smash your face in.
I swiped it from my brother.

40
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,731
She's a real dish.

41
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,200
She's got no tits.

42
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,172
Look out! Monkeys!

43
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,360
Good evening, Father.

44
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,999
- Is this bed free?
- Yes. D'Eparville has whooping cough.

45
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,460
Take this one.

46
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,967
Children, this is Jean Bonnet,
your new schoolmate.

47
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,012
Mr. Moreau, find him a locker.

48
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,918
- Good night, children.
- Good night, Father.

49
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,117
- Hey, Bonnet!
- Where's your Easter bonnet?

50
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,090
That's enough!
Leave him alone!

51
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,627
I'll show you your locker.

52
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,628
Take this one.
Go get your things.

53
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,205
What's your name?

54
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,476
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

55
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,652
Shut up and get to bed.
It's just a blackout.

56
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,089
My name's Julien Quentin.
Mess with me and you'll be sorry.

57
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,624
Babinot, vacation's over.

58
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,061
Good night, everyone.

59
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,527
Cut it out!

60
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,738
Hey, that's my place.

61
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,807
- What's today?
- French lit and religion.

62
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:11,018
- No hot water?
- No. We're not sissies here.

63
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,705
"Verily I say unto you,

64
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,436
unless you eat the flesh of the 
Son of Man and drink his blood,

65
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,442
you have no life in you."

66
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,412
Father, give me a hand.

67
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,627
"Whoever eats my flesh
and drinks my blood has eternal life.

68
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,928
For my flesh is food indeed,

69
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,922
and my blood is drink indeed."

70
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,727
We starve and freeze,
yet we fast for communion.

71
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,096
What a place.

72
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,364
- You're taking communion?
- I'm no ass-kisser like you.

73
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,377
"Star of the sea,
here lies the heavy sheet

74
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,444
The deep swell, the ocean of wheat

75
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,479
The turbulent spume and our 
full granaries

76
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,913
Here, your eyes on this immense cope

77
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,053
Here your voice on this weighty plain

78
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,484
Our absent friends, depopulated hearts

79
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,250
Here, the stretch of our shattered fists

80
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,858
Our weariness and our full force..."

81
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,894
Quentin, you're ready
for the Comédie-Française.

82
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,362
Can you tell us
who Charles Peguy was?

83
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,968
He was killed in the First World War.

84
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,070
You're starting at the end of the story.

85
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,864
His mother mended chairs.

86
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:39,476
Stop laughing like idiots.
Peguy's mother was a good woman.

87
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,511
What about you, Bonnot?
You know anything about Peguy?

88
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,717
No, sir.
And my name's Bonnet.

89
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,353
As in Easter bonnet!

90
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,580
Very funny, Babinot.

91
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,052
To get back in the swing after vacation,

92
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,127
write an essay on the first two verses.

93
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,161
You have half an hour.

94
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,930
I'd like to confess.

95
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,244
- Are you nuts?
- It doesn't even hurt.

96
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,539
Quentin, take it easy!

97
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,676
Careful, children.

98
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,580
Take that, Negus.

99
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,521
This'll warm him up.

100
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,904
I'm Bayard, the fearless knight.

101
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,743
Love live France!

102
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,312
Playing rough, Quentin?

103
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,386
Bastard!

104
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,125
En garde, Laviron!

105
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,228
Coward, traitor, villain!

106
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,299
I'm Negus, the Black Knight,
protector of widows and orphans.

107
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,034
Get back, Moor!
I'm Richard the Lionhearted.

108
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,970
I'll drive you from Jerusalem,
infidel Saracen.

109
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,744
Son of a bitch.

110
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,277
Allah is God
and Mohammed is his prophet.

111
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,210
Tremble, my friend.

112
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,611
Lion heart, flea brain, pig face, 
cow turd.

113
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,561
Go, Negus.

114
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,231
Is that his real name?

115
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,431
What do you think?

116
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,537
He looks nasty.
You know him?

117
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,506
That's Lafarge, my best friend.

118
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,708
Death to the Saracens!

119
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,118
Well done!

120
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,384
Playtime's over.
Back to class.

121
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,824
Babinot, hurry up.

122
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,741
It doesn't even hurt.
Hold still while I put on a bandage.

123
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,205
You boys will kill yourselves
on those stilts.

124
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,513
Someone'll break a leg one day.

125
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,384
Hey, we said 45.

126
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,656
The richer they are, the more they steal.

127
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,764
Joseph, what are you up to?
Back to your potatoes.

128
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,898
There, all better.

129
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,141
You drink too much, Mrs. Perrin.

130
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,542
Quiet, brat! Nothing wrong
with a drop of the good stuff.

131
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,685
- Got any stamps?
- I'm not trading with you guys anymore.

132
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,523
I've got some jam.

133
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,561
After lunch.

134
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,532
The doctor's wife loves your jam.

135
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,639
It puts her in the mood.
Know what I mean?

136
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,591
Pass the basket.

137
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,464
Now there's straw in the bread!
I'm gonna write to my dad.

138
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,501
- What can he do?
- Complain.

139
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,341
I remind those
who've received food from home

140
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,635
to share with their fellow students.

141
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,140
You want some salami?

142
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,044
I'm warning you... it's horsemeat.

143
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,217
I have to eat. I'm anemic.

144
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,414
What about us?
Didn't you hear Father Jean?

145
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,190
There's not enough for everyone.
Let your folks feed you.

146
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,931
There's one piece left.

147
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,659
- You take it.
- Thanks. You're a pal.

148
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,715
Today, St. Simeon Stylites.

149
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,320
"St. Simeon was 13
and tending his father's sheep

150
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,287
when he heard this verse
from the Bible:

151
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,221
'Woe unto you who laugh now,

152
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,760
for the day shall come when you 
shall weep.'

153
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:10,298
He left home to become a hermit and 
lived 30 years atop a column.

154
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,672
He stood upright, without shelter,

155
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,434
absorbed in almost continuous prayer.

156
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,109
Vitamin crackers.

157
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,304
Here. It'll taste better now.

158
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,071
- I've got two.
- Thanks. I'm not hungry anymore.

159
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,114
That guy gets on my nerves.

160
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,844
- There's little Joseph now.
- You got the jam?

161
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,387
Stop it!
These are my clean pants!

162
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,887
Joseph's in love, boys.

163
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,758
Your girlfriend looks like a slut.

164
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,595
How about your sister?

165
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,294
What's she look like?

166
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,644
- Is the teacher tough?
- No, he's nice.

167
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,337
- Have you had him?
- Yes. He was amazed at my Latin.

168
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,727
- They'll be ready to eat in three months.
- Sure, for Parents' Day.

169
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,456
So parents will say,
"You eat so well here!"

170
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,835
Let's see the stamps.

171
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,901
A 15-centime Madagascar.
The guy said it's real rare.

172
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,770
Somewhat rare.

173
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,784
I think I'll keep my jam.
The grub here is lousy.

174
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,487
You're a real Jew.

175
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,065
So, you're in love?

176
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,393
Don't joke around. It's serious.
Could you spare 50 francs?

177
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,037
Women cost a bundle.
You'll find out.

178
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,299
No, I won't.
Besides, you're rich.

179
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,502
On what they pay me here?
If I could find another job...

180
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,079
I'm broke. Ask François.

181
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,784
Ciron, put some wood in the stove.
It's freezing in here.

182
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,316
No need to play the fool.

183
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,531
Who can prove that the sum
of the two opposite sides AB plus CD

184
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,565
equals the sum
of the other two sides?

185
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,333
The new boy.

186
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,473
- His name's Easter Bonnet, sir.
- Knock it off.

187
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,843
We know that tangents of a circle
from a given point are equal.

188
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,917
Therefore A equals a,

189
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,118
B equals b...

190
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,765
You think?

191
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,097
Turns your brain to mush,
but he doesn't have a lot to lose.

192
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,449
Right. Very good.

193
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,221
- Everyone understand?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,553
Great! An air raid!

195
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,161
We'll go down to the shelter.

196
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,522
But class isn't over.
Bring your books.

197
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,926
Hurry up, children.

198
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,959
- Mother Michel lost her cat
- Quiet!

199
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,593
Now for some algebra.

200
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,002
Follow along in your books.
Page 61.

201
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,606
Algebraic numbers

202
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,146
are like arithmetic numbers in that...

203
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,678
Give me some light?

204
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,754
Get lost.

205
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,922
Lift up the light.
I can't see.

206
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,719
I'll get caught!

207
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,588
You're such a pain!

208
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,104
They're bombing the station.

209
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,780
- No, it's the barracks.
- Calm down and stay seated.

210
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,114
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with you...

211
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,605
The lovebirds!

212
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,140
Quentin, turn that off!

213
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,115
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

214
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,049
Give us this day our daily bread,

215
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,986
and forgive us our trespasses as we 
forgive our trespassers,

216
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,652
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

217
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,290
To bed now. Good night.

218
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,101
Just curl up like a little doggie.

219
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,916
Did you do this?

220
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,798
Shit!

221
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,825
What is it?

222
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,344
One, two...

223
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,956
three, four...

224
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,196
Shoulders back!

225
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,774
You've got biceps like papier-mâché!

226
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,314
She's showing off her ass.

227
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,716
It's a lot better than yours.

228
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,890
Quiet!

229
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,457
Ciron, 20 extra push-ups!

230
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,287
Keep going!
Get those rear ends down!

231
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,675
It's an A-sharp.

232
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,851
Can't you hear
when you hit a wrong note?

233
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,712
Go on.

234
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,053
You should try the violin.

235
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,224
Do you hate music?

236
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,923
Not at all. 
But my mother forces me to take piano.

237
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,265
She's right. If you stop now,
you'll always regret it.

238
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,774
Time's up.

239
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,434
See you Tuesday.

240
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,571
Good-bye, miss.

241
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,443
- What's your name?
- Jean Bonnet.

242
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,391
Let's hear you play.

243
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,184
Try this.

244
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,778
Ass-kisser.

245
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,164
Bonnet, get back to your seat.

246
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,448
"My darling, as you know,

247
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,150
it's very hard
for me to write to you.

248
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,092
Mr. D. Was going to Lyon,

249
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,257
and he agreed to mail this.

250
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,663
Your aunt and I seldom go out..."

251
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,394
Julien Quentin.

252
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,703
Confession.

253
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,714
Your mother's up to something.

254
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,752
Oh, yes... I fought
with my sister on vacation.

255
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,724
Nothing else?

256
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,522
I don't think so.

257
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,632
No evil thoughts?

258
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,834
You know what I mean.
Everyone has them.

259
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,201
- Even you?
- Even me.

260
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,169
- What's wrong?
- Frostbite.

261
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,005
Show me.

262
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,416
It's a vitamin deficiency.

263
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,220
Tell Mrs. Perrin
to give you cod-liver oil.

264
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,791
It's the cold.
It's freezing in school.

265
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,428
I know.

266
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,298
But think of those
less fortunate than you.

267
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,103
You told your mother
you wanted to take holy orders.

268
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,030
She told you?

269
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,702
I don't think you have
any calling for the priesthood.

270
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,370
It's a sorry job anyway.

271
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,853
Say three Hail Marys.

272
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,022
You may stand up.

273
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,193
Who told you that?

274
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,063
You mustn't believe rumors.

275
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,505
What can I do?

276
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,047
We're in the Lord's hands.

277
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,625
Do you get along well with your 
new classmate?

278
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,059
Bonnet?

279
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,256
Be very nice to him.

280
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,603
The others look up to you.
I'm counting on you.

281
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,963
Why? Is he sick?

282
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,506
Not at all.
Run along now.

283
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,600
- Pétain's a loony.
- He is not.

284
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,636
If we didn't have Pétain,
we'd be in deep shit.

285
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,501
- Says who?
- My father.

286
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,438
My father says Laval sold out to 
the Germans.

287
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,407
Jews and Communists are worse 
than Germans.

288
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,843
- Your Dad says that?
- No, I do.

289
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,709
I'm not surprised.

290
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,292
Don't dawdle.
Stay together.

291
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,128
- Good, isn't it?
- What?

292
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,428
The Three Musketeers.
How far are you?

293
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,695
- Milady's trial.
- She's a real bitch.

294
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,233
- What are you gonna do later?
- I don't know. Math.

295
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,674
Math's a bunch of shit,
unless you want to be an accountant.

296
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,981
My father was an accountant.

297
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,049
PUBLIC BATHS
Hurry up, children.

298
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,282
Quentin, come along.

299
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,654
Come on, Babinot.

300
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,304
NO JEWS ALLOWED

301
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,980
Remember, we don't have much time.

302
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,816
You haven't bathed in two weeks.

303
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,620
Bonnet, is it true
you're not gonna be confirmed?

304
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,318
I'm a Protestant.

305
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,327
A heretic... disgusting!

306
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,831
Bonnet isn't a Protestant name.

307
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,834
It sure is.

308
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,305
- Second shower.
- Not a tub?

309
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,141
A shower. Now go!

310
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,376
Babinot, what are you doing?
That's enough now.

311
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,951
Bonnet, take the tub at the end.

312
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,222
- Can I have a tub too?
- In there.

313
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,453
- What about me?
- In there.

314
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,928
- It's tiny. My feet'll stick out.
- It'll have to do.

315
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,018
You should try the violin.

316
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,232
Quentin, what are you doing?

317
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,801
I'm waiting for your tub.

318
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,823
Smart-aleck.
I told you to hurry up.

319
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,591
I can't help it.

320
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,701
My soap won't lather.

321
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,835
Hurry up. It's freezing.

322
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,019
- That guy's got some nerve!
- Shut up.

323
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,348
It's cold. We'll run back.
Let's go!

324
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,358
Pull your arms back.

325
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,265
Squat, one and two.

326
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,668
Again.

327
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,350
Looks like the mountain troops.

328
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,579
No, they're militia.

329
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,486
This is a search.

330
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,885
You have no right to enter here.

331
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,060
This is a private school.

332
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,732
Only children and men of the cloth.

333
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,359
What do those collaborators want?

334
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,596
- We have orders.
- From whom?

335
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,069
Our superiors.

336
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,072
- I'll complain.
- To whom?

337
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,647
- You can go in now.
- Already? Great!

338
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,223
Hey!

339
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,593
Your jam was a big hit.
Got any more?

340
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,464
What did the militia want?

341
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,537
They're snooping around.
Heard there were draft dodgers here.

342
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,968
Draft dodgers?

343
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,632
Guys hiding out
to avoid forced labor in Germany.

344
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,211
Like Moreau, the monitor.
- Really?

345
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,872
Moreau's not his real name.
But I don't care.

346
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,716
With my leg, I'll be exempt.

347
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,720
- Joseph!
- Coming.

348
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,384
She's worse than going to Germany.

349
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,396
Rollin: Average. Nine and a half.

350
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,503
Bonnet? Not here.

351
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,570
Good riddance.

352
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,739
Quentin.

353
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:35,309
Intelligent, but a bit pretentious.

354
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,104
This, for example:

355
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,342
"Peguy sees the cathedral
as a grand and generous beacon."

356
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,421
Take your seat.

357
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,420
Where were you?

358
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,066
Ciron, 12 points.

359
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,263
Where do you get barges
in the middle of wheat fields?

360
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,409
On the Foussarde Canal, sir.
I was there on vacation.

361
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,237
Bonnet.

362
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,377
13 1/2. Good work.
Sensitive and well-written.

363
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,716
Quentin, you've got competition.

364
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,852
Who hasn't had his vitamin cracker?

365
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,162
D'Arsonval, stop lagging.

366
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,266
I can't pay you right away.

367
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,727
You promised.

368
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,406
Ask the little shit. I'm sure
the miser's hoarding some sugar.

369
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,238
Want some marbles?

370
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,580
Julien Quentin?

371
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,049
Wait!

372
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,488
Julien Quentin.

373
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,702
The apartment seems empty
without you.

374
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,280
Paris is no fun these days.
They bomb us nearly every night.

375
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,884
A bomb killed eight people yesterday.

376
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,611
Charming!

377
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,514
The girls are back in school.

378
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,284
Sophie works at the Red Cross
Thursdays and Sundays.

379
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,484
So many unfortunate people.

380
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,492
Dad's at the plant in Lille.
His factory's hardly producing.

381
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,529
He's in a foul mood.

382
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,334
It's really time this war ended.

383
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,368
I'll come get you Sunday at 8:00,
as we agreed.

384
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,537
We'll have lunch at Le Grand Cerf.

385
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,343
Can't wait to give you a big hug.

386
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,203
Your loving mother.

387
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,381
P.S. Eat your jam.
I'll bring you more.

388
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,447
Take good care of your health.

389
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,090
Beat it, buddy.

390
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,152
"First prize in arithmetic... Jean...

391
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,331
Jean Kippel...

392
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,905
Kippelstein."

393
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,343
I'm hungry.

394
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,015
What's a perpendicular bisector?

395
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,024
- A perpendicular in mid-segment.
- What's it good for?

396
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,053
That's a theta, not a tau.

397
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,873
We'll continue next time.

398
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,778
Greek is useful, you know.

399
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,574
All scientific words have Greek roots.

400
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,414
Who do you like best?
Athos or d'Artagnan?

401
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,149
Aramis.

402
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,489
He's a hypocrite.

403
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,596
Yeah, but he's the smartest one.

404
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,862
Why don't you take Greek?

405
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,829
- I took Latin.
- Where?

406
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,838
At school in Marseilles.

407
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,342
You're from Marseilles?
You don't have an accent.

408
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,578
I wasn't born there.

409
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,878
Where were you born?

410
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,052
You wouldn't know it if I told you.

411
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:30,586
Is Greek hard?
- Not once you know the alphabet.

412
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,921
Are your parents in Marseilles?

413
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,228
My dad's a prisoner.

414
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,099
He didn't escape?

415
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,809
And where's your mother?

416
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,476
You won't tell me?

417
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,215
- In the unoccupied zone.
- There's no unoccupied zone anymore.

418
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:58,513
I know that. Now lay off.
I don't know where she is.

419
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,418
She hasn't written in three months.
Happy now?

420
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,489
What are you two up to?

421
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,998
I have a cold.

422
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:16,904
Enough nonsense.
Go out and play.

423
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:23,572
Hippo's a bastard.
Always snooping around.

424
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:31,812
St. Thomas's proofs
of God's existence don't hold water.

425
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,853
I don't agree.

426
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,251
Since we can imagine God,
he must exist.

427
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,522
That's just sophistry.

428
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,166
At least Bergson 
seeks transcendence in science.

429
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,331
Hey, I want to talk to you.

430
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,435
- That's strong.
- It's the real thing, dummy.

431
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,409
Let's go somewhere else.
The monkeys will catch us here.

432
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,849
- Do me a favor.
- What?

433
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,183
Pass a note to your piano teacher.

434
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,122
- You're crazy! I'll get expelled!
- She won't say anything.

435
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,920
You're such a scaredy-cat.

436
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,366
François, what's a yid?

437
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,695
- A Jew.
- I know, but what exactly is a Jew?

438
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,599
- Someone who doesn't eat pork.
- Are you kidding me?

439
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,296
Not at all.

440
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,372
What have people got against them?

441
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,774
The fact they're smarter than us,
and they crucified Jesus.

442
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,811
That's not true.
It was the Romans.

443
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,047
Is that why they have to wear 
yellow stars?

444
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,652
- Will you take my letter to Davenne?
- No.

445
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,914
What do you want with her anyway?
- Never mind.

446
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,615
Be nice. I'll lend you my Arabian Nights. 
It'll give you a hard-on.

447
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,757
Leave me alone!

448
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,228
You smell awful, Joseph.

449
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,938
Stop it, right now!

450
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,201
He called me a creep!

451
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:02,469
That's enough now.
Calm down and go back to the kitchen.

452
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,105
"Down, Joseph! To your kennel!"

453
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,045
I'm not a dog!

454
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,947
Stop it, D'Arsonval!

455
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,762
Damn, a cross.
Another wrong trail.

456
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,401
We have to get back to the crossroads,
quickly and quietly.

457
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,140
There must be another trail at the fork.

458
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,309
I wonder where the others are.

459
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,242
What's today?

460
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,941
January 17. Thursday.

461
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,556
You realize there'll never be another 
January 17, 1944?

462
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,721
Never again.

463
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,594
Shut up and get a move on!

464
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,855
In 40 years,
half these guys'll be dead and buried.

465
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,529
Come on.

466
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:01,598
I'm the only one in this school
who thinks about death. It's incredible!

467
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,437
You're our prisoners.
Follow us.

468
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,774
We're gonna tie your hands.

469
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,022
There are two missing.
Over there! It's Quentin!

470
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,536
Wow!

471
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:43,087
I found the treasure.
The Greens win.

472
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,393
Didn't they catch you?

473
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,689
Yes, they tied me to a tree,
but I got free.

474
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,365
Bastards!

475
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,293
I found the treasure.
All by myself.

476
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,635
Are there wolves in these woods?

477
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,324
It's that way.

478
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,335
We go left. I'm sure.

479
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,409
- No, we go right.
- I told you, we go left.

480
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,828
It's the high wall next to the church, 
right?

481
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,939
I know it.
We Bavarians are Catholic.

482
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,347
Good evening, Father.
Lost any children?

483
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:07,216
We looked everywhere.
Always playing the fool, Julien!

484
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:11,019
That's not fair.
I found the treasure.

485
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,819
But everyone had vanished.

486
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,570
It's all right, my boy.

487
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,363
What happened?

488
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,864
They got arrested by the Krauts.

489
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,274
Could the Krauts

490
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,843
have their blanket back?

491
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,306
Thank you very much.

492
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:38,049
No civilians in the woods after 8:00 p.m.
Don't you know there's a curfew?

493
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,245
You think we did it on purpose?

494
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,049
I caught hell because of you.

495
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,658
You won because of me, jerk.

496
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,590
Come on. Hurry up.

497
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,902
Calm down.

498
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,546
Lafarge, out!

499
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,947
Feeling better, twerp?

500
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,554
A present from Joseph.

501
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,922
And a letter from your mom.

502
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,618
She's your mom too.

503
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,525
But you're her pet.

504
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,960
Dad's always off in Lille.
I bet she's getting plenty.

505
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,365
- What do you mean?
- Women are all whores, my friend.

506
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,002
Sorry, Sister.

507
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,537
What an idiot!

508
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,868
- Swabbing time.
- Again?

509
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,637
Three times a day.
Sit up straight.

510
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,842
Open your mouth.

511
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:43,583
Open wide.
Keep your tongue down.

512
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,528
Listen here!
Open your mouth!

513
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,304
- Were you scared last night?
- Not really.

514
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,505
I hear you saw some wild boar.

515
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,014
Were there lots?
- Around 50.

516
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,021
What about the Germans?

517
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,313
Did they really fire at you?

518
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,851
- Just a few bursts.
- Come on!

519
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,252
Nice book.

520
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,897
What is it?

521
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,397
The Arabian Nights.
It's my brother's.

522
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,593
It's banned by the monkeys.
- Why?

523
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,671
It's really dirty.
I'll lend it to you.

524
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,705
Recess is over.

525
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,073
We've got our religion class.

526
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,839
See you tomorrow.

527
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,319
- Kiss Mother Michel for me.
- Oh, we will.

528
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,354
The Arabian Nights.

529
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,976
You're disgusting.

530
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,115
It doesn't hurt it.

531
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,516
It's dead.

532
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,322
A present from Joseph.

533
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,363
No, thanks.
I don't like pâté.

534
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,001
Go on. Eat it.

535
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,330
I said no.
I don't like pâté.

536
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,442
Because it's pork?

537
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,777
Why do you always ask such 
stupid questions?

538
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,939
Because your name's Kippelstein,
not Bonnet.

539
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,382
Do you say "Kippelstine"
or "Kippelsteen"?

540
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,229
Bonnet, get back in bed
this minute or I'll report you!

541
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,964
And you quiet down.

542
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,478
- Are your parents coming?
- The whole family.

543
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,426
Aren't you dressing up?
No visitors?

544
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,064
What the hell is it to you?

545
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,957
My message today is especially
for the youngest among you

546
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:12,184
who will be confirmed in a few weeks.

547
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:13,721
My children,

548
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,057
we live in a time of discord and hatred.

549
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,698
Lies are all-powerful.
Christians kill one another.

550
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,527
Those who should guide us betray 
us instead.

551
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:27,103
More than ever, we must beware
of selfishness and indifference.

552
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:31,910
You're all from wealthy families,
some very wealthy.

553
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:36,551
Because you've been given much,
much will be asked of you.

554
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,782
Remember the Bible's stern lesson:

555
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,480
"It's easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle

556
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,196
than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven."

557
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,693
St. James said,

558
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:54,097
"Now, you rich, weep and wail
for the woes awaiting you."

559
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:58,364
Your wealth has rotted,
and your garments are eaten by worms."

560
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,841
Worldly wealth corrupts souls
and withers hearts.

561
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,606
It makes men contemptuous, unjust,

562
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,114
pitiless in their egoism.

563
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,287
I understand the anger
of those who have nothing

564
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,821
when the rich feast so arrogantly.

565
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,065
He's hitting pretty hard.

566
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:30,566
I don't mean to shock you

567
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:35,301
but only remind you
that charity is a Christian's first duty.

568
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,904
St. Paul tells us in today's Epistle,

569
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:42,744
"Brothers, be not wise in your 
own conceits.

570
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,943
Do not repay any man evil for evil.

571
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,016
If thine enemy hunger, feed him.

572
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,488
If he thirst, give him drink."

573
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:56,294
Let us pray for the hungry,
for those who suffer,

574
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,657
for the persecuted.

575
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,461
Let us pray for the victims

576
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,033
and for their executioners as well.

577
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,578
- Will you give concerts?
- Not right away.

578
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,576
I still need practice.

579
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,575
It's hard to get started.

580
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,748
It's Duvallier's dog.

581
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:27,582
- It'll bite you.
- He doesn't bite.

582
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,161
En garde, Easter Bonnet.

583
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,291
Help me, you guys!
Get the heretic!

584
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,529
You're really getting on my nerves.

585
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,065
Go, Julien!

586
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,082
Julien, have you gone mad!

587
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,019
Your best suit.

588
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,155
What'll they say at the restaurant?

589
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,794
What's gotten into you boys?
You think it's funny?

590
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,301
Was everything all right, Mr. Meyer?

591
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,572
Thank you.
The rabbit was tolerable.

592
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,941
Mrs. Quentin, your table's this way.

593
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,287
François, sit over there.
Julien here.

594
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,487
- We haven't seen you lately.
- Vacations.

595
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,831
What fish do you have?

596
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:50,028
We haven't had fish in ages, ma'am.

597
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:55,006
I recommend the rabbit.
Half a meal coupon per serving.

598
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,202
Is it rabbit or cat?

599
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,878
Rabbit, sir.
With sauteed potatoes.

600
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,574
- In butter?
- Margarine.

601
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,520
No coupons required.

602
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:10,317
Very well. We'll have the rabbit,
and a bottle of Bordeaux.

603
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,196
The place is full of Krauts.

604
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,997
I thought they were all on the 
Russian front.

605
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,239
You caught their eye.

606
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,606
Your parents couldn't come?

607
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,978
Poor boy.

608
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:35,580
What about Dad?

609
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,811
He said he was coming.
- He couldn't. Problems at the plant.

610
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,283
As usual.

611
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,549
Your poor father
is under a lot of pressure.

612
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,351
- Is he still for Pétain?
- No one is anymore.

613
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:52,099
I heard of your ordeal in the woods.
I gave Father Jean a piece of my mind.

614
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,003
Those boy scout games are ludicrous
in this freezing cold.

615
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:57,104
You could've died, my darling.

616
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,598
Guns do go off!
- Makes a man of him.

617
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,576
That's just what Father Jean said.

618
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,906
I mean really!

619
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,913
- He was with me in the woods.
- Oh, so it was you.

620
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,381
I bet you're from Lyon.

621
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,818
The name Gillet is from Lyon.
They're all in the silk trade.

622
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,418
His name's Bonnet, not Gillet.

623
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,159
Of course.

624
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,726
He's from Marseilles.

625
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,094
I knew a Bonnet there, a cousin
of the Du Perrons. Is she your mother?

626
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,462
How strange.

627
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,202
His father's an accountant.

628
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,872
Really.

629
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,521
Your papers, please.

630
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,032
Your papers, sir.

631
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,348
Can't you read?

632
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,351
This place is off limits to yids.

633
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,154
Why are those men bothering people?

634
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,657
That gentleman looks very proper.

635
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,896
Mr. Meyer's been coming here
for 20 years.

636
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,373
I can't just throw him out.
- Shut up, flunky!

637
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,607
I can have your license revoked.

638
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,468
Collaborators.

639
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,169
Quiet, François.

640
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,009
Did you say that?

641
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,514
He's a child.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

642
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,651
We serve France, lady.
He insulted us.

643
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,684
Go away!

644
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,859
It's monstrous.
You should be ashamed.

645
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,731
Not at all.

646
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,705
Leave him alone.

647
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,500
He's right.
Send the Jews to Moscow!

648
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,478
Get the hell out of here!

649
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,878
You understand?
Get the hell out!

650
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,592
We'll meet again.

651
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,631
Say what you will,
but some of them are decent.

652
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,967
He was showing off for you.

653
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,489
Aren't we Jewish?

654
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,154
- That's all we need!
- Isn't Aunt Reinach Jewish?

655
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:08,394
- She's Alsatian.
- You can be Alsatian and Jewish.

656
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,597
That's quite enough!
The Reinachs are devout Catholics!

657
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,097
If they heard you!

658
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,428
Mind you,
I have nothing against Jews.

659
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,267
Except for that Léon Blum.
They can hang him.

660
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,071
Julien, sit up straight.

661
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:32,317
Your friend is nice.
He doesn't say much.

662
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:33,987
He has his reasons.

663
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:37,215
- Then he's no dummy.
- Not at all.

664
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,886
Where's François?
What's he up to?

665
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:45,225
He always gives the Krauts
wrong directions.

666
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,059
Very clever!

667
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,664
- What if I joined the resistance?
- Nonsense. You must finish school.

668
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,539
Some things are
more important than school.

669
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,580
Julien wants to become a monkey.

670
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,182
Not a monkey.
A missionary in the Congo.

671
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:05,751
Stop using that stupid word.
It's awful.

672
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,385
You should be grateful
to those poor monks who...

673
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,058
"...work so hard to educate you."

674
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,994
Precisely!

675
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,228
You're a real pain.
Leave me alone.

676
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,098
Fernande!

677
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,664
You know her?

678
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,510
Julien, are you sure
you want to become a priest?

679
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,806
- Would you object?
- Not at all.

680
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,413
Your father and I would be proud.

681
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,278
But why not engineering,
like Grandpa?

682
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,046
Don't worry.

683
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:44,885
He'll give up the church for a girl.
He's a lover boy, like Joseph.

684
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,604
Laviron's sister is a real dish.

685
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,837
I'm gonna sweet-talk her.

686
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,550
I can't kiss you anymore?

687
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,752
Look at that.
You've got a little mustache.

688
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:18,191
Can I go back to Paris with you?
Dad won't know.

689
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,138
Did you have a good lunch?

690
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,083
Your mother's nice.
Boy, can she talk fast.

691
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:46,853
She's crazy.

692
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,456
You'll see her again soon.

693
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,591
I know how to thread it.

694
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,634
It'll break like last time.

695
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,566
No, it won't.

696
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,277
Your jam's great.

697
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,408
- Adrienne made it.
- Is that your sister?

698
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,446
No, she's the cook.

699
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,681
What's funny?
Don't you have a cook?

700
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,450
You always eat out?
- No. My mom's a great cook.

701
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:37,034
- You're eating my jam.
- Stop it.

702
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,002
Move over, guys.

703
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,737
We're ready.

704
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,611
Turn out the lights, please.

705
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,283
The fat lady's gonna go sliding.

706
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,250
Looks like Mrs. Perrin.

707
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,728
She's beautiful.

708
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,265
He's in love.

709
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,462
She loves him too.

710
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,526
Shit!

711
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:40,939
Time to get up.

712
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,646
Quentin wets the bed.

713
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,953
Quentin wets the bed.

714
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,497
Hurry up in the washroom.

715
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,765
It never fails.

716
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,126
I'm having a great dream.

717
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:06,034
I feel like peeing.
I open my fly. Everything's great.

718
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,511
Then I wake up and feel
the warm piss on my stomach.

719
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,907
It's no fun, let me tell you.

720
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:20,217
Try it. Don't be scared.

721
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,754
Go on. Keep your head up.

722
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:28,727
Get back up.

723
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,032
- Bed wetter.
- Sagard, you're gonna get it.

724
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,001
You dirty thief!

725
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,639
You're the thief!

726
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:42,105
Just you wait, you thief!

727
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,745
Father Michel, I caught him stealing lard!

728
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,915
He put it in his bag to sell!

729
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,982
Not in front of the boys, Mrs. Perrin!

730
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:54,212
- I told you he was stealing!
- It's not true, damn it!

731
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,822
She's the thief!
She's a liar!

732
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:58,921
Get back in the kitchen.

733
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,529
I told that idiot he'd get caught.

734
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:10,801
Joseph was selling our supplies
on the black market.

735
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:15,567
Mrs. Perrin should have told us.
She may have been in on it.

736
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,674
But that's not all.

737
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:22,640
We found these in his locker.
Private food supplies.

738
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,949
He named all seven of you.

739
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:27,121
Whose pâté is this?

740
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,188
Mine.

741
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,859
- And the jam?
- Mine.

742
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,288
Know what you are?

743
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,896
A thief, just like Joseph.

744
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:39,566
I didn't steal.
That jam was mine.

745
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,497
You should've shared it.

746
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,700
I believe true education consists in 
teaching you

747
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,101
to make good use of your freedom.

748
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:48,904
And this is what happens!

749
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,907
You disgust me. There's nothing
I despise more than the black market.

750
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,782
Always money!

751
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,642
It wasn't for money.
We traded, that's all.

752
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,444
For what?

753
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:01,915
Cigarettes.

754
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:06,822
Quentin, if it weren't for your parents,
I'd kick you out at once.

755
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:08,824
You and your brother.

756
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,731
I have to fire Joseph, even though 
it's unfair.

757
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,703
You're all confined to school
until Easter.

758
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,074
Now go back to class.

759
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,115
Where do I go now?
I don't even have a place to sleep.

760
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,857
Get back to class.

761
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,860
Go see the bursar.
He'll pay you a month's wages.

762
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:51,664
I end up taking the rap.
It's not fair.

763
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:55,800
Come on, Joseph.

764
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,257
- What are you doing here?
- Choir practice.

765
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:23,631
You two help me
with the flowers for Sunday.

766
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,574
We'll take it from "O Lord, in thee..."

767
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,279
Bonnet's not here?

768
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,456
- No, miss. He's in the infirmary.
- Really?

769
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,912
It's easy.
Do this with your left hand.

770
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,366
We'd better get to the shelter.

771
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:39,670
Everyone in the shelter, and hurry!

772
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:54,193
They won't miss us.
They never count.

773
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:55,679
I hope the Americans land soon.

774
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,354
Will you stay at this school when 
the war's over?

775
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,688
I don't know. I doubt it.

776
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:10,995
You scared?

777
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,431
All the time.

778
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,712
How long's it been since you saw him?

779
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,781
My father?
Almost two years.

780
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,658
I never see mine either.

781
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,703
What are you doing here, Joseph?

782
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,975
I forgot some things.

783
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,409
What about you?

784
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:11,496
"Could I, lad,
belong to anyone but you?

785
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:15,800
She swiftly cast aside her veils,
removed her clothing,

786
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,199
and appeared naked as the day she 
was born.

787
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:20,601
Blessed be the womb that bore her.

788
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:24,805
The princess was
as soft and white as fine linen.

789
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,639
Her whole being
exuded a scent of amber.

790
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,616
He took her in his arms,

791
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:34,219
probing her intimate depths,
and found she was a virgin pearl.

792
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:38,014
His hand roved
over her lovely limbs and neck

793
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:41,024
and through the richness of her hair.

794
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:45,599
She responded by eagerly displaying
her many gifts.

795
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,793
She had the sinuous grace of Araby,
Ethiopian ardor,

796
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:53,235
the startled candor of the French,
the high art of the Indians,

797
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,136
Yemeni coyness,

798
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:59,370
and the narrow passage of a 
Chinese girl.

799
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:04,748
Each embrace became a coupling,

800
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:08,047
and each coupling
the wildest fornication,

801
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:12,158
until, weary from
their passionate writhings,

802
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:17,320
they fell asleep in each other's arms,
drunk with pleasure.

803
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,599
Thus ended..."

804
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:30,271
The Russians have begun
a major offensive in the Ukraine.

805
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,205
British radio claims
the Germans have been overrun

806
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:38,146
along a 60-mile front west of Kiev.

807
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,854
Radio Paris claims the attack was repulsed

808
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,886
with heavy losses.

809
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,359
The truth is likely
somewhere between the two.

810
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,462
Radio Paris tells German lies

811
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:51,291
Meanwhile, in Italy,

812
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:56,766
the Americans and British
are pinned down at Monte Cassino.

813
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,574
Take out your notebooks for an 
algebra problem.

814
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:05,702
We're going to multiply two monomials.

815
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:10,075
May I be excused, sir?
It's the soup.

816
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,751
It's always you, Sagard.
Go on.

817
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:50,221
Dr. Müller. Gestapo.

818
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,262
Which one of you is Jean Kippelstein?

819
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,696
Answer me.

820
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:04,965
There's no one by that name in this class.

821
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,458
Let's go.

822
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:37,097
That boy is not French.

823
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,700
He's a Jew.

824
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:47,474
Your principal committed
a serious crime by hiding him.

825
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,011
The school is closed.

826
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:57,241
You have two hours to pack your bags
and line up in the yard.

827
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:05,125
Was Bonnet a Jew?

828
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,022
Keep calm, children.

829
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,768
Quiet down and listen to me, children.

830
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,541
They've arrested Father Jean.

831
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,238
It seems we've been denounced.

832
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,682
What about Bonnet?

833
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:31,875
Bonnet, Dupré and Lafarge
are Jewish.

834
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,253
Father Jean took them in
because their lives were in danger.

835
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:40,723
Go to the dormitory
and pack quickly and calmly.

836
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:44,122
But first we'll say a prayer
for Father Jean and your friends.

837
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,327
Our Father, who art in heaven...

838
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,355
Negus got away.

839
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:15,426
They didn't get Negus.

840
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:19,828
They're looking for him and Moreau.
Father Jean had resistance leaflets.

841
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:23,863
When you're ready, go to the dining hall.

842
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:28,335
Quentin, pack Laviron's bag
and take it to the infirmary. Hurry!

843
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,135
Want some help?

844
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,795
Don't worry.
They'd have gotten me anyway.

845
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,432
Negus got away.

846
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,139
I know.

847
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:43,107
Take these.
I've read them all.

848
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:53,557
You want The Arabian Nights?

849
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:22,819
- What are you doing here?
- I brought his bag.

850
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,123
Are you gonna get up?

851
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:32,858
What do you want now?

852
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:35,058
We can't stay here.
They're searching the attic.

853
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:55,680
Sister, put a compress on him!

854
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,152
Hurry!

855
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,757
You'll get us all arrested!

856
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,782
There's a Jew here.
I'm sure of it.

857
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,789
We haven't seen anyone.

858
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:33,459
You, come here.

859
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:38,160
Pull down your pants. Quick!

860
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:28,639
What happened?

861
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:31,441
- It's her.
- Get out!

862
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:36,051
I'm going over the roof.
Good-bye, Julien.

863
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:08,485
He's a friend.

864
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:16,358
What are you doing with them?

865
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:22,100
Here.

866
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,697
Aren't you happy?
You'll get a vacation.

867
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:37,540
You don't smoke?

868
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:48,087
Don't worry about it.
They're just Jews.

869
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:54,896
You really liked Bonnet?

870
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:05,041
Don't act so pious!
You guys are to blame!

871
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:08,076
I got fired
for doing business with you.

872
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:10,307
Mrs. Perrin stole more than I did.

873
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:16,650
Stop acting so pious!

874
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:19,052
There's a war going on, kid.

875
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,312
Are there any other Jews among you?

876
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,351
Answer me!

877
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:09,934
What about you?
Sure you're not Jewish?

878
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:11,406
Your name?

879
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,443
Pierre de la Rozière.

880
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:15,738
Go stand against the wall.

881
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,294
You think they'll arrest us?

882
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:03,495
We didn't do anything.

883
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,256
We were in the chapel.

884
01:40:30,824 --> 01:40:33,657
We came for confession.

885
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:46,036
That soldier did his duty.

886
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,504
His orders were to let no one leave.

887
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:55,014
The strength of the German soldier
is his discipline.

888
01:40:56,116 --> 01:40:59,711
That's what you French lack:
Discipline.

889
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:05,686
We're not your enemies.

890
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:10,290
You must help us rid France of 
foreigners and Jews.

891
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:49,102
Good-bye, Father.

892
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:55,333
Good-bye, children.
See you soon.

893
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:21,496
Bonnet, Negus and Dupré

894
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:23,363
died at Auschwitz.

895
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:26,300
Father Jean
died in the camp at Mauthausen.

896
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:31,410
The school reopened its doors
in October of 1944.

897
01:42:32,012 --> 01:42:33,980
More than 40 years have passed,

898
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:39,551
but I'll remember every second of that
January morning until the day I die.
