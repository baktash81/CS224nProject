1
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,110
Mind your step, Jenny.

2
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:45,413
Don't you worry none about me.
I can hold me gin.

3
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,386
I'm right as rain.

4
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,354
Ta-ta, love.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,892
Mind how you go.

6
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,670
- Evening.
- Good evening.

7
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:49,315
- Is a raw night, isn't it?
- Yes. Raw.

8
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:56,850
- You'll ruin them fine clothes.
- Would you like this?

9
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,409
Come straight to the point,
don't you, love?

10
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,946
Well, my place is right along here.

11
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,218
No.

12
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,320
There.

13
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,434
We are in a hurry, aren't we?

14
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,904
Come on, then.

15
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,308
Come along.

16
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,195
Oh, right you are, sir.

17
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,662
Wouldn't want to break it.

18
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:17,305
Wow. Thas lovely.

19
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:21,569
We got our own band.

20
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:27,272
Come on, then.

21
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:32,543
I'm hot and getting colder,
if you take my meaning.

22
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,992
- Whas your name, dearie?
- John.

23
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,059
John.

24
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,825
John.

25
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,557
Oh, John.

26
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,604
Oh, John.

27
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,530
John.

28
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:53,998
John.

29
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,270
But my friends all call me Jack.

30
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:05,877
Will The Gazette continue
with your pieces on free love, H. G?

31
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:11,019
Free love sells newspapers.
Gentleman, the Fleet Street Casanova.

32
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,949
Here, here.

33
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,148
I've got my little experiments
to pay for.

34
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:21,023
You're the hero of the working class.
Free love is all they can afford.

35
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,527
Oh, Lord.
Don't start him on socialism.

36
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,828
We'll have to listen
to a sermon on it.

37
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:33,065
Don't call it a sermon. You know
I don't believe in organized religion.

38
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:38,612
Socialism is the path man must tread
on the way to a utopian society.

39
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,445
We've heard all that. Whas this
great announcement we're here for?

40
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,646
- A cure for gravity?
- I want to wait until we're all here.

41
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,916
Who's missing?

42
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,960
- Dr. Stevenson is here.
- Thank you. Send him in.

43
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,262
- Good evening, John.
- Herbert.

44
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,935
- Good evening.
- Hello.

45
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:04,630
We'd begun to despair. Have you dined?
There's still roast beef.

46
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,971
Thank you, no. Perhaps a little brandy
to take away the chill.

47
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:14,013
I'm sorry I missed supper, but
a physician's hours are not his own.

48
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,514
- Gentlemen.
- Good health.

49
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,153
Cheers.

50
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,953
What has Herbert left for me tonight?

51
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,120
Chess must wait.
You're just in time for the surprise.

52
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,665
Isn't he, H. G?
The great big whatever-it-is?

53
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,565
- Am I?
- I was waiting for you.

54
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,744
- I am all attention.
- Very well.

55
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:53,715
Gentlemen, I have called you here
tonight to bid you farewell.

56
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,948
- Farewell?
- Where are you going?

57
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,495
- Another holiday in Scotland?
- No. No, I am traveling...

58
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:07,897
...but I'm not leaving London.
I don't expect to leave my laboratory.

59
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,436
- Riddles again.
- Gentlemen.

60
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,939
I am talking about traveling
through time.

61
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:18,136
In a machine constructed
for that very purpose.

62
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,548
What?

63
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:24,419
- Poppycock.
- Why?

64
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:30,783
Electric light, courtesy of Edison,
a modern Prometheus.

65
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:36,021
Good heavens. You were really serious.

66
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:42,767
I don't believe it. You've actually
built the bloody thing.

67
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:46,066
- Free love paid for most of it.
- I've no doubt.

68
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,210
I didn't think practical jokes
was in your line.

69
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:54,315
Twelve years ago, an engineer used
the sun to power a printing press.

70
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,953
My time machine
uses the same power source.

71
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:02,716
- You can't be serious.
- This thing is propelled by sunshine?

72
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,860
This cup catches
the rays of the sun...

73
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:09,657
...converting its heat
to electricity here.

74
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:15,201
Electricity does the rest. Juxtaposing
fields of energy creating friction.

75
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:19,170
The result is an ever-increasing
series of reactions...

76
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:25,746
...that literally rotates the machine
out of one time sphere into another.

77
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:30,112
Cruising speed is two years per
minute. Go into the past or future.

78
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,986
Two years per minute?

79
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:36,591
Acceleration keeps the machine and
occupant outside all time spheres...

80
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:41,661
...conscious, but vaporized.
- How do you determine direction?

81
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,857
West, you gain yesterdays.
East, you accumulate tomorrows.

82
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,162
Balderdash!
Go north, you get to Glasgow.

83
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:53,172
The machine is designed
with several safety features.

84
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:57,972
The reversal rotation lock returns
the machine to its starting date...

85
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,478
...after the completion of a voyage.

86
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,618
If the occupant is injured
during a flight...

87
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,313
...the passenger is returned
to the point of departure.

88
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:14,759
Unless he uses this key
to countermand the device.

89
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:18,092
Without that key,
is a bloody homing pigeon.

90
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,930
And what, may I ask, is this?

91
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,137
Well, John...

92
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:31,945
...this is the vaporizing equalizer.

93
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:36,141
Without it, the passenger journeys
without the machine...

94
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:40,755
...and without the machine,
there is no coming back.

95
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,622
Well, H.G., which is it to be?
The past or the future?

96
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,392
The past, surely.
He'll want to meet Cleopatra.

97
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,331
- The future.
- Why the future?

98
00:10:55,538 --> 00:11:00,908
I belong there. In three generations,
social utopia will have come to pass.

99
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,878
There'll be no war, crime or poverty.
And no disease either, John.

100
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,849
Men will live like brothers,
and in equality with women.

101
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,819
- Oh, dear. Les have the past.
- Here, here.

102
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:19,750
I can't agree with you. Check.

103
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:25,298
You astonish me. In the midst of all
your theorizing, you ignore the facts.

104
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:30,404
We live in a cosmic charnel house.
Mankind has not changed in 2000 years.

105
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:34,804
We hunt, we're hunted. Thas
how it is. How it will always be.

106
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,907
The future will prove you wrong.

107
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,344
The future will tell.

108
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,743
Anyway, I have just one question
for myself. When do you leave?

109
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,424
- I'm not sure.
- Human frailty, at last.

110
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,022
Well, to be quite candid...

111
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,362
...I haven't worked up the nerve.
- First time for that.

112
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:04,801
But I will. All I have to do is set
the date and activate the switches.

113
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:07,271
And I'll inherit the Hope diamond.

114
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,411
- Checkmate.
- How does he do it?

115
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,342
- Not again?
- Every time.

116
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,176
I know how he thinks. Thas all.

117
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:20,151
- One day I shall win.
- When you learn how I think.

118
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:28,387
Sorry to interrupt. Two gentlemen from
Scotland Yard want a word with you.

119
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,263
What is the meaning of this?

120
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,736
Beg pardon, sir.
Might we have a word with you?

121
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,306
- The Ripper? In this vicinity?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

122
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:51,850
We've cordoned off the neighborhood.
We're asking for cooperation.

123
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:56,218
Will that be all right? Your
housekeeper will sleep better.

124
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,620
- By all means.
- Thank you, sir.

125
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,625
Whas happened?

126
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,992
Apparently, the Ripper
has struck again.

127
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,261
- With your permission, sir.
- Please.

128
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,963
- He's not been heard from in years.
- Nor in this area.

129
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:16,736
No doubt about it, I'm afraid.
He has a very distinctive style.

130
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:20,507
- What have you there?
- You better look at this, sir.

131
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:26,516
- Thas Dr. Stevenson's bag.
- That belongs to one of my guests.

132
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:33,351
- Whas his name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.

133
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:39,762
- Chief surgeon at St. Bartholomew's...
- Also chief surgeon in Whitechapel.

134
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,553
- Nothing upstairs.
- All windows locked.

135
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,052
- Skylight?
- Closed.

136
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,657
- Checked the roof. No sign.
- In back?

137
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:07,920
A high brick wall.
He's not gone that way.

138
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,564
- He was with you just now?
- Yes.

139
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,826
He must have gone out the front,
as we came in.

140
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:18,905
It doesn't matter. We know who he is,
which is more than before tonight.

141
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:25,069
We'll round him up. If you come with
me, I'll see that you get home safe.

142
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,511
- There's bound to be an explanation.
- Beyond belief.

143
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,124
Thank you, dear. Thas my umbrella.

144
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,926
I've never been so frightened. All the
times I've put that bag in the closet.

145
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,868
- I wonder he didn't take it with him.
- We'd never have known.

146
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:57,603
- He was always such a gentleman.
- Yes. A gentleman.

147
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,773
I wonder where he got to so fast.
The coppers searched high and low.

148
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,283
We were by the door the whole time.

149
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,514
If he fooled them this long,
no surprise he's done it again.

150
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,217
- What did you say?
- We were by the door the whole time.

151
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:23,067
When you learn how I think.

152
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,121
1979.

153
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:30,793
What have I done?

154
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,361
I've turned that bloody maniac
loose upon utopia.

155
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,971
- Mr. Wells...
- Bring me all the housekeeping money.

156
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:44,373
And any money you have of your own.
I'll make it up to you.

157
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,783
- How much?
- Fifteen pounds, sixpence.

158
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:28,082
- You want it all?
- All, if you please, Mrs. Turner.

159
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:34,826
- Something wrong, sir?
- Would you mind awfully?

160
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:40,091
Money may not answer.
I may have to trade with the natives.

161
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,690
Let me see. The key.

162
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:13,093
86 years. Two years per minute.
That makes 43 minutes.

163
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:16,430
Estimated time of arrival would be...

164
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,232
11:15.

165
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:21,734
Right.

166
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:26,844
Utopia.

167
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,841
Mr. Wells?

168
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,646
Mr. Wells?

169
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,509
Lindbergh's over the Irish coast...

170
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,221
support of the woman I love...

171
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:53,952
we have to fear is...

172
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,492
their finest hour...

173
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,567
attacked Pearl Harbor...

174
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,329
I shall return...

175
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,234
this is London...

176
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:12,110
whose throat you'd like to cut...

177
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,613
proclaim the state of Israel...

178
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:21,948
Queen Elizabeth II is crowned...

179
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,890
from North Korea...

180
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,526
Ask not...

181
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,787
President Kennedy is dead...

182
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:30,988
Martin Luther King...

183
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,827
one small step for man...

184
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,303
lsraeli athletes were killed...

185
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,338
Vietnam cease-fire agreement...

186
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,740
because of Watergate...

187
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,377
second test-tube baby...

188
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:46,410
Pope John Paul's successor...

189
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,976
and executed four generals...

190
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,980
Mommy, look at that.

191
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,815
Mommy, come over here.

192
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,489
Mommy. Who's that man?

193
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,097
Jason, come away.
He probably works here.

194
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,501
The Wells exhibit is on loan
from the British Muzeum.

195
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:13,805
The objects in this hall
form a portrait of the public...

196
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,274
...and private life
of an extraordinary person...

197
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,939
...whose prophetic vision influenced
the shape of things to come.

198
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,814
On your left is the inlaid wood
secretary with a unique top...

199
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:30,753
...from Wells' rooms.
It was on this desk...

200
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,325
Hey! Get away from the exhibit.

201
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,359
Where do you think you are,
Disneyland?

202
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:44,639
- Pardon?
- You heard me. Get behind those ropes.

203
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:49,435
- Was discovered by workmen
digging where Wells' house once stood.

204
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:50,736
Come on.

205
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,779
The reasons for his building it
are unknown.

206
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,091
- That it didn't work
made him avoid discussing it.

207
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:14,291
- H.G. Wells was born in...
- Novel? Time Machine?

208
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,575
You people. Christ, Almighty.

209
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,048
Never.

210
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:09,453
Eight hours off.

211
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:25,328
What did you do to my car?
Can't you drive?

212
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,865
Some SOB can't read.

213
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,877
- Could you tell me what city this is?
- Oh, come on.

214
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,262
Could you please tell me
what city this?

215
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,966
San Francisco?

216
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:13,614
California. Of course!
Eight hours difference.

217
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:19,082
Thirteen, 14, 15 pounds. This money
is quite old, you're aware of that.

218
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:22,418
- They're still good, aren't they?
- Sure.

219
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,354
A coin dealer would give you more.

220
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,758
Here, all you'll get is the current
exchange rate, which is...

221
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,096
...$25.50.

222
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:38,834
- Twenty-five dollars?
- Really, is the same all over.

223
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,170
Money makes the world go round.
Is just worth less and less.

224
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,439
Money, yes.
Everyone needs money.

225
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,677
Has there been another gentlemen
here recently...

226
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:56,050
...another Englishman
with currency like mine?

227
00:27:56,257 --> 00:28:01,092
Not that I recall.
And they would have sent him to me.

228
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:02,888
I see.

229
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:26,546
Get me a Big Mac, an order of fries
and a small Coke to go, please.

230
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,021
Thank you, dear.

231
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:39,627
Get me a Big Mac, fries
and tea to go, please.

232
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:52,903
Pommes frites.
Fries are pommes frites.

233
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:10,629
I never saw wood like this before.

234
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:54,436
I haven't seen stones in settings
like these since before the war.

235
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:57,770
- The war?
- Since the Second World War. You know.

236
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:03,450
- Did you say, "world war"?
- Since World War II, I said.

237
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:13,861
- How much are they worth?
- Today's market? $6000 easy.

238
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:18,961
- Would you like to buy them?
- I couldn't give you top dollar.

239
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,398
Thas all right. Whas your offer?

240
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:37,215
- Four?
- Yes. Very well.

241
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:41,616
You don't want to think about it?
Okay. May I see some ID?

242
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:47,727
You know. Driver's license,
credit card, something like that.

243
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,960
- I'm afraid I don't have some.
- I can't do business without some ID.

244
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:56,602
- How do I know these aren't hot?
- Hot?

245
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,328
- Stolen.
- Stolen?

246
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:01,804
I assure you, I give you my word
as a gentleman.

247
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,504
Come on, whas this gentleman stuff?
How come you don't got any ID?

248
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:13,548
Let me do a computer check. If is
clear, you'll have a check in a week.

249
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,245
I don't have a week.

250
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,955
I don't believe you exist.

251
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:02,494
But if you do, I need your help.

252
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,269
Just let me stay the night...

253
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:11,241
...and I'll be on my way in the
morning. I won't trouble you again.

254
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:20,646
I'm sorry. We're closing now.

255
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,517
Utopia.

256
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:06,064
200. 300. 400.

257
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,727
There you are, sir.

258
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,773
May I help you?

259
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:57,917
I'd like to see the foreign
currency officer.

260
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,349
- You're looking at him.
- You?

261
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,124
Surely there must be a gentleman?

262
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:09,820
Don't be a chauvinist. Is taken
me three years to get here.

263
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:13,558
Don't you believe in women's
liberation?

264
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:16,999
Women's liberation.

265
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:20,439
I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect.

266
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,266
In fact, I was all for it,
so I shouldn't complain.

267
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,506
You were all for it?
What changed your mind?

268
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,681
Nothing.

269
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:35,151
I don't know whether you can help me.

270
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:41,357
- May I help you?
- Thank you.

271
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:44,558
I'm certainly willing for you to try.

272
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:49,328
I'm looking for an Englishman who may
have tried to exchange money.

273
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,061
I'll say.

274
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:52,534
Then he was here?

275
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:56,538
Yesterday, big as life.
With a money belt that was bigger.

276
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:59,235
Musve weighed a ton. A friend?

277
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:04,648
We were traveling together,
and now I've lost him.

278
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:08,720
- His name was John Leslie Stevenson.
- Thas him.

279
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:13,690
I wanted him to open an account but
he only cashed a few hundred dollars.

280
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:17,023
You wouldn't happen to know
whas become of him?

281
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:20,662
He asked me to recommend a hotel.

282
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:25,100
- An hotel?
- I sent him to the Hyatt Regency.

283
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,203
- Hyatt Regency?
- Yeah.

284
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,336
Oh, thank you.

285
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,982
You here on a visit?

286
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,351
Tourist type thing?

287
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,559
If you don't know anyone,
let me show you around.

288
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,894
We San Franciscans are pretty
proud of this old town.

289
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:58,627
Well...

290
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:03,038
...yes, perhaps that might be nice.

291
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:10,516
Is your option. You've got the card.
Give me a ring. My name's Amy.

292
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,652
- A ring?
- You know:

293
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,423
My number's on the card.

294
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:24,665
- Whas your name?
- Herbert...

295
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:28,892
...Wells.

296
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,039
What was that?

297
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:42,145
That was a very cute man.

298
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:44,279
That was a pickup.

299
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,985
- Against bank rules.
- I don't care.

300
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:52,319
At least he's not gay.
Plus, I love the way he talks.

301
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,723
How about that suit? Early American.

302
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,429
He'll be back.

303
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,187
- Whas up, doc?
- Pardon?

304
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,557
Where to?

305
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,633
Could you take me, as quickly
as possible, to the Hyatt...?

306
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:33,419
- Who is it?
- Your breakfast, sir.

307
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:57,817
- Bless my soul.
- May I come in?

308
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,648
Certainly, certainly.

309
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:07,226
You were literally the last person
on earth I expected to see.

310
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:12,396
There was no way to prevent the
machine's return. I lack the key.

311
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,835
- No.
- You do manage to find the nerve...

312
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:19,268
...after I tested
your machine for you.

313
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:24,075
How did you manage to track me down?
That was brilliant.

314
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,509
We'll add detective to your list
of accomplishments.

315
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,650
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.

316
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:34,553
I'm not here to engage
in idle banter, Stevenson.

317
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:37,918
You've used me and my machine
to escape justice.

318
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,094
I must congratulate you on the device.

319
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:45,994
At dinner the other century,
I thought you'd lost your wits.

320
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,797
Fate intervened, and I ascertained
that you are a Columbus of a new age.

321
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:54,702
The dawn of time travel.

322
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:56,638
I salute you.

323
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:02,713
- Come with me.
- Of course. Where are we going?

324
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,081
To the muzeum.

325
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm obliged to take you back to face
the consequences of your acts.

326
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,894
You can't be serious.

327
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:18,623
You're so Victorian.
How do I get back? By force?

328
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,997
Be reasonable, John.
We don't belong here.

329
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:26,696
- We violated...
- We don't belong here?

330
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,800
Let me show you something.

331
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,770
Sit down.

332
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,510
Come on, I won't bite. Sit.

333
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:43,585
Now, look...

334
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,555
Terrorists carried out their threat
and began shooting...

335
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:53,529
...the first five of 106 Israeli
schoolchildren held hostage...

336
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:06,074
You haven't gone forward, Herbert.
You've gone back.

337
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,424
We've just received word that
Mayor Margolin of Columbus was shot.

338
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:25,296
We don't belong here.
On the contrary...

339
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,292
...I belong here completely
and utterly.

340
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,364
I'm home.

341
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,369
Is you who do not belong here.

342
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:43,007
You, with your absurd notions of a
perfect and harmonious society. Drivel.

343
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:48,121
The world has caught up
and surpassed me.

344
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,826
Ninety years ago, I was a freak.
Today, I'm an amateur.

345
00:41:54,228 --> 00:42:00,497
You go back. The future isn't
what you thought. Is what I am.

346
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:05,530
Do you know that you can
purchase a rifle? Is legal.

347
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,139
- These people encourage...
- Stop it!

348
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:15,876
Is catching, isn't it?

349
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,639
Violence.

350
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:23,216
You finding me is rather fortuitous.
For me, that is.

351
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,685
Otherwise, I'd be obliged
to search for you.

352
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,556
Are you going to give it to me?

353
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,066
- I have no idea what you mean.
- Of course you do.

354
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,669
I'm talking about the key.

355
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,903
I can't have you following me for
eternity, like the Flying Dutchman.

356
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,907
Give me the key and we'll be quits.

357
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,514
IKey? I don't have it with me.

358
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:54,817
I've played countless games
of chess with you...

359
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:58,348
...and the one thing
you cannot do is bluff.

360
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:03,860
I want that key.

361
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:07,860
Oh, God.

362
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:12,936
Maid.

363
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:21,270
Seòor.

364
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,366
Stevenson.

365
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,425
Is he okay?

366
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:09,776
I beg your pardon.

367
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:12,213
Just a moment, please.

368
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,317
Yes?

369
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,456
I'm looking for a patient
recently admitted.

370
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:21,458
- Name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.

371
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:25,857
- Not here.
- They told me he'd be here.

372
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:30,829
- This is San Francisco Hospital?
- Not here under that name. Next.

373
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,872
- He just arrived. A motorcar hit him.
- A motorcar?

374
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:36,709
- Pardon?
- A car.

375
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:38,405
Yes, a car.

376
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:44,284
He's a tall, flaxen-haired,
distinguished-looking Englishman.

377
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,476
Just a minute, please.

378
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:54,758
Sorry. An accident victim matching
your description died 20 minutes ago.

379
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:58,625
- We had him listed as John Doe.
- Died?

380
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:02,265
Lmpossible. I saw him sitting
up after the accident.

381
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:05,302
His chart says, "internal injuries."

382
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,506
It happens that way sometimes.

383
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:12,671
Wait. May I see the body?

384
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,442
Are you family? Are you a relative?

385
00:47:17,651 --> 00:47:20,415
- He doesn't have any relatives.
- I'm sorry.

386
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,681
- Wait a minute, please.
- Excuse me.

387
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,832
O- R-A-J.

388
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,445
Gloriosky.

389
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,555
- Oh.
- Hello.

390
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,990
You'll let me take you to lunch.

391
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:05,289
Hello. What did you say?

392
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:07,990
I said, lunch on me.
What do you say?

393
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:10,260
Oh, well...

394
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,296
Just let me get my things.

395
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:18,003
That is what you had in mind?

396
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,777
- Certainly, if you like.
- Wait right there.

397
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:44,665
All set. Where to?

398
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:48,702
Well, is your city.
I'll leave it up to you.

399
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,307
I know, something with a view.

400
00:48:54,881 --> 00:49:00,877
Don't worry, is safe. We haven't had
any trouble since the big one in 1906.

401
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:02,612
Big one?

402
00:49:02,823 --> 00:49:06,816
The earthquake. Don't you know?
You haven't done your reading.

403
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:10,690
- It leveled the whole shebang.
- The shebang?

404
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:12,821
I see.

405
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:22,566
Delicious. Far superior to that
Scottish place where I breakfasted.

406
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:26,371
- Scottish?
- MacDougall's.

407
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:31,144
- What about your friend?
- Friend?

408
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:32,682
Dr. Stevenson.

409
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,478
He wasn't exactly my friend.

410
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,320
We had a falling out.
I won't be seeing him again.

411
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:47,999
I like that suit. Is that what they're
wearing in London?

412
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:50,192
It was when I left.

413
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:55,364
Are you from London? Everyone
I meet from England is from London.

414
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,475
Sorry, what were you saying?

415
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:01,910
I was asking if you're from London.
I have some friends there.

416
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:04,140
I thought you might know them.

417
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:09,288
I realize is a big city.
Anyway, their name is Phillips.

418
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:12,322
He works for Coca-Cola. Any chance?

419
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,460
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Ah, yes.

420
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:17,425
You probably move
in different circles.

421
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:25,036
Are you a scientist or something?

422
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,231
Whatever makes you say that?

423
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:29,937
Just a hunch.

424
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:35,672
You give me the impression of
someone who's cloistered away...

425
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:41,149
...in a library, doing research
and never reads the newspaper.

426
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:45,791
I used to write for a newspaper.
The Pall Mall Gazette.

427
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:50,520
Really? Shows how much I know.
You're a reporter?

428
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:56,526
I wrote articles on whatever struck
my fancy. Social issues, mainly.

429
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:02,708
The last thing I did was a series
on free love.

430
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,305
Free love?

431
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,109
I haven't heard that term
since the eighth grade.

432
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:20,386
Tell me something.

433
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:25,725
Did you think it was forward of me
to invite you to lunch like this?

434
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:31,504
- Do you often...?
- Invite strange men to lunch? No.

435
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:35,664
But is not often that a strange man
turns me on.

436
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:37,969
Or a strange woman.

437
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,614
I didn't mean to imply I was a dyke.

438
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:44,716
- A dyke?
- Sorry, lesbian.

439
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:46,613
I like my sex straight.

440
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,985
Is just that I go for months without
meeting anybody who does it for me.

441
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,252
A lot of people,
like my friend Carol...

442
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:59,091
I won't gossip,
but a lot of people can sleep around.

443
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:04,896
Not me. I really have to like the guy.
Otherwise, is just no go.

444
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:11,167
I'm sorry.

445
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,074
I shouldn't say that
right off the bat.

446
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:18,081
Is not Women's Lib.
I just get nervous.

447
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:21,220
When I get nervous,
I tend to babble.

448
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,150
- Do I make you nervous?
- Yes.

449
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,954
- You do, sort of.
- Why?

450
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,693
Because I like you.

451
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:48,608
You ought to see the Golden Gate.

452
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,174
Whas that?

453
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,614
You're kidding.
How'd you decide to come here?

454
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,789
Stick a pin in a map or something?

455
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:01,051
- The Golden Gate.
- The Golden Gate.

456
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:05,391
- Want to drive across it?
- Oh, is it for motorcars?

457
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:35,751
R stands for "reverse,"
and D stands for "drive."

458
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:41,332
The right pedal causes us to accelerate
while the left retards our speed.

459
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:46,836
Of course. Honestly, Herbert, you act
like you've never been in a car before.

460
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,565
Nonsense, I was in one this morning.

461
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:52,540
You've a very good driver.

462
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:57,806
Damn straight. My husband used
to drive in stock car rallies.

463
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:00,248
He taught me good.

464
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:08,594
- What are you thinking about?
- A brave new world with such people.

465
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:11,787
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

466
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,057
You mentioned your husband.

467
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:20,263
My ex. Yeah, I was married
for a while, when I was very young.

468
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:24,569
We met during an antiwar
demonstration.

469
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:29,545
- The Second World War.
- What? How old do you think I am?

470
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:33,708
Oh, I'm sorry. The Third World War?

471
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,812
The Vietnam War.

472
00:54:38,224 --> 00:54:39,316
Vietnam.

473
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:45,822
Is just that he wanted me to give up
work and have children.

474
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,592
The housewife routine.

475
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:51,729
Not for me.

476
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:55,669
He never took my ambitions seriously.

477
00:55:01,614 --> 00:55:04,640
What about you? You married?

478
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,216
I wouldn't be here if I were.

479
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:11,590
Well, thas nice.

480
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:14,993
A lot of guys...

481
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:17,753
Is no big deal.
I like that.

482
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:21,862
I'm also divorced,
for similar reasons.

483
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:27,438
- She wanted you to be a housewife?
- She wanted me to be routine.

484
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:32,472
Well, that is one thing
you definitely are not.

485
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:36,672
First I thought it was your voice
or your clothes.

486
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:38,145
Now, I don't know.

487
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:42,515
Maybe is that "little boy lost"
quality you give off.

488
00:55:42,722 --> 00:55:47,750
- Brings out my maternal instincts.
- You're very perceptive.

489
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,528
Lost is what I am.

490
00:56:00,507 --> 00:56:02,236
No.

491
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:17,513
Herbert.

492
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:23,856
Is only a movie.

493
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,296
I hate all that violence.

494
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:37,237
Did you ever see Red Shoes?

495
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:41,540
I really got off on that.
Careers.

496
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,517
Is 6:00.
Do you have plans for tonight?

497
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:48,311
I haven't made any.

498
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:52,753
- Are you tired of me yet?
- No, not in the least.

499
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:54,187
Great.

500
00:56:54,394 --> 00:56:59,923
How about I cook you dinner?
I don't live very far from here.

501
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:04,433
- Is not too much trouble?
- I'm half Italian. I love to cook.

502
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:09,165
- What about the other half?
- Norwegian. Norwegians love to eat.

503
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:16,877
What on earth is that?

504
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:21,952
Isn't it incredible? They built it
for the Pan-American Expo of 1914.

505
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:25,955
Somehow, is still standing.
I love living next to it.

506
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:28,684
Come on, I'll give you the cook's tour.

507
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:32,422
I bet you don't have anything
like this in London.

508
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:38,264
- You've never seen the Albert Hall.
- I've never even been to London.

509
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:41,098
- Where do you live?
- This way.

510
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,277
You should see it
when they turn the lights on.

511
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,940
- Is it marble?
- Would you believe plaster?

512
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:05,325
What on earth is Cosmopolitan?

513
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:08,130
Where are all your books?

514
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:10,702
I don't have all that many.

515
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,271
I don't seem to read much anymore.

516
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:17,932
Even when I have the time,
is easier to watch TV...

517
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:20,908
...even though thas mainly crap.

518
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:22,913
Whas that?

519
00:58:23,116 --> 00:58:24,606
The phone.

520
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:28,818
Teïs idea.
Hello? Oh, hi.

521
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:33,857
Is my friend Carol, from the bank,
checking up on you.

522
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,357
Yeah.

523
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,764
No.

524
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:42,494
Who knows?

525
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:50,604
Carol, I'm trying, so will you please
let me get on with it?

526
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,011
I have to go now. Bye.

527
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:57,239
Carol says hi.

528
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,216
She asked if London
is really crawling with Arabs.

529
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:04,151
- Arabs?
- She wants to marry into oil.

530
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:09,987
This is almost ready.
I'm going to change.

531
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,256
I've been in my work clothes all day.

532
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,629
Please, you go right ahead.

533
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:50,100
You look very beautiful.

534
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:26,935
Herbert, if you don't take me
into your arms this minute...

535
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,370
...l'll scream.

536
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,225
Well, hello there.

537
01:00:52,432 --> 01:00:54,195
Hello.

538
01:00:59,272 --> 01:01:03,470
Why, Miss Jones, you're gorgeous.

539
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,650
- What?
- You don't close your eyes.

540
01:01:16,856 --> 01:01:19,484
Well, neither do you.

541
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:31,559
These are the funniest buttons
I ever saw.

542
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,865
Is like it was some kind of costume.

543
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:37,705
Oh, my gosh.

544
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,776
Is the rest of this outfit
as interesting?

545
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,784
Amy. Amy.

546
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,856
I don't want to compromise you.

547
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:59,054
Are you certain I'm not
forcing you...?

548
01:01:59,265 --> 01:02:04,464
Forcing me? My God, Herbert,
I'm practically raping you.

549
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,264
Yeah, thas true.

550
01:02:12,345 --> 01:02:13,676
Here.

551
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:20,678
All naked, all right here.

552
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,846
The hottest, wildest, sexiest ladies
in San Francisco.

553
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:28,083
Come on and check it out.
This is the one.

554
01:02:28,294 --> 01:02:32,526
This is where is happening.
Come on in, buddy.

555
01:02:32,732 --> 01:02:35,724
If you're old enough,
you're bold enough.

556
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:39,794
Come here, come here.
Let me show you.

557
01:02:40,206 --> 01:02:42,902
Third largest in the West.

558
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,217
The weather should be sunny.

559
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:05,158
Is a nippy 51 degrees,
going up to 68...

560
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,356
...then dropping to
an overnight low of 43.

561
01:03:09,435 --> 01:03:11,460
Good morning.

562
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:13,935
Good morning.

563
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:20,344
- You want some coffee?
- Thank you.

564
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:24,448
- Walked into city hall
and shot Mayor Margolin.

565
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,917
In local news, the second body
in 14 hours was found in North Beach.

566
01:03:30,122 --> 01:03:32,522
Identified as prostitute Cindy Chow...

567
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:38,129
...the mutilated corpse was found in an
alley behind the City Lights Bookstore.

568
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:41,164
Police had no comment
on the two murders...

569
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:43,995
...stating only
that they were similar.

570
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:47,604
According to the police chief,
there are no leads.

571
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:49,365
In other news...

572
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,599
No.

573
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,899
Coffee's ready.

574
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:55,842
How do you take it?
Is milk okay instead of cream?

575
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:57,515
I have to talk to you.

576
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:02,279
- I'm running late.
- Amy, I have to talk to you now.

577
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,046
He's alive and out there.
I have no idea what to do.

578
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,160
You say you're after this man.

579
01:04:09,362 --> 01:04:12,593
Are you a detective?
You work for Scotland Yard?

580
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,757
Les just say their interests
are definitely involved.

581
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:20,700
I don't understand. Why can't
you just go to the police...

582
01:04:20,907 --> 01:04:23,899
...tell them who they're looking for?

583
01:04:25,144 --> 01:04:29,171
- Whas wrong with that?
- They'd never believe me.

584
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:32,351
- You don't know that
- They'd never...

585
01:04:32,552 --> 01:04:35,578
If you knew the story,
you'd never believe me.

586
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,882
- I'd believe you.
- Well, they wouldn't.

587
01:04:39,091 --> 01:04:43,357
If I told the truth, they'd send
me to a lunatic asylum, not him.

588
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:48,000
All right. I led you to him, didn't I?

589
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,260
What were you doing,
visiting bank after bank?

590
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,406
Would you have slept with anyone
who knew where he was?

591
01:04:56,342 --> 01:05:00,039
You don't suppose that for one minute.

592
01:05:00,246 --> 01:05:06,151
No. I guess I don't.
I don't know, this is very confusing.

593
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:08,513
I'm late on top of everything else.

594
01:05:08,721 --> 01:05:11,656
- Today is the executive staff meeting.
- Sorry.

595
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:15,315
I didn't want to burden you.
I'll get dressed and go.

596
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:18,497
No, no, no.
Oh, please, you stay.

597
01:05:18,698 --> 01:05:20,563
I don't know what to say.

598
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:25,066
I like you. I like you very much.
I'd like to see you again.

599
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:29,367
I don't know how to help you,
if you can't go to the police.

600
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:34,945
- I don't know where you're staying.
- Yesterday was my first day.

601
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:39,914
Will you stay here for a while? Eat
something and try to sort things out.

602
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:45,250
I'll call you if I get
any bright ideas, okay?

603
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:50,422
Be sure and slam the door
when you leave or it doesn't lock.

604
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:55,226
One thing I wouldn't have
pegged you as, a detective.

605
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,608
Well, you look like the cat
that ate the canary. Did you?

606
01:06:45,818 --> 01:06:50,312
- Hi, Carol, how's everything?
- "Hi, Carol, how's everything?"

607
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:53,492
You're the one who took off
the whole afternoon.

608
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:57,720
In one word, fabulous. He's...

609
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,626
I just can't describe it.

610
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:04,826
On second thought, please don't try.
I may just die of envy.

611
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:09,497
I want you to meet him. Could you come
for dinner Friday, around 7?

612
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:12,769
I'm sure it will be fine with Herbert.

613
01:07:14,513 --> 01:07:16,413
Herbert?

614
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:21,144
You must really be hooked.

615
01:07:21,353 --> 01:07:26,450
I think so. I'll just check my busy
social calendar. Talk to you later.

616
01:07:30,596 --> 01:07:31,654
Hello again.

617
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:41,567
I've come to change some
more currency.

618
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,746
Yes, of course.

619
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:56,078
How much did you want
to exchange this time?

620
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:59,086
Oh, say 40 guineas.

621
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:01,693
Forty guineas.

622
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:13,162
I'm sorry, would you excuse me
for a moment? I'll be right back.

623
01:08:13,372 --> 01:08:15,397
Take your time.

624
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:30,047
Herbert, Herbert.
Come on, come on.

625
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,426
Herbert, is me.

626
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:38,627
- Listen, he's here.
- Amy?

627
01:08:39,265 --> 01:08:43,634
- Who is?
- Who do you mean who? Who do you think?

628
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:44,860
What?

629
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:48,971
He's right at my desk
with a money belt.

630
01:08:49,175 --> 01:08:52,110
He wants to change more sovereigns.

631
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:57,408
- Herbert, what do I do? I'm terrified.
- Amy, be calm. Is all right.

632
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,585
You're in a bank.
He's mad but he's not stupid.

633
01:09:00,786 --> 01:09:04,085
Now, nothing's going to happen to you.

634
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:06,588
- Can you keep him there?
- What?

635
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:11,058
Is a lot to ask, but try.
Just until I'm there. I'm on my way.

636
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:13,927
- I'll try.
- What did you say?

637
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:18,334
I said I'll try.

638
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,906
Sorry about that. I checked
what the exchange rates are today.

639
01:09:29,114 --> 01:09:32,948
They fluctuate every day.
I wouldn't want you to get gypped.

640
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:35,985
- Are you enjoying San Francisco?
- Very much.

641
01:09:36,188 --> 01:09:37,485
Thas wonderful.

642
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:42,693
- Find room at the Hyatt Regency?
- Yes, thanks to you I've...

643
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,769
Thanks to you.

644
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:05,907
You wouldn't happen to know
a man called Wells, would you?

645
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,050
I thought so.

646
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,986
Miss Amy Robbins.

647
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:18,160
He asked you to detain me
until he got here, right?

648
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:21,797
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh.

649
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:31,008
I won't conduct my business here
anymore, if is all the same to you.

650
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:34,809
Good day.

651
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:42,716
There's just one other item.

652
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:46,449
Be good enough to leave a message
for Wells from me.

653
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,957
Tell him I want that key.

654
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:52,858
Tell him to leave it for me at the
exhibit. Leave it...

655
01:10:53,065 --> 01:10:55,397
...or face the consequences.

656
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:59,059
Have you got that?

657
01:10:59,271 --> 01:11:01,239
Yes, I believe you have.

658
01:11:02,975 --> 01:11:07,605
Herbert! You gotta bring the police
into this. Now if you don't, I will.

659
01:11:07,813 --> 01:11:11,249
That man is crazy,
I could see it in his face.

660
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,974
And he threatened you.

661
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:16,382
Something about leaving
the key to the exhibit.

662
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:22,458
Les tell the police. If you don't,
I will, but I don't know what to say.

663
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:25,528
You can't fool around
with a person like that.

664
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:36,867
"Robbins. 2340 Francisco."

665
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:40,910
His name is John Leslie Stevenson.
English, he's a surgeon.

666
01:11:41,113 --> 01:11:46,050
Approximately 37 years of age,
flaxen-hair, clean-shaven...

667
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:49,812
...and stands well above
6 feet in height.

668
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:54,455
What makes you say that this,
Dr. Stevenson...

669
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,390
...is responsible for the death
of the girls?

670
01:11:57,596 --> 01:11:59,757
I just know for a fact he is.

671
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:03,560
- I see. Do you have spiritual powers?
- Do I what?

672
01:12:03,769 --> 01:12:06,329
Are you a medium or a mystic?

673
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:10,070
I make no claim to supernatural
gifts of any sort.

674
01:12:10,275 --> 01:12:14,075
If I could reveal the source
of my information, I...

675
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:19,010
As a matter of fact,
I'm also a detective.

676
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:24,312
I was sent from London on the trail
of Stevenson, traveling incognito.

677
01:12:24,523 --> 01:12:26,252
My name...

678
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,998
- My name is Sherlock Holmes
- Sherlock Holmes, I see.

679
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:38,097
Go on, go on.

680
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:43,168
I can't. I gave you a complete
description, I told you his name.

681
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,707
I've told you everything I know.

682
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:49,403
It was good of you to share
your insights, Mr. Holmes.

683
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:52,345
How can we reach you if we need
to speak to you?

684
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:55,884
Is that necessary?
I'm staying with a friend.

685
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:57,646
Must we involve her?

686
01:12:57,856 --> 01:13:02,850
Not unless is unavoidable we contact
you. We're known for our discretion.

687
01:13:03,062 --> 01:13:04,086
Very well.

688
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:09,893
Her name is Miss Amy Robbins.
She lives at 2340 Francisco.

689
01:13:11,403 --> 01:13:13,963
Thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes.

690
01:13:19,111 --> 01:13:20,476
You don't believe me, do you?

691
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:24,046
I'd like to. My job would
be simpler if I could.

692
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:27,776
This printout says U.S. Customs
has no record...

693
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:32,889
...of John Leslie Stevenson coming
here. British Customs has no record...

694
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:37,756
...of a man by that name leaving.
There's no mention of a Mr. Holmes...

695
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:42,627
...coming into the country. Now he
could be using another name...

696
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:47,636
...but since we don't know where he
is, we can't question him.

697
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,741
- Can we?
- No.

698
01:13:50,943 --> 01:13:54,879
Well, thank you for your time.
Good day.

699
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,541
Put this on file.

700
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:03,778
The entire affair was a fiasco.

701
01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:08,426
- He didn't believe a word of it.
- Well, you tried.

702
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:10,925
Trying isn't enough, I'm afraid.

703
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:33,214
- Are we in or out here?
- Out.

704
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:37,548
- Would you care to join me for a walk?
- Sure.

705
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:43,192
You have to slam it. All right.

706
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:47,889
Old buildings have their
little quirks.

707
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:52,633
Why is it your responsibility?

708
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,043
I'm going to tell you the truth.

709
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:02,509
In the first place,
my name isn't Herbert Wells.

710
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:04,443
Is Herbert George Wells.

711
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:08,547
H.G. Wells.

712
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:15,283
In the second place,
I'm 113 years old.

713
01:15:30,676 --> 01:15:33,770
I swear to God, I am telling
you the truth.

714
01:15:34,713 --> 01:15:38,479
Please, please believe me.

715
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:45,621
- Where are you going?
- Home.

716
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:47,957
You don't believe me?

717
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,687
Christ, Herbert, what do you think?

718
01:15:51,897 --> 01:15:56,766
Please go away, I don't want
to see you anymore.

719
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,369
Amy!
Please, Amy, listen to me!

720
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:04,701
I have listened to you. And a bigger
crock of shit I never heard.

721
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:08,846
Look, I don't know if you're crazy,
but I don't care.

722
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:12,415
Just go back to whatever hole
you crawled out of.

723
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:15,246
Go back to your machine.

724
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:17,913
Amy...

725
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:21,490
Wait! Amy!

726
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:25,896
Amy, what if I can prove
what I told you is true?

727
01:16:26,098 --> 01:16:29,795
Won't you give me that chance?
I know I sound mad!

728
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:36,134
I knew how you'd respond. Didn't I say
yesterday you wouldn't believe me?

729
01:16:38,277 --> 01:16:40,302
And I said I would.

730
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:48,445
All right. There is an H.G. Wells
exhibit with time machine.

731
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:59,258
There is some resemblance between
you and the man in those pictures.

732
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:01,091
The muzeum is closing.

733
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:05,259
But that doesn't prove anything.

734
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:09,172
- Now what?
- I want you to go to the powder room.

735
01:17:15,314 --> 01:17:17,248
Hang on.

736
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:27,015
- Hello.
- Hi! Holy shit! Flowers.

737
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:31,559
Wow. Let me go put these
in water. Come on in.

738
01:17:31,763 --> 01:17:33,890
- You're early.
- I couldn't wait.

739
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:39,935
You're cute. Last time I had flowers
was my graduation in high school.

740
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,936
You bring flowers to all your women?

741
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,867
Why don't you sit down
and I'll be right in, okay?

742
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,817
You want some grass?

743
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:56,148
Grass?

744
01:17:56,355 --> 01:17:59,882
Marijuana. Don't they call it grass
where you're from?

745
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,687
England, right? I could tell
from your accent.

746
01:18:03,895 --> 01:18:07,331
You're observant.
Are you a typical American woman?

747
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:10,501
Am I a typical American woman?

748
01:18:10,902 --> 01:18:12,494
Me?

749
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,835
Yeah, more or less. You know.

750
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,540
I like to hang out.

751
01:18:20,545 --> 01:18:23,036
And what about you?

752
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:26,445
- Are you a typical Englishman?
- Not really.

753
01:18:27,018 --> 01:18:29,248
Neat watch.

754
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:32,051
Are we going somewhere?

755
01:18:34,226 --> 01:18:35,921
No.

756
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:38,389
Well, what time is it?

757
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:47,197
Later than you think.

758
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:17,699
This is really dumb.

759
01:19:55,769 --> 01:19:58,203
Whas this gizmo?

760
01:19:59,306 --> 01:20:04,539
Well, les just say we wouldn't
want to go anywhere without it.

761
01:20:07,081 --> 01:20:10,915
Right. This time I'll drive.

762
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:19,122
Come on. Get in.

763
01:20:28,202 --> 01:20:33,504
You know what you're doing? What am I
saying? This is completely bananas.

764
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:38,735
I don't propose to take you a great
distance. Suppose we go to Saturday.

765
01:20:38,946 --> 01:20:43,178
- How would that be?
- Just fine. My cleaning's due back.

766
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:46,251
That would make it November the 10th.

767
01:20:47,755 --> 01:20:53,557
Don't expect too much. The entire
voyage will last a quarter of a second.

768
01:20:54,628 --> 01:20:56,994
- You ready?
- Come on.

769
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:07,601
Good. Can we go now, please?

770
01:21:07,808 --> 01:21:13,610
- You still maintain this is poppycock?
- That wasn't the word I had in mind.

771
01:22:11,605 --> 01:22:14,768
Amy, you just wait. You wait.

772
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,264
We've got to go back.

773
01:22:47,574 --> 01:22:49,565
We must go back.

774
01:23:01,722 --> 01:23:04,714
We could easily avoid
this whole thing.

775
01:23:04,925 --> 01:23:07,052
- You mean give him the key.
- No.

776
01:23:07,261 --> 01:23:09,661
I mean come back with me.

777
01:23:09,863 --> 01:23:14,493
- Back?
- Yes. Back to 1893.

778
01:23:20,307 --> 01:23:26,177
I'm a 20th century woman. I have
a career and a mind of my own.

779
01:23:26,547 --> 01:23:30,540
Be reasonable. How am I gonna
make it in 1893?

780
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:33,379
Is your life we're talking about.

781
01:23:33,587 --> 01:23:36,954
My work is my life.

782
01:23:38,258 --> 01:23:41,750
As much as yours or any other man's.

783
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:45,830
Please don't start sounding
like my husband.

784
01:23:46,967 --> 01:23:52,599
- Wait a minute? What about forward?
- Forward?

785
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:59,105
You mean into the future. Yes!
Of course...

786
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:02,375
No.

787
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:07,577
No. We're forgetting something. Him!
I can't just leave him here.

788
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:10,951
So much for your place or mine.

789
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:13,015
Stop a bit.

790
01:24:13,227 --> 01:24:16,162
You know we're making a big mistake.

791
01:24:16,897 --> 01:24:19,991
We keep imagining time is our enemy.
Is not.

792
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,432
We know whas supposed to happen.
When and where. He doesn't.

793
01:24:27,574 --> 01:24:30,702
This is one time I do know
how he thinks.

794
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:34,312
I even know before he thinks.

795
01:24:34,514 --> 01:24:40,043
Look here. We're too late to prevent
the murder of number three.

796
01:24:40,254 --> 01:24:42,779
But what about number four?
Les see.

797
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:48,485
Dolores Marks. She was killed
in McLaren Park. Is that far?

798
01:24:48,695 --> 01:24:51,163
Nothing's far in San Francisco.

799
01:24:51,365 --> 01:24:54,857
She was killed. Or rather she will
be killed...

800
01:24:55,068 --> 01:24:58,094
...at 3:00 in the morning
in McLaren Park.

801
01:24:58,305 --> 01:25:00,830
All I have to do is surprise him.

802
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:04,977
I'll just sit tight here for a few
hours and then be off.

803
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,306
We. I'm coming too.

804
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:12,383
No. I absolutely forbid it.

805
01:25:12,586 --> 01:25:17,546
Herbert, you can't drive.
You don't even know where the park is.

806
01:25:17,758 --> 01:25:22,388
I'm safe. I've got till Friday
at 7:30. Haven't you read the paper?

807
01:26:20,487 --> 01:26:23,888
Too bad there aren't any
sport stores open.

808
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:25,581
Whatever for?

809
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,057
So we could buy a gun.

810
01:26:29,262 --> 01:26:34,700
- He's dangerous, haven't you heard?
- I wouldn't purchase a weapon now.

811
01:26:34,901 --> 01:26:38,962
What is this Victorian chivalry?
We're playing for keeps.

812
01:26:39,172 --> 01:26:43,108
Exactly. And Stevenson was right
about one thing.

813
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:46,746
Violence is contagious. Like measles.

814
01:26:47,581 --> 01:26:53,144
The problem is not that things aren't
more efficient. They're the same.

815
01:26:53,353 --> 01:26:57,084
World war this. World war that.

816
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:01,920
We're obviously killing more
efficiently. But we're still killing.

817
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:09,567
Well, I'm not going to stoop
to that man's barbaric level.

818
01:27:11,071 --> 01:27:15,474
The first man to raise a fist
is the man who has run out of ideas.

819
01:27:16,009 --> 01:27:17,101
I love you.

820
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:47,734
Oh, no.

821
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:57,817
Whas happening?

822
01:27:58,685 --> 01:28:02,781
Goddamn it! The tire is flat.

823
01:28:02,989 --> 01:28:07,585
- Can you mend it? Can it be repaired?
- Yes. Is gonna take time.

824
01:28:07,794 --> 01:28:09,591
All right, Amy. Calm down.

825
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:14,096
You work as fast as you can
and I'll go telephone the police.

826
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:16,861
Where would I be likely to find one?

827
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:22,167
I don't know. There are phone booths
all around. Do you have a dime?

828
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:26,539
Herbert, do you have ten cents
for the call? Hurry!

829
01:28:26,746 --> 01:28:30,443
- Here. Is 911.
- 911.

830
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:34,108
- Read the instructions.
- I'll be right back.

831
01:29:08,321 --> 01:29:11,051
Out of order? Damn!

832
01:29:16,096 --> 01:29:18,155
911.

833
01:29:29,676 --> 01:29:33,942
Did you get that? McLaren Park.
Get there as soon as possible.

834
01:29:34,147 --> 01:29:38,982
Can I what? Wells. No, Holmes.

835
01:29:39,185 --> 01:29:44,088
Sherlock Holmes.
McLaren Park, as soon as possible.

836
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,426
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

837
01:30:10,684 --> 01:30:14,484
Oh, no. No.

838
01:30:17,324 --> 01:30:20,452
IKeep moving.
Don't stop, do you hear me?

839
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:25,355
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Amy. Go! Come on!

840
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:46,945
I don't wanna die.

841
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,724
I don't wanna die.

842
01:31:05,305 --> 01:31:08,206
First the zodiac and now this.

843
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:12,872
- Yeah, they're out for blood, I see.
- I see Mr. Holmes called.

844
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:18,142
- What time would that be?
- That was at 2:45 a.m.

845
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:21,812
Maybe he is psychic.

846
01:31:25,692 --> 01:31:27,091
No.

847
01:31:27,293 --> 01:31:31,127
We won't be here.
Is simple, we just won't be here.

848
01:31:31,331 --> 01:31:35,392
- Is 10:30. I'm going to go out.
- No!

849
01:31:35,602 --> 01:31:41,165
Just for a little bit. I'll come back,
and we'll be off well before 7:30.

850
01:31:41,374 --> 01:31:43,365
Where are you going?

851
01:31:43,576 --> 01:31:48,673
Is something I've got to do.
And you do trust me, don't you?

852
01:31:48,882 --> 01:31:54,548
I tell you what. Whas the best
hotel in the city, your favorite?

853
01:31:54,754 --> 01:31:58,053
The Huntington. I used to work there.

854
01:31:58,258 --> 01:32:01,659
The Huntington. Write down
the telephone number.

855
01:32:01,861 --> 01:32:07,857
If I'm not back in an hour, register
at the hotel. You've got the car.

856
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:13,231
- Promise you'll be back. Promise me.
- I promise. I promise.

857
01:32:15,275 --> 01:32:18,005
Now you try and get some rest.

858
01:32:18,211 --> 01:32:21,510
There's brandy in the flask
if you need it.

859
01:32:22,082 --> 01:32:25,381
Thas all right, I have some Valium.

860
01:32:25,585 --> 01:32:30,921
- Sedatives.
- All right. Try and get some rest.

861
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:23,841
Hold it right there.

862
01:33:24,744 --> 01:33:28,771
- What is the meaning of this?
- Shut up.

863
01:33:29,048 --> 01:33:30,948
Amy!

864
01:33:32,418 --> 01:33:34,477
- Look here.
- Listen, constable...

865
01:33:34,821 --> 01:33:40,691
- Amy! Amy, get out of the house!
- Come on!

866
01:33:53,973 --> 01:33:56,771
- Just get Lieutenant Mitchell...
- Look ahead.

867
01:33:56,976 --> 01:34:01,003
- You're gonna have another murder.
- State your name, please.

868
01:34:01,214 --> 01:34:04,581
I told you. Herbert George Wells.
What is this?

869
01:34:04,784 --> 01:34:08,379
- Your valuables.
- Preposterous. Now please hurry.

870
01:34:08,588 --> 01:34:12,024
- There is a lady in grave danger.
- Your watch, please.

871
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:17,094
My watch? This is ridiculous.
Please, where is Lieutenant Mitchell?

872
01:34:17,297 --> 01:34:19,595
- You don't need that.
- Yes, we do.

873
01:34:19,799 --> 01:34:24,395
Miss Amy Robbins is in very great...
Why do you need my glasses?

874
01:34:24,604 --> 01:34:28,062
- I demand to see Lieutenant Mitchell!
- Relax.

875
01:34:29,776 --> 01:34:36,045
I'm sorry, we have no one by the name
Amy Robbins registered at the hotel.

876
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:38,915
You've absolutely no right...

877
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:42,087
- Let me see Lieutenant Mitchell.
- No.

878
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:45,985
Now! Soon! Hurry! Please! Help!

879
01:34:47,427 --> 01:34:52,023
I've told you. I've told you 50 times.
My name is H.G. Wells.

880
01:34:52,232 --> 01:34:56,931
I came here in a time machine.
I'm pursuing Jack the Ripper...

881
01:34:57,136 --> 01:34:59,570
...who escaped into the future.

882
01:34:59,772 --> 01:35:03,799
If you don't do something,
he'll kill Miss Robbins by 7:30.

883
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:08,840
What about the gun? They weren't
making that model back in 1893.

884
01:35:09,048 --> 01:35:15,385
I purchased it to defend Miss Robbins
should the worst come to the worst.

885
01:35:15,655 --> 01:35:19,716
- Where did you purchase it?
- A pawn shop. I don't remember it.

886
01:35:19,926 --> 01:35:22,895
You're wasting your time.
Please listen to me.

887
01:35:23,096 --> 01:35:28,898
Forget about the shop and the time
machine. Forget that I'm H.G. Wells.

888
01:35:29,102 --> 01:35:33,300
Please just save the girl.

889
01:35:33,506 --> 01:35:39,502
You'll have to do better than that.
Last time you were Sherlock Holmes.

890
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:46,611
- All right, les take it from the top.
- My name is H.G. Wells.

891
01:35:46,819 --> 01:35:50,755
I came here in a time machine.
The one at the muzeum.

892
01:35:50,957 --> 01:35:55,291
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want the truth!

893
01:35:55,495 --> 01:35:58,020
We're gonna stay here until I get it.

894
01:36:08,808 --> 01:36:10,639
Take a look at this.

895
01:36:12,946 --> 01:36:16,040
Thas right. Thas it.
Take a look.

896
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:20,583
Look, you cretinous idiot.
This is tomorrow's bloody paper.

897
01:36:20,787 --> 01:36:24,518
You see what will happen
if you don't listen to me!

898
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:28,890
Mr. Wells, or whatever
your real name is...

899
01:36:29,095 --> 01:36:33,725
...you know that novelty shops will
run a phony newspaper edition.

900
01:36:33,933 --> 01:36:40,065
You may have been born yesterday, but
I wasn't. Where did you get the gun?

901
01:36:56,622 --> 01:36:58,419
Herbert.

902
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:06,089
Herbert?

903
01:37:06,299 --> 01:37:08,733
You want to break for dinner? Hey!

904
01:37:09,836 --> 01:37:11,428
I'll strike a bargain.

905
01:37:26,953 --> 01:37:30,116
I'll confess to anything you like!

906
01:37:59,052 --> 01:38:01,179
I killed them all.

907
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:23,475
Now, please...

908
01:38:23,676 --> 01:38:28,477
Please send a car to 2340 Francisco.

909
01:38:29,749 --> 01:38:33,412
Send a car and I'll sign
whatever you want.

910
01:39:14,594 --> 01:39:16,459
You're free to go.

911
01:39:19,232 --> 01:39:20,722
I'm sorry.

912
01:39:23,169 --> 01:39:27,105
Please believe me. I'm truly sorry.

913
01:40:25,364 --> 01:40:27,229
Herbert.

914
01:40:31,837 --> 01:40:35,068
Herbert, I'm over here.

915
01:40:35,274 --> 01:40:41,179
He murdered Carol, my friend. I forgot
I invited her over to meet you.

916
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,747
- Amy?
- He's got the car.

917
01:40:44,951 --> 01:40:46,441
Amy?

918
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:54,453
- The newspaper was wrong.
- Amy.

919
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,753
Not so fast.

920
01:40:57,129 --> 01:41:00,030
We have a little unfinished business.

921
01:41:00,366 --> 01:41:04,928
- What more do you want?
- You know what I want. Give me the key.

922
01:41:05,137 --> 01:41:07,662
And you get the white queen.

923
01:41:09,075 --> 01:41:10,940
All right.

924
01:41:13,946 --> 01:41:17,814
- Let her go and I'll throw it to you.
- No.

925
01:41:18,017 --> 01:41:23,182
My mother was atrocious, but she
didn't raise mentally deficient sons.

926
01:41:23,389 --> 01:41:27,155
You throw me the key
and I'll release the girl.

927
01:41:27,526 --> 01:41:30,893
- On your honor.
- You have my word as a gentleman.

928
01:41:53,519 --> 01:41:55,851
Now there's just one thing.

929
01:41:56,122 --> 01:42:00,752
I woulïve expected that you'd noticed
I am not a gentleman.

930
01:42:05,298 --> 01:42:08,392
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Herbert.

931
01:42:19,779 --> 01:42:21,406
You know where we're going.

932
01:43:50,669 --> 01:43:55,038
You haven't instructed him in the use
of one of these machines?

933
01:43:55,775 --> 01:43:58,403
Go faster. Please.

934
01:44:19,799 --> 01:44:20,993
Go faster.

935
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:25,569
If I go any faster I'm gonna wrap
us around a phone pole.

936
01:44:52,164 --> 01:44:55,531
- Herbert!
- Stevenson!

937
01:45:05,778 --> 01:45:07,712
Stevenson!

938
01:45:10,816 --> 01:45:14,343
What is it, H. G? You're becoming
extremely tiresome.

939
01:45:15,521 --> 01:45:19,685
- The girl.
- Which girl? You mean this one?

940
01:45:20,226 --> 01:45:25,357
Let her go. Please, I beg you.
You can afford to be magnanimous.

941
01:45:25,564 --> 01:45:29,500
Women throughout the centuries
are yours for the taking.

942
01:45:29,702 --> 01:45:31,727
Is it so important?

943
01:45:33,339 --> 01:45:37,776
I don't find her attractive. Do you?
You're not about to disagree?

944
01:45:38,577 --> 01:45:39,635
No.

945
01:45:39,845 --> 01:45:44,248
- No, what?
- No, I don't find her attractive.

946
01:45:45,317 --> 01:45:51,517
- Shall I cut her throat then?
- No. Please.

947
01:45:52,625 --> 01:45:57,585
John. You and I, we were friends once.
I admired you.

948
01:45:57,796 --> 01:46:03,257
What are you babbling about, Wells?
You've become quite an old fool.

949
01:46:03,469 --> 01:46:09,339
Yes. I am an old fool.
I know nothing.

950
01:46:10,776 --> 01:46:13,870
And she means that much to you?

951
01:46:17,516 --> 01:46:19,416
Yes.

952
01:46:20,019 --> 01:46:22,112
Please.

953
01:46:29,328 --> 01:46:31,193
I'm sorry.

954
01:46:32,231 --> 01:46:35,530
H.G., is checkmate
and you've lost again.

955
01:46:39,438 --> 01:46:41,201
Herbert!

956
01:47:12,771 --> 01:47:15,103
What did you do?

957
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:18,999
I sent him to where he belongs.

958
01:47:19,211 --> 01:47:21,304
Infinity.

959
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:27,045
Thas the last anyone will hear
of Jack the Ripper.

960
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:42,157
Is time for us to say goodbye
before the police arrive.

961
01:47:43,769 --> 01:47:45,361
You going back?

962
01:47:47,306 --> 01:47:51,174
- Why?
- I've got to dismantle that machine.

963
01:47:51,377 --> 01:47:55,507
Until we master ourselves we have
no proper use for time.

964
01:47:55,714 --> 01:47:59,013
I've got those books to write.
Whatever they are.

965
01:47:59,218 --> 01:48:01,277
Fiction, I hope.

966
01:48:01,553 --> 01:48:03,953
Every age is the same.

967
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:08,686
Is only love that makes
any of them bearable.

968
01:48:17,836 --> 01:48:24,002
And finally, I must go back because
that is where I belong.

969
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:29,376
And my life is almost as important
to me as yours.

970
01:48:29,715 --> 01:48:32,479
Not quite.

971
01:48:32,685 --> 01:48:34,710
Almost.

972
01:48:51,203 --> 01:48:57,164
Herbert! You wait for me!
You wait for me!

973
01:48:57,376 --> 01:48:59,674
Herbert!

974
01:48:59,878 --> 01:49:05,373
It isn't life without you.
Please, look at me.

975
01:49:16,261 --> 01:49:22,131
Don't expect miracles. I'm changing
my name to Susan B. Anthony.

976
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:26,561
Les go.
