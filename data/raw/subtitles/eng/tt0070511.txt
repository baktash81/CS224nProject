1
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,766
All present and accounted for, sir.

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,329
Thank you, Captain.

3
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,430
As of this moment...

4
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:38,734
...you are the property of
the Penal Administration of French Guiana.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,088
After serving your full terms in prison...

6
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,282
...those of you with sentences...

7
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,967
...of eight years or more...

8
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,566
...will remain in Guiana...

9
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,031
...as workers and colonists...

10
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:58,222
...for a period equal
to that of your original sentences.

11
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:00,879
As for France...

12
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:03,344
...the nation has disposed of you.

13
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,726
France has rid herself of you altogether.

14
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:12,407
Forget France and put your clothes on.

15
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,107
Papillon! Papi!

16
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:09,146
You'll be back, Papillon.

17
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:11,063
Don't worry, you'll be back.

18
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:18,669
No, you won't.

19
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,307
You, that way.

20
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,772
Down there. You, too.

21
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,371
Next, over here. Come along.

22
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,758
Come on. Come in here.

23
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:41,562
You, too.

24
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:42,837
Over there.

25
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,357
Come along, up there. Hurry up.

26
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:51,546
You, too. Down.

27
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,368
Down. In there.

28
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:54,864
In there.

29
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,684
Come along, now. Down.

30
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,312
Come on down. Down there.

31
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,678
Come on, up there.

32
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,653
In there.

33
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:52,571
We're really something, aren't we?

34
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,187
The only animals in the world
that shove things up their ass for survival.

35
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,901
The first time I shoved one up my gut...

36
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,104
...it infected me so bad
the camp doctor had to cut it out.

37
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,570
He doesn't have any ether...

38
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,005
...so he knocks me out with rum.

39
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,461
Then you know what he did?

40
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:10,640
He stole it.

41
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,963
A butterfly.

42
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,361
You're Papillon, aren't you?

43
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:19,799
Yeah.

44
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,910
The bastards gave you life.

45
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,813
Right to the end of the line, they think.

46
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,989
It may not be as long as you think.

47
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:29,841
Forty percent of us will die...

48
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,510
...the first year out.

49
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,437
They gave him life, too.

50
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,451
The kid's only 18.

51
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,973
Look at him. No wonder he dreams.

52
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:45,023
He'll never make it.

53
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,749
But a man like you could make it...

54
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,695
...if you have enough money.

55
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,652
How long were you there?

56
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,337
Nine years of work camp...

57
00:06:58,594 --> 00:06:59,936
...nine years a colonist.

58
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,679
You were outside the walls.
Why didn't you run?

59
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,953
There's no place to run to.

60
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:08,156
You're out in the middle of a swamp,
1,000 miles from no place.

61
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,975
Now, if you've got a lot of money
that's a different thing.

62
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:14,198
I mean, you take somebody
like Dega there. Back there.

63
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,099
Louis Dega.
The best counterfeiter in France.

64
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,363
National Defense Bonds.

65
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,510
-Series of 1928.
-Right.

66
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:28,737
Now, if you've got money like he has,
there's a chance to buy your way out.

67
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,109
That is unless somebody cuts
his guts open first to get at all that cash.

68
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,858
Everybody up! Let's go!

69
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,067
Everybody up!

70
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,378
Come on, everybody up! Let's go!

71
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,395
Let's go!

72
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,414
Mind if I sit down here?

73
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:15,579
If you wish.

74
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:21,918
You're Dega, aren't ya? Louis Dega?

75
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:27,845
Sorry to see you here.

76
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,272
I presume most of us have earned
our passage.

77
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:36,055
You're Papillon. You got life for killing
a pimp. Then you had the bad taste...

78
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:38,999
...to tell the prosecutor you were going
to escape and kill him, too.

79
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,706
I was framed. I'm innocent.

80
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,337
No one is innocent.

81
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,293
I'm no pimp killer, for Christ's sake.

82
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,693
I'm a safecracker.

83
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:49,271
And that's a profession of which
I thoroughly disapprove.

84
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,212
I put almost everything I had
into National Defense Bonds.

85
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,445
Series of 1928.

86
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:58,334
1928?

87
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,880
Your instincts were sound.
How much did you lose?

88
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,141
I wouldn't put my money on those bonds.
Not any more than you would.

89
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,848
I'm relieved to hear that.

90
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:10,150
If that's true,
why are we having this little chat?

91
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,300
Every convict on this ship knows
who you are.

92
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,779
Any of them would slit you open to
reach inside and get what you're carrying.

93
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,659
So?

94
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,124
You need protection.

95
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,234
From you?

96
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,832
Remember what the chicken said
to the weasel?

97
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,723
If he was a healthy weasel, the chicken
didn't get a chance to say anything.

98
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,584
Think about that.

99
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:02,141
Hose down!

100
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,385
Come on, off your asses! Hose down!

101
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,538
Come on, you've got a fever.

102
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,823
Do what I tell ya.

103
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,317
Come on.

104
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:17,563
Julot!

105
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:21,889
I've got a question.

106
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,243
If I wanted to get a boat when I got there,
a small boat, maybe a 15-footer...

107
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,259
...how much would it cost?

108
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:30,636
I don't know. Fr 3,500, Fr 4,500, maybe.
It all depends.

109
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:32,927
What if I could pick up the money
to buy one?

110
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,760
Then I guess you'd have yourself a boat.

111
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,857
You know the country.
You and I could make it out of there. Huh?

112
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:41,377
The answer is no. Nothing against you,
but the answer is no.

113
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:45,088
If I've gotta go to solitary for
some half-assed escape that didn't work...

114
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,388
...I want the mistake to be mine,
not anybody else's. You understand?

115
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,979
So the answer is no.

116
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:51,908
How'd it feel, kid?

117
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:53,087
Good.

118
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,710
All right. Come on, move it!

119
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,430
Move it a little. Let's go!

120
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,599
Let's move!

121
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:48,742
What do you want?

122
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,439
Almost unbearable, isn't it?

123
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,058
What?

124
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:54,621
The heat.

125
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:56,232
It's not too bad.

126
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,081
Of course, you're closer to it than I am.

127
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,013
Oh, yes. You're referring to last night,
aren't you?

128
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,574
Well, aren't you?

129
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,492
May I tell you something?

130
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,886
At first glance I'm afraid
that I regarded you with rather...

131
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:14,052
...a large degree of unworthy suspicion.

132
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,653
Am I clear?

133
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:16,775
No.

134
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:21,284
Well, it now seems quite possible
that until we get to a decent jail...

135
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,129
...with bribeable guards,
I may stand in some need of...

136
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,773
...rather close physical protection.

137
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,216
It depends on how long you want to live.

138
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:33,523
Oh, a long time.

139
00:13:35,823 --> 00:13:37,406
Then you got a problem.

140
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,307
Well, I presume that you have some...

141
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:43,054
...goals, some particular need that...

142
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,991
...outweighs all others.

143
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,837
I mean, if so, may I ask what it is?

144
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,143
Money.

145
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,422
For what?

146
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:52,691
Escape.

147
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,571
Very good.

148
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,109
You keep me alive...

149
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:01,603
...until we land in Guiana and I will
underwrite any escape you care to arrange.

150
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:04,761
Escape for me. Not for us.

151
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,602
Of course.

152
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,535
I have no intention of even attempting
an escape. Ever.

153
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:15,675
Done.

154
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,396
Thank you.

155
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:28,197
Leave him alone...

156
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,914
...or I'll cut your head off!

157
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:33,349
Hide this!

158
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,276
Over there is Saint Joseph.

159
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:04,205
The other island is Royale.

160
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,179
The one on the right is Devil's.

161
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:09,901
Julot, why is it so hard
to escape from there?

162
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,059
A man could almost swim to the mainland.

163
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,377
No, there must be a better way
than swimming.

164
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:17,028
No, no, swimming's not the way.

165
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,663
The current is so strong it'll push you
right back where you started from.

166
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:24,289
You know, when you're on those islands
you're there for keeps.

167
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:29,766
Where do we go?

168
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,620
We go up the Moroni River.

169
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:35,881
Then we dock at Saint Laurent.

170
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,068
That's where they decide whether
to send you to the work camps or...

171
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,203
...to the islands.

172
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:19,713
You see those two on the dock
with the guns?

173
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,182
Right over there.

174
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:26,239
They served their time.
Now they're colonists.

175
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,787
They've turned man hunter.

176
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:29,902
Man hunter?

177
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:32,260
Yeah, you escape, they hunt.

178
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,558
For money, I presume, a reward.

179
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:36,047
Jesus!

180
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,383
Get ready to move!

181
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,071
Line up to disembark.

182
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:02,982
I'm going to have an accident going down
that gangplank and it's gotta look good...

183
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,317
...so lend me your shiv.

184
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,758
What the hell for?

185
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,304
Because I'm a two-time loser.

186
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:10,500
No matter what happens, I'll be sent
to the islands on the next transport.

187
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,494
I have to get in the hospital
to give me time to think.

188
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,059
Now give me that shiv!

189
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,814
You're crazy, Julot.

190
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:49,275
Single file down the gangplank. March.

191
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,551
Hold it! Hold it!

192
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,418
Let's go!

193
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:28,718
Single file!

194
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,177
Move! Let's go!

195
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,982
Bring a stretcher.

196
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:42,084
Single file, single file.

197
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,848
Take him away!

198
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,166
-All right, move! Move!
-Let's go!

199
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:50,996
Move it!

200
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:13,064
Come on, move 'em!

201
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,011
Let's go! Come on!

202
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,483
Column, march!

203
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:28,640
Keep moving.

204
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,099
You two, pick him up, quickly!

205
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:15,194
Attention!

206
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,470
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

207
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,673
...of French Guiana...

208
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:30,021
...whose prisoners you are...

209
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,826
...and from which there is no escape.

210
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,631
First attempts at escape...

211
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:39,094
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

212
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,243
Second attempts, add five more.

213
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,277
Of course, more serious offenses...

214
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,065
...are dealt with in this fashion.

215
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:02,155
Make the best of what we offer you
and you will suffer less than you deserve.

216
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,274
Dismissed.

217
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,618
In the bunkhouse.

218
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:13,261
One, two, three, four.

219
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,961
Go on! Go on! Get a move on!

220
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,243
Mr. Dega?

221
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,868
Yes, indeed.
I know all about you, Mr. Dega.

222
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:29,586
Very intelligent man.

223
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:32,391
Thank you. I seem to be known
in all the wrong places.

224
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,216
Well, I have a friend who is a guard.
For very--

225
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:38,688
Yes, go ahead.

226
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:43,020
For very little money he can arrange
for certain people to stay here...

227
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:46,788
...instead of being sent to a work camp
or one of the islands.

228
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:50,348
Can he get us a job here
so we can walk around the place?

229
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:53,018
Perhaps a selection from which
we may choose?

230
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,280
Oh, yes. That is, my friend can.

231
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:58,591
You take our money,
and you put your life on the line.

232
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,594
Of course.

233
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,541
How much will it cost?

234
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,321
Well, my friend has a very large family.
Many little children, you understand?

235
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:10,177
And his sergeant has a mother,
heart trouble.

236
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,602
He was asking you how much,
not how many.

237
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,771
If you don't mind, I'll do the negotiating.

238
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:18,821
How much?

239
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:22,613
For you, Fr 500. For him, Fr 1,500.

240
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,393
He made trouble.

241
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,720
Yes, indeed he did. Nevertheless,
I'll give you Fr 1,250 for the both of us.

242
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,101
Now, you take it or leave it as you wish.

243
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:51,355
Try again.

244
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:55,692
Very well. I want two pairs
of comfortable shoes for the both of us...

245
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,545
...and you, you get the Fr 2,000.

246
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,917
Don't you have to go to the toilet?

247
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:03,439
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you excuse me a moment?

248
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:07,049
You don't need to, Mr. Dega.
Unless, of course, you want to.

249
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,724
I can pick it up in the morning.

250
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,942
Get moving, white men!

251
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,419
Let's go! Come on, move it!

252
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:50,128
Let's go! Come on, move it!

253
00:26:50,206 --> 00:26:51,571
On your feet!

254
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:38,261
Attention! Present arms!

255
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,499
No! No!

256
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,443
No!

257
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,677
Mr. Dega, did you get the money?

258
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:24,245
Move it! Move it! Move it!

259
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,664
Get going! Move it!

260
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,660
Fischer, what the hell's wrong?

261
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:34,637
Someone broke out
of the hospital compound.

262
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,643
All right, break it up. We'll get him.

263
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:42,222
Next.

264
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:48,440
Next.

265
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:57,629
You're fine. Next.

266
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,244
I must be better than I feel.

267
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:02,125
You're in wonderful shape.

268
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:05,797
How do you fail an examination like this?

269
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:06,852
Next.

270
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:12,041
7551 .

271
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:16,393
Dega?

272
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,244
Yes, sir, Louis Dega.

273
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:20,422
It was suggested that I speak to you, sir--

274
00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:21,668
I have it right here.

275
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:24,527
We'll just keep you on here
in the cleaning squad.

276
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:26,818
Thank you, sir. There's also my friend.

277
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,007
You're Louis Dega?

278
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,597
I am, sir. And this is my friend, Papillon.

279
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,485
We have a great deal in common,
Mr. Dega.

280
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,144
I'm extremely glad to see you.

281
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,974
Why, thank you, sir.
Of course, if the circumstances were--

282
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,512
My family lost everything they had
in counterfeit National Defense Bonds.

283
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,698
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

284
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:50,946
Even so, buying them was a tribute
to their patriotism, wouldn't you say?

285
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,187
And you're Mr. Dega's friend?

286
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:55,395
Well--

287
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,601
There's one thing about Saint Laurent
you'll like:

288
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:59,615
We never separate old friends.

289
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:03,038
Kilo 40. Both of them. Today's transport.

290
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:12,129
What is Kilo 40?

291
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,423
Don't touch him.
You'll wind up worse off than he is.

292
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,091
Move! Get moving!

293
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:44,198
Duck!

294
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:49,319
Get up, you lazy bastards!

295
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,784
You get that crock
and you bring him along!

296
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,363
You! Pick another man
and grab that crock.

297
00:31:05,353 --> 00:31:07,107
Come on, move!

298
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,575
Move!

299
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:30,306
The son of a bitch isn't dead,
they just irritated him!

300
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:32,645
Get his tail. You get his tail.

301
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:35,963
-Where's his tail?
-Over there.

302
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:40,931
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

303
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,427
-So am I.
-Go ahead.

304
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,443
Okay.

305
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,344
Ready?

306
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,971
-Is that the tail?
-No.

307
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,340
I'd better go over to this side.

308
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:57,368
You get the head.

309
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:58,586
-The head?
-Yeah.

310
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,734
You try the tail.

311
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,078
Okay, now you try the head.

312
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:09,105
Grab him!

313
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:11,963
He's dead.

314
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:13,824
He's still talking.

315
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:17,688
He's dead!

316
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:19,961
He's dead?

317
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:29,618
Move it!

318
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,038
Come on.

319
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:40,733
Come on, hands up.

320
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:42,162
Next!

321
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:43,676
Move!

322
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,899
Next!

323
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,826
Bring it around here.

324
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,946
Just lay the crock right there.

325
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,701
-Just drop it.
-Hold it.

326
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,031
Move out.

327
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,234
He's pretty big.

328
00:32:58,426 --> 00:32:59,960
This skin's worth some money.

329
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,618
Move it!

330
00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:11,612
What the hell are you looking at?

331
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:33,266
You're Louis Dega.

332
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,152
Yes, sir.

333
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:37,495
I'm Clusiot.

334
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:40,275
How come you ended up
in a place like this?

335
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:42,673
Favoritism.

336
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:50,872
Friend's kind of quiet, isn't he?

337
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:52,081
He's dead.

338
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:56,952
He jammed a piece of wood down
his throat and choked himself to death.

339
00:33:59,648 --> 00:34:01,048
Three-way split....

340
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,128
It's fair, isn't it?

341
00:34:20,764 --> 00:34:21,713
Quinine.

342
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,753
Worst country in the world for malaria.

343
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,120
Here, take them.

344
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:38,514
Go ahead, I've got some left.

345
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:42,667
Well, if I'm going to get my sleep...

346
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:46,004
...I'll have to take this poor bastard
with me.

347
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:51,758
A decent man.

348
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:56,495
Dega....

349
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,878
The man hunters.
The ones we saw down at the dock.

350
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,863
Son of a bitches.

351
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:11,436
-Butterflies?
-Yeah, that's right.

352
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,363
Some guy named Richter.

353
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,979
He works every camp on the river
buying the damn things.

354
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:21,074
We catch them, he buys them,
the guards get the big payoff.

355
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,855
It's called the Blue Morphus butterfly.

356
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:27,594
It's wings are used for dye
in making American currency.

357
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,565
How often does he come up here?

358
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,975
A couple of times a month.

359
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:33,837
Boat?

360
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,180
No other way.

361
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:37,491
-Why?
-Thinking.

362
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:41,453
I handle a boat pretty good myself,
you know?

363
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:42,996
Yeah?

364
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,919
You're supposed to catch them,
you clumsy bastard.

365
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:20,311
-Where do you send these bugs, sir?
-The United States.

366
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,310
How much would you charge
to send this one to Panama?

367
00:37:32,372 --> 00:37:33,475
Guard, come here a minute.

368
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:37,261
Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake.
I got Fr 1,000.

369
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:38,326
I didn't hear you.

370
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:40,276
I said I got Fr 2,000 on me.

371
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:41,466
Right now.

372
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,807
What's the trouble?

373
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,066
This man just brought me
the finest Morphus...

374
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,198
...I've ever seen.

375
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,632
Why don't you get him a net?

376
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,898
Right away, sir.

377
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,533
I want a seaworthy boat, new sails.

378
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,699
It'll cost you Fr 4,000, my friend.
Half now, half on delivery.

379
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:03,087
When will that be?

380
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:04,457
One week from tonight.

381
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:05,790
Where will the boat be?

382
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:07,321
Half a mile down river.

383
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,136
About 300 yards this side of the river...

384
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,535
...there's a big tree.

385
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:12,638
You can't miss it.

386
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,265
I'll be there.

387
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,499
You bring me the rest of the money.

388
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,849
I'll take you to your boat.

389
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:26,640
You're a goddamn burglar...

390
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:28,967
...and that proves it.

391
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:51,943
Are you asleep?

392
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,454
No.

393
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:56,972
I've been thinking....

394
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:01,278
When you decide to go...

395
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:06,184
...I'd very much appreciate going with you.

396
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:11,375
What?

397
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,732
-Can you handle a boat?
-No.

398
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,206
Well, can you even see a boat
without your glasses?

399
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:23,974
I can help.

400
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:26,753
Jesus Christ! You're the one
that didn't want to risk it.

401
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:27,831
I didn't.

402
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:30,693
Now I have no choice.

403
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,655
If I stay here in this place...

404
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:39,618
...I'll die.

405
00:39:44,496 --> 00:39:45,736
Well, it's your money.

406
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:04,166
You two, I've got a job for you.

407
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:07,297
You load a stiff into the boat,
you load him right now.

408
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:20,966
Julot!

409
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:27,076
Pick him up.

410
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:38,008
Dega!

411
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:40,891
Don't puke here!

412
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,097
Hey, Sarge!

413
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:44,686
Sarge!

414
00:40:45,828 --> 00:40:47,759
He didn't mean it, sir. He's sick.

415
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,604
I'll take care of him.

416
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:53,152
Stop that, you pig!

417
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:08,515
You just leave him to me.

418
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,084
I'll take care of him, sir.

419
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:21,537
Stop, you bastard!

420
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:49,209
Do you realize that the first man
who carved a wheel out of stone...

421
00:41:50,323 --> 00:41:52,168
...used it as an ornament?

422
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:57,086
I've always admired him for that.

423
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:03,036
There's one search party that gave up.

424
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:12,577
Instead of trying to make
the orifice fit the lens...

425
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:15,533
...I made the lens fit the orifice.

426
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,083
What do you think?
Did he make it or didn't he?

427
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,215
I'd say his chances are very poor,
wouldn't you?

428
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:33,422
Jesus! ls that all you've got to say?

429
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,898
What do you expect me to say?

430
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,211
That man risked his life to save mine.

431
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,957
For me that's a new experience.

432
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:55,278
These may work better than I had hoped.

433
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,220
I told you, you couldn't miss it.

434
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:23,398
The only trouble is, you're a week early.

435
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:28,133
It's up to you.

436
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,730
You're worth just as much dead
as you are alive.

437
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,848
The rule here is total silence.

438
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:14,934
We make no pretense
of rehabilitation here.

439
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:17,033
We're not priests, we're processors.

440
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,576
A meatpacker processes live animals
into edible ones.

441
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,231
We process dangerous men
into harmless ones.

442
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,559
This we accomplish by breaking you.

443
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:31,596
Breaking you physically, spiritually,
and here.

444
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:37,062
Strange things happen to the head here.
Put all hope out of your mind...

445
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,130
...and masturbate as little as possible.
It drains the strength.

446
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:43,392
That's all, take him away.

447
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,588
One, two...

448
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,794
...three, four, five.

449
00:46:58,612 --> 00:47:02,381
One, two, three, four, five.

450
00:48:25,177 --> 00:48:26,347
Oh, Jesus!

451
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:32,715
No. You'll eat everything they give you.

452
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:44,789
I'm going to be fine.

453
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:48,626
I'm going to be fine.

454
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:50,323
I'm going to be fine.

455
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:54,093
One, two, three, four, five.

456
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:33,069
I'm Jo-Jo.

457
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:35,064
Papillon.

458
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:38,257
How do I look?

459
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:40,981
I feel pretty good...

460
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:44,529
...but I need somebody
to tell me how I look.

461
00:49:46,362 --> 00:49:48,078
Fine. You look fine.

462
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,489
"Chew the coconut well...

463
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:46,897
"...then swallow the pulp.

464
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,458
"One each day, for strength.

465
00:50:50,073 --> 00:50:51,502
"My thoughts are with you.

466
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:53,995
"Squinter."

467
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:57,975
Dega. I'll be a son of a bitch! Dega.

468
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,069
I'm still here, you bastards!

469
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,232
Prisoner, show yourself.

470
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,200
You've been receiving coconuts.

471
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:22,525
Unless you tell us who sent them,
your rations will be cut in half.

472
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:25,940
Well, how can I tell you...

473
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:28,059
...who sent me stuff I didn't get?

474
00:53:28,127 --> 00:53:29,201
What stuff?

475
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:33,391
Well, I don't know.

476
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:35,540
You...

477
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,486
...you said coconut.

478
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:40,181
I want that name and I want it now.

479
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,739
Put him on half rations
and screen his cell for six months.

480
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:52,313
Darkness does wonders for a bad memory.

481
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,413
You know the charge.

482
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:45,657
I'm innocent.

483
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,930
I didn't kill that pimp.

484
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:51,162
You couldn't get anything on me
and you framed me.

485
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:54,135
That is quite true.

486
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:59,708
But your real crime has nothing to do
with a pimp's death.

487
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:02,719
Well then?

488
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:04,052
What is it?

489
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:09,174
Yours is the most terrible crime
a human being can commit.

490
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:11,580
I accuse you...

491
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:14,391
...of a wasted life.

492
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:18,966
Guilty.

493
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,427
The penalty for that is death.

494
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:25,813
Guilty.

495
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:29,880
Guilty.

496
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:35,605
Guilty.

497
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:29,879
They know.

498
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:55,006
How did you hear?

499
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:58,842
Trusty works on the launch
between here and Saint Joseph.

500
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,375
That's all that he said?

501
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,748
Then it's only a matter of time.

502
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:07,378
You think so?

503
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:09,823
He's on half rations now.
He can't exist on that.

504
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:14,235
Forced to choose between starvation
and telling, what would you do?

505
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,455
We're not talking about me.
What would you do?

506
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,930
I'd tell. I'd have to.

507
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:25,341
You get weak, you get delirious,
you lose control...

508
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,207
...and you talk.

509
00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:31,624
Then you won't blame him, huh?

510
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:39,806
Blame is for God and small children.

511
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,059
Look at me! I eat bugs!

512
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,520
I don't...I don't have enough sense
to get out of the rain.

513
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,935
Prisoner, show yourself.

514
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,612
Give me the name
and you're back on full rations.

515
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:57,795
Just one name.

516
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:02,931
Well, I don't get that hungry.

517
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:08,366
You'll starve. You should see yourself.

518
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,154
I was born skinny.

519
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,041
Then you'll die.

520
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:03,461
One, two....

521
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:23,401
I'm Papillon.

522
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:25,317
Francisco.

523
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,656
How do I look?

524
01:01:28,882 --> 01:01:30,022
Do I look okay?

525
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:31,680
You look swell.

526
01:02:13,955 --> 01:02:15,200
That's 30 days more...

527
01:02:15,268 --> 01:02:16,417
...pimp killer!

528
01:02:16,897 --> 01:02:18,363
I want to see the warden.

529
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:20,116
I want to talk to him.

530
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:21,984
I have something I want to tell him.

531
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,615
Who gave you the food?

532
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:11,695
I....

533
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:15,786
Jesus, Warden...

534
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:18,671
...I had it.

535
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:23,107
I had the name, honest to God....

536
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,748
I must be light--

537
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:30,236
I must be lightheaded or...

538
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,411
...something because...

539
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:35,803
...I'm trying.

540
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:37,461
I'm trying.

541
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:41,648
I can...I can't remember.

542
01:03:42,358 --> 01:03:43,603
Honest to God, I can't.

543
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,327
I can't, I can't remember.

544
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,373
It's not there, Mr. Prosecutor.

545
01:03:51,604 --> 01:03:54,315
I don't know, it's not, it's not there.

546
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:55,810
No.

547
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:00,735
It's gone.

548
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,565
He's dying.

549
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:09,010
You're dead.

550
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,363
Your term is completed.

551
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:27,711
One, two, three, four...

552
01:07:28,095 --> 01:07:29,140
...five...

553
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:35,739
...six.

554
01:07:37,629 --> 01:07:39,672
Oh, you son of a bitch.

555
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,271
Welcome to the Penal Colony...

556
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,285
...of French Guiana...

557
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,489
...whose prisoners you are...

558
01:08:00,132 --> 01:08:02,175
...and from which there is no escape.

559
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:07,709
First attempts at escape...

560
01:08:08,323 --> 01:08:11,171
...add two years in solitary
to existing sentences.

561
01:08:14,884 --> 01:08:16,898
Second attempts, add five more.

562
01:08:19,335 --> 01:08:21,378
Of course, more serious offenses...

563
01:08:22,059 --> 01:08:24,361
...are dealt with in this fashion.

564
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:40,034
Hello, Papi!

565
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,403
Don't take advantage. I'm in handcuffs.

566
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,335
Make the best of what we offer you...

567
01:08:51,535 --> 01:08:53,741
...and you will suffer less than you deserve.

568
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:55,237
Dismissed.

569
01:08:59,438 --> 01:09:01,385
Move! ln the bunkhouse!

570
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:27,149
I have hot soup, with real meat in it.

571
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,316
Dega sent it to you.

572
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:46,706
My name is Maturette.

573
01:11:00,766 --> 01:11:01,667
How are you?

574
01:11:02,656 --> 01:11:04,066
Pretty good.

575
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,753
You'd be in much better health, you know,
if you'd given them my name.

576
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,796
I almost did.

577
01:11:13,446 --> 01:11:15,642
Someone once said
that temptation resisted...

578
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:20,150
...is the true measure of character.

579
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:24,122
How'd you get out of Kilo 40?

580
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:27,201
It was the rankest sort of corruption.

581
01:11:27,556 --> 01:11:30,654
Suffice it to say the warden
now has a new house...

582
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:33,061
...and I've become his chief clerk.

583
01:11:34,184 --> 01:11:35,133
Papi, look....

584
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:37,148
My wife and lawyer...

585
01:11:37,445 --> 01:11:40,514
...have convinced certain members
in the Ministry of Justice...

586
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:42,404
...that my sentence was a bit harsh.

587
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:44,610
Some months back I asked them...

588
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,104
...to look into your case...

589
01:11:47,661 --> 01:11:49,694
...and they've made some headway.

590
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,581
One of the principle witnesses
against you...

591
01:11:52,773 --> 01:11:55,142
...may be willing to change his story...

592
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,118
...for a price.

593
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,784
If this happened, when would it be?

594
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,962
You could be out in perhaps three years.

595
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,967
-Too long.
-No, it isn't.

596
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:07,305
And with a good job,
the time will pass very quickly.

597
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:09,923
Listen, my friend.

598
01:12:11,055 --> 01:12:12,167
You owe me nothing.

599
01:12:19,343 --> 01:12:20,589
Tell me what you want.

600
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,016
A boat.

601
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,824
I should have known.
