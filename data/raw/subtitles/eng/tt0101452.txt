1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,360
It is time.

2
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,840
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,360
Their message is about to
reach millions.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,120
But... we will change all that.

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,680
When our mission is successful...

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,840
...no longer will the world
be dominated...

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,080
...by the legacy of these two fools!

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,400
No longer will we hear this:

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,960
We will stop them now!

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,000
Brothers and sisters...

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,280
...are we ready?

12
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,360
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

13
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,640
Let's continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

14
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,200
Meet today's most non-bogus
guest speakers.

15
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,320
Say hello to Thomas Edison.

16
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
Hello there.

17
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
To help us on the musical side:

18
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,440
Johann Sebastian Bach.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,480
And Sir James Martin
of Faith No More...

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,560
...founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

21
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,920
- Station!
- Station!

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,920
And a special treat
from the 23rd century:

23
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Miss Ria Paschelle.

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,760
Miss Paschelle is
the inventor of the...

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,440
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Hard to imagine the world
without them, isn't it?

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,680
Remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

28
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,680
Saturday is the field trip
to Babylonia. And very important:

29
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,040
Do not do your homework without
wearing headphones...

30
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,760
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

31
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,640
Rufus.
My favorite pupil.

32
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,280
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

33
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,320
No.

34
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,000
Just in preparation.

35
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,720
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

36
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,640
And soon...

37
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,640
...soon the system
will never have existed.

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

39
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Time has told.

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,760
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

41
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
How's it going, dudes?

42
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,840
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

43
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,080
Replicas only.
Furnished with my agenda.

44
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,920
Now, what is your mission?

45
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,000
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Then we take over their lives.

46
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,440
Then we utterly destroy them.

47
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,360
At the Battle of the Bands, we give
their speech except totally different.

48
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,360
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

49
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Don't tell us.
You programmed us.

50
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,720
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you!

51
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,720
We're total metal heads!

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
Shut up.

53
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,240
Now.

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,400
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

55
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,160
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

56
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,560
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

57
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
And how do we achieve it?

58
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Death to Bill and Ted!

59
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,000
Catch you later, evil dude.

60
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
I am Bill S. Preston...

61
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,000
...Esquire!

62
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,080
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

63
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
On drums and keyboards...

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,400
...celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

65
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,560
...the princesses
from medieval England.

66
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,360
Joanna and Elizabeth.

67
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,920
And we are...

68
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,240
...Wyld Stallyns.

69
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,840
You tell me you're
the greatest band, but you stink.

70
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,760
We don't understand it either.

71
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,480
You can't sing.

72
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,200
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

73
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
Plus, they started
in the 15th century.

74
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
What do you mean?

75
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,600
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,840
Medieval England, Iowa.

77
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,240
The Battle of the Bands is
the biggest event in the area.

78
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,120
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

79
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
...a two-year record deal and exposure
to people in the business.

80
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,360
We're even live on Channel 12. If you
were me, would you put you guys on?

81
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,680
No way.

82
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,560
Since you work for Pretzels 'N' Cheese,
I'll give you a shot.

83
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Excellent!

84
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,440
But last. Midnight.
By that time, everyone will be gone.

85
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,080
That's all right.
We're used to that.

86
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,560
We cleaned out Ted's brother's
junior high dance.

87
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,080
They turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

88
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,000
Shut up, Ted!

89
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,120
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

90
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,200
Work on your act.
Think of something.

91
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,640
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

92
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,000
- Dude, we gotta win.
- Then we could propose to the ladies.

93
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,680
We can't raise a family on the
money from Pretzels 'N' Cheese.

94
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,840
I'll tell Missy we're on our way.

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,240
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

96
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,680
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

97
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,680
So you have something
else to celebrate tonight.

98
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,640
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

99
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,120
If we win, I'll totally
pay you back your money.

100
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,280
What if you don't win?

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,360
Well, uh, I guess...

102
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,920
- Maybe sell more blood.
- Think about selling the instruments.

103
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,840
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you.

104
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,440
Remember my friend, Colonel Oats
from the Alaskan Military School?

105
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
- "How's it going?"
- Yeah.

106
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Splendidly.

107
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,640
Remember...

108
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

109
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,040
For either of you.

110
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,080
For all four of you.

111
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,520
Fresh fudge.

112
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
Hi, Oatsie.

113
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,120
Darling.

114
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

115
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,280
Hey, Missy.
I mean, Mom.

116
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
I can't believe Missy
divorced your dad...

117
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,080
...and married mine.

118
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
Shut up, Ted.

119
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,680
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

120
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,680
What's next?

121
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,560
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Then you'll be your own stepdad.

122
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,560
You probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

123
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,400
That's because...

124
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,720
That's because we wanted to say...

125
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Excuse us, dude.

126
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,800
I wrote this myself.

127
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I wrote this last night.

128
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
"Elizabeth..."

129
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
"Joanna...

130
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,080
...as I wander through this dark
and Ionely forest of life..."

131
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,520
"...surrounded by various beasts..."

132
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
"...bears, vipers, squirrels..."

133
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,280
"Not to mention barnacles
and algae..."

134
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,400
"...man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

135
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

136
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,680
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

137
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,720
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

138
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,200
...we said the future held
some really good stuff.

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Although stuff hasn't
worked out how we thought...

140
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,920
...it will, we hope.

141
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,840
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

142
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
What this is about is...

143
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

144
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,240
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

145
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
- Aim for the cat, dude!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

146
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
Aw, just missed!

147
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,600
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

148
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
We're here, dude.

149
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
Is Rufus with you?

150
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
One second.

151
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

152
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,600
Good.
Then he's gone forever.

153
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,040
Our first act of business:

154
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,320
Destroy that ridiculous,
insipid band!

155
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,720
You got it, dude!

156
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Get to work.

157
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,640
Now!

158
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,480
Study these books well.

159
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,160
When my mission is completed...

160
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,000
...this will be the new history.

161
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,840
What a shithead.

162
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,600
- Bye!
- Bye!

163
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,160
Drive safe!

164
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,560
- Dude.
- What?

165
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,080
After we're married,
will the girls stay with us?

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,080
Yeah, our girlfriends are
most chaste.

167
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,120
- At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

168
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,680
- Hello?
- This is Joanna.

169
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,800
Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

170
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not important. This is:

171
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,320
Elizabeth and I have decided
we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

172
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,440
What?

173
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,760
- Yes!
- Why?

174
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,800
You're losers and
we don't want to see you again.

175
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,920
No way!

176
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,840
We're going to the desert to be alone.
It's over. Goodbye.

177
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,080
- I totally fooled them.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

178
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Not!

179
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,160
- Let's start phase two.
- Station.

180
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,760
<i>An incredible fortune in stones.</i>

181
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
<i>Yet I'd trade them all</i>
<i>for a hand phaser.</i>

182
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,600
<i>Or a good solid club.</i>

183
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,840
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

184
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,640
How could we, Ted?

185
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
We could barely afford
our own apartment.

186
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,600
This is most non-non-heinous.

187
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,160
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

188
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,560
Talk to them.

189
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,400
But how?

190
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,280
Who could that be?

191
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,480
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

192
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
Ted, it's us again.

193
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

194
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Bad.

195
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,880
We came to help in your most
unfortunate situation.

196
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
How?

197
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Come with us. We'll show you.

198
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,160
Excuse us.

199
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,640
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

200
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,400
I don't know.

201
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,120
How do we know they're really us?

202
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,240
We've been through this before.

203
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,120
Without the intervention
of our future selves...

204
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,040
...would we have passed history?
Or met the babes?

205
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,960
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

206
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,600
Ted, if you're really me,
how many fingers am I gonna hold up?

207
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Three.

208
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
You're right!

209
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,400
Let's go, guys.
We'll drive.

210
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,600
- Ted.
- What?

211
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,400
I think we're about to embark
on an unprecedented expedition.

212
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,840
- Dude.
- What?

213
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,000
I got a full-on robot chubby.

214
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,280
Later, Evil Ted.

215
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
Later.

216
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm cold.

217
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
Hey! Can we have some heat back here?

218
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,920
Shut up, Bill.

219
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,280
That other you's a real jerk.

220
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,040
I'll be more considerate to myself
when I become him.

221
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
He said, shut your holes!

222
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I got a very bad feeling.

223
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,800
Out.

224
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,360
So where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

225
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,240
They're not here.

226
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,480
We lied. Here's the truth,
we're gonna kill you now.

227
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,480
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

228
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,040
- We're programmed to do it.
- And we want to do it too.

229
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,600
You dick, Bill!

230
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,520
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out.

231
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,360
Let's go.

232
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,480
Bogus.

233
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,640
We gotta do something.

234
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,640
Dudes, even though
you're doing this...

235
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,080
...we, we...

236
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,760
We love you.

237
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
We love you.

238
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,160
Fags!

239
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,160
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

240
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,880
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

241
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,760
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

242
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,160
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

243
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,880
There's a Porsche.

244
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
Let's bag it.

245
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,040
Station.

246
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
Bill...

247
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,760
...what happened?

248
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,280
Ted...

249
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,480
...we're dead, dude.

250
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,200
- No way.
- Yes way.

251
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,760
Look.

252
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,840
Now what?

253
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,880
Who's that?

254
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,600
Who are you?

255
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Ted...

256
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,800
...it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

257
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,200
How's it hanging, Death?

258
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,680
You will come with me.

259
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,640
We can't.
We gotta get back to the babes.

260
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,200
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

261
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,840
We gotta stop these evil "usses."
We gotta try.

262
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,800
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

263
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,000
You may challenge me to a contest.

264
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,120
But if you lose...

265
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,720
...you will remain here
in the afterlife...

266
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
...forever.

267
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,120
What if we win?

268
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,680
No one has ever won.

269
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,240
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

270
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,840
But how?

271
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
Melvin.

272
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,440
Excuse us, dude...

273
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,160
...but your shoes are untied.

274
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,280
I can't believe
we just melvined Death.

275
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,360
Let's hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

276
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
No way!

277
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,720
This isn't funny.

278
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,360
Way to go, Joanna!

279
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,160
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

280
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,120
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

281
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,600
So get over here and put out!

282
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,200
You can forget
about us playing tonight.

283
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,000
Fine.

284
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,680
Then I guess that's that.

285
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah, see you.

286
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Catch you later, babes!

287
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,040
Ted, I have an idea.

288
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,000
Tonight after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

289
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
...let's waste them.

290
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,440
Station. Meanwhile, let's trash
this lame rathole.

291
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,040
Stellar, Evil Ted!

292
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,760
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

293
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,280
I hope this works.

294
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,760
<i>It worked in The Exorcist.</i>
<i>I and III!</i>

295
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,640
You'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

296
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,960
Also, anyone interested
in moonlighting...

297
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,480
...we're stepping up security
for the Battle of the Bands.

298
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,840
I hear your son's band is playing.

299
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,360
Thanks for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

300
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,880
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

301
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,200
Why don't you try something?

302
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,440
Okay.

303
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Okay, dudes.

304
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,240
I mean, fellow policemen...

305
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,320
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

306
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,000
...and his friend
Bill Preston, Esquire...

307
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,480
...have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

308
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
You totally did it, dude!

309
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,360
I totally possessed my dad.

310
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,400
Okay.

311
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,960
You have to arrest these robots
so they don't ruin everything for us.

312
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,640
I mean, my son and Bill.

313
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,320
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

314
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,840
The princesses.

315
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,280
This isn't working.

316
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,000
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

317
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,200
I totally believe you, dude.

318
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,920
- Doughnuts!
- Excellent!

319
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,680
Savory cruller.

320
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

321
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,920
I don't think they believe us.

322
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,640
We have to find someone who will.

323
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,000
Catch you later, cop dudes!

324
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,960
Ted, we can't go like this.

325
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,040
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,560
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

327
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,840
Gandhi.

328
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,320
Anne Boleyn.

329
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,760
Aristotle.

330
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,160
President Chester A. Arthur.

331
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,320
Clark Gable.

332
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,520
Charlemagne.

333
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,800
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

334
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,760
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

335
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,440
But it will today, dude.

336
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,680
O great spirits
from the netherworld...

337
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,640
...leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

338
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,920
...with your life lessons.

339
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,400
I feel the spirits have arrived!

340
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,400
How's it going...

341
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,360
...New Age dudes?

342
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,920
Spirits, can you hear me?

343
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,080
And we can see down your...

344
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,000
It's your mom, dude!

345
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,800
You're right! Move over, dude.

346
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,080
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

347
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,760
The princesses are in trouble.

348
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,200
Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

349
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,080
...were killed!

350
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,000
- Listen to us.
- Beware!

351
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,640
O evil spirits from Hell...

352
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,880
...I send you back into the darkness!

353
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,360
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

354
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
No way!

355
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,200
This is a totally deep hole.

356
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,360
- Now what?
- I don't know.

357
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,920
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

358
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Are you a mineral?

359
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,120
Are you a tank?

360
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,680
Good one!

361
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,600
- Not bad!
- Can we do it again?

362
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm working as hard as I can!

363
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,920
No way!

364
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,560
This is not what I expected
this place to look like.

365
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,480
We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

366
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,200
Who's that?

367
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,800
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

368
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
How do we get his attention?

369
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,920
Sign of the devil, dude!

370
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,200
- Hey, Devil dude!
- Down here!

371
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,520
Down here, dude!

372
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,440
Two little guys!

373
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Big dude! Down here!

374
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
I kind of like this.

375
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,200
Excellent!

376
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,960
Let's get out of here.

377
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,680
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

378
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,200
But, dude, we're already dead!

379
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,360
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

380
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,360
How's it going, Beelzebub?

381
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,600
Okay. Can we go now?

382
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,760
You may go.

383
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Thanks, dude!

384
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,840
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

385
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,280
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

386
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,720
Maybe we should try
one of these tunnels.

387
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,800
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

388
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,120
Maybe we should try
one of these doors.

389
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,240
After you, dude.

390
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,600
Now where are we?

391
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,760
Who's that?

392
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,600
It's Colonel Oats!

393
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,840
No way!

394
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
Gentlemen!

395
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,360
Welcome to Hell.

396
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,960
- No way.
- What?!

397
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,680
No way, sir?

398
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,600
You two...

399
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,120
...will do whatever
I tell you to do...

400
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,120
...from now on.

401
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,560
Is that clear?

402
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,760
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

403
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,120
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

404
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,440
Yes, sir, sir dude!

405
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,320
Get down and give me...

406
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,600
...infinity.

407
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,800
Stupid, pathetic,
craven little cretins.

408
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,000
- I can't possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

409
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,800
- Maybe we can do girls' style.
- Jokers!

410
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,280
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

411
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,080
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

412
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

413
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,760
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'll eat you up like butter cakes.

414
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,280
Get back here!

415
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
- Dude.
- What?

416
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,440
I think we're in
our own personal hell.

417
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,560
- Let's split up.
- That way he can't get us so bad.

418
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,000
What happened?

419
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,600
Bogus!

420
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,320
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

421
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,960
No way.

422
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Theodore!

423
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,760
You made your brother cry.

424
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,840
How about...

425
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,800
...a kiss...

426
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,720
...for your dear old granny, Bill?

427
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,680
Come along.

428
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,920
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

429
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,480
No way. This was 10 years ago!

430
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,960
Come here!

431
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,240
That was non, non, non...
Non-heinous!

432
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,720
Choose...

433
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,120
...your...

434
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
...eternity.

435
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,760
Choose your own, you fag!

436
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,840
You ugly, red source of all evil!

437
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,120
Hello, girls.

438
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,480
- Dude.
- What?

439
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,720
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

440
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,440
- You no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket!

441
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,240
Come to Oatsie!

442
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,600
I want one right on the lips!

443
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,920
- There's only one way out!
- Right. We gotta play the Reaper!

444
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,800
Choose your game.

445
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
But if you lose...

446
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,240
...you will stay here in Hell...

447
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,680
...forever.

448
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,080
D-1.

449
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,480
Miss.

450
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,560
B...

451
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,920
...3.

452
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,920
Miss.

453
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,120
C-6.

454
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,480
Hit.

455
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,880
- Dude...
- I know.

456
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,640
J-7.

457
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
J-7...

458
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,160
Hit.

459
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,720
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

460
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Excellent!

461
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,760
- I knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking.

462
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,880
You must play me again.

463
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,360
- What?!
- Best two out of three.

464
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,720
No way!

465
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,240
Yes way.

466
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,520
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

467
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,840
I believe...

468
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,960
...Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

469
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,040
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

470
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,080
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

471
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,560
Can we go back now?

472
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,440
Best three out of five.

473
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,720
I don't believe this guy.

474
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,560
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

475
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
Right hand, green.

476
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,800
Left hand, red.

477
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,040
Right foot, green.

478
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,080
Right foot...

479
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,480
Well?

480
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,800
I will...

481
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,120
...take you back.

482
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,640
- You played very well.
- Especially with your heavy robes.

483
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,560
Don't patronize me.

484
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,840
Whatever. You got a lot
to learn about sportsmanship.

485
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,360
This way.

486
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,240
Now we can save the babes.

487
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,320
But, Bill, how will we fight
those other usses?

488
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,400
They're totally stronger than us.
And way smarter.

489
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,400
Plus, they already killed us once.

490
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,560
One minute, duder!

491
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,000
If we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

492
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,600
...what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

493
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
Good thinking, dude!

494
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
Excuse us.

495
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,480
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

496
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,840
Could you take us to someone
who could help us?

497
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,320
You have beaten me.
I am at your command.

498
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,760
Cool!

499
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,520
This way.

500
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,680
- Ted.
- What?

501
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,800
Don't fear the Reaper.

502
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,720
I heard that.

503
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,440
This is most atypical.

504
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,560
Welcome to Heaven.

505
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,600
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

506
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,480
Thank you.

507
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,720
Through there.

508
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
Welcome to Heaven.

509
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,280
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

511
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,440
Dude, we're in big trouble.

512
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,760
I think I have an idea.

513
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,000
Wise dudes.

514
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,280
Can we ask you a question?

515
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,600
Right this way, please.

516
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,400
We're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

517
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,720
We better leave
before we ruin it for everybody.

518
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,360
Come on, Death.

519
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,120
You look great, dude.

520
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,880
You think so?

521
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,120
You do.

522
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,520
Shut up.

523
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,960
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

524
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,000
I can't believe I'm doing this.

525
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,080
How did I end up in this situation?

526
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,080
How's it going?

527
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,560
What is the meaning of life?

528
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,200
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>

529
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,360
<i>Just like every night has its dawn</i>

530
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,440
<i>Just like every cowboy</i>

531
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,680
<i>Sings a sad, sad song</i>

532
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,560
<i>Every rose has a thorn</i>

533
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,280
Don't I know you?

534
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,120
No.

535
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,120
So, God, as if you didn't know...

536
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,080
...we're not the three wise people
you might have thought we were.

537
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,480
We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

538
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,160
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

539
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,840
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

540
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,120
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

541
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,440
He brought us when we
challenged him and won.

542
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,560
First, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

543
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,440
- We enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other planets.

544
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,440
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

545
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,280
But the point is, we died.

546
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,840
Most unfairly.

547
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,920
But we won the chance to come back.

548
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,800
We gotta construct something
to save the women we love.

549
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,840
And there's not a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

550
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,400
...could you help us
find somebody to help us?

551
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,440
<i>Station.</i>

552
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,440
We were thinking along the lines...

553
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,760
...of maybe a scientist or something.

554
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,040
Cool.

555
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,880
Thanks, God.

556
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,840
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

557
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,520
- We'll be going now.
- Keep up the good work.

558
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,680
Catch you later, God.

559
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,240
Sorry. They melvined me.

560
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,760
All right, upside-down cake!

561
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,600
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

562
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,360
We're out of dishes.

563
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,680
Check this out.

564
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,360
Not bad, E.T.

565
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,640
Let me try.

566
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,720
You totally didn't see the fan.

567
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,720
Tell my body to get over here
and get me!

568
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,960
That's all right. I'll get you.

569
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,840
Got your head, dude.

570
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,160
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

571
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,960
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

572
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,280
Come on. There you go.

573
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,720
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

574
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,600
<i>Okay, dude.</i>

575
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,760
<i>What do you say</i>
<i>we trash their relationships?</i>

576
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,840
I hate them.

577
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,080
I hate the robot versions of them.

578
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,360
<i>You made us, dude.</i>

579
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,480
Looks like this is the place.

580
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,480
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

581
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,920
- What kind of name is Station?
- I don't know.

582
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,400
Must be some kind of future guy.

583
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,760
Okay, how many syllables?

584
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,040
Is it a play or a song or...?

585
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,560
It's something big.

586
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,280
My money's on Einstein.

587
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,400
That's Station?

588
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,400
Did you assume
the most brilliant scientist...

589
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,200
...in the universe
would be from Earth?

590
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,600
Yeah.

591
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,920
Movies?

592
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,120
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

593
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,560
Fire? Cigarettes?

594
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,280
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

595
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,480
<i>Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.</i>

596
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,360
- Death!
- Sorry.

597
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,440
<i>Smokey and the Bandit III.</i>

598
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,360
Smokey is the bandit!

599
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,080
Excuse us. Martians?

600
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,960
First, my friend,
Bill and I congratulate you...

601
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,120
...on a well-played round of charades.

602
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,480
You've been referred to us...

603
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,360
...as the most brilliant scientists
in the universe.

604
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,800
Would you help us build
good robot usses...

605
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,720
...to save two princesses
from bad robot usses?

606
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,920
Sounds good, Station.

607
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,200
Let's rock, Death.

608
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,080
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

609
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,560
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

610
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,360
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

611
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,640
You guys okay?

612
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,880
Where's Death?

613
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,960
You okay, dude?

614
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,480
I'm fine.

615
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,480
First, we go back to town
and clean up.

616
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,920
Second, we warn the princesses.

617
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,840
Third, we buy stuff
to build good robot usses.

618
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,400
Let's go.

619
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,400
What? What?

620
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,960
Here, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!

621
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,800
There's one, dude!

622
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,400
Just missed, dude.

623
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,440
Dude, we're there.

624
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,280
Okay. I got an idea.

625
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,080
How's it going, lady humans?

626
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,600
Okay, this is Builders Emporium...

627
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,520
...a repository for electronics
and robot materials.

628
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,080
Get what you need to make metal usses.

629
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,720
- Ready for the big night?
- No! We're not going.

630
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,280
I think you guys
should stop right there.

631
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,640
Catch you later, future wife.

632
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,480
Evil breath!

633
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,720
Who are you?

634
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,960
Well, you see...

635
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,800
Come on.

636
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,240
- Any luck?
- They're not at our place or theirs.

637
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,720
I'll try your dad's.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

638
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,760
Logan residence.

639
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,160
Evil Bill S. Preston,
Esquire, speaking.

640
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,920
It's them! They're back from the dead.

641
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,240
We get to kill them again.

642
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,640
Excellent!

643
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,120
See you real soon.

644
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,000
- But this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

645
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,840
We can be ready for them too.

646
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,960
Good luck getting
in the concert, losers!

647
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,880
<i>- Initiate the final plan.</i>
<i>- You got it, great one.</i>

648
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,800
<i>Do not fail me.</i>

649
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,320
<i>Metallic buffoons.</i>

650
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,160
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

651
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,000
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

652
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,040
Station! What are you doing?

653
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,800
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

654
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,080
That one's me, right?

655
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,000
Not bad.

656
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,640
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

657
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,240
How's it doing?

658
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,520
<i>Kate Axelrod for KJM...</i>

659
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,480

<i>the San Dimas Auditorium.</i>

Ready? You're up.

664
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,000
Where are the girls?

665
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,400
- Hanging from the rafters.
- We'll kill them at the finale.

666
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,120
Good luck, gentlemen.

667
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,000
Check it out.

668
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,320
Not bad.

669
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:15,080
Let's hear it for Primus!

670
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,720
- Are they ready?
- Station.

671
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,680
Excellent work, dude.

672
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,760
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

673
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,160
I helped do the shopping.
I pushed the cart.

674
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,440
- Do they work like we asked?
- Station.

675
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,720
You're a most excellent scientist.

676
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,840
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

677
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,560
Feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

678
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,880
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

679
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,040
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

680
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,160
Ready to take on those evil usses
and save the babes?

681
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,560
<i>Fight evil usses. Save the babes.</i>

682
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,400
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

683
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,400
Let's go get 'em.

684
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,240
And now, the last band of the evening.

685
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,080
Wyld Stallyns!

686
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,640
How's it going, worms?

01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,720
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

692
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,880
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

693
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,280
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

694
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,000
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

695
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,840
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends.

696
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,920
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

697
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,880
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

698
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,000
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

699
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,880
We may have met our match.

700
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,120
Kudos to you, good human usses.

701
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:32,160

- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

703
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,480
- Joanna!
- William!

704
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,680
Who is that?

705
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,600
Who are you?

706
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:47,360
Who am I?

707
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,600
I am De Nomolos.

708
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,480
I am their master.

709
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,280
And I must see to it that you die.

710
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,520
But first...

711
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,760
<i>We are now transmitting on every</i>
<i>channel throughout the world.</i>

712
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,080

<i>I want the whole universe</i>
<i>to behold this...</i>

714
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,240
<i>... transfer of power.</i>

715
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,520
<i>No longer will our future society...</i>

716
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,760
<i>... be based on</i>
<i>the ideas and the music...</i>

717
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,400
<i>... of these two fools!</i>

718
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,720
<i>They will be based on my ideas...</i>

719
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,960
...and my ideas alone!

720
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,160
How do we get out of this?
There's no time.

721
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,920
We do. After we get away
from this guy...

722
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,960
...we time-travel back and set up
the things we need to get him now.

723
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, like what?

724
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,560
Like a sandbag.

725
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,480
Excellent!

726
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,720
Then we'll get a cage.

727
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,400
My friends.

728
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,360
I too can play the time game.

729
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,720
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

730
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,840
...I'll go back and set up this key.

731
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,520
And another gun.

732
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,640
Right. Only there's one thing
you didn't think of.

733
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,880
Only the winners can go back
and set things up.

734
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,000
And that's gonna be us.

735
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,080
We set up the key,
and we set up the gun.

736
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,480
Excuse me.

737
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,520
Your shoelaces are untied.

738
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,280
Melvined.

739
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,120
You're under arrest.

740
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,960
Way to go, Dad!

741
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,400
Book him, Danno.

742
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,680
Good job, Death.

743
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,400
Who was that guy?

744
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,560
I can answer that question.

745
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,080
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

746
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,680
We definitely...

747
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,280
Take it off, baby!

748
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,920
Rufus!

749
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,400
When did you get here?

750
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,840
Just in time for your audition.

751
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,360
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

752
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,080
Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

753
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,080
That was Chuck De Nomolos,
my old gym teacher.

754
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:07,560
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

755
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,080
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

756
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,600
Thanks, Rufus.

757
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,680
<i>Dude, we still don't know how to play.</i>

758
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,240
Maybe we ought to get good.

759
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,640
How?

760
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training.

761
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:02,240
Except for the two-week
medieval honeymoon.

762
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,480
Hello, San Dimas!

763
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,000
Let me introduce you
to a little friend.

764
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,880
This is little Ted.

765
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,720
Hello, little Ted!

766
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,720
This is little Bill.

767
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,160
Now for the rest of our band.

768
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:30,840
On conga and bongos, proof that
you can't tell a book by its cover...

769
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,640
...the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

770
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,680
...Station!

771
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,080
Our backup dancers...

772
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,840
...Station's most bodacious
creations...

773
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,720
...the Good Robot Usses!

774
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:54,960
And over here...

775
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,000
...our bass player,
the Duke of Spooks...

776
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,840
...the Doc of Shocks,
the Man With No Tan...

777
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,760
...please say hello
to Death himself...

778
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,720
...the Grim Reaper!

779
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,720
<i>You might be a king</i>
<i>Or a little street sweeper</i>

780
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,160
<i>But sooner or later</i>
<i>You dance with the Reaper</i>

781
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,360
Get down with your bad self!

782
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,240
I love show business.

783
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,120
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,720
...we've been to the past.

785
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,840
We've been to the future.

786
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,560
We've been all around the afterlife.

787
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,480
And you know...

788
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,400
The best place to be...

789
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,520
...is here.

790
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,400
And the best time to be...

791
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,240
...is now.

792
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,480
And all we can say is...

793
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,560
...let's rock!

794
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,200
One! Two!

795
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,040
One, two, three, four!

796
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,720
Right good! Right good!

797
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,920
<i>You are go, Stallyn!</i>

798
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,080
<i>Come home soon. We'll miss you.</i>
