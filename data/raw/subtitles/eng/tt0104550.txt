1
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,575
{y:i}Destroy the Earth.

2
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,085
Coming in for a landing.

3
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,596
Hey, what is going on here?

4
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,099
-I didn't do it on purpose.
-Yes, you did.

5
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,686
No. Jason, we don't hit.
You got to use your words.

6
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,981
Come on, I want to hear you
use your words. Go ahead.

7
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,365
I think what you did was wrong.
Friends don't do that to each other.

8
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,868
Sorry.

9
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,998
Can you guys shake hands?

10
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,377
You guys are good.

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,588
All right, I'm out of here,
and I want you to play nicely, okay?

12
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,965
-Okay.
-All right. Bye.

13
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:58,571
What do you think, pretty face?
Am I dynamite in this, or what?

14
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,283
You actually bought that?

15
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,371
Yeah, I actually bought it.
You think they give shirts like this away?

16
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,083
It took $46. If you don't like it, who cares?
Don't look.

17
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,293
No. I like it.

18
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,172
You do? You're sure?

19
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,092
-Otherwise I could take it back.
-No, I'm positive.

20
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,178
It's great on you, Pop. They're your colors.

21
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,390
Yeah, that's what I figured. The colors.

22
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,268
It makes me look like a young Tony Bennett.

23
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,894
Only handsomer.

24
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,275
And thinner.

25
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,071
Pop, my sink's still leaking.
Can you stop over?

26
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,491
Now that you're such a big shot
living alone, fix your own sink.

27
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,368
At my age, I should be living alone.

28
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,871
-And at your age you should be--
-What?

29
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,581
-Nothing.
-What?

30
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,959
-I didn't say anything. What did I say?
-Don't start with me, okay?

31
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,462
I'm not starting. You're starting.

32
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,464
But...

33
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,593
seeing that you brought it up...

34
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,471
there's this guy I met. His name's Gino.

35
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,598
Terrific guy. He's an apprentice plumber.

36
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,892
I tell you, he's got a head on his shoulders.

37
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,977
He's gonna have his own shop someday.

38
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,897
-Does he speak English yet?
-He's learning.

39
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,775
That's good, Pop. Keep them coming.

40
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,572
So, want to stay
and play poker with us tonight?

41
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,699
I can't. I'm meeting the girls.

42
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,994
How come you're always meeting the girls?
How come never a guy?

43
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,498
And how come my sink leaks
when my father's a plumber?

44
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,377
-See you, Pop.
-Yeah, see you.

45
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,297
-You look good tonight, Ange.
-I do, right?

46
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,799
Yeah, I like that shirt.

47
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,760
-I got this at Rassini's.
-You did? How much?

48
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,679
-$13.99.
-No way.

49
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,765
-I can't believe you shop there.
-What's wrong with Rassini's?

50
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,560
-Nothing, if you like cheap clothes.
-They have the same stuff as Stardrift's.

51
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,398
-They have the same exact stuff, Cookie.
-You guys don't know how to shop.

52
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,068
-You probably have no money in the bank.
-I don't. Everything I own is on me.

53
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,571
You shop the way you shop,
and then we'll shop the way we shop.

54
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,282
Wholesale or no sale.

55
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,076
You're so cheap.

56
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,790
I told her no French fries. I'm on a diet.

57
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,167
You hear that, Toby? Angie's on a diet.

58
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,462
No French fries,
but half a barbequed chicken is all right.

59
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,089
You're so special, Cook.

60
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,259
Did I tell you
how nice your roots are looking?

61
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,761
Cook, the mustard.

62
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,180
-What?
-It's all over you.

63
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,974
Put club soda on that.

64
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,184
You know what club soda gets out?
Club soda.

65
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,061
No, it works. Club soda works.

66
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,397
Miss, could we have club soda here, please?

67
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,483
Jeez, Ange, I don't think
enough people heard you.

68
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,195
Excuse me. What is wrong, Toby?

69
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,866
Every Friday night we go to the same place,
with the same people.

70
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,160
We eat the same garbage food.

71
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,082
The last guy I made love to forgot my name.

72
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,298
There is something desperately wrong
with my life.

73
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,261
Come on, Toby,
you'll feel better in the morning.

74
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,181
If you don't, just give it a couple of days...

75
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,266
then something really bad will happen...

76
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,894
and then you'll forget all about this feeling.

77
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,064
Is that supposed to
make me feel better, Dottie?

78
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,275
It always works for me.

79
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,767
-Ange, see this guy?
-Who is this?

80
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,395
I don't know. Just some guy.

81
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,564
But there's thousands of them in Manhattan
and none in Jersey.

82
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,069
This is the kind of guy that doesn't
eat in front of the sports page, Cookie.

83
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,781
This is the kind of guy
who remembers your name.

84
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,784
He doesn't forget your anniversary.

85
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,288
He writes you love notes,
plans special things for you to do.

86
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,958
I love the way
these guys look at these girls...

87
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,794
like they're the most unique things
on the planet.

88
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,173
That's 'cause they are.
They're 5'11", and they weigh 100 pounds.

89
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,466
So what?

90
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,886
-I want them to look at me that way.
-Toby, will you get real?

91
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,598
These guys are out of our league.
They go out with model-actress types.

92
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,685
If you were an uptown kind of guy,
would you want one of us?

93
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,062
Depends if you want a good blowjob or not.

94
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,899
-That's not what I'm talking about.
-We know what you're talking about.

95
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,195
What we are talking about is real.
What you are talking about is nuts.

96
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,995
Don't worry. He'll show up.

97
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,874
I don't think he's gonna show here, Dottie.
I think I gotta go find him.

98
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,294
Toby, I know where I'd be
if I was a cool guy.

99
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,880
-Yeah, where?
-lnside a cool girl.

100
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,178
Aren't you guys sick of guidos running
around in guinea tees, driving Camaros?

101
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,097
-Doesn't that make you sick?
-No.

102
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,393
What do you want? Some guy
from Manhattan driving a Mercedes?

103
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,896
You think that will make you feel better?

104
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,274
-Yeah, maybe.
-So go cruise a car lot.

105
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,861
While you're at it,
you can polish your fender.

106
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,488
Maybe I will.

107
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,158
-Come on, you're not serious.
-I'll do something.

108
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,995
She's serious.

109
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,374
-What's wrong with meeting a guy that way?
-Nothing.

110
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,670
Not if you're the most beautiful girls
in the world, which we are not.

111
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,589
Actually, maybe I am.

112
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,594
Hello. May I help you?

113
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,097
No, I'm just looking around. Thanks.

114
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,194
This is stupid. I've seen enough. Thank you.

115
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,671
Stupid idea. I'm over it now.

116
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,260
Don't do this to me, all right?

117
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,596
Goddamn it!

118
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,392
Thank you.

119
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,782
Excuse me, can you move your car forward
so I can get by?

120
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,167
Hello?

121
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,088
Can you move your car forward
so I can get by?

122
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,173
Sure, no problem.

123
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,677
No! Forward!

124
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,096
Sorry.

125
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,767
Never mind. I'll go around you.

126
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,392
Excuse me!

127
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,980
Could you please tell me
how to get to the....

128
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,192
What? I'm not from around here.
I don't know.

129
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,693
Shit.

130
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,573
Shit.

131
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,462
Are you okay?

132
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,176
Come on. You sure?
Sit down until you're really sure.

133
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,470
-Come on, breathe. You all right?
-Yeah.

134
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,389
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

135
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,059
-Jesus. I can't even look.
-I'm sorry.

136
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,772
-That's all you can say, "I'm sorry"?
-I'm really sorry.

137
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,861
Do you have any idea
what kind of damage you just did?

138
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,988
My insurance will cover it.

139
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,492
Except I don't have any insurance anymore
since they raised my rates.

140
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,577
How about I pay you $20?

141
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,290
$30 a month, you know.

142
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,584
$30 a month?

143
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,298
What are you talking about?
It's a brand-new car.

144
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,094
It's supposed to last 20 years, and in
10 minutes you make it a piece of shit.

145
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,889
You don't have to keep screaming at me,
you know. I said I was sorry.

146
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,767
You're fine, right?
No broken bones, no pains anywhere...

147
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,978
no internal bleeding, anything like that?

148
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,980
I'm just so embarrassed.

149
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,778
-Where are you going?
-I have to get it towed, don't I?

150
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,781
Don't you want to exchange
phone numbers?

151
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,587
Hi.

152
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,797
Are you some kind of nightmare
or something?

153
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:26,593
I stayed 'cause I felt bad, okay?
Can I give you a ride?

154
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,179
In the car with you?
I'd be dead in five minutes.

155
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,764
I can drive carefully.

156
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,684
-No, thanks. I called a cab.
-You're not from Jersey, are you?

157
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,771
-No, why?
-Because I was gonna say...

158
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,775
that cabs in Jersey take four or five times
longer than they say it's gonna take.

159
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,694
It's a big problem we have here in Jersey.

160
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,281
But it's fine if you want to wait.
That's no problem.

161
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,785
I've got the afternoon free.
I'm gonna hang with you.

162
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,762
What are you looking at?

163
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,389
-You.
-Why?

164
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,891
I want to know who you are,
what you do and stuff.

165
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,184
I'm a guy. I got a job.

166
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,187
I had a beautiful car.
You completely destroyed it.

167
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,189
Anything else you want to know?

168
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,484
-I figured you had a job. What kind?
-Just a job.

169
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,569
Is it a good job?

170
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,074
Of course it's a good job,
or I wouldn't be doing it, would l?

171
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,578
What kind of job is it?
What do you do all day? Where do you go?

172
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,497
Graphics.

173
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,458
-I sell graphics.
-Now that's very interesting.

174
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,877
Graphics. What exactly is that?

175
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,879
Printing.

176
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,758
-I sell printing.
-That's good for a start.

177
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,094
-What else?
-What else what?

178
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,390
What else do you do for fun, friends, family,
that kind of stuff?

179
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,478
Are you hungry or thirsty--

180
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,982
Look, I'm not hungry. I'm not thirsty.
I want you to keep driving.

181
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,193
Keep your eyes on the road.
I don't want any more accidents.

182
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:11,573
I'm not hungry or thirsty either.
Lousy idea. It was a bad idea.

183
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,660
How about maybe some gum?
As like a mood-lifter or something?

184
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,997
No. I feel like we've started out
on the wrong foot--

185
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,291
The wrong foot?

186
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,170
You destroyed my $70,000 car.
Do you understand that?

187
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,089
-Yes.
-We've got off on a really bad foot.

188
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,093
Okay. Maybe we should
just listen to some music, you know?

189
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,970
It'll mellow us out.

190
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,695
Just pull over. Fine. Great. I'll walk--

191
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,573
No, I want to take you right to your door.

192
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
Wait!

193
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,288
I need your name and your address,
so I can pay you back.

194
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,292
-Save your money. Go to driving school.
-No, I gotta pay you back.

195
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,590
There you go.
How about we never do it again?

196
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,969
Call me with the damages.

197
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,473
Toby Mastallone, Hackensack.
One "T," two "L's"!

198
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,685
See you, Sal.

199
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,774
Yes. All right.

200
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,694
Guys.

201
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,488
Where have you been?
We had to let ourselves in.

202
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,281
-I found him.
-Who?

203
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,076
Him. Mr. Make-It-Happen.

204
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,286
Mr. Sal Torme.

205
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,082
-He's Italian?
-He's in trouble, is what he is.

206
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,878
-Where'd you meet him?
-A Mercedes dealership.

207
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,880
Get out of here.

208
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,758
I swear to God, Cook. I felt so pathetic.

209
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,969
I thought, "What am I doing here?"

210
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,472
And then I saw him.
My heart started pounding so fast...

211
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,475
-that I could hardly restrain myself.
-Is he cute?

212
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,270
Oh, my God. He is gorgeous.

213
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,565
He has dark hair and big blue eyes.

214
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,984
What, did you just walk up to him and say:

215
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,862
"I'm looking for a gorgeous, rich guy,
and you're it"?

216
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,864
I chased him down and wrecked his car.

217
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,366
-Oh, my God.
-You got into a car accident?

218
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,495
Just a little one. I ran
his brand-new Mercedes into a bus bench.

219
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,373
A Mercedes? He must be rich.

220
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,293
Who cares? He's just the greatest guy
in the entire world.

221
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,086
Did he ask you out?

222
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,673
Not yet, but I'm sure
he's thinking about it right now.

223
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,177
Thanks, Bernie.

224
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,764
I'm sorry, baby. Go ahead.
What were you saying?

225
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,059
{y:i}-Sal, what are you doing?
-I'm working.

226
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,480
Could you take a break
and come play again?

227
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:51,858
{y:i}You ask me this every day.
{y:i}I can't, honey. I gotta work.

228
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,779
I know, but I was just thinking about
what you were doing to me this morning...

229
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,989
and how good it felt.

230
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,659
{y:i}I want you to do it again.

231
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:05,580
You know, you keep talking like this,
and I'm not gonna make it till tonight.

232
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,083
And, Sal...

233
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,378
I seem to have lost my panties.

234
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,465
And I was wondering if you'd found them?

235
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,469
{y:i}Could you check inside your jacket pocket?

236
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,063
Bye, Sal.

237
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,573
-Hey, Pop.
-What?

238
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,578
When you first met Mom,
did you instantly know she was it?

239
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,165
What's to know?
We got along, we got married. Simple.

240
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,168
That's simple, okay.

241
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,176
Toby, remember that fellow
I mentioned, Gino?

242
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,889
I gave him your number.

243
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,767
-You gave him my number?
-Just talk to the guy.

244
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,187
-lf you don't like him, then--
-Pop, I met someone.

245
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,859
You met a guy?

246
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,779
No kidding, pretty face. What's his name?

247
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,990
-Sal Torme.
-Torme?

248
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,493
-Sounds ltalian. Is he ltalian?
-I think so.

249
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,871
So when can I meet him?

250
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,583
We haven't exactly connected yet.

251
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,172
What exactly does that mean,
you haven't exactly connected?

252
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,591
I haven't really talked to him.

253
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,469
Then how you do you know
you're gonna go out?

254
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:46,389
I don't know I'm gonna go out with him.
I want to go out with him.

255
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,894
Has he given you any indication
that he wants to go out with you?

256
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,775
I'm not exactly his type.
I have to make a few changes.

257
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,361
Changes? What are you talking about?

258
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,781
Who does this guy think he is?
Let him change.

259
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,493
Pop, I want to be different.
I want to improve myself.

260
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,665
Toby, you see this apple?
You see this banana?

261
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,462
This apple knows it's an apple,
and this banana knows it's a banana.

262
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,589
You know what I'm talking about?

263
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,760
If you want to improve yourself...

264
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:27,764
if you want to take classes,
get a new hairdo, that's fine.

265
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,058
But you're still you.

266
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,269
Like that wall.

267
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,273
If you were to put a coat of blue paint
on that wall...

268
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,276
that wall wouldn't think it was a waterfall.

269
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,988
Otherwise it'd be a dumb-as-shit wall.

270
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,158
Now you know what I'm talking about?

271
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,173
-What's up, chief?
-You're up.

272
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:10,890
-What are you talking about?
-I'm giving you Smith and Smith.

273
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,769
-What, are you kidding me?
-No, I'm not kidding.

274
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,565
That's Marvin's.
He's been working on it for six months.

275
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,567
So he's been warming it up for you.

276
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,570
Come on. You can't do that
to the poor bastard.

277
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,490
Working it costs money, Sal.
Closing it makes money.

278
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:32,287
-You like to make money, right?
-Of course I do. That's not my point.

279
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,663
I know you like to make money.

280
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:37,083
Come on, Mitch. You can't do that.
He's got a family.

281
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,970
The elevator's going up, Sal.

282
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,766
You get on, you punch any floor you want.
It's up to you.

283
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,185
You with me on this?

284
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,191
Good.

285
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,695
Straighten that tie.

286
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,961
I just wanted to give him my number at work
in case he tried to call me at home...

287
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,090
'cause I'm hardly ever there.
I'm pretty busy most of the time...

288
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,760
and I know a guy like Mr. Torme
is pretty busy, so I figured...

289
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,097
why waste the guy's time
by dialing a number I'm not even at?

290
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,682
I'm out of here.

291
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,394
Do you know a Toby Mastallone?

292
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:39,979
Hello?

293
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,984
-Mastallone. One "T," two "L's."
-No.

294
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:49,364
Tell her I got hit by a bus.
I'm dead. Anything.

295
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,992
We'll get back to you. Okay, hon?

296
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,174
Kind of like this?

297
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,387
Hon, unless you want
to walk around with a fan...

298
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,098
blowing out your hair all the time,
it'll never do this.

299
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,267
So you can't do this for me?

300
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,060
No, I can do this for you.

301
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,980
Your mother can do this for you,
even your father can...

302
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:25,859
but your hair still will not do this, okay?
Face the news.

303
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,160
Cookie, I need to borrow
that outfit you bought on Saturday.

304
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,078
Forget it. I haven't even worn it.

305
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:41,374
I need it, Cookie. I've gotta go see him.
He's my only chance.

306
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:46,671
Who, Mr. Millionaire? Mr. "Make-It-Happen"?
Let him buy you a dress.

307
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,091
Cookie, please.
If you could only see his eyes....

308
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,678
Toby, I hope you know what you're doing.

309
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:58,183
I'm telling you.
You stain it, you stink it, or you stretch it...

310
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,061
-you own it.
-I love you. Bye.

311
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,687
Get out of here.

312
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,566
So you really won't do this for me?

313
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,572
-Sounds good.
-Damn right it sounds good.

314
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,075
May I help you, please?

315
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,160
-So it's not chicken feed?
-No.

316
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,499
No, I found my party. Thank you, anyway.

317
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,460
-That works for me. I'm solvent.
-You win.

318
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,963
If you lose, you still win. You can't lose.

319
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,675
It works, you know?

320
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,260
Hi. No, sit.

321
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,764
Your secretary told me
that you would be here.

322
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,392
She did?

323
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,063
Not exactly. I went to your office,
and I saw the calendar on her desk.

324
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:50,068
So I figured since I'm in the city,
and since I owed you money, what the hell.

325
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,071
-This is Tony.
-Toby.

326
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,074
Kind of a hard name to remember.

327
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,661
-This is Mr. Stevens.
-Hi, I'm Gabe. Just call me Gabe.

328
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,080
-Hi, Gabe. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

329
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,958
-Would you like to join us?
-Sure it's okay?

330
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,961
-Sure it's okay. Right, guys? Come on.
-Thank you.

331
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,588
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

332
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,758
You have a price tag sticking out here.

333
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,260
-Just pull it off.
-No.

334
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,388
I'll stick it in here.
You might want to return it.

335
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,764
-Is that better?
-Yeah.

336
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:23,476
Just when you think you're looking
your best, it can't get any better...

337
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,271
there's a price tag sticking out,
you run your stockings.

338
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,274
Sometimes the whole thing
goes haywire, right?

339
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,358
Get rid of her.

340
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,776
-Love your dress.
-Thank you.

341
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,571
Can I talk to you for a second?
What are you doing here?

342
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:38,283
First, you destroy my car,
now you're trying to destroy my life?

343
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:42,370
-Sal and I had a little bit of a fender bender.
-Fender bender.

344
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,167
And he was more concerned about me
being okay than he was about his car.

345
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,378
How many people do you know
that are that understanding?

346
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:55,884
Gabe, you've got a very special person here
working for you.

347
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:57,969
That's great.

348
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,892
-Listen, do you want something to eat?
-Sure, if that would be okay.

349
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:07,395
Are you kidding me? It's no problem.
Right, Mitchell?

350
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,066
The lady would like a menu.

351
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,068
Thank you.

352
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,071
And take this back, would you?
It's absolutely ice-cold.

353
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,198
Make sure that it's decaf.

354
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,867
I was once a waitress...

355
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:23,870
and I have to say
it's very difficult to keep the coffee hot.

356
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,373
First of all, you put it into a cold cup.

357
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,875
Second, you're walking
through the air conditioning...

358
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,378
so you could just imagine, right?

359
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,588
We could all imagine.

360
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,676
I wasn't a very good waitress.

361
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,763
Come on.
I can't imagine you being bad at anything.

362
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,391
You should see her drive.

363
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,476
That's very sweet of you.

364
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,065
Have you ever tried grilled swordfish?

365
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,777
No, but I'm always into
trying something new.

366
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,282
-What was her name again? Tabby?
-Toby.

367
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,368
-You like the name?
-Try and get her number.

368
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,792
-What's this?
-My first installment.

369
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,461
You're gonna get one every month,
just like I promised.

370
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:16,589
And here's my number,
in case I forget a payment.

371
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:17,882
You can call or contact me.

372
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:21,386
$30. You don't have to do this.
My insurance is gonna cover it.

373
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:25,682
-But they'll raise your rates.
-I've been a high-risk since I was 15.

374
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,686
How much damage did I do?

375
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,063
-You don't want to know.
-I do.

376
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,191
-You don't want to know.
-I do. I feel horrible.

377
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,777
$6,300 and change.

378
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,864
Really? That much?

379
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,160
How about I just pay the change?

380
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,372
Look, all I want you to do
is stay on your side of the road...

381
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:53,460
I'll stay on my side of the road.
You know, hopefully we won't...

382
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,965
run into each other.

383
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,762
No, but you keep my number, all right?

384
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,893
I'm kind of high-risk, too.

385
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,568
Sal, come on.

386
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,158
-I gotta go.
-See you.

387
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,291
Bye. Nice meeting you.

388
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,371
I can't believe I'm this late.

389
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,668
Don't want to be late for Mommy and Daddy.

390
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:22,882
Sweetheart, I'm not keeping you
away from them.

391
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,885
I'm keeping them away from you.

392
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,977
So where is this party?

393
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,981
It's at my grandmother's house.

394
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,567
Back to Scarsdale?

395
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,487
Jesus, Sal.
I don't want to put you through that.

396
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:48,366
No, you're right.

397
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,663
I'd probably have a horrible time.

398
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:58,084
I just don't think
you'd have anything in common.

399
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,879
You'd find them terribly boring.

400
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,593
-Baby, I'm already late.
-So you'll be later.

401
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,195
Hello, operator?
I don't think this phone is working.

402
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,698
So could you call back
and check it for me? Thank you.

403
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,998
Hello? Yes, it's working fine. Thank you.

404
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,982
So you can't take one of the kittens?
I got six cats at home.

405
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:07,362
-I'm allergic, Ange. I told you.
-They got medicine for that now.

406
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,989
Tobe, you okay?

407
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,993
I've been sitting by the phone
waiting for him to call. It's pathetic.

408
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,871
-I love men.
-He's gonna call you, you'll see.

409
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:19,791
I want him to call so bad, I can taste it.

410
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,180
Dottie, you and Larry look so beautiful.

411
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,975
I just wish he was here for our anniversary.

412
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:40,770
-I don't even know where he is tonight.
-I told you not to marry a trucker.

413
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,273
{y:i}...all the luck in the world,
{y:i}and I'm happy for you....

414
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,775
Greg looks so hot in the tux.

415
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,570
I mean, he's just so hot.

416
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:51,781
He's hot.

417
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,783
{y:i}...and I'll baby-sit.

418
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:57,162
I mean, I don't look good.
No wonder he dumped me.

419
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,292
All right, tell me the truth.
Do I look that big in real life?

420
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,877
-Yes.
-No!

421
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:12,260
You don't understand, Sal.
It's my gallery. I can't be late.

422
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,973
Relax, we're 10 minutes late.
In Soho we're supposed to be late.

423
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:21,895
Late is late. I invited 550 guests.

424
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,689
The critics, the collectors....

425
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,277
I don't know how your people work.
My people pay attention to schedules.

426
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:32,072
My people! What is that?
Are we some kind of tribe?

427
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,990
Don't push me. I am not in the mood.

428
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:36,576
I want to know what you meant
by "my people."

429
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,662
-I don't have time for this.
-Make time, then.

430
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,791
Sal, do I really have to explain the obvious?

431
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,580
Hello?

432
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:25,667
Yeah. Who's this?

433
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,086
Sal, hi.

434
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,964
What are you doing?

435
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,883
Okay, listen up. This is a really good one.

436
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:38,096
"You and your lover are in bed,
and he asks you to do something kinky.

437
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:42,183
"You, A: refuse,
but continue to make love to him.

438
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:46,396
"B: start crying
and lock yourself in the bathroom.

439
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:50,775
"Or C: give it a whirl.
After all, you might like it."

440
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,571
-Angie?
-"A." Definitely "A."

441
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:58,992
I would make love to him,
but I'm not gonna do any weirdo stuff.

442
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,286
-Dottie?
-N.A.

443
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:05,165
-What's "N.A."?
-Not applicable.

444
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:16,384
-Ange, it's probably Greg.
-Yeah, right.

445
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,472
Hello?

446
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:26,561
-Oh, my God, he called her.
-Yes! There is a God.

447
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,795
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

448
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,064
You're right. This is better than Bud.

449
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:17,987
What?

450
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:24,494
I gotta tell you,
I've never seen earrings so big.

451
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,372
-You don't like them?
-No, they're fine...

452
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:30,375
just big.

453
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,461
Don't do that.
You don't have to do that for me.

454
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,171
Put them back on.

455
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:41,886
I was really surprised when you called me.
Good surprise, not bad surprise.

456
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,390
I mean, really, it was an excellent surprise.

457
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,560
You did give me your number.

458
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,271
Kind of forward?

459
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,075
I believe in letting people know
what you want.

460
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,290
Otherwise you might never get it.

461
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,888
You ever wonder
which ones are on their first dates...

462
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:29,893
or which ones are dating other people,
or who's seeing the wrong people?

463
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,479
-No.
-I do.

464
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,192
-Which do we look like?
-Us?

465
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:42,197
We look like them. First date.

466
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,366
How do you tell?

467
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,581
She's nervous, and I'm very nervous.

468
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:56,670
She's hoping that he likes her,
and I'm hoping that you like me.

469
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:02,676
And he's not sure
if he's gonna call her again...

470
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:08,181
just like you're not sure
if you're gonna call me again.

471
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,063
Let me ask you something, Toby.

472
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,358
-What do you want?
-What do I want?

473
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,488
What do you want out of life?

474
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,993
I want to look like her...

475
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,663
a city girl.

476
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,377
God, I look at them and I think,
"Where are they going?"

477
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:42,173
And then I invent things.
Like, she's probably going to a meeting...

478
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:46,177
or to a secret date,
or to some kind of conference.

479
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:49,764
Nothing ever ordinary,
like going to the A&P to pick up bleach...

480
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,059
'cause some kid threw up grape juice
all over you.

481
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,688
So that's what I want.

482
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:01,276
I want some Jersey girl
to look at me someday...

483
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,195
and say, "Where is she going?"

484
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,491
And I'll be going to a meeting.

485
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,873
Have you decided?

486
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,879
Two Venison à l'Orange.

487
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,175
-Venison à l'Orange, please.
{y:i}-Très bien.

488
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,888
That sounds good.

489
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,892
What is that?

490
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,697
So do you want to come up?

491
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:51,993
No, not tonight. It's late, and....

492
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,163
So I guess I should go in then?

493
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,086
Sal, are you ever gonna call me again?

494
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,382
You're a good kid, Toby.

495
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,177
Not that good.

496
00:41:27,195 --> 00:41:29,572
No one can say that didn't work.

497
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:38,581
No. Nobody could say that.

498
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:52,095
-Night.
-Good night.

499
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,972
Hey, Cook, it's me. How you doing?

500
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:39,392
I just got home.
I had the best time. I could not believe it.

501
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,687
I am in love with this guy. He's so great.

502
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:49,069
You did not. A fish? You sent him a fish?

503
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:53,073
Stop laughing. Yeah, I sent him
a little goldfish, with an invitation to lunch.

504
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,075
I think it's kind of cute.

505
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,660
You couldn't have given him
one of my kittens, right?

506
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,373
I wanted to give something he couldn't
throw away, like flowers or a card.

507
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,875
Yeah? You can always flush a fish.

508
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,794
I'm kidding.

509
00:43:07,295 --> 00:43:09,964
I think you forget who you're talking to.

510
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,883
All right.

511
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:14,886
I'll call you tomorrow.

512
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,687
-What is that?
-It's a fish.

513
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,564
I know it's a fish.

514
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:30,860
-But what is he doing here?
-He came with this.

515
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:46,960
Did you get enough to eat?

516
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:50,588
-'Cause I got a lot more if you're hungry.
-No, thanks.

517
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,967
I gotta tell you, you are a great dresser.

518
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:55,885
Thank you.

519
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,764
When you go shopping,
do you ever look at a price tag?

520
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:02,684
-Probably not, right?
-I look.

521
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:05,186
Get out of here. You're rich.

522
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:08,481
Rich. Yeah, I'm really rich.
Toby, I'm a kid from Queens.

523
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,066
I grew up with nothing.

524
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,068
-You're from Queens?
-Yeah, Rockaway.

525
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,863
Rockaway? I can't believe this.

526
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:19,576
How does a guy from Rockaway
get from there to here?

527
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:21,661
I worked at it.

528
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,789
Believe me, I worked at it.

529
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:31,379
I hope you don't think
that I'm dating you for your money...

530
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,883
because that's not the way it is.
That's not what I'm about.

531
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,677
So I just wanted to set that straight.

532
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:40,764
Are we dating?

533
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,185
No, we're not dating.

534
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:49,689
I mean, I could call this a date.
That would be okay with me...

535
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,191
really okay.

536
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:57,489
-So, to you, this is a date?
-Yeah, to me, this is a date.

537
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:19,969
You busy next Friday night?

538
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,682
-Are you asking me out on a date?
-Yeah.

539
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:32,273
-Are you accepting?
-Yeah.

540
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:45,578
Okay, we're all in. Here we go.

541
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:49,791
A possible straight for Fat Louie.
No help for Tommy Pickles.

542
00:45:49,874 --> 00:45:52,669
Minchia, three deuces
for the good doctor.

543
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:56,089
And ungatz for the dealer.
Minchia, I can't buy a hand.

544
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,966
-This is bad.
-I'm in.

545
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,887
Hey, Toby, where you been? I was worried.

546
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,897
-You should've called.
-I know. I forgot.

547
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,066
You know how these guys get
when they don't eat.

548
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:17,068
They turn into raving cafones.

549
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:20,697
-Fat Louie's on the verge of tears.
-I'm sorry. I was in the city.

550
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,492
You seeing that guy again?

551
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,870
When you gonna bring him by for dinner?

552
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,872
-Here?
-Yeah, here.

553
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,293
What, is he too good for Fat Louie?

554
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:36,588
-Guess where he's taking me Friday night.
-Where?

555
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:39,174
To a charity benefit for the mayor.

556
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,177
-What mayor?
-Of New York City!

557
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,387
No kidding?

558
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,182
That's real nice.

559
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:52,479
That still don't answer my question.
I mean, these are your people.

560
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:54,189
Why are you doing this to me?

561
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,399
What am I doing? I'm asking you a question.

562
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:01,279
Look, Dad, Sal is teaching me things.
He's showing me a different life.

563
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:07,577
Let me ask you something, Toby.
These kids at the daycare...

564
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,579
they show you respect?

565
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:15,585
Do you think that just anybody
can find that any place they look?

566
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:21,966
Maybe Mr. Wonderful from Manhattan
just forgot to tell you that.

567
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,972
Think about it, pretty face.

568
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,685
All right, listen up, cafones.
It's antipasto time.

569
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:36,064
So he says he wants to start up again.

570
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:40,568
-Do you believe him?
-From the waist down, she does.

571
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:44,489
Of course I believe him. I mean, I love him.

572
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:48,493
And he loves me, too. All of me.

573
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:54,165
Guys, you gotta help me.
He's taking me to a charity benefit.

574
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,085
I found the perfect dress. I'm $60 short.

575
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:59,087
A benefit?

576
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,881
Come on, I'll pay you back.
It's for charity. Cough it up.

577
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:04,759
-All right, when are we gonna meet him?
-Soon.

578
00:48:04,884 --> 00:48:08,972
What do you think of these?
Do you like them? Don't they look real?

579
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,599
-They're made of glass.
-They're really nice, Toby.

580
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,061
-You can have all my hoops, Angie.
-When are we gonna meet him?

581
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:17,981
How about Friday?
He can meet us at the Steak 'N' Brew--

582
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,692
I'm sorry, Friday night's
the night of the benefit.

583
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:22,986
Tobe, Friday is Dot's birthday.

584
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:29,367
-God, Dottie, I forgot. I'm sorry.
-It's all right. Forget about it.

585
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:33,788
-It's just that he bought these tickets.
-And he's more important than you are.

586
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:36,875
No. He bought these tickets.
What do you want me to say to him?

587
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:41,171
"No, I can't go to the charity benefit, I'm
going to the Steak 'N' Brew on Route Four."

588
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,799
-That's where we're going.
-Dottie, listen. I'm sorry, okay?

589
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:48,470
I promise, I will make it up to you, okay?
I love you, all right?

590
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:52,098
Let me see you smile. Have a kiss? Bye.

591
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,190
Excuse me, am I deaf?

592
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:03,360
Or did anybody hear her ask us
how we're doing?

593
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,783
I'm thinking, "My girl's gonna meet
the mayor of New York City...

594
00:49:09,783 --> 00:49:11,659
"so she's got to look great." Right?

595
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:14,079
I happen to be passing
this place on Passaic...

596
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,082
Rita's Fine Wear.
And I see this in the window.

597
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,585
And I think to myself,
"Dummy, buy it for her."

598
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:27,258
Open it. Go ahead. For tonight.

599
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:38,770
Do you like it?

600
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,565
Because if you don't, I'll take it back.
They'll give me my money back.

601
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:45,193
No, I love it, Pop. It's my color.

602
00:49:45,276 --> 00:49:48,863
That's what I thought.
The pink and the lace, it's you.

603
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:52,659
-You're gonna look dynamite in it.
-But you gotta go, Pop.

604
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:55,787
You gotta go now
because he's coming any minute.

605
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:58,373
This is the perfect time.
Look, I promise you.

606
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,084
"Hello, how are you?" And I'm out of here.

607
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:05,296
-He's here. I have to get ready.
-Don't worry about it.

608
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,675
Just go do what you have to do,
and I'll let him in.

609
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:13,179
-You better be good.
-Me? Of course I'll be good.

610
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,566
-I'm sorry. I'm looking for Toby Mastallone.
-She's here. Come on in.

611
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:30,488
-Bennie Mastallone, Toby's father.
-How are you doing? Sal Torme.

612
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,574
How you doing?

613
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,662
She ain't ready yet,
but you know the way women are.

614
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,373
Come on in.

615
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,462
Have a seat. Yeah, take a load off.

616
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:50,258
So you sell printing?

617
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,680
Got your own office?

618
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:00,685
You got your own secretary?

619
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:06,775
How many windows in your office?

620
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:11,279
One.

621
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:16,284
One big one.

622
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,663
What do you make a year?

623
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:24,793
Look, you don't have to tell me exactly.
Round numbers.

624
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,379
You clear six figures?

625
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,176
In that neighborhood.

626
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,388
That's a good neighborhood.

627
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,976
So, Sal, what do you say
we talk man-to-man?

628
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:48,066
I know what girls from the city are like.
When I was your age...

629
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,860
I dated a couple, myself. Nice girls.

630
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:55,365
But not like girls from around here.
You catch my drift, Sal?

631
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,079
Let me put it this way.

632
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:05,959
In this world, you got fast girls,
and you got family girls.

633
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:09,796
It's all right to go out with both.

634
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,465
But when you cross the river into Jersey...

635
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,176
it's important to know the difference.

636
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,679
Think about it, Sal.

637
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,273
Nice watch.

638
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:31,276
What did it cost you?

639
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:39,284
You look just like an angel.

640
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,162
Oh, wow! This is so beautiful.

641
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:30,085
Look, they have an orchestra.
Shall we go listen to them?

642
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,172
...is that it took 50 trees
to make this bookcase...

643
00:53:34,297 --> 00:53:37,175
which was smuggled out
of a small African country.

644
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,596
Let's go upstairs. Come on.

645
00:53:43,264 --> 00:53:45,558
It was quite exciting, actually.

646
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:48,478
A friend of mine had told me
about this little village...

647
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:51,481
where the trees were cut down
and brought in.

648
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:53,692
-Are you cold?
-No, I'm fine.

649
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:55,985
-God, it's cold in here.
-No, it's not.

650
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,780
-I feel a draft. I'm catching a cold already.
-I'm okay.

651
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,865
Wear this. I don't want you to catch a cold.

652
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:03,493
I told your dad I'd look after you,
I don't want him mad.

653
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:04,786
I'm okay.

654
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,293
Darling, what a surprise.

655
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,464
I don't think you know Kenneth.

656
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,262
-Hi.
-How you doing?

657
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,973
Kenneth is a buyer from England.

658
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:29,269
-I hope I'm more than that.
-And an old friend.

659
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:37,569
Hello, I'm Tara.

660
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:38,862
-Toby.
-I'm sorry.

661
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:45,076
-And this is....
-Kenneth, I already heard. How you doing?

662
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,169
I hope you two enjoy your evening.

663
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:57,464
-It was very nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.

664
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:08,099
Here, they already saw me.

665
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:11,686
I'm sorry.

666
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:17,484
-Who was she?
-Just somebody I know.

667
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,987
That was obvious.

668
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,992
-You want to stay?
-You tell me.

669
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:30,497
I'll take you home.

670
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:41,174
Who do you think you are?

671
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:43,385
Do you think
you're the only one walking here...

672
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:46,179
or the only one trying to get someplace?

673
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:51,059
-Talk to me! You goddamn owe me!
-Owe you? I don't owe you anything.

674
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:55,188
-Yes, you do.
-Why is that?

675
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:57,065
Because I love you.

676
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:00,694
Because you love me?

677
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:06,074
How the hell can you love me?

678
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:09,077
Like I met you. I crashed into it.

679
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:12,789
-Toby, you don't even know me.
-Who knows anybody?

680
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,875
What, is there a manual
I'm supposed to read on you?

681
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:18,962
Or can't I just figure it out as I go along?

682
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:22,382
-I wish it was that simple--
-It is that simple.

683
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:23,675
Not here!

684
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,095
-It isn't that simple here.
-I see.

685
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:31,766
I'm just some stupid Jersey girl
in some stupid dress, right?

686
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:35,061
Laugh with your friends
at what an idiot I am!

687
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,564
You're right, I am stupid.

688
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:43,570
My father bought me this dress
especially for tonight.

689
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:48,074
I had a dress. A simple, black dress.

690
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:53,163
But I thought it was more important
not to hurt his feelings...

691
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:55,290
than it was to impress you.

692
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:57,667
God, I guess I was wrong, right?

693
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:03,089
I don't know who I feel sorrier for:
you or me.

694
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:23,485
Get me out of here, okay?
I don't care where we go. Just get....

695
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,779
-What?
-I'm sorry.

696
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:20,083
Jersey feels so far away.

697
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,299
It's after 1 :00.

698
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:36,177
Are you hungry?

699
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,472
No, are you?

700
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:43,393
I'm starving.

701
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,275
-I guess I could eat if you could eat.
-Okay.

702
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:52,986
Let's get up.

703
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:59,659
No, I don't want to.
I'm very happy where I am.

704
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:02,787
-You're very happy where you are?
-Yes, I am.

705
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,497
I see.

706
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,085
Are you happy with this?

707
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,765
I'm up!

708
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:37,072
You know, Sal, I got to tell you something.
This place looks like a hotel.

709
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:41,368
I mean, it's beautiful and everything,
but there's nothing personal.

710
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:46,998
Where are your family pictures?
Where are the souvenirs from the vacations?

711
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:50,585
-There's nothing of you here.
-I love you in my shirt.

712
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,674
What about family,
your mother, your father?

713
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:58,760
Yeah, I had one of each.

714
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,097
Really, you did? We usually do.

715
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,182
Where are they?

716
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:09,479
My dad, he....

717
01:02:11,272 --> 01:02:13,692
He cut loose when I was about 10.

718
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:17,070
And a new guy took his place.

719
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,659
And I left when I was 14.

720
01:02:25,286 --> 01:02:27,497
What about your mother?
Don't you see her?

721
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:28,790
Dolores?

722
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:35,964
I last saw her about four years ago.
She was in-between husbands...

723
01:02:37,882 --> 01:02:39,968
and she needed some money.

724
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:46,766
What about you?

725
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:50,979
-What about me?
-Tell me about your parents.

726
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,982
Can we talk about your father
for just a second?

727
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,984
A little bit protective.

728
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:03,491
I think they loved each other,
but kind of in a sad way.

729
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:05,994
Sad? Why?

730
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:09,789
They always told each other
that they were lucky...

731
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,167
if a hammer didn't fall on them.

732
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:17,297
That's the most their lives were.
Nothing too awful happening.

733
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,884
And they were grateful for that.

734
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:24,888
But were they happy?

735
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,684
Yeah, very.

736
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:35,982
Then maybe that's all that matters.

737
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:52,791
-All right, I'll call you tomorrow.
-Okay.

738
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,294
-What time do you get up?
-Early.

739
01:04:06,596 --> 01:04:07,764
Go.

740
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:19,275
I forgot to tell you
how beautiful you look in that dress.

741
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:34,666
-Did you come?
-What kind of question is that to ask?

742
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:38,086
Come on, Tobe.
I never do the first time I'm with a guy.

743
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:41,297
-And Dot, she never does.
-Shut up.

744
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:45,760
-It's true.
-It doesn't have to be public knowledge.

745
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:49,681
-So when can we meet him?
-Soon.

746
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,975
So, videos tonight, right?

747
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:55,270
Dot, get a comedy.
No more of this depresso bullshit.

748
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:59,774
-You don't like my wedding video?
-Yeah, it's as funny as a heart attack.

749
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:05,363
Fluorescent satin, cloth and foil.
I need three shipments of this.

750
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:16,666
I gotta call you back.
I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

751
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,668
Rosie, hold all my calls.

752
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,381
I don't have a white flag,
but will white lace do?

753
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:29,471
What, are you slumming again?
Or are you just bored with your people?

754
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,765
You're still mad.

755
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,773
Technically, I'm the one who should be mad.

756
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:42,692
I started a fight, you started an affair.

757
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,780
What is she? A girl
from the old neighborhood or something?

758
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,574
Or something.
You want to explain Kenneth?

759
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:54,662
Kenneth is a buyer from England
who likes ballet and boys.

760
01:05:55,997 --> 01:05:58,583
But I'm happy to see you were jealous.

761
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,090
What's this?

762
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,385
That's Carlos.

763
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,889
It's cute, but it's not very you.

764
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:26,194
Rosie, could you please
find a home for this?

765
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:30,198
-I'll take it. I need a pet.
-Thank you.

766
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,583
I understand distractions, Sal.

767
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:46,089
Until I met you,
that's all the men in my life were to me.

768
01:06:48,383 --> 01:06:51,261
So I forgive you for what's-her-name.

769
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,888
-Tony.
-Toby.

770
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,059
Toby, yes.
It's really a hard name to remember.

771
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:03,189
I don't want you to remember it.
And I don't want to remember it.

772
01:07:07,986 --> 01:07:10,864
You are so past something like her now.

773
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,159
Don't go backwards.

774
01:07:19,497 --> 01:07:23,793
{y:i}I know where you've come from,
{y:i}and I know where you wanna go.

775
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:28,465
{y:i}And I can help you get there.

776
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:35,472
{y:i}I love you, Sal.

777
01:07:50,987 --> 01:07:53,198
The door's open. Come on in.

778
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:04,876
Oh, my God, Sal. Hi.

779
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,962
How you doing? What are you doing here?

780
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,299
This is such a great surprise.
You want something to eat?

781
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:13,885
-I'll get you something to drink.
-No.

782
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:19,391
So what are you doing here?

783
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:23,395
Listen, Toby, we gotta talk about something.

784
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:34,989
Can you believe she won't let us meet him?

785
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:39,160
I know. What does she think we'll do?
Lift our legs and pee on him?

786
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:43,665
I don't know how to say this to you.

787
01:08:44,874 --> 01:08:46,292
Just say it.

788
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:57,679
We can't see each other anymore.

789
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:06,187
-Why not?
-'Cause I need something different.

790
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,982
"Something"? What's "something"?

791
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,484
Toby, we come from different worlds.

792
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,571
What, Queens and Jersey are so different?
What's so different?

793
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:17,991
You gotta understand.
I can't go backwards. I can't.

794
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,785
I worked too hard to get where I am.

795
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,080
And I'm gonna hold you back? Is that it?

796
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,585
She's in here.

797
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:33,965
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

798
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,888
-Sal, these are my....
-Friends.

799
01:09:40,972 --> 01:09:45,185
"Friends" is the word she was looking for.
We're her Jersey friends.

800
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:48,480
You know Jersey,
where the little people live?

801
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:53,276
-Toby, I think I better go.
-No, Sal, you stay. They are going.

802
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:56,363
Outside now. Cookie, right now!

803
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:17,384
-What were you doing up there?
-I don't like him, okay?

804
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,469
How do you know?
You don't even know him.

805
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,180
No, but I know you,
and you are no longer you.

806
01:10:22,263 --> 01:10:24,099
What is that supposed to mean?

807
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:28,186
That means, "I drink Corona now.
Hoops are out, diamonds are in."

808
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:30,689
Does that sound stupidly familiar?

809
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:33,358
Tell her what it means, Ange!

810
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:46,579
It means that if we didn't know you before,
we probably wouldn't like you now.

811
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,375
Why? Because I don't hang out
at the diner? Is that why?

812
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:54,462
It's because you look down on us, like
the city girls do. You're not from New York.

813
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:56,965
You're just a Jersey girl
trying to act like she's not.

814
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,676
Fine! Stay in your halter-tops!

815
01:10:59,968 --> 01:11:03,096
And your purple eye shadow,
and your pink nails!

816
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:06,182
Stay in Jersey, because I don't give a fuck!

817
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,382
-Don't you like being with me?
-Yes.

818
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:45,597
-Oh, God.
-Don't you like kissing me?

819
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:48,767
I love kissing you.

820
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:56,566
-I can't do this.
-Do what?

821
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,988
Toby, I don't wanna hurt you.

822
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,991
You know, I never wanted to hurt you.

823
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:12,290
-I just need more.
-But I can give you more.

824
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,959
Yeah, but I can't.

825
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,380
You understand?

826
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:21,966
I know where you are, I do.

827
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:26,471
I'm just not there anymore.

828
01:12:35,897 --> 01:12:37,065
Don't.

829
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:50,370
God.

830
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:07,971
You owe more.

831
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:11,683
-Get out of here. You ate half my food.
-You ordered it.

832
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,777
Can I get a cheeseburger
and French fries to go, please?

833
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:26,281
We are not talking to her
unless she talks to us first.

834
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,078
What's the matter?
He doesn't feed you caviar for dinner?

835
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,664
Doesn't that make you guys happy?

836
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:37,667
-What, did he blow you off?
-Yeah, he did.

837
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,963
Why don't you buy yourselves
some balloons, pop open the champagne?

838
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,883
Why don't you guys
throw yourselves a party?

839
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:47,260
-What happened?
-Nothing happened.

840
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:50,263
I'm shit, okay?

841
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:54,976
And I was stupid enough to forget it
for one second!

842
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:02,692
He blew her off. I knew he would.

843
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:07,697
It's good for her.
It'll cool her jets for a while.

844
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,867
-Listen to yourself.
-What?

845
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:13,370
You disgust me, you really do.

846
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:17,582
You sit there, with your hair
and your legs and your shiny lips...

847
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:20,460
and you're either giving out orders
or passing judgments...

848
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:24,172
on anyone who can't live up
to the great Cookie's standards.

849
01:14:24,297 --> 01:14:26,883
Look at us. What's so great about us?

850
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:32,889
We're not beautiful. We're not rich.
We're not too incredibly special.

851
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:37,060
We're just girls. But we're friends.

852
01:14:37,977 --> 01:14:39,896
You know what I'm saying?

853
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:44,859
We have nothing, and less than nothing,
if we don't have loyalty.

854
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:51,783
Excuse me. Move.

855
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,293
Gabe, this is a Heidelberg Press.

856
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:04,671
It's the fastest printing press in the world.

857
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:08,466
You give me the artwork tomorrow,
and I'll have the separations the day after.

858
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:09,884
-You're kidding.
-I'm not.

859
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:12,971
I'm talking about Wednesday,
Thursday of next week.

860
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:15,390
It will be in the magazines by Friday.

861
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:16,683
Hey, you!

862
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:21,771
Mr. Big Shot. That's right,
I'm talking to you.

863
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,193
You think you are so cool, don't you?
Let me tell you something, Sal.

864
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,695
When you gave up Toby...

865
01:15:28,778 --> 01:15:32,282
you gave up the best girl
you ever had the chance to meet in your life.

866
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,993
-Get your hands off me!
-Jimmy, get them out of here.

867
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:38,371
And that's why guys like you
are so goddamn ordinary!

868
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,498
-Jimmy, get them out!
-Out.

869
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:42,667
Come on, the bunch of you.

870
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:49,799
Sal, what was that? What is this?

871
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:52,469
What?

872
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,765
I'm sorry, Gabe.

873
01:15:58,683 --> 01:15:59,976
Excuse me.

874
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:02,187
A little misunderstanding.

875
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:05,273
-Let me show you the rest of the plant.
-Who was that redhead?

876
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:06,399
You like her, too?

877
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:16,868
Right.

878
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:23,792
Wait a minute. That's my fish!

879
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:26,461
Where are you going? Come back here!

880
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,880
-She's got the fish.
-Oh, my God!

881
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,593
-Keep it down.
-Where's the elevator?

882
01:16:33,677 --> 01:16:36,179
You guys, we're gonna get arrested.

883
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:39,265
Here it is! Come on!

884
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:46,898
There you are.

885
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,568
Playing hide-and-seek?

886
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:55,699
Let me give you a little piece of advice.

887
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,368
Don't risk this for an easy lay.

888
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,459
I saw you at the benefit.

889
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:10,672
You take such girls to a hotel.
You don't take them to meet the mayor.

890
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,174
Back off, Mitch. I like that girl.

891
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:17,679
Relax, okay? Take it easy.

892
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,390
Gabe likes her, too. He likes her a lot.

893
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:23,393
He wants to know if you're done,
so he can have a crack at her.

894
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:27,272
You know what?
Toby may not have a lot of style...

895
01:17:27,772 --> 01:17:31,359
but she's got more class
than you and Gabe put together.

896
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:34,863
Where you going?

897
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:38,366
Sal, we're not through here.

898
01:17:42,787 --> 01:17:44,080
What are you doing?

899
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:47,667
What am I doing? I'm out of here.
That's what I'm doing.

900
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:51,463
Okay, so fine. So you like the girl.

901
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:54,299
I like the girl.

902
01:17:54,674 --> 01:17:58,094
Gabe likes her. We all like her.
She's a likable girl.

903
01:18:01,264 --> 01:18:04,976
Now you listen to me, goddamn it.
I watched you. I groomed you.

904
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,063
I taught you which fork to use,
how to tie your tie.

905
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:10,398
I showed you how to make money.

906
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:12,776
You listen to me.

907
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:18,865
I showed you.
I invested myself, you hear me?

908
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:21,576
Yeah, you groomed me?
Is that what you said?

909
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:25,372
You groomed me? You did a hell of a job.
You taught me how to steal accounts.

910
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:28,583
You taught me how to pimp for clients,
anything to close a deal.

911
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:31,294
The real world too much for you, Sal?

912
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:35,465
Neither one of us could spell "real"...

913
01:18:37,592 --> 01:18:39,678
even with a gun up our ass.

914
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:50,480
You leave now, Sal, you end up
back on the street where I found you.

915
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:53,483
You know what? I'd rather be in the street.

916
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,960
These potatoes are real?

917
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:15,880
The box was real. How's that?

918
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:25,682
I don't think I ever told you this...

919
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:30,186
but your mama and l
wanted to have a whole bunch of kids.

920
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:35,191
But when only you came...

921
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:40,697
it was okay,
because we thought you were perfect.

922
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:43,658
I ain't saying that 'cause I'm your father.

923
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:47,162
If you were a stranger
who I met at the hockey game...

924
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:53,168
and I saw how pretty and sensitive you are...

925
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:58,381
I would think,
"This girl is a perfect living miracle."

926
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:06,389
And if this Sal guy doesn't think so,
then he's a loser.

927
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:10,977
And he needs glasses.

928
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:18,568
-I love you, Pop.
-Yeah, I love you, too.

929
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:22,072
So let's eat.

930
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:26,493
What do you think?

931
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:38,088
Maybe I should have cooked the box.

932
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:23,258
Come on, all right?

933
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:08,178
Bennie, have you seen Toby today?

934
01:22:10,388 --> 01:22:11,973
She left already.

935
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:15,268
Do you know where she went?

936
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,772
No, nothing's wrong.

937
01:22:19,898 --> 01:22:21,858
Listen, will you do me a favor?

938
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:25,987
If you see her, will you tell her
that me and the girls are looking for her?

939
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:14,994
Here she comes.

940
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,672
Okay, I'm a jerk.

941
01:23:26,297 --> 01:23:28,758
I'm probably gonna be a jerk again, right?

942
01:23:28,883 --> 01:23:31,386
But I'm good with kids.

943
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:36,599
I'm a great tipper,
you guys know that about me.

944
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:39,769
And I'm generally a good friend.

945
01:23:41,187 --> 01:23:43,565
So what do you say? How about it?

946
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:48,862
Come on, guys, are you listening to me?

947
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:52,365
Oh, God!

948
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:56,578
-You should've been there.
-It was beautiful.

949
01:23:56,661 --> 01:23:59,664
-We nailed him in front of God, everybody.
-It was great.

950
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:02,292
You guys stole the fish.

951
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,585
-Dottie stole it.
-I stole it.

952
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:07,881
-She kicked ass. Cookie kicked ass.
-I would expect nothing less.

953
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:20,894
Are you out of your mind?

954
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:24,773
This is absolutely wrong.
Can't you see that?

955
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:29,069
These two pieces cannot possibly
be hung on the same wall.

956
01:24:44,584 --> 01:24:48,672
-Don't you think I'm right?
-About this? Yeah.

957
01:24:54,886 --> 01:24:56,262
About us...

958
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:00,266
no.

959
01:25:06,189 --> 01:25:08,274
What are you talking about?

960
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:18,284
You see, Tara, you and me,
we're like these two paintings here.

961
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:22,497
We shouldn't be hung on the same wall.

962
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:35,093
She'll never fit in.

963
01:25:36,177 --> 01:25:38,263
I don't want her to fit in.

964
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:49,983
"And the handsome Prince
fought the evil dragon in a mighty battle...

965
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:53,486
"and saved the beautiful maiden
from sure death.

966
01:25:53,778 --> 01:25:57,782
"'I love you, fair maiden,' said the Prince.
'Will you marry me?'

967
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:01,870
"'I love you, too,' said the maiden.
'And I will marry you."'

968
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,581
But not until after I finish law school.

969
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:08,793
-Is that really what it says?
-That's what it should say.

970
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:12,797
Okay, it's nap time.
We all gotta get to our mats, okay?

971
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:14,591
Who's that?

972
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:28,188
Okay, I want you guys to be good.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

973
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:31,775
Outside.

974
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:43,661
What are you doing here?

975
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,083
I want my fish back.

976
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:54,381
I want you back.

977
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,258
I don't want you back.

978
01:26:58,593 --> 01:27:00,178
I love you, Toby.

979
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,889
You do?

980
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:08,687
Take a look, Sal, 'cause this is it.
This is me.

981
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,482
And I like who I am.

982
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:15,985
And I don't want to change it for you
or for anyone.

983
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:18,571
And I don't want you to change.

984
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:21,199
Lie to me, Sal, but don't lie to yourself.

985
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:23,493
You'd run over me
and every kid in this school...

986
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:25,995
to save a dent in your stupid car.

987
01:27:27,163 --> 01:27:29,791
Is that what you really think of me?

988
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:35,171
I know where you're at, Sal.
And I'm just not there anymore.

989
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:43,596
All the boys are being crazy,
and they won't let me sleep.

990
01:27:46,182 --> 01:27:47,559
I gotta go.

991
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:06,197
So I guess you're gonna need a ride.

992
01:30:11,494 --> 01:30:13,079
Yeah, maybe I do.

993
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:16,082
So call a cab.

994
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:19,586
You know I would, except that I hear...

995
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:24,174
that cabs in Jersey take four, five times
longer than they say they're gonna take.

996
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:28,094
Seems like it's a really big problem
they have here in Jersey.

997
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:32,474
You got another big problem here in Jersey.

998
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:37,270
-What's that?
-Me.

999
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:59,793
-And you call me a bad driver?
-No, wait, I did that on purpose.

1000
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:03,380
On purpose? What is that, a male thing?

1001
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:05,382
You could have just brought flowers.

1002
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:08,259
Hey, who let these animals out of the zoo?
