1
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,897
<i>Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

2
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:30,239
<i>What a glorious feelin'
We're happy again</i>

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,323
<i>We'll walk down the lane</i>

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,322
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

5
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>And singin'
Just singin' in the rain</i>

6
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>This is Dora Bailey,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

7
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,731
<i>talking to you from the front of
the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.</i>

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,272
<i>What a night, ladies and
gentlemen. What a night!</i>

9
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,905
Every star in Hollywood is here to
make Monumental Pictures' premiere...

10
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,993
of <i>The Royal Rascal</i>,
the outstanding event of 1927.

11
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,071
Everyone is
breathlessly awaiting...

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,721
the arrival of Lina Lamont
and Don Lockwood.

13
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,119
Look who's arriving now.

14
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,963
It's that famous "zip"
girl of the screen...

15
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,207
the darling of the flapper set...

16
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,425
Zelda Zanders!

17
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,263
Zelda! Zelda!

18
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,760
Her new red-hot pash,
J. Cumberland Spendrill III...

19
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,013
that well-known eligible bachelor.

20
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:31,394
Zelda's had so much unhappiness,
I hope this time it's really love.

21
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,489
And here comes that
exotic star, Olga Mara!

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,699
Ooh.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,622
And her new husband,
the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon.

24
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,460
They've been married two months already,
but still as happy as newlyweds.

25
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,624
Well, well, well. It's Cosmo Brown!

26
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,265
Cosmo is Don's best friend.

27
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,805
He plays the piano on the
set for Don and Lina...

28
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,521
to get them into those
romantic moods!

29
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,932
Oh, folks, this is it. This is it!

30
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,319
The stars of tonight's picture,
those romantic lovers of the screen...

31
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,163
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont!

32
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,586
Ladies and gentlemen, when you
look at this gorgeous couple...

33
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,335
it's no wonder they're a household
name all over the world.

34
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,671
Like "bacon and eggs."

35
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,174
"Lockwood and Lamont."

36
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,894
Don, tell me confidentially,
are these rumors true...

37
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,724
that wedding bells are soon
to ring for you and Lina?

38
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,067
Lina and I have no statement
to make at the present time.

39
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,521
We're just good friends.

40
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:01,734
You've come a long way together.
Won't you tell us how it happened?

41
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,201
Lina and I have made a number
of pictures together...

42
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,828
Oh, no, no, Don. I want your
story from the beginning.

43
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,998
Dora, not in front
of all these people!

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,208
The story of your success
is an inspiration...

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,711
to young people all over the world.

46
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,344
Please!

47
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,515
Well, to begin with,
any story of my career...

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
would have to include my
lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown.

49
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,566
We were kids together, grew
up together, worked together.

50
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,768
Yes?

51
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,529
Well, Dora, I've had one motto
which I've always lived by:

52
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,073
"Dignity. Always dignity."

53
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,912
This was instilled in me by Mum
and Dad from the very beginning.

54
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,411
They sent me to the finest
schools, including dancing school.

55
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,747
That's where I first met Cosmo.

56
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,252
And with him, I used to perform for
Mum and Dad's society friends.

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,599
<i>They used to make
such a fuss over me.</i>

58
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:16,601
<i>If I was very good, I was allowed to
accompany Mum and Dad to the theater.</i>

59
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,852
<i>They brought me up on Shaw...</i>

60
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,901
<i>Moli√®re, the finest
of the classics.</i>

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,284
To this was added rigorous
musical training...

62
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,657
at the Conservatory of Fine Arts.

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,330
<i>We rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy.</i>

64
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,379
<i>And at all times...</i>

65
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,297
<i>the motto remained...</i>

66
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>"...Dignity."</i>

67
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,009
<i>"Always dignity."</i>

68
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:53,054
<i>In a few years, we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour.</i>

69
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,395
<i>We played the finest symphonic
halls in the country.</i>

70
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

71
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,736
<i>I can jump over
The moon up above</i>

72
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,531
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

73
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,906
<i>Haven't a worry
Haven't a care</i>

74
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,371
<i>Feelin' like a feather
That's floatin' on air</i>

75
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,324
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

76
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,667
<i>Soon the church bells will be ringin'
And a march with Ma and Pa</i>

77
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>How the church bells
will be ringin'</i>

78
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,626
<i>With a hey-nonny-nonny
And a hot-cha-cha</i>

79
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,677
<i>Hi diddle diddle
My baby's okay</i>

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,218
<i>Ask me a riddle
I'm happy to say</i>

81
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,175
<i>Fit as a fiddle
And ready for love</i>

82
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,868
<i>Audiences everywhere adored us.</i>

83
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,070
Get out of here!

84
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,617
<i>Finally we decided to
come to sunny California.</i>

85
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,162
<i>We were stranded... We were
staying here, resting up...</i>

86
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,507
<i>when offers from the movie
studios started pouring in.</i>

87
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:50,128
<i>We sorted them out and decided
to favor Monumental Pictures.</i>

88
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,013
Lina, you hate him. Resist him.
Keep that mood music going.

89
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:56,513
Now, Phil, you come in.
Keep on grinding.

90
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:01,310
Now you see her. Now here's the bit,
Bert, where you get it on the jaw.

91
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,183
Cut!

92
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,310
No, no! That wasn't right!

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,861
You were supposed to go over the bar and
crash into the glasses! Try it again!

94
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,941
Okay, Bert? Bert!

95
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, that's swell, just swell.

96
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,412
Take him away, fellas!

97
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:20,334
You'll be all right. We've lost
more stuntmen on these pictures...

98
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,419
It'll take hours to get a new
one from Central Casting.

99
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,622
Mr. Dexter, I can do that.

100
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,625
- You? You're a musician.
- That's a moot point.

101
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,631
No kidding! What's your name?

102
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,471
Don Lockwood, but the
fellas call me "Donald."

103
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,387
Wise guy, huh? Okay. I'll try you.

104
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,475
Get this guy into Bert's suit!

105
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:43,273
And remember, Lockwood, you might
be trading that fiddle in for a harp.

106
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,567
Camera!

107
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,321
Phil, come in. Now you
see him. That's it.

108
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,032
Now, here's where you
get it right on the jaw.

109
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,027
Cut!

110
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,704
That was wonderful!

111
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,617
Got any more little
chores you want done?

112
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,992
Plenty!

113
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,624
Okay.

114
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,529
<i>My roles in these
films were urbane...</i>

115
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,073
<i>sophisticated...</i>

116
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,275
<i>suave.</i>

117
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,035
And of course, all through
those pictures...

118
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,708
Lina was, as always,
an inspiration to me.

119
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,661
Warm and helpful.

120
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,663
A real lady.

121
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,050
Hello, Miss Lamont. I'm Don
Lockwood, the stuntman.

122
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,800
It was a thrill working
with you, Miss Lamont.

123
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,267
Hey, Don.

124
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,388
Meet the producer of the
picture, R.F. Simpson.

125
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,396
I just saw some rushes and asked
Dexter who the stuntmen were.

126
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,863
He said they were all you. I'm putting
you and Lina together in a picture.

127
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,483
Come to my office.
We'll discuss a contract.

128
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,485
Thanks, Mr. Simpson!

129
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,417
Are you doing anything
tonight, Miss Lamont?

130
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,544
That's funny.

131
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,088
I'm busy.

132
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,427
<i>Lina and I have had the same
wonderful relationship ever since.</i>

133
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:43,602
But most important of all,
I continue living up to my motto:

134
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,261
"Dignity.

135
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,680
Always dignity."

136
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,266
Thank you, Don.

137
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:55,022
And I'm sure you and Lina will continue
making movie history tonight...

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:11:00,027
in your greatest picture,
<i>The Royal Rascal.</i>

139
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,164
Get enough, boys?

140
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,286
She's so refined...

141
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,873
I think I'll kill myself.

142
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:30,208
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

143
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,375
We're thrilled at your
response to <i>The Royal Rascal.</i>

144
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,922
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

145
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:47,138
We screen actors aren't much
good at speaking in public.

146
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,727
So we'll just act out our thanks.

147
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,324
- Hot diggity! It's a smash!
- Don, Lina, you were gorgeous!

148
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,709
Lina, you looked pretty
good for a girl.

149
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,362
For heaven's sake!
What's the big idea?

150
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:11,537
Can't a girl get a word in edgewise?
They're my public too!

151
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,284
The publicity department...

152
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,129
thought it'd be better if Don made
all the speeches for the team.

153
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,331
Why?

154
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,668
You're beautiful. Audiences
think you got a voice to match.

155
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,755
We gotta keep our stars from
looking ridiculous at any cost.

156
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,445
- No one's got that much money.
- What's wrong with the way I talk?

157
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,877
What's the big idea?
Am I dumb or something?

158
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,648
No, it's just that Don's had
so much more experience...

159
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,360
Next time, write me out
a speech. I could memorize it.

160
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,776
Sure. Why don't you recite
the Gettysburg Address?

161
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,531
What do you know about it,
you piano player? Are you anybody?

162
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,998
Donnie, how can you let him talk
to me like that, your fianc√©e?

163
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,578
My fia...

164
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,412
Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.

165
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,836
Look, you shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

166
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,213
that Dora Bailey dishes out.

167
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,422
Now, try to get this straight:
There is nothing between us.

168
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,221
There has never been
anything between us.

169
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,678
- Just air.
- Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.

170
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,851
We'll be late for R.F.'s party.

171
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:19,727
Better go in separate cars to break
up the mobs. Come on, honey.

172
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,687
Ta-ta, Donnie! See you there!

173
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,981
"Donnie."

174
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,824
Can't that girl take a gentle hint?

175
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,325
Haven't you heard? She's
irresistible. She told me so.

176
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,871
I can't get her out of my hair.
This romance for publicity...

177
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,585
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.

178
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,628
The little heartaches go with it.

179
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,629
Look at me. I got no glory.
I got no fame. I got no mansions.

180
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,377
I got no money. But I've got...

181
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,055
- What have I got?
- I don't know.

182
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,885
I gotta get out of here.

183
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,859
Don't tell me. It's a flat tire.

184
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,275
This car hasn't given me
trouble in nearly six hours.

185
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,152
Hey, there's Don Lockwood!

186
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,283
Hey, give me an autograph!

187
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,904
- Give me your autograph!
- I want a souvenir!

188
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,781
I want a souvenir too!

189
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,376
Hey! You're playing rough here!
You're tearing my...!

190
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,458
Hey, Cos, do something!
Call me a cab!

191
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,788
You're a cab.

192
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,878
Thanks a lot!

193
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,890
- Lady, keep driving.
- Get out!

194
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,817
- Everything's all right!
- I'll call a policeman!

195
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,734
- Just a few blocks.
- Don't hurt me!

196
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:48,155
- I'm not a criminal.
- I don't care...

197
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,992
You are a criminal! I've seen
that face. You're a gangster!

198
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,579
I've seen your picture in the
paper or in the post office.

199
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,827
Officer!

200
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,956
- This man jumped in my car and...
- Why, it's Don Lockwood!

201
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,921
- Don Lockwood?
- How are you? Out for a joy ride?

202
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,463
Just a lift. My car broke down.
I got surrounded by...

203
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,336
- You're a lucky lady. Anything wrong?
- Why, no.

204
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,467
No, I should think not. Good night.

205
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,340
Good night, officer.

206
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,763
Well, thanks for saving
my life. I'll get out now.

207
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,938
I'm driving to Beverly Hills.
Can I drop you someplace?

208
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:27,646
I'd like to get out of this suit if
you're going by Camden and Sunset.

209
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,275
Yes, I am.

210
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,329
I'd like to know whose
hospitality I'm enjoying.

211
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,322
Selden. Kathy Selden.

212
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,540
Enchanted, Miss Selden.

213
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,667
I'm sorry I frightened you.

214
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,122
I was getting a little too
much love from my fans.

215
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,046
Oh, that's what you
were running away from.

216
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,261
They did that to you?
That's terrible!

217
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,592
Yes. Yes, it is, isn't it?

218
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,344
It is terrible.

219
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,805
Well, we movie stars
get the glory...

220
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,643
I guess we have to take the little
heartaches that go with it.

221
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,068
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...

222
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,156
but we're really lonely.

223
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,697
Terribly lonely.

224
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,496
I really can't tell you how sorry
I am about taking you for a criminal.

225
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,794
But it was understandable, under the
circumstances. I knew I'd seen you.

226
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,462
Which of my pictures have you seen?

227
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,755
I don't remember.

228
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,750
I saw one once.

229
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,295
- You saw one once?
- I think you were dueling.

230
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,513
And there was a girl. Lina Lamont.

231
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,554
I don't go to the movies much.

232
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,853
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

233
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,013
Thank you.

234
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,435
No offense.

235
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,775
Movies are entertaining
for the masses...

236
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,066
but the personalities on the
screen don't impress me.

237
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:54,942
They don't talk or act.
They just make a lot of dumb show.

238
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,613
Well, you know.

239
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,361
Like that.

240
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,072
You mean, like what I do.

241
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,166
Well, yes.

242
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,328
Here we are, Sunset and Camden.

243
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,586
Wait, you mean I'm not an actor?

244
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,260
- Pantomime isn't acting?
- Of course not.

245
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,013
Acting means great parts,
wonderful lines, glorious words.

246
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,431
Shakespeare. Ibsen.

247
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,550
What's your lofty
mission in life...

248
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,101
that lets you sneer at
my humble profession?

249
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,056
I'm an actress. On the stage.

250
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,811
Oh, on the stage.

251
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,436
I'd like to see you.
What're you in now?

252
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,905
I could brush up on my English
or bring an interpreter.

253
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,987
That's if they'd let
in a movie actor.

254
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,075
I'm not in a play now.
But I'm going to New York...

255
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:44,657
You're going to New York, and someday
we'll all hear of you, won't we?

256
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,244
Kathy Selden as Juliet,
as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear!

257
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,871
You'll have to wear a beard!

258
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,590
Laugh if you want, but the stage
is a dignified profession.

259
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,714
Why are you so conceited?

260
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,010
You're nothing but a shadow on film.
You're not flesh and blood.

261
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,637
- Stop!
- What can I do? I'm only a shadow.

262
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,767
Keep away from me! Just because
you're a big movie star...

263
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,731
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet. Don't touch me!

264
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,436
Fear not, sweet lady.
I will not molest you.

265
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,658
I am but a humble jester. And you?
You are too far above me.

266
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,947
Farewell, Ethel Barrymore.

267
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,288
I must tear myself from your side.

268
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,258
Is this R.F. Simpson's house?
I'm one of the Coconut Grove girls.

269
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,725
- Yes, the floor show. Around the back.
- Oh, I see. Thank you.

270
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,285
- Nice little party, R.F.
- Thanks, Roscoe.

271
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,538
Do you really think you
can get me in the movies?

272
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,789
- I should think so.
- Really?

273
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,670
- The picture's great.
- There's Don. I loved the picture.

274
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,339
- Did you come by way of Australia?
- Hello, Cos. Excuse me.

275
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,468
Cos, tell me the truth.
Am I a good actor?

276
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,345
As long as I work for Monumental,
you're the greatest.

277
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,931
No kidding. You're my pal.
You can tell me.

278
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,354
What's the matter?
Of course, you're good.

279
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,313
Keep telling me from time
to time. I feel a little shaken.

280
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,064
- The new Don Lockwood.
- Don!

281
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,863
- Hi, R.F.
- It's colossal. Where have you been?

282
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,745
There you are. Where were you?
I was lonely.

283
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,947
Hello, Lina.

284
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,699
Okay, fellas. Hold it.

285
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,626
Together again, my two
little stars, Don and Lina.

286
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,046
No kidding, folks,
aren't they great?

287
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,463
All right, open that screen.

288
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,803
- A movie? We just saw one.
- Gotta show one at a party. It's a law.

289
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,724
Everybody, I've got a
few surprises for you.

290
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,098
All right, sit down, sit down.

291
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,933
This'll make you laugh.

292
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,521
There's a madman coming into
my office for months, and...

293
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,568
- You got that gadget working?
- All set.

294
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,646
Okay, let her go.

295
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,036
<i>Hello.</i>

296
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>This is a demonstration
of a talking picture.</i>

297
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,254
<i>Notice, it is a picture
of me and I am talking.</i>

298
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,631
<i>Note how my lips and the
sound issuing from them...</i>

299
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,304
<i>are synchronized together...</i>

300
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,299
<i>in perfect unison.</i>

301
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,059
- Who's that?
- Somebody's talking behind that screen.

302
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,639
Come out from behind
that screen, Mr. Simpson.

303
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,523
Oh, no. I'm right here.

304
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,068
<i>My voice has been
recorded on a record.</i>

305
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,357
<i>A talking picture.</i>

306
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,405
<i>Thank you.</i>

307
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,777
<i>Goodbye.</i>

308
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,407
Well?

309
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,498
- It's just a toy.
- It's a scream!

310
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,709
- It's vulgar.
- You think they'll ever use it?

311
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,924
I doubt it. Warners is making a
picture with it, <i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

312
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,426
- They'll lose their shirts.
- It'll never amount to a thing.

313
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,427
They said that about the
horseless carriage.

314
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,804
Let's get on with the show.
Okay, boys.

315
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,053
Come on, my little starlets.

316
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,812
I have a surprise.
A very special cake.

317
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,688
I want you kiddies to
have the first piece.

318
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,159
Well! If it isn't Ethel Barrymore!

319
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:59,120
I do hope you'll favor us with something
special. Say, Hamlet's soliloquy...

320
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,457
or a scene from Romeo
and Juliet? Don't be shy.

321
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,586
You make about the prettiest
Juliet I've ever seen. Really.

322
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,347
<i>All I do is dream of you
The whole night through</i>

323
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,562
<i>With the dawn I still go on
Dreaming of you</i>

324
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,974
<i>You're every thought
You're everything</i>

325
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,646
<i>You're every song I ever sing</i>

326
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:25,567
<i>Summer, winter, autumn and spring</i>

327
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,571
<i>And were there more than
Twenty-four hours a day</i>

328
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,495
<i>They'd be spent in sweet content
Dreaming away</i>

329
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,872
<i>When skies are gray
When skies are blue</i>

330
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,871
<i>Morning, noon and nighttime too</i>

331
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:42,080
<i>All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you</i>

332
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,902
<i>It's the cat's meow!</i>

333
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,285
<i>All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you</i>

334
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,038
- I had to tell you how good you were.
- Excuse me.

335
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,705
Now that I know where you live,
I'd like to see you home.

336
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,420
- Listen, Mr. Lockwood...
- Say, who is this dame anyway?

337
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,464
Someone lofty and far above us all.

338
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:31,045
She couldn't learn anything from
the movies. She's a stage actress.

339
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,424
Here's one thing I've
learned from the movies!

340
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,479
- I'll kill her!
- Lina, she was aiming at me!

341
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,225
- You never looked lovelier.
- It was an accident.

342
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,522
It happens to me five
or six times a day.

343
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,020
Where is she?

344
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,946
Donnie?

345
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,035
Excuse me. Where'd Miss Selden go?

346
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,827
She grabbed her things and
bolted. Anything I can do?

347
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,700
Sorry. I don't have
time to find out.

348
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,954
Kathy!

349
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,460
Hey, Kathy!

350
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,797
Hey!

351
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,871
Keep that action going.
More steam in the kettle!

352
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,286
More action, boys.
A little more rhythm.

353
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,250
More steam and more water.

354
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,248
- Hi, Maxie.
- Hi, Don.

355
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,164
- Good morning, fellas.
- Hiya, Don.

356
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,132
Did you read Variety today?

357
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,088
"First talking picture, The Jazz Singer.
All-time smash end of first week."

358
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,265
- All-time flop end of the second.
- We start today.

359
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,599
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

360
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,436
I'm now Count Pierre de Bataille,
known as the Duelling Cavalier.

361
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,273
- What's it about?
- It's a French Revolution story.

362
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,233
You're a French aristocrat.

363
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,896
She's a simple girl of the people
and won't even give you a tumble.

364
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,947
Well, it's a living.

365
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,032
Good morning.

366
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,785
Keep the background moving.
Hit him.

367
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,368
Come on. Knock him down!

368
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:23,119
Get up there and hit
him again. Hurry up!

369
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,665
Why bother to shoot this? Release
the old one under a new title.

370
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,212
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

371
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,541
- Why'd you say that?
- What's the matter?

372
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,547
That's what that Kathy Selden
said to me that night.

373
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,925
That's three weeks ago.
You still thinking about that?

374
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,801
- I can't get her out of my mind.
- How could you?

375
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,270
She's the first dame who hasn't
fallen for you since you were 4.

376
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,897
She's on my conscience.

377
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,980
It's not your fault
she lost her job.

378
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:51,480
- I've got to find her.
- You've been trying to.

379
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,983
Short of sending out
bloodhounds and a posse.

380
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,776
Come on, now. Snap out of it.

381
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,782
You can't let this get you down.

382
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,409
You're Donald Lockwood. Donald
Lockwood's an actor, isn't he?

383
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,488
What's the first thing
an actor learns?

384
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,828
"The show must go on, come rain,
come shine, come snow, come sleet!"

385
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,003
Yeah.

386
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,335
<i>The world's so full
Of a number of things</i>

387
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,929
<i>I'm sure we should all
Be as happy as...</i>

388
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,673
<i>But are we? No</i>

389
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,923
<i>Definitely, no</i>

390
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,635
<i>Positively, no
Decidedly, no</i>

391
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,477
<i>Short people have long faces</i>

392
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,521
<i>Long people have short faces</i>

393
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,695
<i>Big people have little humor
Little people have no humor at all</i>

394
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:39,237
<i>In the words of that immortal bard
Samuel J. Snodgrass</i>

395
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,819
<i>As he was being led
To the guillotine</i>

396
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,698
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

397
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,625
<i>Don't you know everyone
wants to laugh, ha, ha</i>

398
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,037
<i>My dad said, "Be an actor, my son".</i>

399
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,710
<i>"But be a comical one"</i>

400
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,709
<i>They'll be standin' in lines</i>

401
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,130
<i>For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines</i>

402
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,265
<i>Now you could study Shakespeare
And be quite elite</i>

403
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,182
<i>And you could charm the critics
And have nothing to eat</i>

404
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,139
<i>Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet</i>

405
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,856
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

406
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,024
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

407
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,226
Make...?

408
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,148
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

409
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,653
<i>Don't you know everyone
wants to laugh?</i>

410
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,780
<i>My Grandpa said,
"Go out and tell 'em a joke"</i>

411
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,741
<i>"but give it plenty of hoke"</i>

412
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,490
<i>Make 'em roar
Make 'em scream</i>

413
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,835
<i>Take a fall, butt a wall
Split a seam</i>

414
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,921
<i>You start off by pretending
You're a dancer with grace</i>

415
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,962
<i>You wiggle till they're giggling
All over the place</i>

416
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,802
<i>And then you get
A great big custard pie in the face</i>

417
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,421
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

418
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,093
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

419
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,012
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

420
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,476
<i>Don't ya...
All the...</i>

421
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,769
<i>What...?</i>

422
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,687
<i>My Dad...</i>

423
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,238
<i>They'll be standing in lines</i>

424
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,733
<i>For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines</i>

425
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,609
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

426
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,273
<i>Don't you know everyone...</i>

427
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,197
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

428
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,451
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

429
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,793
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

430
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,596
<i>Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh</i>

431
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,636
<i>Make 'em laugh</i>

432
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,014
Ready, Don?

433
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,104
- All set.
- Here we go again.

434
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,811
- We have another smash on our hands.
- I hope so.

435
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,313
You're darn tooting we have.

436
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,149
- Where's Lina?
- Here she is, Mr. Dexter.

437
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,284
Well! Here comes our
lovely leading lady now.

438
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,830
This wig weighs a ton. What
dope'd wear a thing like this?

439
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,289
Everybody wore them.

440
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,163
Then everybody was a dope.

441
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,244
- You look beautiful.
- You look great.

442
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,329
Let's get into the set.

443
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,039
Thanks, Joe.

444
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:27,128
I looked for you at Wally Ray's
party. Where were you?

445
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,882
I've been busy.

446
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,178
And I know what you've been
busy at. Looking for that girl.

447
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,601
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Why?

448
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,095
I've been worried about her.

449
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,267
You should've been
worried about me.

450
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,392
I'm the one who got the
whipped cream in the kisser.

451
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,064
Yes, but you didn't lose
your job, and she did.

452
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,238
Darn tooting she did.
I arranged it.

453
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,440
What?

454
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:52,027
They weren't gonna fire her,
so I told them they better.

455
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,950
- Why...
- Don, now remember.

456
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,909
You're madly in love with her and
you have to overcome her shyness.

457
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,952
Cosmo, mood music.

458
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,081
Roll 'em!

459
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,046
Okay, Don.

460
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,464
Now enter.

461
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,803
You see her.

462
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,639
Run to her!

463
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:21,182
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.

464
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,394
That's not all I'm gonna do if
I ever get my hands on her.

465
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,022
I never heard of anything so low.

466
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,697
Fine. Fine. Looks great.

467
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,070
What did you do it for?

468
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,411
Because you liked her.
I could tell.

469
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,080
So that's it.

470
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,543
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.

471
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,287
You reptile.

472
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,289
Sticks and stones
may break my bones.

473
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,592
I'd like to break every
bone in your body.

474
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,090
You and who else, you big lummox?

475
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,762
Now kiss her, Don.

476
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,466
That's it. More.

477
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,973
Great! Cut!

478
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:04,312
You couldn't kiss me like that and not
mean it just a teensy-weensy bit.

479
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,690
Meet the world's greatest actor.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula!

480
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,813
- You don't mean that!
- I don't...?

481
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,280
Joe, bring me a tarantula.
Now listen...

482
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,159
Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds.
Let's get another take.

483
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,407
Hold it.

484
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,412
- Hold it, Dexter!
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.

485
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,830
We're really rolling.

486
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,326
Well, you can stop rolling at once.

487
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,286
All right, everybody! Save it!

488
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,168
Save it? Tell them to go home.
We're shutting down.

489
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,965
Don't stand there. Tell them!

490
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,759
Go home until further notice!
What is this?

491
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,927
What's the matter?

492
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,301
<i>The Jazz Singer</i>,
that's what's the matter.

493
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,805
<i>Oh, my darling little mammy
Down in Alabamy</i>

494
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,478
This is no joke. It's a sensation.
The public's screaming for more.

495
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,022
- More what?
- Talking pictures.

496
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,397
- It's just a freak.
- We should have such a freak.

497
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,946
I said talking pictures were a
menace, but no one would listen.

498
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:56,527
We're going to make <i>The Duelling
Cavalier</i> into a talking picture.

499
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,487
That means I'm out of a job.

500
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,496
I can start suffering and
write that symphony.

501
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,413
We'll put you in as head
of the music department.

502
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,626
Thanks. I can stop suffering
and write that symphony.

503
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,581
Wait a second. Talking pictures!
You should wait...

504
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,131
Every studio's jumping
on the bandwagon.

505
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,882
All the theaters are putting
in sound equipment.

506
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,596
We know nothing about it.

507
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,389
What do you have to know?

508
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,719
You do what you always did.
You just add talking to it.

509
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,853
Believe me, it'll be a sensation.

510
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,144
"Lamont and Lockwood. They talk!"

511
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,522
Well, of course we talk.
Don't everybody?

512
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,670
<i>I got a feeling
You're fooling</i>

513
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>I got a feeling
You're havin' fun</i>

514
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,675
<i>I get the go-by
When you are done foolin' with me</i>

515
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,720
<i>It's a holiday
Today's The Wedding of the Painted Doll</i>

516
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,264
<i>It's a jolly day
The news is spreading</i>

517
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,311
<i>Should I reveal exactly how I feel</i>

518
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,350
<i>Should I confess</i>

519
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,397
<i>I got a feeling you're fooling
I got a feeling you're</i>

520
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,604
<i>It's a holiday
Today's The Wedding</i>

521
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,360
<i>Should I reveal</i>

522
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,199
<i>Exactly how I feel</i>

523
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,949
<i>Should I reveal</i>

524
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,711
<i>Beautiful girl
You're a lovely picture</i>

525
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,427
<i>Beautiful girl
You're a gorgeous mixture</i>

526
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:42,300
<i>Of all that lies
Under the big blue sky</i>

527
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,805
<i>My heart cries</i>

528
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,807
Who's that? She looks familiar.

529
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,729
<i>You're a dazzling eyeful</i>

530
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,433
I featured her before,
in lots of nightclub shows.

531
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,733
I've seen her there.

532
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,686
She'd be good as Zelda's sister.

533
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,443
- That's a good idea.
- Excuse me.

534
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,491
<i>There may be blondes and brunettes
That are hard to resist</i>

535
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,619
<i>You surpass them like a queen</i>

536
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:11,036
<i>You've got those lips
That were meant to be kissed</i>

537
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,960
<i>And you're over sweet 16</i>

538
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,926
<i>Beautiful girl
What a gorgeous creature</i>

539
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,677
<i>Beautiful girl
Let me call a preacher</i>

540
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,674
<i>What can I do</i>

541
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,849
<i>But give my heart to you?</i>

542
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,436
<i>A beautiful girl
Is like a great work of art</i>

543
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,655
<i>She's stylish
She's chic</i>

544
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,743
<i>And she also is smart</i>

545
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,782
<i>For lounging in her boudoir</i>

546
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:52,002
<i>This simple plain pajama</i>

547
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,172
<i>Her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur</i>

548
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,667
<i>To lend a dash of drama</i>

549
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,670
<i>Anyone for tennis?</i>

550
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,848
<i>Well, this will make them cringe</i>

551
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,597
<i>And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner</i>

552
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,222
<i>If your gown just drips with fringe</i>

553
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,482
<i>You simply can't be too modest
At the beach or by the pool</i>

554
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,778
<i>And in summertime, it's organdy</i>

555
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,777
<i>That'll keep you fresh and cool</i>

556
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>You'd never guess
what loud applause</i>

557
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,743
<i>This cunning hat receives</i>

558
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:37,047
<i>And you'd never dream the things
That you could hide</i>

559
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,586
<i>Within these sleeves</i>

560
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,011
<i>A string of pearls
with a suit of tweed</i>

561
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,880
<i>It's started quite a riot</i>

562
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,641
<i>And if you must wear
fox to the opera</i>

563
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:53,221
<i>Dame Fashion says, "Dye it"</i>

564
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,349
<i>Black is best when you're in court</i>

565
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,604
<i>The judge will be impressed</i>

566
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:05,488
<i>But white is right
when you're a bride</i>

567
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:10,864
<i>And you want to be well-dressed</i>

568
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,539
<i>Beautiful girl</i>

569
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,456
<i>For you I've got a passion</i>

570
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,125
<i>Beautiful girl</i>

571
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,129
<i>You're my queen of fashion</i>

572
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,681
<i>I'm in a whirl</i>

573
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,972
<i>Over</i>

574
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:37,599
<i>My beautiful girl</i>

575
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,575
- That's stupendous!
- Thanks.

576
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,743
Kathy, come here.

577
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,246
This will start a trend
in musical pictures.

578
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,496
Mr. Simpson's thinking about
casting you as Zelda's sister.

579
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,997
That's wonderful!

580
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,453
Hey, Kathy!

581
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,038
That's Kathy Selden.

582
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,790
Thanks anyway. It was nice of you.

583
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,917
- Wait a minute.
- That's all right.

584
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,049
Before Mr. Lockwood refreshes your
memory, you may as well know...

585
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:12,301
I'm the girl who hit Miss Lamont with
a cake. it was meant for Mr. Lockwood.

586
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,556
Goodbye. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

587
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,850
Wait a minute.
What's this all about?

588
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,396
We were gonna use her, but if
it'd make you and Lina unhappy...

589
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,359
Unhappy? It's wonderful.

590
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,104
He's been looking for her!

591
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,855
Are you speaking for Lina also?

592
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,113
The owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him...

593
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,116
- ...but you're the head of this studio.
- Yes, I am.

594
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,997
She's hired. Don't let Lina
know she's on the lot.

595
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,199
Take care of that.

596
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,496
Thank you, Mr. Simpson!

597
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,497
I'm glad you turned up. We've been
looking inside every cake in town.

598
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,258
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?

599
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,132
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?

600
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:52,678
Not exactly. But for lunch, don't you
tear a pheasant with Miss Lamont?

601
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,978
Look, Kathy. All that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.

602
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,769
Oh? Certainly seems
more than that...

603
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,191
from what I've read in all those
articles in the fan magazines.

604
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:07,989
Ohh, you read the fan magazines?

605
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,451
I pick them up in the beauty
parlor or the dentist's office...

606
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,327
just like anybody.

607
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,780
Honest?

608
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,165
I buy four or five a month.

609
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,875
You buy four or five...?

610
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,121
To get back to the main point...

611
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,250
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures...

612
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,176
Did you say all my pictures?

613
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,425
Now that I think of it,
I've seen eight or nine of them.

614
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,675
Eight or nine.

615
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,599
It seems to me
I remember someone saying:

616
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,106
"If you've seen one,
you've seen them all."

617
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,903
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?

618
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,818
No, I deserved them.

619
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,572
Of course, I must admit I was
pretty much upset by them.

620
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:59,204
So upset that I haven't been able to
think of anything but you ever since.

621
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,413
Honest?

622
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,995
Honest.

623
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,548
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

624
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,126
Kathy...

625
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,177
Kathy, look, I...

626
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,048
Kathy, seeing you
again now that I...

627
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,938
I'm trying to say something
to you, but I...

628
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,807
I'm such a ham.

629
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,733
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.

630
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,901
What do you mean?

631
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,445
Well...

632
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,148
Come here.

633
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,579
This is the proper setting.

634
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,499
Why, it's just an empty stage.

635
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,292
At first glance, yes.

636
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,040
But wait a second.

637
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,219
A beautiful sunset.

638
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,050
Mist from the distant mountains.

639
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,475
Colored lights in a garden.

640
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,733
Milady is standing on her balcony,
in a rose-trellised bower...

641
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,408
flooded with moonlight.

642
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:20,030
We add 500,000
kilowatts of stardust.

643
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,751
A soft summer breeze.

644
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,421
And...

645
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,757
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight.

646
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:37,214
Now that you have the proper
setting, can you say it?

647
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,387
<i>I'll try.</i>

648
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,637
<i>Life was a song</i>

649
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,016
<i>You came along</i>

650
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:53,355
<i>I've laid awake the
whole night through</i>

651
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,158
<i>If I but dared</i>

652
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,369
<i>To think you cared</i>

653
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,913
<i>This is what</i>

654
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:07,540
<i>I'd say to you</i>

655
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,968
<i>You were meant for me</i>

656
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:23,177
<i>And I was meant for you</i>

657
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,933
<i>Nature patterned you</i>

658
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,565
<i>And when she was done</i>

659
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,450
<i>You were all the sweet things</i>

660
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,286
<i>Rolled up in one</i>

661
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,368
<i>You're like</i>

662
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:49,578
<i>A plaintive melody</i>

663
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,711
<i>That never lets me free</i>

664
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,141
<i>But I'm content</i>

665
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,847
<i>The angels must have sent you</i>

666
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,435
<i>And they meant you</i>

667
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,772
<i>Just for me</i>

668
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,697
<i>But I'm content</i>

669
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,836
<i>The angels must have sent you</i>

670
00:45:55,419 --> 00:46:01,046
<i>And they meant you</i>

671
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,715
<i>Just for me</i>

672
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,068
Now...

673
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:32,040
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

674
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:37,458
Ta, te, ti, toe, too.

675
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,958
No, no, Miss Lamont...

676
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,250
round tones, round tones.

677
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,595
Now let me hear you read your line.

678
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,132
"And I can't stan' 'im."

679
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,180
And I can't stand him.

680
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,600
"And I can't stan' 'im."

681
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,268
"Can't."

682
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,808
Can't.

683
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,860
"Can't."

684
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,155
Can't!

685
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,865
Can't. Can't.

686
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,318
Very good.

687
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,700
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

688
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,539
"Around the rocks the rugged..."

689
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,079
No, no. "Rocks." "Rocks."

690
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,626
"Around the rocks the
rugged rascal ran."

691
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,828
Very good.

692
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,004
Hi, Don.

693
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,128
- Shall I continue?
- Don't mind me.

694
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,677
Now. "Sinful Caesar
sipped his snifter..."

695
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,843
"seized his knees and sneezed."

696
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,342
"Sinful Caesar snipped
his sifter..."

697
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,683
Sipped his snifter.

698
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,807
"Sipped his snifter."

699
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,137
Oh, thank you.

700
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:41,689
"Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed."

701
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,644
- Marvelous.
- Wonderful.

702
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,695
Here is a good one.

703
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:49,442
"Chester chooses chestnuts, cheddar
cheese with chewy chives."

704
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,573
"He chews them and he chooses them."

705
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,867
"He chooses them and
he chews them..."

706
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,915
"those chestnuts, cheddar
cheese and chives..."

707
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,414
"...in cheery, charming chunks."

708
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,379
- Wonderful! Do another one.
- Thank you.

709
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,882
"Moses supposes his
toeses are roses..."

710
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,802
"but Moses supposes erroneously."

711
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,506
"Moses, he knowses his
toeses aren't roses..."

712
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,055
"...as Moses supposes
his toeses to be."

713
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,932
"Moses supposes his
toeses are roses..."

714
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,525
"but Moses supposes erroneously."

715
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,771
"But Moses, he knowses
his toes aren't roses..."

716
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,490
"as Moses supposes
his toeses to be."

717
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:32,201
Moses supposes his
toeses are roses...

718
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,786
but Moses supposes erroneously.

719
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,204
A mose is a mose.

720
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,531
A rose is a rose.

721
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,242
A toes is a toes.

722
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,037
<i>Moses supposes his toeses are roses</i>

723
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,915
<i>But Moses supposes erroneously</i>

724
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,668
<i>Moses, he knowses

725
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,796

00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,472

728
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,720
<i>For Moses knowses

00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,814
<i>As Moses supposes his toeses to be</i>

730
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,438
<i>A rose is a rose

731
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,278
<i>A rose is what Moses

732
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,943
<i>Couldn't be a lily
Or a taffy daffy dilly</i>

733
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,901
<i>It's gotta be a rose
'Cause it rhymes with "mose"</i>

734
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,403

00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,909

00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,528
<i>"A"</i>

738
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,453
All right, here we go.

739
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,713
- Quiet!
- Quiet.

740
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,336
Roll 'em!

741
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,047
<i>Oh, Pierre.
You shouldn't have come.</i>

742
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,176
She's gotta talk into the mike.
I can't pick it up.

743
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,553
Cut!

744
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,933
What's the matter?

745
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,184
It's Lina.

746
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,559
Look, Lina, don't you
remember? I told you.

747
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,562
There's a microphone right there...

748
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,113
- ...in the bush.
- Yeah.

749
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,237
You have to talk into it.

750
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,861
I was talking.
Wasn't I, Miss Dinsmore?

751
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:06,119
Yes, my dear. But please
remember, round tones.

752
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,623
"Pierre, you shouldn't have come."

753
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,166
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

754
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,584
That's much better...

755
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,506
Hold it a second.

756
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,425
Now, Lina, look.

757
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,843
Here's the mike.

758
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,304
Right here in the bush.

759
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,513
Yeah.

760
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,216
Now, you talk towards it.

761
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,470
The sound goes through
the cable to the box.

762
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,349
A man records it on a
big record in wax...

763
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,273
but you have to talk
into the mike first.

764
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,774
In the bush!

765
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,317
Now try it again.

766
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,652
Gee, this is dumb.

767
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,951
She'll get it, Dexter. Don't worry.

768
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,321
We're all nervous the first day.
Everything will be okay.

769
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,115
By the way. You know the
scene coming up where I say:

770
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,246
"imperious princess of the night"?

771
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,045
I don't like those lines. Is it all
right if I say what I always do?

772
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,749
"I love you. I love you.
I love you."

773
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,252
Sure. Any way it's comfortable.

774
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,968
But into the bush!

775
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,178
Okay.

776
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,426
Again!

777
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,973
Quiet!

778
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,717
Roll 'em!

779
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,318
Cut!

780
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,866
We're missing every other word.

781
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,369
You've got to talk into the mike!

782
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,030
Well, I can't make love to a bush!

783
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,328
All right, all right.

784
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,328
We'll have to think
of something else.

785
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,214
What are you doing?

786
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,929
- You're being wired for sound.
- What?

787
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:48,051
Watch out for those dentalized
D's and T's and those flat A's.

788
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,393
Everybody's picking on me.

789
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,644
Okay, Lina.

790
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,098
Now look at this flower, see?

791
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,191
The mike is in there.

792
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,102
That's it.

793
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,029
The sound will run from it...

794
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,073
through this wire, onto the record.

795
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,402
It'll catch whatever you say.

796
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,784
Now let's hear how it sounds, Lina.

797
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,457
Okay, quiet!

798
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,076
Roll 'em!

799
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,006
<i>Oh, Pierre,
you shouldn't have come.</i>

800
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,718
<i>You're flirting with danger.</i>

801
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,962
What's that noise?

802
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,964
It's picking up her heartbeat.

803
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,716
Swell.

804
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,725
Cut!

805
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,266
That's right. That should do it.

806
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,938
Now, don't forget.

807
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,144
The mike is on your shoulder.

808
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:45,025
And whatever you say goes through
the wire onto the record.

809
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,322
Now, please, Lina,
talk into the mike.

810
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,868
Don't make any quick movements
or you might disconnect it.

811
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,582
Okay, let's go.

812
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,708
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

813
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,536
Roll 'em.

814
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:04,801
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.

815
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,425
What's this wire doing here?
It's dangerous.

816
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,820
You'd better not go in together.

817
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,941
Lina's probably waiting
right inside the door.

818
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,033
- Oh, how I wish...
- Don't worry.

819
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,780
I'll lead the cheering section
in the balcony. Good luck.

820
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,915
- Mr. Lockwood.
- Hello.

821
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,108
What's that? The storm outside?

822
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,827
It's those pearls, Mr. Simpson.

823
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:22,421
<i>I am the noblest lady of the court,
second only to the queen.</i>

824
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:26,337
<i>Yet I am the saddest
of mortals in France.</i>

825
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,426
<i>What is the matter, milady?</i>

826
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,841
<i>I'm so downhearted, Theresa.</i>

827
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,388
<i>My father has me betrothed
to the Baron de Landsfield...</i>

828
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,101
<i>and I can't stand him.</i>

829
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,891
<i>Oh, but he's such a catch.</i>

830
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,732
<i>All the ladies of the court
wish they were in your shoes.</i>

831
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,602
<i>My heart belongs to another...</i>

832
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,276
<i>Pierre de Bataille.</i>

833
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,451
<i>Ever since I met him, I can't
get him out of my mind.</i>

834
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,203
Sounds good and loud, huh?

835
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,670
<i>Oh, Pierre!</i>

836
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,213
<i>You shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.</i>

837
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,720
<i>They will surely find you out.</i>

838
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,756
<i>Your head is much too valuable.</i>

839
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,184
She never could remember
where the microphone was.

840
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,104
<i>'Tis Cupid himself
that called me here...</i>

841
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,731
<i>and I...</i>

842
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,684
<i>smitten by his arrow,
must fly to your side...</i>

843
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,571
<i>despite the threats
of Madame Guillotine.</i>

844
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,242
<i>But the night is
full of our enemies.</i>

845
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,116
What you hitting him
with, a blackjack?

846
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,542
<i>Imperious princess of the night...</i>

847
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,086
<i>I love you.</i>

848
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,917
<i>Oh, Pierre.</i>

849
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,749
<i>I love you.</i>

850
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,219
<i>I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.</i>

851
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,596
<i>I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!</i>

852
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,937
Did somebody get paid
for writing that?

853
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,565
Sounds like a comedy.

854
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,235
- It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie.
- What?

855
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,938
This is terrible.

856
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,283
What's that?

857
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,748
The sound. It's out
of synchronization!

858
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,245
Tell them to fix it.

859
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,952
Yes, sir.

860
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,753
<i>What's this? Yvonne?</i>

861
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,382
<i>Captured by Rouge Noir
of the Purple Terror?</i>

862
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,132
<i>Ohh. Oh, my sword!</i>

863
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,805
<i>I must fly to her side!</i>

864
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,141
<i>Yvonne, Yvonne...</i>

865
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,968
<i>my own.</i>

866
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,935
<i>Pierre will save me. Pierre!</i>

867
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,267
<i>Pierre is miles away, you witch.</i>

868
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,568
<i>No, no, no.</i>

869
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,778
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

870
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,652
<i>No, no, no.</i>

871
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,655
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

872
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,374
This is a scream.

873
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,994
Give me pictures like
<i>The Jazz Singer.</i>

874
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,375
"I love you, I love you,
I love you"...

875
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,966
- We're ruined. We're all ruined.
- You can't release this picture.

876
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:18,388
We're booked to open in six
weeks all over the country.

877
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,599
But you're such big stars,
we might get by.

878
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,802
I never wanna see Lockwood
and Lamont again.

879
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,011
Wasn't it awful?

880
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,689
This is the worst
picture ever made.

881
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:29,646
I liked it.

882
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,202
Well, take a last look at it.

883
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,533
It'll be up for auction
in the morning.

884
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,159
You're out of your mind.

885
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,117
It's Saturday. No bank will
foreclose until Monday.

886
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,836
- It wasn't so bad.
- That's what I told him.

887
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,872
There's no use kidding myself.

888
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:56,168
Once they release <i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>,
Lockwood and Lamont are through.

889
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,174
The picture's a museum piece.

890
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,755
I'm a museum piece.

891
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,679
Things went wrong with
the sound. Get the technical...

892
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,008
No, it wasn't that.

893
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,686
This is sweet of both
of you, but I...

894
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,436
Something happened to me tonight.

895
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,935
Everything you said
about me is true.

896
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,648
I'm no actor.

897
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,522
I never was. Just a
lot of dumb show.

898
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,404
I know that now.

899
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,740
Well, at least you're
taking it lying down.

900
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,241
No kidding, Cosmo.

901
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,290
Did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen?

902
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,083
Yeah. How about Lina?

903
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,707
Heh. I ran her a close second.

904
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,664
Maybe it was a photo finish.
I'm through.

905
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,211
You're not through.

906
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,883
Why, of course not.

907
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,428
With your looks, you could
drive an ice wagon.

908
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,887
- Or shine shoes.
- Block hats.

909
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,385
- Sell pencils.
- Dig ditches.

910
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,183
Or go back into vaudeville.

911
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:49,563
<i>Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I could jump over the moon up above</i>

912
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:51,936
<i>Fit as a fiddle and ready for love</i>

913
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,728
Too bad I didn't do that in <i>Duelling
Cavalier</i>. They might have liked it.

914
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,609
- Why don't you?
- What?

915
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,820
- Make a musical.
- A musical?

916
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,568
Sure. Make a musical.

917
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,950
The new Don Lockwood. He yodels,
he jumps about to music.

918
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,995
The only trouble is that
after <i>Duelling Cavalier</i>...

919
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,207
nobody'd come to see me jump off the
Woolworth Building into a damp rag.

920
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,914
Turn <i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>
into a musical.

921
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,795
<i>- Duelling Cavalier?</i>
- Sure.

922
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,127
They've got six weeks
before it's released.

923
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:23,305
Add songs and dances,
trim bad scenes, add new ones.

924
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,090
And you got it.

925
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,391
Hey, I think it'll work.

926
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,601
- Of course!
- It's a cinch.

927
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,770
It may be crazy, but we'll do it.

928
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:33,519
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>
is now a musical.

929
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,150
- Hot dog!
- Hallelujah!

930
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:39,981
Whoopee! Fellas, I feel this
is my lucky day, March 23rd.

931
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,444
- Your lucky day's the 24th.
- What?

932
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:44,651
It's 1:30 already. It's morning!

933
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:48,739
Yes. And what a lovely morning!

934
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,324
<i>Good mornin'</i>

935
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,791
<i>Good mornin'</i>

936
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,744
<i>We've talked the
whole night through</i>

937
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:55,954
<i>Good mornin'</i>

938
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,664
<i>Good mornin' to you</i>

939
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,134
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

940
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,837
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

941
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,015
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

942
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:13,263
<i>When the band began to play
The stars were shining bright</i>

943
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:17,188
<i>Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night</i>

944
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:20,020
<i>So good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

945
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,029
<i>Sunbeams will soon smile through</i>

946
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,907
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

947
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,825
<i>And you and you and you</i>

948
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,529
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

949
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,289
<i>We've gabbed the
whole night through</i>

950
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,832
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

951
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,953
<i>Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana</i>

952
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:38,289
<i>In the mornin'
In the mornin'</i>

953
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,373
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

954
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,043
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

955
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,341
<i>Might be just as zippy
If we was in Mississippi</i>

956
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:49,425
<i>When we left the movie show
The future wasn't bright</i>

957
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:53,391
<i>But came the dawn, the show goes on
And I don't wanna say good night</i>

958
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,225
<i>So say good mornin'</i>

959
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,932
<i>Good mornin'</i>

960
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,725
<i>Rainbows are shinin' through</i>

961
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,935
<i>- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'</i>

962
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,028
<i>- Bonjour!
- Monsieur!</i>

963
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,231
<i>- Buenos dias!
- Muchas fr√≠as!</i>

964
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,317
<i>- Buon giorno!
- A ritorno!</i>

965
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,198
<i>- Guten morgen!
- Guten morgen!</i>

966
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,746
<i>Good mornin' to you</i>

967
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,464
Ol√©!

968
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,303
<i>- Toro!
- Toro!</i>

969
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,747
Hey, we can't make this a musical.

970
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,241
What do you mean?

971
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,958
Lina.

972
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,670
- Lina.
- Lina.

973
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:27,211
She can't act, she can't
sing and she can't dance.

974
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,717
- A triple threat.
- Yeah.

975
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,882
What's so funny?

976
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,886
I'm sorry, I was just thinking.

977
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:36,849
I liked her best when the
sound went off and she said:

978
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,517
"Yes, yes, yes."

979
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,220
"No, no, no."

980
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,013
"Yes, yes, yes."

981
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,689
"No, no..."

982
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:45,899
Wait a minute.

983
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,977
I am just about to be brilliant.

984
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,446
Come here, Kathy.
Come here. Now, sing.

985
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,197
- Huh?
- I said sing.

986
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,366
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

987
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,786
Don, keep your eyes
riveted on my face.

988
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,744
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

989
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,408
Watch my mouth.

990
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,244
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

991
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,916
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

992
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,543
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

993
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,382
Well, convincing?

994
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,086
Enchanting. What?

995
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,255
Don't you get it?

996
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,099
Use Kathy's voice.

997
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:21,432
Lina moves her mouth and Kathy
sings and talks for her.

998
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,720
That's wonderful!

999
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,432
- I couldn't let you do it, Kathy.
- Why not?

1000
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,439
You wouldn't be seen. You'd
throw away your career.

1001
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:32,111
It has nothing to do with my career.
It's only for this picture.

1002
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:34,611
The important thing is to save
<i>The Duelling Cavalier...</i>

1003
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:37,410
- ...save Lockwood and Lamont.
- Yeah.

1004
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:42,453
Well, all right, if it's only
for this one picture, but...

1005
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,743
- You think it'll get by?
- Of course.

1006
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,750
It's simple to work the numbers.

1007
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:51,254
Just dance around Lina and
teach her how to take a bow.

1008
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,960
We'll spring it on R.F.
in the morning.

1009
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:56,254
Don, you're a genius.

1010
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,590
I'm glad you thought of it.

1011
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,300
Oh, Cosmo.

1012
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,353
Good night, Kathy.
See you tomorrow.

1013
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,693
Good night, Don.
Take care of that throat.

1014
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,950
You're a big singing
star now, remember?

1015
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,325
This California dew is just a
little heavier than usual.

1016
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,948
Really?

1017
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:27,706
From where I stand, the sun
is shining all over the place.

1018
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,425
<i>I'm singin' in the rain</i>

1019
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,886
<i>Just singin' in the rain</i>

1020
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:26,348
<i>What a glorious feelin'</i>

1021
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,396
<i>I'm happy again</i>

1022
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,025
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds</i>

1023
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:37,072
<i>So dark up above</i>

1024
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,782
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

1025
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:43,286
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

1026
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:46,532
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

1027
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:50,251
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

1028
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,253
<i>Come on with the rain</i>

1029
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:57,543
<i>I've a smile on my face</i>

1030
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,924
<i>I'll walk down the lane</i>

1031
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,424
<i>With a happy refrain</i>

1032
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,472
<i>Just singin'</i>

1033
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:10,263
<i>Singin' in the rain</i>

1034
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,775
<i>Dancin' in the rain</i>

1035
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,612
<i>I'm happy again</i>

1036
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,829
<i>I'm signin'</i>

1037
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:38,625
<i>And dancin' in the rain</i>

1038
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,204
<i>I'm dancin'</i>

1039
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,078
<i>And singin'</i>

1040
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:38,703
<i>In the rain</i>

1041
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,597
Why, that's wonderful!

1042
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,357
We'll keep it secret until
we're ready to release...

1043
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,103
just in case it doesn't come off.
I'm worried about Lina.

1044
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,572
She doesn't like Miss Selden.
There might be fireworks.

1045
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,241
Lina won't even know
she's on the lot.

1046
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,944
Boys, this is great.

1047
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:13,658
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i> can be saved.

1048
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:14,905
Now, let's see.

1049
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,582
<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i> with music.

1050
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,285
The title.

1051
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:23,002
The title's not right. We
need a musical title. Cosmo?

1052
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,462
Hey! <i>The Duelling Mammy.</i>

1053
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,380
No.

1054
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,972
I've got it.

1055
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,263
No.

1056
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,978
<i>The Dancing Cavalier!</i>

1057
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,984
That's it. <i>The Dancing Cavalier.</i>

1058
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:47,647
- Remind me to make you a scriptwriter.
- Thanks. Have a cigar.

1059
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,114
Thanks.

1060
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,486
Now, what about the story?

1061
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:56,618
We need modern musical numbers.

1062
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,829
We throw a modern section into it.

1063
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,793
The hero's a hoofer on Broadway.

1064
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,419
He sings and he dances.

1065
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,301
One night, backstage, he's
reading The Tale of Two Cities.

1066
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,843
A sandbag hits his head.

1067
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,971
He dreams he's back during
the French Revolution.

1068
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,640
This way, we get in the
modern dancing numbers.

1069
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,139
But in the dream, we can
still use the costumes.

1070
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,146
Sensational! Cosmo, remind
me to give you a raise.

1071
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,231
- Oh, R.F.
- Yes?

1072
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,809
Give me a raise.

1073
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:37,160
<i>He holds her in his arms</i>

1074
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,993
<i>Would you?</i>

1075
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,995
<i>Would you?</i>

1076
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:46,210
<i>He tells her of her charms</i>

1077
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,253
<i>Would you?</i>

1078
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,963
<i>Would you?</i>

1079
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,597
<i>They met as you and I</i>

1080
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:59,891
<i>And they were only friends</i>

1081
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,102
<i>But before...</i>

1082
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:09,688
<i>...the story ends</i>

1083
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:14,572
<i>He'll kiss her with a sigh</i>

1084
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,902
<i>Would you?</i>

1085
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,992
<i>Would you?</i>

1086
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:23,118
<i>And if the girl were I</i>

1087
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,002
<i>Would you?</i>

1088
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,296
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

1089
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,087
<i>Let's do the same</i>

1090
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,302
<i>As they</i>

1091
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,090
<i>I would</i>

1092
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,138
<i>Would you?</i>

1093
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:51,736
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

1094
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,111
<i>Let's do the same</i>

1095
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:57,944
<i>As they</i>

1096
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,111
<i>I would</i>

1097
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:07,127
<i>Would you?</i>

1098
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,593
Perfect! That Selden girl is great.

1099
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,263
I'm gonna give her a big buildup.

1100
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,307
- Swell!
- How much is there left to do?

1101
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,267
- One scene and a number.
- What number?

1102
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,687
It's a new one. It's
for the modern part.

1103
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,472
It's called "Broadway Melody."

1104
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:30,435
It's the story of a young
hoofer who comes to New York.

1105
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,816
First, we set the
stage with a song.

1106
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,275
It goes like this.

1107
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:39,577
<i>Don't bring a frown to old Broadway</i>

1108
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:44,328
<i>You gotta clown on Broadway</i>

1109
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,666
<i>Your troubles there</i>

1110
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,668
<i>They're out of style</i>

1111
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:53,625
<i>For Broadway always wears a smile</i>

1112
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,006
<i>A million lights</i>

1113
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,678
<i>They flicker there</i>

1114
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,180
<i>A million hearts beat quicker there</i>

1115
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:08,352
<i>No skies of gray
On that Great White Way</i>

1116
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:12,609
<i>That's the Broadway</i>

1117
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,310
<i>Melody</i>

1118
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,420
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1119
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:24,924
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1120
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,603
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1121
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:52,951
Shh.

1122
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,010
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1123
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,096
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1124
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:09,639
<i>Gotta dance, gotta dance</i>

1125
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,639
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1126
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,435
<i>Everybody dance</i>

1127
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,354
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1128
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,615
<i>Everybody dance</i>

1129
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:27,036
<i>Out on that Gay White Way
And each merry caf√©</i>

1130
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,744
<i>Orchestras play
Taking your breath away</i>

1131
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,663
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1132
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:37,501
<i>Everybody sing and dance</i>

1133
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:43,256
<i>Oh, that Broadway rhythm</i>

1134
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,846
<i>Oh, that Broadway rhythm</i>

1135
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,640
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

1136
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,897
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

1137
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:02,898
<i>To that Broadway rhythm</i>

1138
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,822
<i>Writhing, beating</i>

1139
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,195
<i>Rhythm</i>

1140
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,700
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1141
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,658
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1142
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,159
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1143
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:14,663
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1144
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:56,429
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

1145
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,429
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

1146
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,945
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

1147
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,069
<i>Feel like dancin' down the street</i>

1148
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,547
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1149
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,928
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1150
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,353
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1151
01:27:56,354 --> 01:28:02,527
<i>Gotta dance
Gotta dance</i>

1152
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:35,392
<i>That's the Broadway</i>

1153
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,093
<i>Melody</i>

1154
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,777
That's the idea. What
do you think of it?

1155
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,912
I can't visualize it. I'll
have to see it on film first.

1156
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:57,616
- On film, it'll be better yet.
- Don't forget.

1157
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,369
Have Selden re-record
all of Lina's dialogue.

1158
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,454
- It's all set up.
- And remember...

1159
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:05,249
don't let Lina know about it.

1160
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,256
All set in there?

1161
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,467
Right.

1162
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,511
<i>Nothing can keep us apart.</i>

1163
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:18,763
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>

1164
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:21,185
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

1165
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,483
Nothing can keep us apart.

1166
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:28,530
Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.

1167
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,906
That's great! Perfect. Cut.

1168
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,200
Till the stars turn cold.

1169
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,949
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1170
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,336
I can't wait till this
picture's finished.

1171
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,999
No more secrecy. I'm gonna
let Lina and everyone know.

1172
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,800
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

1173
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,722
From now on, there's only
one fan I'm worried about.

1174
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,142
There!

1175
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:01,472
- What did I tell you?
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.

1176
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:05,650
I want that girl off the lot at once!
She ain't gonna be my voice.

1177
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,443
Zelda told me everything.

1178
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,484
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Anytime, Don.

1179
01:30:10,488 --> 01:30:11,940
Look, Don and I...

1180
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,864
Don! Don't you dare call him Don!

1181
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:18,072
I was calling him Don
before you were born.

1182
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,039
I mean... You were kissing him!

1183
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:23,748
I was kissing her. I happen
to be in love with her.

1184
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:28,005
That's ridiculous! Everybody
knows you're in love with me.

1185
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:32,336
Ha, ha. Now look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

1186
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,217
I'm going to marry her.

1187
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:37,178
Silly boy. She ain't
the marrying kind.

1188
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:40,226
She's a flirt trying to
get ahead by using you.

1189
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:44,848
Well, I'll put a stop to that!
I'm gonna go up and see R.F. right now!

1190
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,523
A little late.
The picture's finished.

1191
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,068
If she weren't in it,
you'd be finished too.

1192
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:52,239
As far as I can see, she's
the only one who's finished.

1193
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,523
Who'll hear of her?

1194
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:56,905
Everybody. Why do you think
Zelda's in such a sweat?

1195
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,869
Kathy nearly stole the
picture from her.

1196
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,150
She's only doing you a favor
in <i>The Dancing Cavalier.</i>

1197
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,410
And she's getting full
screen credit for it too.

1198
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:08,379
It'll say on the screen that I
don't talk and sing for myself?

1199
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,503
Of course. What do you think?

1200
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,750
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1201
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:15,295
There's a whole publicity
campaign planned.

1202
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:17,009
Publicity?

1203
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:19,098
They can't make a fool out of me.

1204
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:21,927
They can't make a laughingstock
out of Lina Lamont.

1205
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:25,097
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1206
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,641
Why, I make more money...

1207
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,310
than Calvin Coolidge...

1208
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,403
put together!

1209
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:39,161
"Monumental Pictures enthusiastic
over Lina's singing and dancing."

1210
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,411
I never said that.

1211
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:44,617
"Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont, big musical talent."

1212
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,953
You can't pull a switch like this
on the publicity department.

1213
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,289
We were prepared for
the Selden campaign.

1214
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,589
Now you do this. At
least keep us informed.

1215
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,589
Wait a minute. I don't
know anything about this.

1216
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:57,045
What are we gonna do?

1217
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,254
Nothing.

1218
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,804
Absolutely nothing.

1219
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:05,140
You wouldn't wanna call the
papers and say Lina Lamont...

1220
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,643
is a big fat liar.

1221
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,478
Did you send this stuff out?

1222
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:13,110
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1223
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,484
You'll never get away
with it. Call the papers.

1224
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,486
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1225
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,783
Don't tell me what to do, Lina.

1226
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:23,488
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1227
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,825
I had my lawyer go
over my contract.

1228
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,167
Contract?

1229
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,961
And I control my
publicity, not you.

1230
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,337
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1231
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:35,587
The studio is responsible for
every word printed about me.

1232
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,887
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1233
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,217
What?

1234
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,681
I can sue.

1235
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:45,852
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1236
01:32:45,894 --> 01:32:50,816
it would be "detrimental and
deleterious" to my career.

1237
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:54,603
I could sue you for
the whole studio.

1238
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:57,105
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so.

1239
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:58,732
Right here.

1240
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:03,494
Contract dated June 8, 1925,
paragraph 34, subdivision letter A.

1241
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,743
"The party of the first part..."

1242
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,831
- That's me.
- You win, Lina.

1243
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,660
We better take Kathy's
credit card off the screen.

1244
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,211
All right, go ahead.

1245
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,631
Let's just get this
premiere over with.

1246
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,215
Satisfied?

1247
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,919
There's just one little thing more.

1248
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:23,427
You want me to change the name of
the studio to Lamont Pictures, Inc.?

1249
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,682
R.F., you're cute.

1250
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,726
Now, I was just thinking.

1251
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,430
You've given her a part
in Zelda's picture...

1252
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:33,225
and you'll give her a
bigger one in the next.

1253
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,018
So, what?

1254
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,945
If she's done such a grand
job doubling for my voice...

1255
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,529
don't you think she ought
to go on doing just that?

1256
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,031
- And nothing else.
- You're out of your mind.

1257
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:47,284
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1258
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:49,290
I wouldn't do that to
her in a million years.

1259
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:53,036
You'd take her career away.
People don't do things like that.

1260
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,791
People?

1261
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:56,922
I ain't people.

1262
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,958
I am a...

1263
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:06,723
"A shimmering, glowing star
in the cinema firmament."

1264
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,767
It says so...

1265
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,436
right there.

1266
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:27,744
<i>Oh, Pierre, Pierre, my darling.
At last, I've found you.</i>

1267
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:28,992
<i>Oh, Pierre.</i>

1268
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:32,993
<i>Pierre, you're hurt.
Speak to me, speak to me.</i>

1269
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:37,831
<i>I'll kiss her with a sigh</i>

1270
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,421
<i>Would you?</i>

1271
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,593
<i>Would you?</i>

1272
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:46,932
<i>And if the girl were I</i>

1273
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:48,762
<i>Would you?</i>

1274
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,348
<i>Would you?</i>

1275
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:55,103
<i>Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.</i>

1276
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,603
Lockwood's a sensation.

1277
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:00,483
Yes, but Lamont! What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous?

1278
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,273
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1279
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:07,827
<i>Our love will last till
the stars turn cold.</i>

1280
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:13,123
<i>And would you dare to say</i>

1281
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:18,501
<i>Let's do the same as they</i>

1282
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:20,456
<i>I would</i>

1283
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:29,345
<i>Would you?</i>

1284
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:54,498
R.F., it's a real smash.

1285
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,418
- Congratulations. We owe you a lot.
- Thank you.

1286
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,537
- Kathy, we made it!
- It's a miracle!

1287
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,581
It's great, Don. Just great.

1288
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:04,710
You were fabulous. You sang
as well as Kathy Selden.

1289
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,844
And I'm gonna for a long time.

1290
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:09,046
What do you mean?

1291
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:12,551
I mean she's gonna go
right on singing for me.

1292
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:13,934
Listen, Lina.

1293
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:17,893
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls.

1294
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:21,226
Kathy has her own career.
She only did this for this picture.

1295
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,894
That's what you think.

1296
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,729
Come on, come on.

1297
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:27,240
- Lina's getting carried away.
- Yeah, she is.

1298
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:28,900
Listen, you boa constrictor.

1299
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,945
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her!

1300
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:34,580
Never mind, R.F.!
Listen to that applause.

1301
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,457
Wait till the money rolls in.

1302
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:40,624
You won't give all that up because
a nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1303
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,835
She's got something.
It's a gold mine.

1304
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,208
Part of that choice is mine.

1305
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,713
And I just won't do it.

1306
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:50,548
You've got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

1307
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:53,258
What's the matter?
Why don't you tell her off?

1308
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,343
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

1309
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,767
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1310
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,231
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1311
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,777
Listen! I'm an avalanche!
Selden, you're stuck.

1312
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:08,279
If this happens, get a new boy.
I won't stand for it.

1313
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,906
Who needs you? They'd come to see
me if I played opposite a monkey!

1314
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:13,452
Don's a smash too.

1315
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:16,285
I'll say a few words.
I'm still running the studio.

1316
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,956
I'm not so sure!

1317
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:21,457
You're Mr. Producer, always
running things, running me.

1318
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:25,131
From now on, as far as I'm
concerned, I'm running things.

1319
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,712
- Lina Lamont Pictures, Inc., huh?
- Yeah.

1320
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,635
You've gone a little too far.

1321
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:32,130
- They're yelling for a speech.
- A speech?

1322
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,265
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.

1323
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:39,812
Tonight, I'm gonna do my own talking.
I'm gonna make the speech!

1324
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:42,975
- No, please!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1325
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:47,146
This is Lina's big night and she's
entitled to do the talking.

1326
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:50,649
- Right?
- Right.

1327
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,621
Ladies and gentlemen.

1328
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:58,914
I can't tell you...

1329
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,288
how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1330
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,497
for <i>The Dancing Cavalier</i>,
our first musical picture together.

1331
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:10,043
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

1332
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:12,553
it makes us feel as
though our hard work...

1333
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,306
ain't been in vain for nothing.

1334
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:18,141
Bless you all.

1335
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,060
She didn't sound that
way in the picture.

1336
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,937
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

1337
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:25,732
Sing us a song, Lina. Sing to us.

1338
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,402
- Please.
- Come on, Lina, sing.

1339
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,193
I got an idea. Come here.

1340
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:32,444
Now, listen.

1341
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,654
What am I gonna do?

1342
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,831
We've got it. Get a mike set
up back of that curtain.

1343
01:38:41,832 --> 01:38:45,376
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back of there and sing.

1344
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:49,046
She'll be back of the curtain
singing, and I'll be in front...

1345
01:38:49,047 --> 01:38:50,966
- Like in the picture?
- Right.

1346
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,051
You've gotta do it.
This is too big.

1347
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:57,223
She's got a five-year contract
with me. Get over to that mike.

1348
01:38:57,265 --> 01:38:59,718
You heard him, Kathy. Now do it!

1349
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:01,181
I'll do it, Don.

1350
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:03,228
But I never want to
see you again...

1351
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:05,355
on or off the screen.

1352
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,229
Now, come on, Lina.

1353
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:13,523
What are you gonna sing?

1354
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:18,532
"Singin' in the Rain."

1355
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:21,121
"Singin' in the Rain."

1356
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,283
"Singin' in the Rain."

1357
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,700
In what key?

1358
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,920
A-flat.

1359
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,213
A-flat.

1360
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,375
In A-flat.

1361
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:48,642
<i>I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

1362
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:53,737
<i>What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again</i>

1363
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:59,034
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds
So dark up above</i>

1364
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:02,078
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

1365
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,156
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

1366
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:06,621
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

1367
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,458
<i>Everyone from the place</i>

1368
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:14,668
<i>Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face</i>

1369
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:19,806
<i>I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain</i>

1370
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:23,972
<i>And singin'
Just singin' in the rain</i>

1371
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:30,316
<i>I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain</i>

1372
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:35,439
<i>What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again</i>

1373
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:40,618
<i>I'm laughin' at clouds
So dark up above</i>

1374
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,695
<i>The sun's in my heart</i>

1375
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:45,573
<i>And I'm ready for love</i>

1376
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,825
<i>Let the stormy clouds chase</i>

1377
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:51,461
Stop that girl!

1378
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:53,630
That girl running up the aisle!
Stop her!

1379
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:56,466
That's the girl whose voice
you heard and loved.

1380
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,716
She's the real star of the
picture, Kathy Selden!

1381
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,019
Kathy.

1382
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:12,187
<i>You are</i>

1383
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:16,858
<i>My lucky star</i>

1384
01:41:17,655 --> 01:41:20,324
<i>I saw you</i>

1385
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:24,700
<i>From afar</i>

1386
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:32,583
<i>Two lovely eyes
At me they were gleaming</i>

1387
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:37,500
<i>Beaming</i>

1388
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:43,381
<i>I was starstruck</i>

1389
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:47,848
<i>You're all</i>

1390
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:52,148
<i>My lucky charms</i>

1391
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:56,693
<i>I'm lucky</i>

1392
01:41:56,694 --> 01:42:01,070
<i>In your arms</i>

1393
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:05,737
<i>You've opened heaven's portal</i>

1394
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:12,536
<i>Here on earth for this poor mortal</i>

1395
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:15,413
<i>You</i>

1396
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:18,381
<i>Are my</i>

1397
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:23,759
<i>Lucky star</i>
