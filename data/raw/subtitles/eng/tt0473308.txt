1
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,570
Hon, you've put it off long enough.

2
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,681
What?

3
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,149
- You know what.
- You know what.

4
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,741
- Negative.
- Negative.

5
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,581
Come on, negative.

6
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,587
- Come on!
- Dear Lord, please protect our Jenna

7
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,350
from the hell of unwanted pregnancy.

8
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,688
I don't need no baby.
I don't want no trouble.

9
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,090
I just want to make pies.

10
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,163
That's all I want to do, make pies.

11
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,061
I thought you weren't sleeping
with your husband no more.

12
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,258
He got her drunk one night.

13
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,367
I should never drink.

14
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,802
I do stupid things when I drink,
like sleep with my husband.

15
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,168
Oh, no!

16
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,001
Looks like a pink line
is forming. Shit.

17
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,107
One line or two lines?

18
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,335
One line or two lines?

19
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,875
Two lines! The control line
and the other line,

20
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,172
- the bad line, the "yes" line.
- Let me see that now.

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,078
Two lines, two definite lines.
There's no mistaking them.

22
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,549
What's going on in there?

23
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,711
We have customers!
Where are my waitresses?

24
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,516
Hold your balls straight, Cal.
Jenna ain't feeling well.

25
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,681
What's wrong with her?

26
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,554
It's none of your business,
you blowhard.

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,150
I'm fine, Cal!
We'll be right out.

28
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,261
Hurry up!

29
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,533
Hon, you okay?

30
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,465
I'm inventing a new pie

31
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,832
<i>in my head.</i>

32
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,635
<i>Tomorrow's blue plate special.</i>

33
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,233
<i>I'm calling it
"I Don't Want</i>

34
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,370
Earl's Baby Pie."

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
I don't think we can write that
on the menu board, hon.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,583
Then I'll just call it
"Bad Baby Pie."

37
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,653
What's in it, honey?

38
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:46,453
It's a quiche of egg and Brie cheese
with a smoked ham center.

39
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,720
Sounds good, baby.

40
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,991
I ain't never going to get
away from Earl now.

41
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,398
You going to tell him?

42
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,337
I'm not sure.

43
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,172
If my plan comes true and I
can make my big escape from him

44
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,712
in a couple months,
maybe he never even has to know.

45
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,509
Are you sure it's his child?

46
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,481
You know everything I do.
I ain't never cheated.

47
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,584
- Ah...
- I'd never do that.

48
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,052
- Eh...
- I feel sorry for you, Jenna.

49
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,745
I mean, I'd do anything

50
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,187
to meet a man, and Becky's
husband is a senile fruitcake.

51
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,124
- Dawn!
- Well, I'm sorry, it's true.

52
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,558
But now here you are,

53
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,721
married to this handsome guy.

54
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,831
Who's got very good hair.

55
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,163
Who's got very good hair.

56
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,267
And pregnant with

57
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,699
a little girl.

58
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,802
How do you know it's a girl?

59
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,871
- We don't know it's a girl.
- But neither of us

60
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,940
would trade places with you for
one second.

61
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,804
Now would we, Becky?

62
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,171
No, we wouldn't, Dawn.
No, we wouldn't.

63
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,246
Except, just once in my life,

64
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,507
I'd like to be able to make

65
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,615
a pie half as good

66
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,241
as Jenna can make a pie.

67
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,875
- Yeah, me, too.
Oh, come on.

68
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,749
So what if I can make a decent pie?

69
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,584
- Who cares?
- Look at this, Jenna.

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,023
As you can plainly see,
my right boob is much higher

71
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,185
than my left boob

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,353
and Dawn here has

73
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,589
pasty, pasty skin.

74
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,394
I'm stuck in a marriage
to Droolin' Phil the Invalid,

75
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,798
and Dawn eats TV dinners alone,

76
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,426
but still, we wouldn't
rather be you.

77
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,029
I do have pasty, pasty skin.

78
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,240
Yeah, I know, you're here.

79
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,043
See you tomorrow, honey.

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
Good luck.

81
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,481
And if you do tell him you're...

82
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,853
- Hey.
- Hey.

83
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,216
Hiya there, Earl.

84
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,488
We all just agreed that your hair
is super attractive.

85
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,653
Hooray for you.

86
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,330
I don't care if she is a pie genius.

87
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,339
I wouldn't trade places with her.

88
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,205
No, me neither.

89
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,081
You don't look happy to see me.

90
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,446
Are you happy to see me?

91
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,883
Yeah, I'm happy to see you.

92
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,112
Even brought you a piece

93
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,485
of today's special,
"Kick In The Pants Pie."

94
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Cinnamon spice custard.

95
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,921
You don't give me a kiss.

96
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,864
Well, give me one.

97
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,258
There. That's more like it.

98
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,893
Where's that money

99
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,129
you made today?

100
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,296
Right here in my pocket.

101
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,896
Well, now, hand it over.

102
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,307
Not much here, is there?

103
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,141
Slow day, you know.

104
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,147
Yeah, you been having
more and more of those.

105
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,116
I'm really not sure it's worth
you working there anymore.

106
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,210
I think I might rather have you
be at home

107
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,754
making me pies all day long.

108
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,557
You didn't ask me

109
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,955
how my day was.

110
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,060
How was your day?

111
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,061
Ask me like you

112
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,790
care about it.

113
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,457
How was your day, Earl?

114
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,832
Well, you know,
Johnson's on my case again,

115
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,599
about the mortgages and everything.

116
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,608
But I don't make the bank policy,
and I told him that,

117
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,440
but he doesn't listen.

118
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,174
<i>"I Hate My Husband Pie."</i>

119
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,716
<i>You take bittersweet chocolate
and don't sweeten it.</i>

120
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,342
<i>You make it into a pudding</i>

121
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,148
<i>and drown it in caramel.</i>

122
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,745
You're not listening to me.

123
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,856
Yeah, I am.

124
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,016
What I say?

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,184
You were bitching about Mr. Johnson.

126
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,524
What were the exact words I said?

127
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,188
Well, I mean, I can't repeat
them verbatim...

128
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,199
You don't listen to me!

129
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,360
Hurts my feelings.

130
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,735
Please just say you're sorry

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,603
so I can let you out this car
so you can make my dinner.

132
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,608
I'm sorry, Earl,
for not being able

133
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,710
to repeat your words verbatim,

134
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,211
something I should be able to do.

135
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,110
Whenever I need it.

136
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,477
Whenever you need it.

137
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,745
All right, then.

138
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,420
You look handsome tonight, Early.

139
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,861
Thank you, honey.

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,464
It's been a long time since
you called me Early.

141
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,868
I like it.

142
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,532
And you look pretty tonight.

143
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,575
Maybe a little tired is all.

144
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,872
You're not eating
your spaghetti pie. Why not?

145
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,716
I'm thinking I want to borrow
some money from you.

146
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,753
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

147
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,881
There's a big pie Bake-Off in
Jonesville in a couple months.

148
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,015
And I'd like to go.

149
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,753
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

150
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,591
Prize money is pretty good.

151
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,756
Why do you need money?

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,259
I give you everything
you need, don't I?

153
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,836
Absolutely.

154
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,428
You want for nothing, don't you?

155
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Yes, Earl, I want for nothing.

156
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,073
I mean, your pies ain't bad.

157
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,943
But what's so important about that
when you got me to take care of?

158
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,448
That's a good point, Earl.

159
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,662
Jenna Hunterson.

160
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,339
Hello, Mrs. Bunterson.

161
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,341
Hunterson.

162
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,740
Who are you?

163
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,844
I'm your doctor.

164
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,573
Oh, wow, you brought me a pie.

165
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,512
How nice.
You know what?

166
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,608
I've only been here a few weeks,
but already I am genuinely

167
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,346
impressed with the hospitality of this place.

168
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
You're not my doctor.

169
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,556
Lily Mueller is my doctor.

170
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,750
This pie is for her.

171
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,291
It's Marshmallow Mermaid,
her favorite.

172
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,690
Well, she's semiretired now.

173
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,319
Just sort of happened this morning.
She kind of quit.

174
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,091
We didn't have time to call anybody.

175
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,132
But Dr. Mueller delivered me.

176
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,632
I mean, she's been my doctor forever.

177
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,168
I really liked and trusted her.

178
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,034
Maybe you could really like
and trust me, too?

179
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,107
I've never even seen you before.

180
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,698
Yeah, I just got hired.

181
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,176
Long story, making it short,
this is still

182
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,214
Dr. Mueller's practice,
I'm the junior doctor on staff.

183
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,215
Um, just moved here from
Connecticut two weeks ago.

184
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,046
Dr. Mueller had a class
over the summer

185
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,053
and I was a student of hers,
and is this story boring you?

186
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,349
No... yes.

187
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,457
Sorry, anyway,

188
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,957
it's nice to meet you.

189
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,549
What's your name again?

190
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,661
I'm Dr. Jim Pomatter.

191
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,729
Okay.

192
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,388
<i>- And you are?
- Jenna Hunterson.</i>

193
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,125
<i>Jenna Hunterson.
It is nice to meet you.</i>

194
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,723
So... What seems to be the problem?

195
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,928
Well, I seem to be pregnant.

196
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,037
Good.

197
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,197
Good for you.
Congratulations.

198
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,671
Thanks, but I don't want this baby.

199
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,265
Oh, well, we don't perform... uh...

200
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,469
No, I'm keeping it,

201
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,546
I'm just telling you I'm
not so happy about it,

202
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,875
like everybody else might be.

203
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,211
So maybe you can be sensitive
and not congratulate me

204
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,217
and make a big deal
every time you see me.

205
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,048
I'm having the baby,
and that's that.

206
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,382
It's not a party, though.

207
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,185
Got it, okay, not a party.

208
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,486
Uh, well, then, why don't we, um...

209
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,255
we'll have to do a blood test,

210
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,852
make sure you're pregnant
and then we'll check

211
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,329
for diseases, hormone levels,
stuff like that?

212
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,524
Sounds like a plan.

213
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,602
Okay, well, the nurse
will be right in.

214
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,534
Um... don't go anywhere.

215
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,509
Nowhere to go.

216
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,244
Come in.

217
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,076
Hi, Jenna, have a seat.

218
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,050
Okay, I'm going to give
you this pie now, Dr. Pomatter.

219
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,985
Oh, thank you.

220
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,353
Thank you very much.
Look at that.

221
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,824
You know what? Just push-push
all of those off onto the floor.

222
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,451
Go ahead, push them off.
That's fine. Just...

223
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,393
I'll get to those later.

224
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,537
Well, un-congratulations-
you're definitely having a baby.

225
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,306
Un-thank you.

226
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,109
So for the next eight months,
if you need me, I'm here.

227
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,081
If you have any questions,
just give a call.

228
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,447
We'll be doing some tests.

229
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,544
All of which I'll tell you
about before they happen.

230
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,815
And I'm going to give you

231
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,451
a prescription for,
uh, prenatal vitamins.

232
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,462
And do you have any,
uh, questions for me?

233
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,826
What kind of questions?

234
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,559
I don't know.
Concerns about your pregnancy?

235
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,567
Do's and don'ts?

236
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,193
Anything you're wondering about?

237
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,771
Exercise, sex...

238
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,872
I don't really do much

239
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,305
of either of those things, so...

240
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,343
Okay, any diet concerns?

241
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,844
Not really. I mean,
just eat healthy, right?

242
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,472
Eat healthy, um, avoid certain
cheeses, certain fish...

243
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,518
The receptionist, she can
give you a list of good and bad

244
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,678
foods for your pregnancy,
general do's and don'ts.

245
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,846
Okay.

246
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,924
And here is your prescription.

247
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:43,120
I'll just... sorry.

248
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,357
And, uh, it was very nice
to meet you, Jenna.

249
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,955
And I'll want to see you again

250
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,432
- in about three weeks.
- Okay.

251
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,526
Okay.

252
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,904
I do have one question.

253
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,067
Shoot.

254
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,372
How pregnant am I, exactly?

255
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,844
Very pregnant.

256
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,313
There's really only one degree
of pregnancy, so to speak.

257
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,543
No, I mean, uh, how far along am I?

258
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,882
Uh, about six weeks,

259
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,353
give or take.

260
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,619
Yeah, that was Earl getting me
drunk that night, all right.

261
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,824
You're late.

262
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,903
By six minutes. I'm sorry.
The bus was late.

263
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,370
Why doesn't your damn husband
buy you a car already?

264
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,941
'Cause he don't want
me goin' nowhere.

265
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,567
And you, late again.

266
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,943
You are inches away
from being fired, missy.

267
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,243
Oh, just try firing me,
you old bucket of cheese.

268
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,443
Who you calling a bucket
of cheese, you heifer?

269
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,521
Now get to work before
I fire your ass.

270
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,782
Calm down, you psychotic ape.

271
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,990
Hey, what are you doing?
Close the door!

272
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,163
How's the doc?

273
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,359
Fine, it was fine.

274
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,663
New doctor, a man.

275
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,329
A man, wow.

276
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,737
Is he single?
Maybe he's good for Dawn.

277
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,639
No, I think he was wearing a ring.

278
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,233
Weird guy, nervous.

279
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,437
From Connecticut.

280
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,776
Hey, honey, could you do me a favor?

281
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:10,882
What?

282
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,440
Old Joe just came in
and sat in my station.

283
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,746
Could you take him?
I can't deal with him today.

284
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,788
You're better with him than I am.

285
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,186
Yeah, sure, I'll take him.

286
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,281
Thanks, hon, you're a trooper.

287
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,690
Oh.

288
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,956
What? What's wrong?

289
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,692
You okay? You going to be sick?

290
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,825
I'm okay.

291
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,732
Just nauseous for a second.

292
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,230
Hurry up, let's get to work!

293
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,976
Hi, Joe.

294
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,576
How you doing today, my friend?

295
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,417
What can I get you?

296
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,115
<i>This is my pie diner.</i>

297
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,419
I own it.

298
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,959
I know you do, Joe.

299
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,154
And I think it's warm in here.
I know I'm warm.

300
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,494
I'll tell Cal, hon.

301
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,067
They keep all my businesses
too warm on the inside.

302
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:07,104
My gas station, my supermarket,
my Laundromat...

303
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,504
But this is my favorite business.

304
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,337
Joe's Pie Shop.

305
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,774
I'm Joe.

306
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,971
And I will not tolerate it being

307
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,513
too damn warm in here.

308
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,741
I hear you, Joe.

309
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,010
Turn the air on.

310
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,745
Yes, sirree, bub.

311
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,218
Okay.

312
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,619
I want two glasses of water, no ice.

313
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,452
Two glasses, no problem.

314
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,786
- Two glasses.
- Right.

315
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,724
No ice.

316
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,423
And I want the "Bad Baby Quiche Pie"
with tomato on the side,

317
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,829
on its own plate.

318
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,026
No potatoes with that?

319
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,660
Did I say anything about potatoes?

320
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,965
Where'd you get potatoes from?

321
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,699
No potatoes, tomato.

322
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,069
On its own plate.

323
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,199
Salt and pepper.

324
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
That everything?

325
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,571
No.

326
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,737
I want orange juice.

327
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,904
But don't bring that first.

328
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,014
Bring the water first.

329
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,449
Bring the orange juice
with the meal.

330
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,885
Okay, listen to my horoscope
before you skedaddle away.

331
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,685
"Aquarius...

332
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:04,058
Smooth sailing today as Mars
enters your inner circle."

333
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,393
Whatever the hell that means.

334
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,628
"The ones you love will listen
carefully to you today,

335
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,172
just make sure you're careful
with what you say."

336
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,867
Hmm.
I don't have ones I love.

337
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,068
Want to hear yours?

338
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,201
Uh, I'm Aquarius, too, hon.

339
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,710
I don't have ones I love either.

340
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,813
Just ones I live with.

341
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Excuse me, I feel like

342
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,007
I'm going to be sick.

343
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,494
You okay, sweetie?

344
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,860
Yeah, I'm okay.

345
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,800
Good. Listen, um, I have
a five-minute blind date tonight

346
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,803
with an insurance
salesman named Pete.

347
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,237
Five foot 10, 37,
all his hair, nice picture,

348
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,933
- loves fishing.
- Five-minute date?

349
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,840
Can't the guy pay for
the whole thing?

350
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,971
Yeah, see, um, I have this idea.

351
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,015
I'm meeting men through
personal ads,

352
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,744
but I just give them five minutes.

353
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,251
Whether or not we
like each other,

354
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,116
- we just have five minutes together.
- Huh.

355
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,452
That way, you know,
if the guy makes me sick,

356
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,616
I don't waste a whole evening.
Anyway, I'm supposed

357
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,216
to meet this guy at
7:00 at Banshee's.

358
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,728
I was wondering if you would
do a full makeup for me

359
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,320
here in the bathroom,
before I leave?

360
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,059
A full makeup for five minutes?

361
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,193
Well, yeah, it's very important
to make a good first impression.

362
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,464
I mean, what if he's
Prince Charming?

363
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,733
There is no such thing.

364
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,933
Whatever.

365
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,442
Will you do that for me?

366
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,602
Yeah, of course.

367
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,270
Oh, would you also make me

368
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,245
your " Falling In Love
Chocolate Mousse Pie"?

369
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,611
That is my favorite pie.

370
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,878
What the heck, I'll do
it during my break, okay?

371
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:34,986
You are the queen

372
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,248
of kindness and goodness.

373
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,063
You with child?

374
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,064
Quiet.

375
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,999
I've seen that look on
a woman's face before.

376
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,694
Name was Annette.

377
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,897
I made sweet love to her
all through the summer

378
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,268
of 1948.

379
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,671
She got that sick look

380
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,302
on her face like you had
all through the fall.

381
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,243
I almost married her right up.

382
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,746
She lost the baby, though.

383
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,907
Close call.

384
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,109
When you due?

385
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,617
Joe...

386
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,119
Don't want Cal to hear.
You can't lose my job.

387
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,452
I'm trying to save money
so I can leave my husband.

388
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,492
Why, what's wrong with him?

389
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, there's no salt and pepper

390
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,626
on the table. I asked
for salt and pepper

391
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,130
and no ice in my juice glass.

392
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,201
- Can't you get nothing I say right?
- I'll go get

393
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,735
your salt and pepper and juice
with no ice.

394
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,963
But you got to promise me

395
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,538
you'll keep your mouth shut
about this baby.

396
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,867
What baby?

397
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,704
Good man.

398
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,641
Honey, Earl's on the phone.

399
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,645
- Tell him I'm busy.
- You don't talk to him,

400
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,942
he might come over here
and cause a scene again.

401
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,050
Yeah, okay.

402
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,176
Can I ask you a question?

403
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,445
Is it my imagination,

404
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,578
or is my left one drooping
down even more today?

405
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,816
I'm starting to feel like something Picasso
would have made.

406
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,892
Do me a favor, hon,
get Old Joe some O.J. -

407
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,551
no ice- or he'll bite your head off.

408
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,356
- And some salt and pepper.
- You got it.

409
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,460
Hello, Earl.

410
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,090
Good, good.

411
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,829
No, I am glad you called.

412
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,997
You picking me up tonight?

413
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,042
No, that's fine, I'll ask
Becky to give me a ride.

414
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,108
Yes, I know you work hard.

415
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,706
Earl, I've got to get back.

416
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,944
We're busy here today.

417
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,052
Okay.

418
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,611
Bye.

419
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,246
I love you, too.

420
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,395
"Falling In Love Pie."

421
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,728
Oh, pretty outfit, Dawn.

422
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,065
Thank you.

423
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,197
It's a little tight
in the butt, I fear.

424
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,742
Oh, no worries. Men like a little meat
back there, don't they, Jenna?

425
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,174
I have no idea what men like.

426
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,609
Speaking of more meat,

427
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,739
does Earl have any clue at all
that you're pregnant?

428
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,283
No, he don't notice, and
I'm never going to tell him.

429
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,613
I'm just going to run away.

430
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Wow.

431
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,154
How much money you got saved?

432
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,883
Not much, $1,200

433
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,390
and I can save
another couple hundred

434
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,857
before the Jonesville Bake-Off.

435
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,519
How much is that prize money?

436
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,688
$25,000, hon.

437
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,561
Wow. What pie you going to bake?

438
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,963
I'm not sure.

439
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,468
I was thinking I'd make one
of my real unusual ones,

440
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,832
like my mama used to make.

441
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,269
One where you wouldn't think
the ingredients

442
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,772
would all go together, but they do.

443
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,874
Huh.

444
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,036
Dawn, you're beautiful.

445
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,237
Your skin looks like
a normal person's.

446
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,746
Thank you.

447
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,976
I know what you should do

448
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,813
with that prize money, Jenna.

449
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,944
You should open your own pie shop.

450
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,022
Oh, yeah.

451
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,353
You should have your own little
pie shop somewhere.

452
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,620
Somewhere where they could
really use a little pie shop,

453
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,628
like Europe or New Jersey.

454
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,494
Wow, my own pie shop.

455
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,863
Jenna's Pie Palace.

456
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,833
Jenna's Pastry Heaven.

457
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,529
Okay, back to reality for a minute.

458
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,504
Hey, can you give me
a ride home, Becky?

459
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,199
Earl don't want
to pick me up tonight.

460
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,606
No, take the bus.

461
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,803
I can't drive you.
I've got somewhere to go.

462
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,038
Oh, where you going?

463
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,774
I can't tell you that.

464
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:24,882
- What?
- What?

465
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,846
that yet.

466
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,953
Why not?

467
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,646
Got to go!

468
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,621
You have fun on
your five-minute date.

469
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,952
Use a five-minute condom.

470
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,059
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Bye.

471
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,127
Hey!

472
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,096
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it's good.

473
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,668
Go look at yourself, hon.

474
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,931
This guy's not going
to know what hit him.

475
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,233
Go on.

476
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,342
Oh!

477
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,505
Look what you did.

478
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,549
You made me almost pretty.

479
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,777
What do you mean "almost pretty"?

480
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,353
You're lovely.

481
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,921
Look at yourself.

482
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,054
Oh...

483
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,683
- Hey, sweetie?
- Hmm?

484
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,285
You think you can drop me off at the bus stop
on your way to Banshee's?

485
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,396
Yeah.

486
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,308
<i>"Baby Screaming Its Head Off</i>

487
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,104
<i>in the Middle of the Night

488
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,612

490
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,448
Hello.

491
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,458
Jenna?

492
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
What?

493
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,119
Hi. Dr. Pomatter.

494
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,229
Yeah.

495
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,094
What are you doing here?

496
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,928
Oh, my car wouldn't
start this morning-

497
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,058
God knows why.

498
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,362
Got to take the bus home.

499
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,767
Where do you live?

500
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,133
Uh, Stanton Grove.

501
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,365
Oh, it's nice over there.

502
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,409
Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

503
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,880
If you like trees, which, you know,
who doesn't like trees?

504
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,041
It's a long walk.

505
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,709
Do you mind if I sit down?

506
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,083
Not at all.

507
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,883
Thanks.

508
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,093
So you're a waitress.

509
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,195
I'm a waitress.

510
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,560
Where do you work?

511
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,497
Uh, a little diner off Highway 27.

512
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,125
Joe's Pie Diner.

513
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,931
Oh, wow.

514
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,336
Sounds like a veritable
factory of pie.

515
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,903
I've never been there.
Is it... is it... is it good?

516
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,774
Yes, it's very good.

517
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,144
We make all the pies there fresh.

518
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,686
Breakfast pies, dinner pies,
27 different varieties of pie.

519
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,017
And a new one that
I create every day.

520
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:47,182
I was just inventing a new one
in my head when you walked up.

521
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,523
Did you make that marshmallow pie
that you brought me?

522
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,189
Yes, I did.
"Marshmallow Mermaid Pie."

523
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,163
I invented it when I
was nine years old,

524
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,666
in my mermaid phase.

525
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,362
That was probably the best pie
I've ever tasted in my life.

526
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,166
That pie, it was...

527
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,333
that pie was biblically good,
that's how good it was.

528
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,707
That pie could win pie contests

529
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,074
and ribbons and things.
It was...

530
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,238
Thank you.

531
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,712
Yeah.

532
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,046
You know, there was a pie diner
right near where I grew up.

533
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,144
And I used to go there every day
after school.

534
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,850
I had a mad crush on this
waitress named Beatrice.

535
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,959
She looked tragically cute

536
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,426
in her uniform,

537
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,659
and years later, I was doing my
residency and she came in

538
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,257
with an emergency ovarian cyst.

539
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,995
I actually treated her.

540
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,798
Wow.

541
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,463
That must have been
something for you.

542
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,702
Well, she was at least
50 years old by then.

543
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,043
Life does funny kind
of things sometimes.

544
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,674
Yes, it does.

545
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,186
Yes, it does.

546
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,848
You want to hear something
else kind of funny?

547
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,926
When I saw you sitting here
alone in your uniform,

548
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,755
I... I had a flashback.

549
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,261
You made me think of her.

550
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,923
You kind of remind me of her

551
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,032
when she was younger.

552
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,196
Wow. What a thing to say.

553
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,861
Yeah, sorry, it was a compliment.

554
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,496
No, I know.

555
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,132
That's why it made me uncomfortable.

556
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,801
You're blushing.

557
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,173
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

558
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,543
No, it was a nice thing to hear. I...

559
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,946
Nobody ever notices me in that way.

560
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,950
Well, somebody
noticed you that way-

561
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,952
otherwise you wouldn't be in
the condition you're in.

562
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,681
- Oh, him?
- Yeah.

563
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,656
He don't count.
He's just my husband.

564
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,387
I'm kidding. Of course he counts.
He's my husband.

565
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,860
Oh!

566
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,430
Oh, here's the bus.

567
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,295
Call me whenever you need me, Jenna.

568
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,595
I'm here for all your
questions and concerns.

569
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,305
Please?

570
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,003
Please?

571
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,570
Please?

572
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,914
Please?

573
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,952
Come on, honey.

574
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,220
I feel sick in my stomach.

575
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,955
You know, it's been over a month.

576
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:10,296
I feel about as sexy
as a tree stump.

577
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,870
You ain't never been sexier.

578
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:19,075
Am I imagining it, or are
your boobies getting bigger?

579
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,045
Like they grew a size
practically overnight.

580
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,309
That's crazy, Earl.

581
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,452
I got to be with you
or I'm going to die.

582
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,056
Come on, baby, kiss me back.

583
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,135
Move up, baby.
Come on, honey.

584
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,102
Say something sexy to me.

585
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,935
What do you want me to say?

586
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,120
That was...
That was great.

587
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,753
That was great, baby.

588
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:13,864
Wasn't it?

589
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,627
Yes, absolutely wonderful.

590
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,512
Oh, no, no, no, no.

591
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,645
No, no, no.
I don't want you as my waitress.

592
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,382
I want her, Dawn.

593
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,889
That lady right there.

594
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,357
Oh, well, I'm sorry, honey,

595
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,792
but you're sitting in my station.

596
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,454
All the tables in Dawn's
station are taken.

597
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,122
No, but I don't want you.
I want her.

598
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,105
Well, if you want to eat in this diner,
you got to sit here, and I've got to wait on you.

599
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,487
She a good friend of yours?
What can you tell me about her?

600
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,841
What are her likes and dislikes?
What does she look for in a man?

601
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:36,673
Honey, I'm just here to bring you pie
or coffee or something like that.

602
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,248
I don't dispense romantic advice.

603
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,543
What if I paid you?

604
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,982
Excuse me, I'm going to go

605
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,748
talk to Dawn for a minute,
see if she won't

606
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,517
- come deal with you herself.
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.

607
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,467
- You've got to help me.
- What is going on?

608
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,901
That guy, his name is Ogie,

609
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,335
short for Oklahoma.

610
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,407
I was supposed to meet someone
named Pete last night.

611
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,600
Instead, he sent Ogie.

612
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,609
It was the worst five minutes in my life.

613
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,804
I made the mistake of
telling him I work here.

614
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,347
How could a five-minute date be that bad?

615
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,746
He took me through the entire medical

616
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,045
and psychiatric history of his family.

617
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,152
Oh, no.

618
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,948
And he told me he wants to marry me.

619
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,750
- Oh, no!
- Marry me!

620
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,417
And he's not giving up, not ever giving up,
that's what he said.

621
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,494
First guy that pays any
attention to me in years,

622
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,563
and he turns out to be
the mad stalking elf.

623
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,563
I'm telling you, Jenna,
your makeup job was too good,

624
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:28,665
and your "Magic Love Pie..."?

625
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,791
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,199
- What am I supposed to do?
- You go over there

627
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,770
and you tell him you're not interested.

628
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,601
- I told him that last night.
- Tell him better.

629
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,732
- Come with me.
- I can't. I've got to go throw up.

630
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,445
Fine, I'll just
go over there myself.

631
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,181
I'm a very persistent man, Dawn.

632
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,480
I know what I want.
I know what makes me happy.

633
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,587
Blah, blah, blah.

634
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,816
I'm a tax auditor.

635
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,155
I make $31,000 a year plus bonuses.

636
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,161
I drive a very nice compact car.

637
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,697
I eat at all the best restaurants

638
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,391
within a 50-mile radius.

639
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
I love my mother.

640
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,228
What else do you need
to know about me?

641
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,702
- How to make you go away.
- You can't.

642
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,467
You can't make me go away.

643
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,132
'Cause I don't take
no for an answer.

644
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,836
I'll just keep coming back
and coming back

645
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,776
till finally your resistance is weakened.

646
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,575
'Cause we were meant
to be together, Dawn.

647
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,774
You don't know me!

648
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:19,907
Oh, yes, I do.

649
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,111
You're Dawn.

650
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,485
And you inspire poetry in me.

651
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,854
Here's one I'm making up
right here on the spot.

652
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,221
"Dawn, can I bring you joy

653
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,387
"like you brung me sunshine?

654
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,364
Can I hold you a minute
and it turns into forever?"

655
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,933
- Do you like that one?
- No!

656
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,868
Okay, how about a spontaneous
tidbit that rhymes?

657
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,734
"All my life I've met harlots,

658
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,206
"but you are a queen...

659
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,106
da, da, da...
something between..."

660
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,940
I got to work on that one.

661
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,411
Leave me alone.

662
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,141
I can't leave you alone...

663
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,944
'cause I'm in love with you, Dawn.

664
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,518
And you're going to be my wife.

665
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,984
Listen to me.

666
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,952
You make me sick!

667
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,887
I think you're nothing
but a crazy little freak,

668
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,754
and I wish you would
go away and die!

669
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,762
I... I...

670
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,436
Oh, I'm sorry, hon.

671
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,514
Jenna.

672
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,676
You're always on the phone.

673
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:28,785
Sorry, this is important.

674
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,911
Yeah, what's so important?

675
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,716
Can I please have some privacy?

676
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,151
Hi, uh, is Dr. Pomatter there?

677
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:40,197
This is, um, Jenna Hunterson.
I'm his patient.

678
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,330
Hi, Dr. Pomatter.

679
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,232
It's Jenna Hunterson.

680
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,498
Um, listen, I'm sure it's nothing,

681
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,404
but you said to call
if I had any concerns.

682
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,967
And this morning, um,
I'm bleeding a little bit.

683
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,780
No, no, it's very, very light,
like spotting.

684
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,784
Come in to see you?

685
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,684
Okay, uh... tomorrow morning?

686
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,121
You in at 7:00?

687
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,556
Oh, okay, then.

688
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,322
Glad you're open so early
so I won't be late for work.

689
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,556
Thanks.

690
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,360
See you then.

691
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,367
Who are you seeing at 7:00 tomorrow?

692
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,734
Not telling you, 'cause you don't
tell me your secrets neither.

693
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,137
Oh, so this is a secret.

694
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,834
No, I'm just going
to see the doctor.

695
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,003
There, that's my big secret.
What's yours?

696
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,512
Can't say. Not yet.

697
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,378
- Why the hell not?
- Well...

698
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,179
- Hey!
- Hey!

699
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,516
Don't you have customers?

700
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,385
How come you can't never say
one nice thing ever

701
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,490
like, "How are you, Jenna?"

702
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,889
or "Nice to see you today, Jenna"

703
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,426
or "Great apple pie today, Jenna"?

704
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,826
All you ever say is stuff like,
"Don't you have customers?

705
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,831
- Get out of the kitchen. Get back to work."
- Don't you have customers?

706
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,992
Get out of the kitchen.
Get back to work.

707
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,737
Hello, Jenna.

708
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,862
Hello.

709
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:31,066
Here. I brought you
some "Peachy Keen" tarts.

710
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,938
Wow, thanks.

711
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,044
You're welcome.

712
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,440
- Where's everybody else?
- Uh, I came in a little early

713
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,743
to see you.
Nobody else is here.

714
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,580
Oh.

715
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,018
That's why I'm opening the door for you.

716
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,317
- I see.
- So come in.

717
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,594
Now, you say the bleeding was very mild?

718
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,699
Yeah.

719
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,428
And has it stopped?

720
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,901
Yeah, I only saw it the one time.

721
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,706
Okay, good.

722
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,303
Well, you can
get dressed now

723
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,747
and, uh, meet me in my office
when you're ready.

724
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,045
You, you're not going to examine me?

725
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,313
No, no need. No.

726
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,615
Just get dressed and we'll talk.

727
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,722
Okay.

728
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,665
Hi.

729
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,860
Hi. Come on in. Sit down.

730
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,438
Oh, my God.

731
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,440
Mm.

732
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,845
Well, am I okay? I mean,
is something wrong with me?

733
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,974
No.

734
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,279
Mm!

735
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,321
No, there's nothing wrong with you.

736
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,515
Uh, light spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom

737
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,624
in early pregnancy.

738
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,853
Were you concerned
about a miscarriage?

739
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,326
Not really.

740
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,194
Is that everything you have to say?

741
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,860
Um...

742
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,969
yes.

743
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,998
- No.
- Well, what?

744
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,676
I...

745
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,842
Nothing.

746
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,814
You can go now.

747
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:24,037
I'll see you at your next regularly scheduled
appointment, and again, don't hesitate to call...

748
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,645
To call you if I have
any questions or concerns.

749
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,986
Exactly.

750
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,925
Why'd you have me come
all the way in here

751
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,053
if spotting's a perfectly normal symptom

752
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,426
in early pregnancy?

753
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,695
I mean, I had to get up early,
take a bus, walk five blocks,

754
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,032
just to hear that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom?

755
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,471
I have no response to that.

756
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,635
And what time does this office
normally open, Doctor, 8:30?

757
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,474
9:00.

758
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,911
9:00?

759
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,178
So-So you came in here two hours
early just to tell me

760
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,082
that spotting is a perfectly
normal symptom?

761
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,452
Well, it would seem that way, yes.

762
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,659
Good-bye, Dr. Pomatter.

763
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,022
Good-bye, Jenna.

764
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,595
I think you're strange.

765
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,096
I'm not sure I want you
to be my doctor anymore.

766
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,496
You make me uncomfortable.

767
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,067
I'm sorry, Jenna.
I'm really sorry.

768
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,364
Whatever it is I do,
I will not do it anymore.

769
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,268
You should not be uncomfortable
at this time.

770
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,273
- You're doing it again.
- How? What did I...?

771
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,775
I don't know, you know,
that nice-guy-talky thing you do.

772
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,811
You just... Oh, forget it.

773
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,843
Damn! My purse!

774
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,784
You forgot your pur...

775
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,596
Hey!

776
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,461
Don't walk away from me.

777
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,602
Well, what do you want?

778
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,228
I want to see you again.

779
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,500
I want to talk to you
somewhere outside of here.

780
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,371
Maybe we could have
a coffee or something.

781
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,206
I can't have coffee.
It's on the bad food list you gave me.

782
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,838
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Well, you don't have to have coffee.

783
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,246
You could have water or fruit juice.

784
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,578
That's a bad idea.

785
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,414
I'm married. You're married.

786
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I'm pregnant.

787
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,521
- You're my doctor.
- Uh...

788
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,954
You're right, it's crazy.
It's unethical

789
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,183
on my part. I...

790
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,437
Wait!

791
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,838
No kissing in the street.

792
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,466
I have a very jealous husband.

793
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,635
He'd kill you

794
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,610
if he ever saw us.
He don't like when other men

795
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,908
- even look at me.
- Is he large?

796
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,175
He's large enough,
and he drives

797
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,444
- right past here on the way to work.
- Well, maybe we

798
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,985
shouldn't be standing
in the street then.

799
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,653
I've got to go make pies.

800
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,656
It'll take me time to walk
the five blocks,

801
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,726
wait for the bus.
I don't want to be late.

802
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,795
- Cal gets mad when I'm late.
- Let me drive you.

803
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,294
No. Yes.

804
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,592
Please.

805
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,370
Well, thank you for the tarts.

806
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,534
They were unbelievably delicious.

807
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,009
"Delicious" is not even

808
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,273
a good enough word
for what they are. They...

809
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,112
I mean, what you do with food is...

810
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,516
unearthly.
It's sensual.

811
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,780
Does anybody else appreciate...?

812
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:11,888
You're welcome.

813
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,890
So, um...

814
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,852
Do we...? I mean, what do we...?

815
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,725
- Dr. Pomatter, I'll call you
- Can I...

816
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,025
if I have any questions or concerns.

817
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,760
<i>"Earl Murders Me
'Cause I'm Having an Affair Pie. "</i>

818
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,702
<i>You smash blackberries and raspberries</i>

819
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,365
<i>into a chocolate crust.</i>

820
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,137

<i>And I Don't Want Earl

822
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,107
<i>Vanilla custard with banana.</i>

823
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,217
<i>Hold the banana.</i>

824
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,912
Don't you have no home?

825
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,079
Excuse me. What?

826
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,623
I'm wondering if you have
to sleep outside my diner,

827
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,352
'cause maybe you don't have no home.

828
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
I have a home.

829
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,494
Right,

830
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,723
and a bad husband, I remember.

831
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,458
You got lipstick all over your face.

832
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,566
What?

833
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,624
Your lipstick
is all smudged,

834
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,930
like someone gave you a good one.

835
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,437
I'm going inside now.

836
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,440
Once you're done wiping away
all your indiscretions,

837
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,941
I'll be sitting in my booth

838
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,343
wanting fresh-squeezed
orange juice, no ice,

839
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,278
and a "Spanish Dancer Pie"

840
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,510
with potato crust.

841
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,089
Here you go.

842
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,690
"Dear Elizabeth..."
Do you know this column?

843
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,963
It's for the lonely hearts.

844
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,629
"Dear Elizabeth.

845
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,173
"My husband fell in love
with another woman

846
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,867
"from his workplace.

"I want to write

00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,991
"I'm wondering if you can

"and his slut girlfriend the most.

Yours truly - Betrayed in Biloxi."

856
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,706
Elizabeth just gives her
some nonsense

857
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,368
about not killing herself.

858
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,377
I love living vicariously

859
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,879
through the pain and suffering
of others.

860
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,973
I don't believe for one second
you're as mean as you play.

861
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,779
You tip me better than anyone.

862
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,376
Oh, what do you know?

863
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,355
Bring me more water
for this empty glass.

864
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,330
- No!
- No. No.

865
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,331
Mommy!

866
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,332
What did I say?

867
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,357
No.

868
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,197
All right, now stop it, sugar, please?

869
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,396
Okay, you can have chocolate milk, okay?

870
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,871
I'm sorry. You can have
as much chocolate milk as you want.

871
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,043
Okay, all right, you little...

872
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,338
Okay.

873
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,503
Jenna, come on.

874
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,547
Listen, you can have
chocolate milk, okay?

875
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,084
Here, darling,
we bought you something,

876
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,345
a present.

877
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,784
That's sweet.
You shouldn't have.

878
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,355
Open it.

879
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,684
Okay.

880
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,026
Oh, it's a book.

881
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:41,256
<i>What a Mama You're Going to Be.</i>

882
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,662
Oh, look at that.

883
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,291
We know you didn't initially
have a strong happiness

884
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,494
about this whole baby thing,

885
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,832
but she is coming anyway.

886
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,166
We don't know it's a she.

887
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,264
We figured we'd give you something

888
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,842
that every woman
is supposed to read.

889
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,968
And every woman is supposed
to read something like that...

890
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,137
we think.

891
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,271
Well, thanks.

892
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,941
- You best read and absorb it.
- Hey, you know,

893
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,746
I was thinking. Have you ever
heard about those people

894
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,650
who sell their babies
for lots of money

895
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,017
through, like, lawyers and stuff?

896
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,284
Jenna, you can't sell your baby.
That's a horrible thought.

897
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,392
I was just thinking,

898
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,792
if I did, I might
make enough money

899
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,226
to finally get away from Earl.

900
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,854
I mean, at this point, the baby
is the only real financial asset

901
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,762
I have if I don't win
that pie contest.

902
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,132
I am going to pretend
that you are not saying this.

903
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,864
Not everybody wants
to be a mama, Dawn.

904
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,099
That don't make me a bad person.

905
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,573
You're not getting
any more affectionate

906
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,676
towards that little baby?

907
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:27,677
Not at all?

908
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,679
I respect this baby's right to thrive.

909
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,974
I do nothing harmful to it.

910
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,413
I don't drink,
I watch my diet, but no.

911
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,747
I feel nothing like affection.

912
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,720
Maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me.

913
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,380
I don't know.

914
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,419
Well, I got to get back to work.

915
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,689
Yeah, uh, breakfast crowd's
heating up.

916
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,025
Yeah.

917
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:49,292
Hey, thanks for the book.

918
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,231
All right.

919
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:55,271
Jenna, there's all these
cool things to do in here.

920
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,466
Um, there's a little scrapbook
section in the back,

921
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,739
where you can put pictures
of your pregnant belly as it develops.

922
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,871
Oh, and there's a place where
you can write your first letter to your baby.

923
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,074
- Oh.
- Right here.

924
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,515
Right in the middle.

925
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,110
Okay, Dawn, thanks.

926
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,992
<i>First Letter To My Baby.</i>

927
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,723
<i>First letter.</i>

928
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,992
Where's my water?

929
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,627
<i>Dear baby...</i>

930
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,574
<i>Dear baby,</i>

931
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,237
<i>if I was writing you a letter,</i>

932
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,180
<i>it would probably sound
something like an apology.</i>

933
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,978
<i>I know everyone deserves a mama</i>

934
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,986
<i>who'd want a nice baby
such as yourself-</i>

935
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:48,422
<i>who was also a good wife,
a fine member of society.</i>

936
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,790
<i>And I can't rightly say
that I'm any of that,</i>

937
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,921
<i>and I'm not sure the world
is such a fine place</i>

938
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,590
<i>to be bringing you.</i>

939
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,136
<i>Many of the people I've met
are not worth meeting.</i>

940
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:04,435
<i>Many of the things that happen
are not worth living through.</i>

941
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,204
<i>And you shouldn't take it
personal, baby,</i>

942
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,180
<i>if I don't seem like all the
other mamas-to-be,</i>

943
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,682
<i>jumping all over themselves
with joy.</i>

944
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,516
<i>I frankly don't know
what I got to give you, baby.</i>

945
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:22,080
<i>What if I leave Earl and don't
win that contest next week</i>

946
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,192
<i>and don't have no money?</i>

947
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,557
<i>What the hell am I going to do
with you then?</i>

948
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,034
You sure is getting fat, baby.

949
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,571
<i>All my life, baby,</i>

950
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,973
<i>the only thing I ever want
to do is run away.</i>

951
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,375
<i>What kind of mama is that?</i>

952
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,877
<i>I wish I could feel other things, baby.</i>

953
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,749
<i>Like excitement
that you're with me now</i>

954
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,618
<i>or faith that I'll be a good mama,</i>

955
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,487
<i>even if my life
ain't such a good place</i>

956
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,583
<i>and the world as I see it
ain't so pretty</i>

957
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,721
<i>like they'd have you believe
in this book.</i>

958
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:04,733
<i>Anyway, I'm writing
this letter to you.</i>

959
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,565
<i>It sounds more like a letter
to me, don't it?</i>

960
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,508
<i>Love, Mama.</i>

961
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,823
Where you going, Jenna?

962
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,865
Nowhere, Earl.

963
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,768
I mean, to work.

964
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,273
Then why you got a suitcase?

965
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,305
Earl!

966
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,940
Shut up and get in the car.

967
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,058
Pie-baking contest, huh?

968
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,832
Yeah, I was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you.

969
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,973
No, you're lying.

970
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,847
You ain't never gone to
a contest before in your life.

971
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,284
You're lying to me.

972
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,479
Earl, don't...

973
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,220
Why you lying to me?

974
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,322
I'm pregnant!

975
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,539
When was you going to tell me?

976
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,582
After I won the pie contest.

977
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:03,312
Well, you ain't going
to no pie contest.

978
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,821
You know what?
You ain't going nowhere.

979
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,224
Here's the thing, wife-

980
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,390
What if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me?

981
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,525
Women do it all the time.

982
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,071
They have a baby and then
it's to hell with the man.

983
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,072
You're jealous of the baby?

984
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,869
No, I don't get jealous.

985
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,638
It's below me.

986
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,905
I'm just talking it out.

987
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,207
I'm talking my feelings out.

988
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,783
And I know how women get.

989
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,976
And I'm just not sure I want
that happening.

990
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,189
I'd tell you to
get rid of it,

991
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,690
but I want you
in the same place

992
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,387
as me in the hereafter,
if you know what I mean.

993
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,991
Maybe if you promise me

994
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,898
that you wouldn't love the baby
more than you love me.

995
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,163
You know?

996
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,296
That you'd make
a real effort to love me more.

997
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,431
If I need something,

998
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,669
you'd keep taking care of it.

999
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,210
You'd hold on to me more.

1000
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,678
I come first- not any baby.

1001
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,114
Well, can you make
Early that promise?

1002
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,380
Absolutely.

1003
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,488
Then say "I promise."

1004
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,081
I promise.

1005
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,160
Say " I promise I will not love the baby

1006
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,455
more than I love you, Early."

1007
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,962
I promise I will not love the baby

1008
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,658
more than I love you, Early.

1009
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,560
How about that?

1010
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:32,108
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

1011
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,177
A baby boy.

1012
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,840
I bet it happened that night
I got you all drunk.

1013
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,647
Where you going?

1014
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:43,913
Gotta throw up.

1015
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,429
Mrs. Hunterson, the doctor will see you now.

1016
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,226
Hi there.
I'm Nurse Norma.

1017
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,431
I'll be helping Dr. Pomatter

1018
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,407
with your ultrasound
examination today.

1019
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,034
You have any questions?

1020
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,375
This is where we look at
the baby's heartbeat?

1021
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,778
Yes, among other things.

1022
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,908
You nervous?

1023
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,849
No. Do I seem nervous?

1024
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,785
Yes, you do.

1025
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,015
That's normal.

1026
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,614
Everybody's nervous before
their first ultrasound.

1027
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,591
I'm not nervous, though.

1028
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,026
Okay, you're not nervous.

1029
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,758
Come in. I'm dressed.

1030
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,094
Hello, Doctor.

1031
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:32,293
Hello, Mrs. Hunterson.

1032
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,528
How have you been feeling?

1033
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,637
Fine.

1034
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,705
No problems?

1035
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:36,898
Nope.

1036
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,168
You had no questions or concerns
this past month.

1037
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,177
No, I certainly did not.

1038
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,044
Okay, well, lie back.

1039
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,049
Uh, Norma, would you get
the lights for me?

1040
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,722
All right,
this isn't going to hurt at all.

1041
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,724
It's just going to be a little cold.

1042
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,023
Here we go.

1043
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,461
All right.

1044
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,934
Okay, just a little pressure.

1045
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,299
Now what are we looking at?

1046
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,547
Ah, there we are.

1047
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,207
We are definitely having a baby.

1048
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,080
You want to see?

1049
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,516
I guess.

1050
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,178
Just look at the screen.

1051
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,346
There.

1052
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,923
Everything looks great.

1053
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,083
You see that little...
that flickering

1054
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,184
right there in the middle of the screen?

1055
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,660
Yeah.

1056
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,958
Right there.

1057
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,090
That's the heartbeat.

1058
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,600
- Congratulations, Mrs. Hunterson.
- Glory be. Hallelujah.

1059
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,762
Uh, Mrs. Hunterson doesn't really like
to be congratulated.

1060
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,635
Oh, sorry.

1061
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,731
Huh.

1062
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,777
Don't really look like
much at this point.

1063
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,609
Certainly don't look
like no baby yet.

1064
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,615
Well...

1065
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,981
Ah, thank you, Norma.
That's all we need you for.

1066
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,576
All done here.

1067
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,449
Well, there you have it.

1068
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,925
Yeah.

1069
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,155
So I guess we are officially
forgetting about that nonsense

1070
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,856
that happened last month?

1071
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:10,432
Yes, we officially are.

1072
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,796
I want to apologize for it.

1073
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,460
I almost called you
just to apologize.

1074
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,868
I mean, I was so
stressed out at the time,

1075
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,234
taking on all those new patients.

1076
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,364
I hadn't been sleeping well.

1077
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,909
My judgment was not
what it normally is.

1078
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,343
I want you to know
that'll never happen again.

1079
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:24,675
From now on our relationship

1080
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,272
will be strictly a medical
and professional one.

1081
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,686
Jenna, no.

1082
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,126
Not with the door open.

1083
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,525
<i>Dear baby.</i>

1084
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:50,595
<i>P.S. I'd want to be able to
teach a baby such as yourself</i>

1085
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,471
<i>the difference between good and bad,
right and wrong...</i>

1086
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,838
<i>...but it seems I'm not fit
to teach nobody nothing.</i>

1087
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,041
Dr. Pomatter, you still in there?

1088
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,640
You got a phone call.

1089
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,514
I'll be right out, Norma.

1090
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,781
Mrs. Hunterson needs to be weighed.
Would you take care of that?

1091
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,949
And you can get dressed.
I'll see you in my office in a few minutes.

1092
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,739
Don't do that again.

1093
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,904
Okay, what? Okay, I won't.

1094
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,072
Kiss you, you mean?

1095
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,377
No, not that.
I didn't mean that.

1096
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,647
I mean don't go away for
a full month and not call.

1097
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,754
No questions or concerns.

1098
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,880
Don't do that.

1099
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,150
This is craziness, Dr. Pomatter.

1100
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,725
Please, call me Jim.

1101
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,918
No, I won't.

1102
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,722
Okay, don't.
Just Dr. Pomatter's fine.

1103
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,387
Dr. Pomatter, this is so...

1104
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,522
I don't want to have another conversation

1105
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,895
about how crazy this is

1106
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,401
or how sorry I am,
or how bad

1107
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,835
my judgment is, or how I'll
never touch you again.

1108
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,170
Not only would I be lying,
but every time I start saying

1109
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,176
those things, all that happens
is you attack me.

1110
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,212
- You're right.
- Have you been taking your

1111
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,610
- prenatal vitamins every day?
- Faithfully.

1112
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,181
Any bad morning sickness?

1113
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,750
- Not too bad, no.
- No more spotting?

1114
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,580
- No more spotting.
- Good, I'm going to want to see

1115
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,176
you again on Friday
for another appointment.

1116
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,085
Do you have time in the afternoon?

1117
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,282
Do you get a lunch break?

1118
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,018
Yeah, but I'll have to ask Becky
to drive me.

1119
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,594
Ask Becky to drive you.
Noon.

1120
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,391
Tell the nurse at the desk on your way out
that you want to be fit in.

1121
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,990
I have to go to St. Mary's now
and deliver a baby.

1122
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,695
Because that's what I do.

1123
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,896
Okay.

1124
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,132
Are we on the same page now?

1125
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,436
We're on the same page.

1126
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,135
Good, then.

1127
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,953
I wish it were Friday.

1128
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,844
<i>Dear baby.</i>

1129
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,039
<i>At first, it was really
just about the sex...</i>

1130
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,706
Jenna, the doctor is
ready for you now.

1131
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,350
Hi there.

1132
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,546
Oh, Dr. Mueller,

1133
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,123
how are you?

1134
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,248
I thought you retired.

1135
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,621
Semiretired.

1136
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,922
I'm just out of retirement
for the day, my dear.

1137
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,122
Dr. Pomatter and his wife
had to fly back east

1138
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,131
for a funeral this morning.

1139
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,066
Oh, he flew back east with his wife?

1140
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,296
How you feeling?
You doing okay these days?

1141
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,431
I'm fine. Just fine. You know,
knocked up and everything.

1142
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,406
Yes, I heard.

1143
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,239
How's it working out
with Dr. Pomatter?

1144
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,336
Oh, he's a great doctor.

1145
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,043
Is he coming back soon?

1146
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,447
I don't really know.

1147
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,075
I think so.

1148
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,778
Today we're going to do
some blood work.

1149
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,583
It's standard stuff.

1150
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,214
Just to see how the baby's developing.

1151
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,259
I don't care.
Do I have to do it?

1152
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,884
Yeah, you have to do it.

1153
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,122
You may be a little
weak afterwards,

1154
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,630
so you should
call your husband

1155
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,563
or somebody to come pick you up.

1156
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,066
Yeah, I'll call him.

1157
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,103
Is that pumpkin pie for me?

1158
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,138
Kind of.

1159
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,105
It's just something I invented.

1160
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,608
"Naughty Pumpkin Pie."

1161
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,956
Hey,

1162
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,893
you ever going to tell us
your secret, girl?

1163
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,522
Yes, I am, when I'm ready.

1164
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:17,964
I've got a secret, too.

1165
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,762
You, Dawn?

1166
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,269
Yes. I have a boyfriend now.

1167
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,372
No!

1168
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,840
Yes.

1169
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,169
Well, who is he?

1170
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,436
Tell us everything, honey.

1171
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,512
You're never going to believe
it, but, um... you know

1172
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,603
that guy came to the diner
that day, wouldn't leave?

1173
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:32,714
Name was Ogie?

1174
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:33,977
Ogie, the stalking elf?

1175
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,141
Yeah, I remember that guy.

1176
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,251
What about him?

1177
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,883
Well, it-it's him.

1178
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,027
Well, that is wonderful, Dawn!

1179
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,155
Isn't it, Jenna?

1180
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,630
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1181
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,633
How'd that happen?

1182
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,067
Well, you know,
he was true to his word.

1183
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,002
He didn't never give up.

1184
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,471
His cousin Pete gave him my number.

1185
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,736
He called me, like,
30 times in one day.

1186
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,209
I thought I might kill him.

1187
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,041
But he got to me.

1188
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,341
He did?

1189
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:06,472
Yeah.

1190
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,107
Well, he's so passionate.

1191
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,810
He writes me
these spontaneous poems.

1192
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,513
Spontaneous poems.

1193
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,557
Yes, they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot.

1194
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,592
Last night he said to me,

1195
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:21,755
"Dawn, your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room."

1196
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,897
"Your love is
like a beating drum."

1197
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,405
And yeah, I know what you're
thinking, that he's not...

1198
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,908
so pretty... but

1199
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,069
he grows on you.

1200
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,444
And anyway, he's it,
'cause nobody else wants me.

1201
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,150
Well, honey, you probably
shouldn't be with someone

1202
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,743
just 'cause nobody else wants you.

1203
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,845
Yeah, well, you are.

1204
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,287
And you wouldn't know it

1205
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,622
to look at him,
but he is a sexual dynamo.

1206
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,752
Wow.

1207
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,625
No, you wouldn't know it.

1208
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,255
Well, Dawn,

1209
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,061
I sure hope it's making you happy.

1210
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,567
You don't mean that.

1211
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,864
Yes, I do.

1212
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,199
Nope.

1213
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,467
I know what you're thinking,
'cause you called him an elf.

1214
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:08,806
Only 'cause you initially
called him an elf.

1215
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,140
- You're jealous.
- No!

1216
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,372
You are.

1217
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,006
Because you have the most mean,
controlling husband

1218
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,085
in the world,
and you are stuck there!

1219
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,983
But I have found someone
who loves me to death!

1220
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,248
Well, let's hope not to death.

1221
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,414
<i>And I am happy!</i>

1222
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,492
Good.

1223
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,420
When the fruit pies go in,
would you put this one in with that one?

1224
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,261
I'm going to go and clean up now
and set up my station.

1225
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,634
We'll see you out there!

1226
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,535
Don't say nothing.

1227
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,735
I wasn't gonna.

1228
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,607
I'm not in no position
to judge nobody.

1229
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,078
Neither are you.

1230
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,081
I hope I didn't hurt her
feelings too bad.

1231
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,343
She'll be fine.

1232
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:51,113
- Hey, is Cal inside yet?
- Yeah, I saw him.

1233
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,848
Think it's time for me
to tell him about the baby.

1234
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,424
You got the oven under control?

1235
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,787
- I do.
- Wish me luck.

1236
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,361
Wishing you luck, honey.

1237
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,657
- Well...
- What?

1238
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,564
It seems I'm almost
five months pregnant.

1239
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,535
Yeah, so?

1240
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,333
So I just thought I should tell you.

1241
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,440
I already knew.

1242
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,838
You did?

1243
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,534
Yeah, I thought everybody knew.

1244
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,441
Oh, who told you?

1245
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,639
Nobody told me.
Nobody needs to tell me.

1246
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,840
I mean, look at you.

1247
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,041
What'd you think?

1248
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,015
I thought you went and got fat?

1249
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,280
Truth be told,
as long as you can carry a tray

1250
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,514
and fill a pie tin,

1251
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,150
I don't care
if you give birth while doing it.

1252
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,454
Well, I'm relieved.

1253
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,588
I'm not such a bad guy, maybe.

1254
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,064
You're not such a bad guy, maybe.

1255
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,930
Well, get out there
and get to work, Jenna.

1256
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,594
Come on. We ain't got all day.

1257
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:42,728
I'll get to work.

1258
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,971
How you doing today, Joe?

1259
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,915
Same bastard as yesterday, Jenna.

1260
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,010
How are you?

1261
01:00:58,121 --> 01:00:59,520
Same train wreck.

1262
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,021
And how's the baby doing so far?

1263
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,719
So far so good, no problems,
no birth defects,

1264
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,158
no diseases, whatever.

1265
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,627
Good, good.

1266
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,197
How's the bad husband?

1267
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,822
Just awful.

1268
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:11,933
And the lipstick smudger?

1269
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,263
The lipstick smudger?

1270
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,631
The dog on the side.

1271
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,863
The affair.

1272
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,940
Joe, I'm not having no affair.

1273
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,101
Okay, you're not having no affair.

1274
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,701
Want to hear your horoscope
before I give you my order?

1275
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:24,813
No.

1276
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,805
Too bad, here it is.

1277
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,043
"Aquarius.

1278
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,246
"If, indeed, you're having an affair,

1279
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,414
"it might be a good time to step back,

1280
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,116
"look at your life

1281
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,590
and reassess things a bit."

1282
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,127
It don't say that in there.

1283
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,388
Yes, it does.

1284
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:44,432
It says, " Even if you have
a miserable, snake husband,

1285
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,968
"you probably shouldn't be
having no affair,

1286
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,628
"'cause it's beneath you

1287
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,571
"and could make you seem
like a common hussy.

1288
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,574
"Not to mention the pain

1289
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,507
you could cause other people."

1290
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,010
You're just making that up.

1291
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:01,644
This afternoon I want the
"Singing Tuna Fish Casserole"

1292
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,309
no pickle on the plate.

1293
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:04,681
Well-done Frenchie fries

1294
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:09,451
with melted Swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate,

1295
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,083
and "Jenna's Special Strawberry

1296
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,059
Chocolate Oasis Pie."
You got that?

1297
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:14,424
I got that.

1298
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,498
Give me a smile, Jenna.

1299
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,159
Nobody makes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do.

1300
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,361
Wednesday's my favorite day
of the week,

1301
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,302
'cause I get to have a slice of it.

1302
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,601
I think about it as I'm waking up.

1303
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,199
Could solve all the problems
with the world, that pie.

1304
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,573
You're making too much of it.

1305
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,169
It's just a pie.

1306
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,077
Just a pie?

1307
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,182
It's downright expert.

1308
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,775
A thing of beauty.

1309
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,321
How each flavor opens itself,
one by one,

1310
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,754
like a chapter in a book.

1311
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,952
First the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you,

1312
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:46,995
just a hint of it.

1313
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:51,499
And then you're flooded with
chocolate, dark and bittersweet,

1314
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,933
like an old love affair.

1315
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,937
And finally, strawberry;

1316
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,372
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste,

1317
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,476
but never knew how.

1318
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,704
In fact,

1319
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,337
I tell you what.

1320
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,643
Forget all the other stuff
I ordered.

1321
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,274
Just bring me the damn pie.

1322
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,750
That's all I want.

1323
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,150
I don't care if it's not

1324
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,255
a well-balanced meal.

1325
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,281
Just bring me the pie.

1326
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,225
Old Joe'll maybe not have much
longer to live, you know?

1327
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,523
Then I better bring you the pie
right away.

1328
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,327
Yes'm, you better.

1329
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,428
I love you!
- Oh!

1330
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,565
I love your breast.
I love your breast.

1331
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,734
I love this breast!
I like this breast, too!

1332
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,869
Oh!

1333
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,947
Uh, there's my order, Cal,

1334
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,948
and I'm going
to need a slice of Oasis.

1335
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,416
Gonna go throw up now.

1336
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,713
Jenna.

1337
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,413
- Whoa!
- No, Cal!

1338
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,989
- Jenna!
- Hey!

1339
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,557
I didn't plan it, Jenna.

1340
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,823
It just happened.

1341
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,956
He's got such nice, strong hands.

1342
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,727
Your poor husband.

1343
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,427
My poor husband
wears a diaper,

1344
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,061
curses constantly
and sleeps in a separate room.

1345
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,730
So why don't you
just divorce him then?

1346
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,309
I can't just leave
a sick, crazy, old man.

1347
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,809
What kind of person would do that?

1348
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,311
I don't know. What kind of person
has an affair with Cal,

1349
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,473
who's married to Ethel,
who we see all the time?

1350
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,583
He says she's awful.

1351
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,846
Maybe anyone
you stay married to

1352
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,647
for 15 years starts to seem awful.

1353
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,584
But we know Ethel.
She's not awful.

1354
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,623
She tells Cal not to yell at us.

1355
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,125
Hey, you're supposed
to be my friend, not Ethel's.

1356
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,492
Having an affair
is a terrible thing to do.

1357
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,794
It destroys people's lives, and I don't
want you messed up with all that.

1358
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,595
Jenna, there's this cute guy here

1359
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,703
to see you.

1360
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,104
He says he's your doctor.

1361
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,572
That's perfect.
Just perfect.

1362
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,209
What are you doing here?

1363
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,249
- You can't just come here.
- I had an hour to kill.

1364
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,943
I wanted to see you.

1365
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,247
Did you make this pie?
It's bliss. Of course you made it.

1366
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:54,880
I got to get back to work.

1367
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,549
- When can I see you again?
- Dr. Pomatter,

1368
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,628
I've been thinking.

1369
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,287
I think we need to end this.

1370
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,796
- No.
- Yes.

1371
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,991
Why?

1372
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,624
Because I feel like
a bad person,

1373
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,532
- and I can't live with that.
- Jenna...

1374
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,002
No, don't say anything.

1375
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,902
Don't get all nervous and sweet.

1376
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,304
Don't talk me out of it.

1377
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,936
Just, please, finish your pie
and go. Please.

1378
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,439
I'm sorry.

1379
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,260
Last piece.

1380
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,525
Sold out even faster
than usual today.

1381
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,063
Good on us.

1382
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,598
Thanks.

1383
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,635
Cal...

1384
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,171
Yeah?

1385
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,071
Are you happy?

1386
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,207
I mean, would you call yourself
a happy man?

1387
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:56,444
Well, if you're asking me
a serious question, I'll tell you.

1388
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,884
I'm happy enough.

1389
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:03,891
I don't expect much, give much,
I don't get much.

1390
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,757
I generally enjoy whatever comes up.

1391
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,633
That's my truth, summed up
for your feminine judgment.

1392
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,168
I'm happy enough.

1393
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,704
Why do you ask?

1394
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,306
No reason.

1395
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,854
Good evening.

1396
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,830
Good evening.

1397
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,403
I'm just waiting on Dawn.

1398
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,336
Hmm.

1399
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,103
Taking her to Stanton
for a steak dinner.

1400
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,872
Gonna be asking her to marry me.

1401
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,276
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1402
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,281
There you are.

1403
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,745
Dawn, if I had a penny for
everything I loved about you,

1404
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,116
I would have many pennies.

1405
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:09,680
He's-He's making me
a poem right here.

1406
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,783
Penny for your teeth,

1407
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:16,024
penny for your nose,
penny for your eyes, penny

1408
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:20,193
for your hair, your navel,
penny for your odor.

1409
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,270
A dollar for your heart.

1410
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,636
Aw, Ogie, thank you.

1411
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,141
That sure is sweet.

1412
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,276
You two have a good time, you hear?

1413
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,650
Oh, we will.

1414
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,881
Bye.

1415
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,117
Where we going?

1416
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:50,993
Waiting for Earl?

1417
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,398
Yeah.

1418
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,665
Hey, I'm real sorry
for what I said before.

1419
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,173
Listen, I love you no matter what you do.

1420
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,141
Okay.

1421
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,244
Okay.

1422
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,245
I forgive you.

1423
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,246
Good.

1424
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,147
Good.

1425
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,911
'Cause this is my little adventure.

1426
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,043
Your little adventure?

1427
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,153
Yeah.

1428
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,587
I'm having me a little adventure

1429
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,418
after many years of lots of nothing.

1430
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:16,991
You love him?

1431
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,561
Cal?

1432
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,892
I don't know.

1433
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,589
<i>But I love it.</i>

1434
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,032
I love having someone
to look pretty for.

1435
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,004
I love waking up and having
something to look forward to.

1436
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,009
Something fun and sneaky and sexy.

1437
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,305
He love you?

1438
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,470
He kind of likes me.

1439
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,707
He kind of hates me.

1440
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,146
It's fun.

1441
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,309
It doesn't sound very fun.

1442
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,419
He makes me forget

1443
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,445
about my invalid husband,
my loneliness,

1444
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:51,219
the dreadful misplacement
of my bosoms.

1445
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,922
Becky, I don't know how
to tell you this,

1446
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,191
but your bosoms are fine.

1447
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,789
There ain't nothing wrong with them.

1448
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,901
It's all in your head.

1449
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,560
What are you talking about?
Are you blind?

1450
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,103
This one's way up here in Maine,

1451
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,695
this one's dangling
down here in Florida.

1452
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,678
All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow, honey.

1453
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,213
No, you won't.
Tomorrow's Thursday, my day off.

1454
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,315
Then I'll see you Friday?

1455
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,408
Yeah.

1456
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:20,755
All right, bye.

1457
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:21,756
Bye.

1458
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,060
Hey, Porky.

1459
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,630
Hey.

1460
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,231
Why don't you treat me like a man?

1461
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,503
I don't feel like it.

1462
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,675
"I don't feel like it."

1463
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:51,549
Well, what makes you think
you have that option, hmm?

1464
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,755
Earl.

1465
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,857
Stop.

1466
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,984
Come on.
Don't tell me to stop.

1467
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,288
Hmm, come on.

1468
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,921
I feed you.

1469
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,195
I pay for this house.

1470
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,271
I put clothes on your back.

1471
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,305
Come on, just do what I tell you.

1472
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,170
I won't get too mad.

1473
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:15,743
Earl, that hurts, come on.

1474
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,976
I love you, baby.

1475
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,714
I don't care if you're fat.

1476
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,556
You're my sweet thing.

1477
01:11:10,963 --> 01:11:13,796
<i>"Pregnant, Miserable, Self-Pitying Loser Pie."</i>

1478
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,803
<i>Lumpy oatmeal with
fruitcake mashed in,</i>

1479
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:21,839
<i>flambe, of course.</i>

1480
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:33,150
What are you doing here?

1481
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,617
I took the whole day off.

1482
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:37,348
I don't know.

1483
01:11:37,456 --> 01:11:38,855
I wanted to see you.

1484
01:11:38,957 --> 01:11:40,219
You look awful.

1485
01:11:40,325 --> 01:11:41,815
Thanks.

1486
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:44,760
I mean, you look sad.

1487
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:46,990
You look really sad.

1488
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:50,367
It's taken you a long time
to notice this,

1489
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:54,428
but, uh... I'm not a happy woman,
Dr. Pomatter.

1490
01:11:54,539 --> 01:11:57,133
And I don't want you to save me.

1491
01:11:57,242 --> 01:11:58,504
I don't want to save you.

1492
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,840
Don't want to be saved.

1493
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:06,315
Can I come in?

1494
01:12:06,418 --> 01:12:08,045
No.

1495
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:13,048
Yeah.

1496
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,358
So, what now?

1497
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:24,935
I don't know.

1498
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:28,336
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to make a pie.

1499
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,409
Seriously?

1500
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,738
Seriously.

1501
01:12:32,844 --> 01:12:35,608
I could do that, sure.

1502
01:12:37,215 --> 01:12:39,240
Come here.

1503
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:55,830
<i>Dear baby.</i>

1504
01:12:55,934 --> 01:12:58,368
<i>I hope someday, somebody
wants to hold you</i>

1505
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:01,871
<i>for 20 minutes straight,
and that's all they do.</i>

1506
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,463
<i>They don't pull away.</i>

1507
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:05,270
<i>They don't look at your face.</i>

1508
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,242
<i>They don't try to kiss you.</i>

1509
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:09,905
<i>All they do is wrap you up
in their arms</i>

1510
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:13,746
<i>and hold on tight without
an ounce of selfishness to it.</i>

1511
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,421
I got it.

1512
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,247
- And now the berries.
- Berries.

1513
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,623
Okay, I'm finished.

1514
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:07,737
I can't let the chocolate burn.

1515
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,908
I love watching you.

1516
01:14:12,811 --> 01:14:15,371
Once the chocolate's all in,
you'll pour the berries on top.

1517
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,971
I'll pour the berries on top.

1518
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:22,349
Mama used to call this
"The Lonely Chicago Pie."

1519
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:24,752
She made hundreds of
different kinds of pie.

1520
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:29,156
They all have real strange names,
like "Car Radio Pie"

1521
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,253
or "Jenna's First Kiss Pie."

1522
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:42,739
Now the berries-you do it.

1523
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:44,570
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1524
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:50,507
You know, Mama would keep me in
the kitchen with her,

1525
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:53,516
and teach me everything
she knew about baking.

1526
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:57,520
She'd sing to me so sweetly.

1527
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,786
Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie

1528
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:06,523
Gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle

1529
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:10,397
Baby, don't be blue,
gonna make for you

1530
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:14,598
Gonna make a pie with
a heart in the middle

1531
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:17,903
Gonna be a pie
from heaven above

1532
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:22,537
Gonna be filled
with strawberry love

1533
01:15:22,647 --> 01:15:26,708
Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie

1534
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:31,619
Hold you forever in
the middle of my heart.

1535
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,054
You are so beautiful.

1536
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,182
No, I'm not.

1537
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:35,384
You are.

1538
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,552
I'm fat.

1539
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:38,686
You're pregnant.

1540
01:15:38,797 --> 01:15:40,765
You've got a little baby
growing inside you.

1541
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:42,595
There is nothing more beautiful.

1542
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:46,000
It's an alien and a parasite.

1543
01:15:46,104 --> 01:15:48,231
It makes me tired and weak.

1544
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,069
It complicates my whole life.

1545
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,733
I resent it.

1546
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:54,710
I have no idea
how to take care of it.

1547
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,145
I'm the anti-mother.

1548
01:15:57,249 --> 01:16:00,013
I don't want to talk
about that no more.

1549
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:03,315
I want to know
what the hell you're doing here.

1550
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:05,252
I'm learning how to make
"Lonely Chicago Pie."

1551
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:09,418
No, I mean what you're doing here,
living in this town.

1552
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,223
My wife.

1553
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:15,094
She just finished med school and
we came here for her residency.

1554
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,498
Are you happy with her?

1555
01:16:17,602 --> 01:16:21,094
No, don't answer that.

1556
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,174
I'm happy right now.

1557
01:16:23,275 --> 01:16:24,970
Being here with you.

1558
01:16:25,076 --> 01:16:27,636
That's a good answer.

1559
01:16:27,746 --> 01:16:30,772
You make me feel calm.

1560
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,715
You make me feel peaceful.

1561
01:16:33,818 --> 01:16:35,308
I don't feel that much.

1562
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,752
I tend to be neurotic.

1563
01:16:37,856 --> 01:16:40,552
And you're so beautiful.

1564
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:42,286
Keep going.

1565
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:43,622
And so sexy.

1566
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:44,820
More, please.

1567
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,989
And I could find
the whole meaning of life

1568
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:48,122
in those sad eyes.

1569
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:52,463
Wow.

1570
01:17:05,483 --> 01:17:06,950
<i>Dear baby.</i>

1571
01:17:07,052 --> 01:17:10,749
<i>Somewhere in the space
between the pie baking</i>

1572
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:13,688
<i>and Earl eating it
later that night,</i>

1573
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:17,250
<i>began the most intimate
conversation of my life.</i>

1574
01:17:17,362 --> 01:17:20,354
<i>About my mama,
about how much she loved me,</i>

1575
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:23,832
<i>how sad she'd be to see my life
turned out like this.</i>

1576
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:27,393
<i>About Earl and how he changed
after we married,</i>

1577
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:29,996
<i>became someone I feared.</i>

1578
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:34,704
<i>About how lonely it is to be
a woman so poor and so afraid.</i>

1579
01:17:34,813 --> 01:17:37,543
<i>And then I was addicted, baby.</i>

1580
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:39,549
<i>I was addicted
to saying things</i>

1581
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:41,812
<i>and having them matter to someone.</i>

1582
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:50,955
Mm.

1583
01:17:51,062 --> 01:17:55,260
I've never had a real best friend before,
except for my mama.

1584
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,834
You feel like a best friend.

1585
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:00,694
I have something for you.

1586
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:02,204
A present.

1587
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:04,036
A present for me?

1588
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:05,142
Yes, for you.

1589
01:18:05,176 --> 01:18:07,337
I hope this is not
some damn baby thing.

1590
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:09,276
No. This is for you.

1591
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,613
Mm-hmm...

1592
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,346
Excuse me.

1593
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:17,853
Hello.

1594
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:19,753
Okay.

1595
01:18:19,858 --> 01:18:22,258
Okay.

1596
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,225
Yes. No, Mrs. Hesdra,

1597
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:26,297
I think that'll be fine.
No, just keep taking

1598
01:18:26,398 --> 01:18:29,060
the painkillers I gave you
and stay on the antibiotics.

1599
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,032
Oh, my God.

1600
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:32,535
No, no, that's fine.

1601
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,195
No, just...

1602
01:18:34,305 --> 01:18:35,704
Right. If you have
any more problems,

1603
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:36,967
just call me in two days.

1604
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:38,474
Okay. You're welcome.

1605
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:39,736
Take care.

1606
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:42,980
Do you like it?

1607
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:48,648
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

1608
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:50,584
I had it made for you.

1609
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,246
It must have cost a fortune.

1610
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:53,381
No, not really.

1611
01:18:53,491 --> 01:18:54,753
You shouldn't have done this.

1612
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:57,794
I can't buy you nothing back.

1613
01:18:57,896 --> 01:19:00,456
I don't want you to buy me anything.

1614
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:04,433
Why'd you give this
to me, Dr. Pomatter?

1615
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,060
You know why.

1616
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:08,071
No, I don't.

1617
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:11,069
Because I am falling

1618
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,235
head over heels...

1619
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:49,780
We're gathered here today

1620
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:52,372
to celebrate the love
between Ogie Anhorn

1621
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:55,214
and Dawn Williams...
to join them together

1622
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,515
in holy matrimony for
the rest of their natural lives.

1623
01:19:57,622 --> 01:19:58,850
Can I say something?

1624
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:02,352
Sure.

1625
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:07,329
Spontaneous wedding poetry,
right now.

1626
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:11,160
The title is "Yes."

1627
01:20:11,269 --> 01:20:16,172
Dawn, every time I look
at you, I think yes,

1628
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:19,175
yes, we're driven by true love.

1629
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:21,575
Yes, I'm more than just he who audits.

1630
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:28,278
Yes, I'm poetry and I'm sex,
and I'm living a dream.

1631
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:30,354
I am, from now on,

1632
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:33,151
whoever you need me to be.

1633
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:37,888
Yes, yes, yes.

1634
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:41,493
Oh, Ogie.

1635
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,794
This reminds me of my third wedding.

1636
01:21:13,898 --> 01:21:14,956
Terry Lynn Lemon.

1637
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:16,556
She had big ones.

1638
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:19,796
Joe, that's not a very
respectful thing to say.

1639
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:22,065
I'm just pointing out
her good qualities.

1640
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:23,401
She was nasty.

1641
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:24,873
I'm going to invent

1642
01:21:24,976 --> 01:21:29,811
a special pie for you called
"Old Joe's Horny Past Pie."

1643
01:21:29,914 --> 01:21:32,382
Have to wait a bit, I'm afraid.

1644
01:21:32,483 --> 01:21:34,348
- I'm going in the hospital next week.
- Oh.

1645
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:35,578
Liver stuff.

1646
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:37,814
Got to have a piece of it removed.

1647
01:21:37,922 --> 01:21:39,480
Maybe I'll even die.

1648
01:21:39,591 --> 01:21:41,889
Don't be stupid.
You won't die.

1649
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:53,970
If I'd ever met a girl
like you, Jenna,

1650
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:57,769
my whole life could
have been different.

1651
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:03,303
You don't even know
what you are deep inside.

1652
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:06,440
You're not just
some little waitress.

1653
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:09,247
You understand what I'm saying?

1654
01:22:09,354 --> 01:22:11,447
Not at all, no.

1655
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:16,858
I'm saying, my whole life
I spent lost.

1656
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:19,623
If a sign said "go this way,"
I'd go the other way.

1657
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:23,030
Time after time after time.

1658
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:25,932
I turned the wrong corner,
made the wrong choice,

1659
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:30,667
went the wrong way,
like a chicken without a head.

1660
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:32,140
You understand?

1661
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,711
You was a chicken without a head?

1662
01:22:34,812 --> 01:22:38,043
Pie lady, listen to me.

1663
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,640
This life will kill you.

1664
01:22:40,752 --> 01:22:42,811
I'm saying...

1665
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,911
make the right choice.

1666
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:46,547
Start fresh.

1667
01:22:46,658 --> 01:22:48,125
It's never too late.

1668
01:22:48,226 --> 01:22:49,693
Start fresh.

1669
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:53,321
I ain't got no money, Joe.

1670
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:56,491
Who the hell does anymore?

1671
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:59,900
And I'm about to have me a baby.

1672
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:02,939
I know you are, Jenna.

1673
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,601
I know you are.

1674
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:09,009
I was just dreaming
a little for you,

1675
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:12,981
'cause... all my dreams is gone.

1676
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:17,611
Oh, no.

1677
01:23:40,912 --> 01:23:42,812
Jenna...

1678
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:46,611
I'm very upset with you.

1679
01:23:46,718 --> 01:23:49,084
I'll be waiting in the car.

1680
01:23:49,187 --> 01:23:52,748
You have 30 seconds to get
your ass in gear and join me.

1681
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:54,950
30 seconds!

1682
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:03,732
You wasn't exaggerating.

1683
01:24:03,835 --> 01:24:05,325
Your husband is terrible.

1684
01:24:05,436 --> 01:24:07,336
Jenna...

1685
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:09,668
- Honey, congratulations.
- Okay, Jenna.

1686
01:24:09,774 --> 01:24:11,901
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1687
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:20,717
Earl...

1688
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:22,652
No, you don't say nothing.

1689
01:24:22,754 --> 01:24:24,779
You don't say one word.

1690
01:24:24,889 --> 01:24:27,016
Not one word.

1691
01:24:29,293 --> 01:24:31,022
You just sit there.

1692
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,755
Earl, that hurts.

1693
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,663
Open the cabinet

1694
01:24:36,768 --> 01:24:38,759
where the coffee
and the sugar jars are.

1695
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,962
I don't want...

1696
01:24:40,071 --> 01:24:41,800
Just open it!

1697
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:46,839
What is that?

1698
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:48,969
Jenna, what is that?

1699
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,274
Money.

1700
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:52,008
It's all over the fucking house!

1701
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:53,947
In cabinets, in drawers,

1702
01:24:54,051 --> 01:24:56,212
under chairs, in closets!

1703
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,619
Money hidden all over my house!

1704
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:00,724
I'm sorry...

1705
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:02,726
Yeah, after everything
I've done for you...

1706
01:25:02,827 --> 01:25:05,523
you go and hide money from me?

1707
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:06,790
I'm sorry.

1708
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:27,684
You're the only thing
I ever loved, Jenna.

1709
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:33,386
And you're the only person
to ever belong to me.

1710
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:36,824
And you having a secret from me,

1711
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:38,589
it tears me up.

1712
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:43,829
Why was you hiding money
all over the house?

1713
01:25:45,736 --> 01:25:47,363
I don't know.

1714
01:25:50,007 --> 01:25:53,067
Tell me you was going
to buy me a present.

1715
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:55,873
I was going to buy you a present.

1716
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,677
Tell me you was going
to surprise me.

1717
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:02,184
I was going to surprise you.

1718
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:06,249
Just hold me.

1719
01:26:20,671 --> 01:26:22,161
Truth is, Earl...

1720
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:30,543
Truth is, I was saving that money...

1721
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:32,707
for the baby.

1722
01:26:32,817 --> 01:26:35,581
I was going to buy
some nice things-

1723
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:37,381
a crib,

1724
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:41,618
toys, layette-
it was all for the baby.

1725
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:45,860
It was for the baby?

1726
01:26:45,963 --> 01:26:47,555
Yeah, so I could buy a crib.

1727
01:26:50,535 --> 01:26:52,366
Yeah.

1728
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:59,235
Baby, I want us to...
I want us to be happy.

1729
01:27:02,713 --> 01:27:05,181
I want us to be happy, Jenna.

1730
01:27:14,559 --> 01:27:16,459
<i>Dear damn baby...</i>

1731
01:27:16,561 --> 01:27:18,358
<i>If'n you ever want
to know the story</i>

1732
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:20,930
<i>of how we bought your damn crib,
I will tell you.</i>

1733
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:23,296
<i>Your crib was bought
with the money</i>

1734
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:25,665
<i>that was supposed
to buy me a new life.</i>

1735
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:28,204
<i>Every time I lay you down
in that damn crib,</i>

1736
01:27:28,306 --> 01:27:29,306
<i>I'm going to think,</i>

1737
01:27:29,407 --> 01:27:32,137
<i>"Damn baby, damn crib.</i>

1738
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:35,337
<i>Me stuck like a pin
in this damn life. "</i>

1739
01:27:37,348 --> 01:27:39,043
Hey, guess what, sugar?

1740
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:41,744
We got enough money left,
I can buy me a nice video camera.

1741
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:44,218
Film you being pregnant,
the birth, film the baby.

1742
01:27:44,322 --> 01:27:46,347
Maybe when you get
a figure back we can make

1743
01:27:46,457 --> 01:27:49,620
a few nasty tapes,
if you know what I mean.

1744
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:52,195
Sounds wonderful, Earl.

1745
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:06,100
Sit up for me, Jenna.

1746
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:31,129
I wish I could stop everything
and run away with you.

1747
01:28:31,235 --> 01:28:33,863
Me, too.

1748
01:28:33,971 --> 01:28:36,462
Where could we go?

1749
01:28:36,574 --> 01:28:38,542
I would go in a second.
I would drop everything.

1750
01:28:38,643 --> 01:28:40,873
Make it go away.

1751
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:44,847
What?

1752
01:28:44,949 --> 01:28:47,474
Everything else in my life.

1753
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:59,122
That's a normal reading.

1754
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,925
Jenna, get dressed.

1755
01:29:05,036 --> 01:29:06,731
Meet me outside.

1756
01:29:06,837 --> 01:29:08,998
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1757
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:11,700
We're going someplace.

1758
01:29:11,809 --> 01:29:14,835
We might even run away.

1759
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:18,676
We'll figure it out.

1760
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:20,410
I mean it.

1761
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,883
Don't you spray me! Don't you dare spray me!

1762
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:29,960
Hunter, no!

1763
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:31,756
No! No!

1764
01:29:31,862 --> 01:29:33,227
What did I say?

1765
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,356
Hunter, no!

1766
01:29:37,601 --> 01:29:39,569
Nobody ever tells you beforehand

1767
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,900
how ridiculously hard
it's going to be.

1768
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:45,468
Come on, Hunter.

1769
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:12,696
Dr. Pomatter, I believe
my water just broke.

1770
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:28,347
Hey, sweetheart.

1771
01:30:28,452 --> 01:30:32,252
Oh, Dr. Pomatter,
this is my husband, Earl.

1772
01:30:32,356 --> 01:30:33,948
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1773
01:30:34,058 --> 01:30:35,616
Nice to meet you, Doc.

1774
01:30:35,726 --> 01:30:38,388
Excuse me, but could you
get up from that chair

1775
01:30:38,496 --> 01:30:41,192
- so I could sit next to my wife?
- Right.

1776
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,705
I would have brought you

1777
01:30:48,806 --> 01:30:51,502
some candy or flowers,
but I didn't have no time.

1778
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:52,769
That's okay, Earl.

1779
01:30:52,877 --> 01:30:55,505
I need you to rest now, Jenna.
Big moment coming soon.

1780
01:30:55,613 --> 01:30:57,843
I'll leave you folks
to your privacy. Excuse me.

1781
01:30:57,948 --> 01:31:00,439
- Dr. Pomatter...
- Yes, Jenna.

1782
01:31:00,551 --> 01:31:02,576
I just want to make sure we're
clear about one thing.

1783
01:31:02,686 --> 01:31:04,950
- What's that, Jenna?
- I want drugs.

1784
01:31:05,055 --> 01:31:07,046
I want massive amounts of drugs.

1785
01:31:07,158 --> 01:31:09,353
I want the maximum
legal limit of drugs.

1786
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:12,122
Noted and understood.

1787
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:14,060
Oh, do... do you belong here?

1788
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:15,189
Yeah, I'm kin.

1789
01:31:15,299 --> 01:31:17,290
Joe, hi!

1790
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:20,493
You having your surgery today?

1791
01:31:20,604 --> 01:31:22,367
Later this afternoon.

1792
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:24,407
Cal told me you were here.

1793
01:31:24,508 --> 01:31:26,305
Here, I bought you this card.

1794
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,537
It's silly.
Look at it later, after all

1795
01:31:28,646 --> 01:31:29,646
the fuss is over.

1796
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:30,909
- Thanks.
- Put it right next

1797
01:31:31,015 --> 01:31:32,880
- to you on the nightstand.
- I will.

1798
01:31:32,983 --> 01:31:34,575
I remember you.

1799
01:31:34,685 --> 01:31:36,380
You're the husband.

1800
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:37,977
Yeah, I'm the husband.

1801
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:40,648
Lucky for you, I didn't take
money out of Jennas check

1802
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:43,386
for all the damage you did
in my diner at that wedding.

1803
01:31:43,494 --> 01:31:46,019
Don't say nothing smart-ass.

1804
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:47,722
I'm leaving.

1805
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:49,231
Give me a hug first.

1806
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,459
Absolutely not.

1807
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,539
Earl, if you don't

1808
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:01,907
put that stinking camera away,
I'm going to smash it.

1809
01:32:03,814 --> 01:32:04,838
Earl!

1810
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,746
All right, all right.

1811
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:14,447
You're doing great, sweetheart.

1812
01:32:17,061 --> 01:32:18,426
You're doing great.

1813
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:19,723
What am I doing?

1814
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:22,264
Try and steady your breathing, hon.

1815
01:32:22,366 --> 01:32:24,334
Hi. I'm Francine Pomatter.

1816
01:32:24,435 --> 01:32:25,959
Jim's told me so much about you.

1817
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:29,904
He thinks you're just
a terrific woman.

1818
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:31,235
So you must be.

1819
01:32:31,342 --> 01:32:32,707
Did I mention my wife
is a resident here?

1820
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:35,472
I think you might have
mentioned that.

1821
01:32:35,579 --> 01:32:38,912
He's so proud of me.
He tells everybody.

1822
01:32:39,016 --> 01:32:41,712
She going to be here
through the whole delivery?

1823
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:44,845
I mean, are all the residents
going to be here?

1824
01:32:44,955 --> 01:32:46,115
No, no, they were just here

1825
01:32:46,223 --> 01:32:47,781
to witness the administration of the epidural.

1826
01:32:47,892 --> 01:32:49,223
So I'm clearing the room now.

1827
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:50,350
So everybody out.

1828
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:58,226
She's fully dilated, Doctor.
I think it's time for her to push.

1829
01:32:58,335 --> 01:32:59,927
Let's go.

1830
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:02,972
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10...

1831
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:08,978
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

1832
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,547
seven, eight, nine, 10...

1833
01:33:11,649 --> 01:33:13,947
That was a good one, Jenna.
That was a good one.

1834
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:16,281
- One, two, three, four, five...
- We're getting close.

1835
01:33:16,387 --> 01:33:18,048
- Good, good.
- ...six, seven, eight, nine...

1836
01:33:18,155 --> 01:33:20,885
Good, we're almost there.

1837
01:33:20,991 --> 01:33:23,926
- We're almost there, sugar.
- One, two, three, four, five...

1838
01:33:24,028 --> 01:33:27,122
...six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

1839
01:33:27,231 --> 01:33:30,291
I don't want no baby, Earl!

1840
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:37,003
Oh, it's a girl.

1841
01:33:41,612 --> 01:33:43,637
How do you like that?

1842
01:33:43,747 --> 01:33:47,911
Would you like to cut the cord,
Mr. Hunterson?

1843
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:50,316
Yeah. Why not?

1844
01:34:00,998 --> 01:34:04,991
Would you like to hold your baby, Mrs. Hunterson?

1845
01:34:05,102 --> 01:34:09,266
Mrs. Hunterson.
Did you hear me?

1846
01:34:10,674 --> 01:34:12,801
Are you okay?

1847
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:15,208
Mrs. Hunterson?

1848
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:21,744
Give her to me.

1849
01:34:35,733 --> 01:34:37,826
Oh, my God.

1850
01:34:44,808 --> 01:34:46,708
Oh, my God.

1851
01:35:25,215 --> 01:35:26,682
Hey.

1852
01:35:26,784 --> 01:35:28,046
Do you remember what I said?

1853
01:35:28,152 --> 01:35:30,985
Don't you go loving
that baby too much.

1854
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:33,147
I don't love you, Earl.

1855
01:35:33,257 --> 01:35:34,690
I haven't loved you for years.

1856
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:36,054
I want a divorce.

1857
01:35:37,327 --> 01:35:38,419
That's not a funny joke.

1858
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:40,121
We got this new baby here.

1859
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:41,629
Shouldn't be making jokes like that.

1860
01:35:41,732 --> 01:35:44,200
I want you the hell out of my life.

1861
01:35:44,301 --> 01:35:46,201
You are never to touch me,
ever again.

1862
01:35:46,303 --> 01:35:47,668
I am done with you.

1863
01:35:47,771 --> 01:35:50,740
If you ever come
within six yards of me,

1864
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:53,332
I will flatten your sorry ass,
and I will enjoy doing it.

1865
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:00,345
Now hold on a second.

1866
01:36:25,843 --> 01:36:29,279
Lulu- that's your name.

1867
01:36:30,981 --> 01:36:33,347
Little Lulu.

1868
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:37,784
We're going to have so much fun,
little girl.

1869
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,152
We're going to have

1870
01:36:40,257 --> 01:36:42,953
so... much... fun.

1871
01:36:54,271 --> 01:36:56,466
Jenna, sweet,

1872
01:36:56,573 --> 01:36:58,200
- you got to wake up.
- Hmm?

1873
01:36:58,308 --> 01:36:59,866
We got to wake you. It's time to go.

1874
01:36:59,977 --> 01:37:02,707
Earl's refusing to pay,
so they're kicking you out.

1875
01:37:02,813 --> 01:37:04,303
- Oh, I can't go home.
- You gonna come stay

1876
01:37:04,414 --> 01:37:06,405
with us for a while till
you get back on your feet.

1877
01:37:06,517 --> 01:37:07,916
You could stay with us,

1878
01:37:08,018 --> 01:37:10,578
but I thought Phil's convulsions
might frighten the baby.

1879
01:37:10,687 --> 01:37:13,315
Oh, I got to see that baby!

1880
01:37:13,423 --> 01:37:15,220
Oh, a beautiful baby girl!

1881
01:37:15,325 --> 01:37:17,054
Oh...

1882
01:37:17,161 --> 01:37:18,355
Look at that little girl!

1883
01:37:18,462 --> 01:37:20,589
Cute little girl.

1884
01:37:20,697 --> 01:37:22,392
Little, tiny baby girl.

1885
01:37:22,499 --> 01:37:24,933
Lulu, the love of my life.

1886
01:37:25,035 --> 01:37:28,402
Hon, we have some bad news for you.

1887
01:37:28,505 --> 01:37:30,439
Old Joe was admitted
to the hospital

1888
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:31,541
same day you were.

1889
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:33,271
No, I know, he came by

1890
01:37:33,377 --> 01:37:34,377
to see me.

1891
01:37:34,378 --> 01:37:36,869
Well, he's not doing so well.

1892
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,845
In fact, he went into a coma

1893
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:40,940
and they don't think
he's going to recover.

1894
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:43,281
No! Oh, poor Joe.

1895
01:37:43,387 --> 01:37:45,287
I know you like him.

1896
01:37:45,389 --> 01:37:48,381
You're probably the only person alive
that likes him, though.

1897
01:37:48,492 --> 01:37:49,492
Becky!

1898
01:37:49,493 --> 01:37:51,324
I'm sorry,
but he's a scaly old gator.

1899
01:37:51,428 --> 01:37:52,793
No, he's dear.

1900
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,887
He came in, he gave me this card.

1901
01:37:54,998 --> 01:37:57,626
Where'd I put that?

1902
01:37:57,734 --> 01:38:00,635
I set it down right over here.

1903
01:38:00,737 --> 01:38:03,570
- Look at the baby. Look at that.
- She's so cute.

1904
01:38:03,674 --> 01:38:06,575
Oh, the tiniest little hands.

1905
01:38:06,677 --> 01:38:08,406
Look at the little nose.

1906
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,706
Oh, she's pretty.

1907
01:38:09,813 --> 01:38:11,906
- Jenna, she's real pretty.
- Jenna, she's...

1908
01:38:14,051 --> 01:38:16,417
Little girl, little girl

1909
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,250
Little baby girl

1910
01:38:19,356 --> 01:38:21,824
We love that baby girl

1911
01:38:21,925 --> 01:38:24,587
She's the cutest baby in...

1912
01:38:44,248 --> 01:38:46,478
Is it a nice card?

1913
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:50,619
Yeah, it's okay.

1914
01:38:50,721 --> 01:38:52,188
He made me a drawing.

1915
01:38:52,289 --> 01:38:53,313
You want to see it?

1916
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:55,118
Yeah, okay.

1917
01:38:59,229 --> 01:39:00,594
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1918
01:39:00,697 --> 01:39:01,697
Isn't that nice?

1919
01:39:01,698 --> 01:39:04,258
Yeah.

1920
01:39:04,368 --> 01:39:06,461
It's pretty nice.

1921
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,868
Jenna?

1922
01:39:08,972 --> 01:39:10,599
Jenna, where you going?

1923
01:39:10,707 --> 01:39:13,141
Oh, they're kicking me out.

1924
01:39:13,243 --> 01:39:14,301
Uh, ladies, would you mind

1925
01:39:14,411 --> 01:39:16,345
if I had a minute
alone with my patient

1926
01:39:16,446 --> 01:39:18,073
to talk to her before she leaves?

1927
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:19,181
Oh...

1928
01:39:19,182 --> 01:39:20,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

1929
01:39:20,484 --> 01:39:22,076
- Thanks.
- Here, Becky, take her.

1930
01:39:22,185 --> 01:39:23,345
Oh, goodness.

1931
01:39:23,453 --> 01:39:25,978
Come here, baby.
Come here, little baby.

1932
01:39:26,089 --> 01:39:29,616
You come see Aunt Becky.
You come see Aunt Becky.

1933
01:39:29,726 --> 01:39:30,852
Oh, my goodness.

1934
01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:32,258
Thanks, ladies.

1935
01:39:32,362 --> 01:39:33,522
Okay.

1936
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:36,497
Look at you.

1937
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,431
Dawn, look at her face.

1938
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:45,534
I know what you're thinking.

1939
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:49,373
No, I don't. That's a lie.

1940
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:50,878
What are you thinking?

1941
01:39:50,981 --> 01:39:56,180
I'm thinking...
I could never thank you enough

1942
01:39:56,286 --> 01:39:58,516
for everything you've done for me.

1943
01:39:58,622 --> 01:40:01,318
I'm thinking
your wife's around

1944
01:40:01,425 --> 01:40:02,983
and you probably shouldn't kiss me.

1945
01:40:03,093 --> 01:40:05,857
The way she looks at you,

1946
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:08,692
so much trust.

1947
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:14,470
So that's it?

1948
01:40:14,571 --> 01:40:16,539
It's over?
I don't have any say in this?

1949
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:20,076
We could have a big drama here
that gets drawn out for a couple years,

1950
01:40:20,177 --> 01:40:21,474
makes everyone miserable.

1951
01:40:21,578 --> 01:40:26,072
Or we could just end it
right here, you know?

1952
01:40:26,183 --> 01:40:28,845
No body count, just say bye-bye.

1953
01:40:30,454 --> 01:40:32,945
I'm saying bye-bye.

1954
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:37,692
Dawn, wheel me off now, okay?

1955
01:40:37,794 --> 01:40:38,886
Off? Okay.

1956
01:40:38,995 --> 01:40:40,860
Wheel me off.

1957
01:40:40,964 --> 01:40:42,556
Wait, wheel me back.

1958
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:47,994
Here...

1959
01:40:49,506 --> 01:40:50,506
Take this.

1960
01:40:54,411 --> 01:40:55,969
Okay, wheel me off again.

1961
01:41:17,234 --> 01:41:19,134
What the heck was that all about?

1962
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:21,329
Oh, nothing.
I just had an affair with him.

1963
01:41:21,438 --> 01:41:22,530
Your doctor?

1964
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,436
Yeah, and he's married.
Nice lady, too.

1965
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,099
Jenna!

1966
01:41:26,209 --> 01:41:28,905
I just ended it for good.

1967
01:41:29,012 --> 01:41:31,173
Here, give Lulu to me.

1968
01:41:31,281 --> 01:41:33,408
Okay. Go see your mommy.

1969
01:41:33,517 --> 01:41:34,916
Hi!

1970
01:41:35,018 --> 01:41:39,853
Geez, I never seen a baby
this beautiful.

1971
01:41:39,956 --> 01:41:41,753
You ever seen a baby this beautiful?

1972
01:41:41,858 --> 01:41:43,416
No.

1973
01:42:16,426 --> 01:42:18,519
Baby, don't you cry

1974
01:42:18,628 --> 01:42:20,186
Gonna make a pie

1975
01:42:20,297 --> 01:42:24,529
Gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle

1976
01:42:24,634 --> 01:42:26,534
Baby, don't be blue

1977
01:42:26,636 --> 01:42:28,695
Gonna make for you

1978
01:42:28,805 --> 01:42:33,174
Gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle

1979
01:42:33,276 --> 01:42:37,042
Gonna be a pie
from heaven above

1980
01:42:37,147 --> 01:42:40,742
Gonna be filled
with strawberry love

1981
01:42:40,851 --> 01:42:44,981
Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie

1982
01:42:45,088 --> 01:42:50,219
Hold you forever
in the middle of my heart.

1983
01:43:45,815 --> 01:43:47,407
Bye!

1984
01:43:47,517 --> 01:43:49,280
Bye!

1985
01:43:49,386 --> 01:43:52,048
- Bye, y'all!
- Bye-bye!

1986
01:43:52,155 --> 01:43:54,180
How do you say "good-bye"?

1987
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:55,656
Bye, bye, bye!

1988
01:43:55,759 --> 01:43:57,386
Bye, bye, bye!

1989
01:43:59,529 --> 01:44:00,529
Bye-bye.

1990
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:02,054
Bye!

1991
01:44:02,165 --> 01:44:04,599
Bye!

1992
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:06,601
You want to walk?

1993
01:44:23,853 --> 01:44:24,853
Bye!

1994
01:44:24,888 --> 01:44:26,480
Bye!
