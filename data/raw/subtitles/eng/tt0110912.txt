1
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:31,406
Forget it. It's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:34,806
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,725
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

4
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:39,165
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,524
- You forget about it in a day or two.
- The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,603
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,723
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,722
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
- You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:53,082
- Quack, quack, quack.
- Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,521
Since I'm never gonna
do it again, you're never
gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:56,761 --> 00:01:01,120
- After tonight?
- Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,519
- Can I get anyone more coffee?
- Oh, yes!

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,118
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:11,158
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,877
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,957
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:18,916
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you
in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:23,035
They're insured. Why should
they give a fuck? I don't even
need a gun in a Federal bank.

19
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,434
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:29,354
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:32,833
"We got this guy's little girl."
"If you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill her."

22
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,592
- Did it work?
- Fuckin' right it worked.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:41,231
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone. Not a pistol,
not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:45,750
- Cleans the place out.
They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
- Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,389
There probably never was
a little girl. The point of
the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,309
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:55,228
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,627
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:01,706
- No more liquor stores?
- What've we been talkin' about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,586
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be. There's too many
foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,505
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,865
You tell 'em empty out
the register, they don't know
what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:10,784
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:14,904
- We keep on, one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him.
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:19,103
I don't want to either.
But they'll probably put us
in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:21,022
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:23,622
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:27,941
You got Grandpa Irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,860
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,780
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,659
- We're out of it.
- Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,258
- Not in this life.
- What then?

43
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,858
Garçon, coffee!

44
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,457
This place.

45
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:49,136
Garçon means boy.

46
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:53,175
This place?
A coffee shop?

47
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:56,095
What's wrong with that?

48
00:02:56,334 --> 00:03:00,534
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,933
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:06,572
gas stations; you get your head
blown off stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,171
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:13,771
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:18,170
- I bet you could cut down on the
hero factor in a place like this.
- Correct.

54
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,369
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,688
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:26,488
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:30,327
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it.
No way they're takin' a bullet
for the register.

58
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,206
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,726
really give a fuck
you're stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,765
Customers sittin' there
with food in their mouths,
they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:43,284
One minute, they're havin'
a Denver omelet, the next, someone
is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:48,243
See, I got the idea the last
liquor store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,882
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:54,642
You got the idea
of takin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:57,961
- Thank you.
- Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

66
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,240
- Yes, we did.
- A lot of people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,800
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,439
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,198
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,597
- Come on.
- All right. Same as
last time, remember?

71
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,916
You're crowd control.
I'll handle the employees.

72
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,475
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

73
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,914
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

74
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:31,753
Any of you fucking pricks move,

75
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:35,873
and I'll execute
every motherfuckin' last one of you.

76
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,609
- ## Jungle boogie #
- # Get down with the boogie #

77
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,768
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get it on #

78
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:28,928
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get down with the boogie #

79
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:31,127
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get it on #

80
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,367
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get up with the boogie #

81
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,406
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get up with the get down #

82
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,686
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Get down and boogie #

83
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:42,405
- # Jungle boogie #
- # Shake it around ##

84
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:51,243
- Okay, so tell me again
about the hash bars.
- Okay, what you want to know?

85
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:54,002
- Hash is legal there, right?
- It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

86
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:58,521
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

87
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,800
I mean, they want you to smoke in
your home or certain designated places.

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,400
- Those are hash bars?
- Yeah. It breaks down like this.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,719
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

90
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,839
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

91
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,118
It's illegal to carry it,
but-but that doesn't matter,
'cause get a load of this.

92
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:18,477
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam, it's illegal
for them to search you.

93
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:22,316
- I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.
- Oh, man! I'm goin'.

94
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,835
That's all there is to it.
I'm fuckin' goin'.

95
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,715
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

96
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:30,394
- But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?
- What?

97
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:34,233
It's the little differences.
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here,

98
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:37,713
- But it's just there,
it's a little different.
- Example.

99
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:40,792
You can walk into a movie theatre
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

100
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:44,351
And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

101
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:48,070
And in Paris, you can buy
a beer in McDonald's.
You know what they call...

102
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,510
a Quarter-Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

103
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,669
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

104
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:56,428
They got the metric system.
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

105
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,228
- What do they call it?
- They call it a Royale with Cheese.

106
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:01,707
- Royale with Cheese.
- That's right.

107
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,627
What do they call a Big Mac?

108
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,866
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it Le Big Mac.

109
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,946
Le Big Mac.

110
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:13,985
- What do they call a Whopper?
- I don't know. I didn't
go into Burger King.

111
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,344
- You know what they put on French fries
in Holland instead of ketchup?
- What?

112
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,303
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

113
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:26,102
- I seen 'em do it, man.
They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
- Yuck.

114
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:31,821
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

115
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,700
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

116
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,219
- That's countin' our guy?
- Not sure.

117
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,578
- So that means that it could be
up to five guys up there?
- It's possible.

118
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,898
We should have
fuckin' shotguns.

119
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,537
- What's her name?
- Mia.

120
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,616
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?
- I don't know.

121
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:55,136
However people meet people.
She used to be a actress.

122
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,615
Oh, really?
She do anything I'd have seen?

123
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,934
- I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.
- Pilot? What's a pilot?

124
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,373
- Well, you know the shows on TV?
- I don't watch TV.

125
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,933
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

126
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:11,972
- And on this invention
they show shows, right?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:16,251
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

128
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:19,130
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

129
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,010
and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if
they wanna make more shows.

130
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,409
Some get chosen and
become television programmes.
Some don't, become nothin'.

131
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,568
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

132
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:32,287
You remember
Antwan Rockamora?

133
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:36,007
Half-black, half-Samoan.
Used to call him "Tony Rocky Horror".

134
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:39,366
- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?
- I wouldn't go so far as to
call the brother fat.

135
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:42,125
I mean, he got a weight problem.
What's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

136
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:46,444
- I think I know who you mean.
What about him?
- Marsellus fucked him up good.

137
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,563
Word 'round the campfire is
it was on account of
Marsellus Wallace's wife.

138
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:02,241
- So what he'd do? Fuck her?
- No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

139
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:07,480
- Well, then what then?
- He gave her a foot massage.

140
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,199
A foot massage?

141
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,239
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,158
Then what'd Marsellus do?

143
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:17,278
Sent a couple cats over to his place.
They took him out on his patio.

144
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:21,117
Threw his ass over the balcony.
Nigger fell four stories.

145
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:25,076
He had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

146
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:27,315
Nigger fell through that.

147
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:31,514
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

148
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:35,833
- That's a damn shame.
- Hmm.

149
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:42,392
- But still, you play
with matches, you get burned.
- What do you mean?

150
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:46,431
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage.

151
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:48,871
You don't think he overreacted?

152
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:53,590
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

153
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:57,669
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothin'.
I give my mother a foot massage.

154
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:01,108
It's laying your hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus's new wife.

155
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:05,907
I mean, is it as bad as eatin'
her pussy out? No, but it's
the same fuckin' ballpark.

156
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,986
Whoa, stop right there.
Eatin' the bitch out...

157
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:10,546
and givin' the bitch a foot massage
ain't even the same fucking thing.

158
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:14,385
- It's not. It's the same ballpark.
- Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

159
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,264
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine.

160
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:20,944
But touchin' his wife's feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies...

161
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:25,103
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark;
it ain't the same league;
it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

162
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:28,862
- Foot massages don't mean shit!
- Have you ever given a foot massage?

163
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,901
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.

164
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,541
- I'm the foot fuckin' master.
- You given a lot of them?

165
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,660
Shit, yeah!
Got my technique down and everything.
I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

166
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,539
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

167
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,218
- Fuck you.

168
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,258
- You give 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

169
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:51,457
- You know, I'm kind of tired.
I could use a foot massage.
- Yo, yo, yo, man.

170
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:55,536
You best back off.
I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

171
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:59,695
- This is the door.
- Yeah, it is.

172
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,254
What time you got?

173
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:05,374
7:22 in the a.m.

174
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:10,453
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

175
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,731
Look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man
a foot massage don't make it right...

176
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,850
for Marsellus to throw
Antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin' house,

177
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,569
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks;
that shit ain't right.

178
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,688
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyse my ass,
'cause I kill the motherfucker.

179
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:34,527
I ain't sayin' it's right,
but you sayin' a massage don't mean
nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

180
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:39,006
Now, look, I've given a million
ladies a million foot massages,
and they all meant somethin'.

181
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:42,686
We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's
so fuckin' cool about them.

182
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,765
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...

183
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:47,924
where you don't talk about it,
but you know it and she knows it.

184
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:52,843
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan
should've fuckin' better known better.

185
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,122
That's his fuckin' wife, man.
This ain't a man with a sense
of humour about this shit.

186
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:59,882
You know what I'm sayin'?

187
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:01,801
It's an interestin' point.

188
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,321
Come on.
Let's get into character.

189
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,279
- What's her name again?
- Mia.

190
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,278
- Mia.
- Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

191
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:20,357
He's goin' out of town, Florida.
And he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

192
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:24,236
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

193
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:27,516
Show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get Ionely.

194
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,035
You're gonna be takin'
Mia Wallace out on a date?

195
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,595
It is not a date.

196
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:36,594
It's just like if you were
gonna take your buddy's wife
to a movie or somethin'.

197
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:41,673
- It's just good company, that's all.

198
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:49,871
- It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

199
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,309
Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'?

200
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:02,548
Hey, keep chillin'.

201
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,546
You know who we are?

202
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:13,386
We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

203
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:17,985
You do remember
your business partner, don't you?

204
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:23,383
Now, let me take
a wild guess here.

205
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,663
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:30,862
I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace,

207
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,701
don't ya, Brett?

208
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,341
Yeah, I remember.

209
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,580
Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

210
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,180
Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'?

211
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,139
Hamburgers.

212
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,378
Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

213
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:50,657
What kind of hamburgers?

214
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,377
- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no.

215
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:55,416
Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box?

216
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:58,176
- Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger.

217
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,215
Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

218
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:05,014
I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

219
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,694
They're... They're good.

220
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:10,293
You mind if I try
one of yours?

221
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:14,292
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

222
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,370
Mmmm.

223
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,450
This is a tasty burger!
Vincent!

224
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,849
You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger?

225
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,328
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

226
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,688
- I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

227
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:38,447
Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,

228
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,486
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian.

229
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,606
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm.

230
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:49,005
You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

231
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:51,084
- No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent.

232
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:55,003
- A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese.

233
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:58,403
You know why they call it that?

234
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:02,362
Uh, because of
the metric system?

235
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:05,601
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

236
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,480
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

237
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,159
- What's in this?
- Sprite.

238
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,079
Sprite. Good.

239
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:18,838
You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?

240
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,277
Go right ahead.

241
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,354
That hit the spot.

242
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:39,314
You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

243
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:42,753
- Why don't you tell my man
Vince here where you got the shit hid.
- It's over...

244
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:47,912
I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing!

245
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,551
You were sayin'?

246
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,230
It's in the cupboard.

247
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,749
N-No, the one
by your kn-knees.

248
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,344
We happy?

249
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,184
Vincent?

250
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,823
- We happy?
- Yeah, we happy.

251
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:32,942
Look, I'm sorry, uh, I...
I didn't get your name.

252
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,061
I got yours. Vincent. Right?
B-But I never got yours.

253
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:42,580
- My name's Pitt, and your ass
ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

254
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,099
I just want you
to know how...

255
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:51,378
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

256
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,537
with us and Mr Wallace.

257
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:57,936
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never...

258
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,256
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

259
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,815
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

260
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:10,094
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions".

261
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,933
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

262
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:18,212
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

263
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,891
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

264
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,050
What?

265
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,250
- What country you from?
- What?

266
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,409
- "What" ain't no country I ever
heard of. They speak English in What?
- W-What?

267
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,048
- English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?
- Yes!

268
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,768
- Then you know what I'm sayin'!
- Yes.

269
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:40,127
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

270
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,726
- What? I...
- Say "what" again!

271
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:46,566
Say "what" again! I dare ya!
I double dare you, motherfucker!

272
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:50,365
- Say "what" one more goddamn time!
- H-H-He's black.

273
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,644
- Go on!
- He's bald!

274
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:55,364
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

275
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,882
Does he look... like a bitch?

276
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:04,042
- No!
- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?

277
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:07,601
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

278
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,760
- You tried to fuck him.
- No, no.

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,879
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs Wallace.

280
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,879
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

281
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,318
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

282
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,637
Ezekiel 25:17.

283
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,837
"The path of the righteous man...

284
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:31,676
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

285
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,555
and the tyranny of evil men."

286
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:39,354
"Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

287
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,473
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

288
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:45,113
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

289
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:48,592
and the finder
of lost children."

290
00:19:48,832 --> 00:19:52,311
"And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

291
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,231
and furious anger...

292
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:58,790
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!"

293
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,549
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

294
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:05,868
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

295
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:25,904
I think you gonna find...

296
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:30,143
when all this shit
is over and done...

297
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:35,902
I think you're gonna find yourself
one smilin' motherfucker.

298
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:38,501
The thing is, Butch,

299
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:43,100
right now...
you got ability.

300
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,419
But painful as it may be,

301
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,138
ability... don't last.

302
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:54,337
And your days are just about over.

303
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:58,617
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life.

304
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:05,135
But that's a fact of life your ass
is gonna have to get realistic about.

305
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:10,574
You see, this business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

306
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:16,053
Motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

307
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:20,772
If you mean it turns
to vinegar... it does.

308
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:26,570
If you mean it gets better
with age... it don't.

309
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,050
Besides, Butch,

310
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,569
how many fights you think
you got in you anyway?

311
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,768
Hmm?

312
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,688
Two?

313
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:43,007
Boxers don't have
an old-timers' day.

314
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:46,926
You came close,
but you never made it.

315
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:51,005
And if you were gonna make it,
you would have made it before now.

316
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:10,841
You my nigger?

317
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,639
Certainly appears so.

318
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:27,557
The night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

319
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:33,156
That's pride fuckin' with you.

320
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:37,315
Fuck pride!

321
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,274
Pride only hurts.

322
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:43,513
It never helps.

323
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:47,153
You fight through that shit.

324
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:51,672
'Cause a year from now,
when you kickin' it in the Caribbean,

325
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:56,431
you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right".

326
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,509
I got no problem
with that, Mr Wallace.

327
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:07,868
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

328
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:13,627
Say it.

329
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:19,066
In the fifth,
my ass goes down.

330
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,745
Yo, Vincent Vega.
Our man in Amsterdam.

331
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:26,104
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
Get your asses on in here.

332
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:29,863
- Goddamn, nigger,
what's up with them clothes?
- You don't even want to know.

333
00:23:30,103 --> 00:23:33,063
Where's the big man?

334
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,942
The big man's right over there
takin' care of some business.

335
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:41,901
Why don't you hang back a second or two.
You see the white boy leave, go on over.

336
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
How ya been?

337
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,499
- I been doin' pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?
- All right.

338
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,778
So I hear you're
takin' Mia out tomorrow.

339
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:59,457
At Marsellus's request.

340
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:01,976
- Have you met Mia?
- Not yet.

341
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:05,096
- What's so fuckin' funny?

342
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:07,655
- Not a goddamn thing.
- I got to piss.

343
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:11,814
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot,
all right? It's the big man's wife.

344
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:14,454
I'm gonna sit across from her,
chew my food with my mouth closed,

345
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:16,413
laugh at her fuckin' jokes,
and that's it.

346
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,452
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

347
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,492
Then what'd you fuckin'
ask me about it for?

348
00:24:22,732 --> 00:24:26,571
Asshole.

349
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,049
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
- Filters?

350
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:36,569
No.

351
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:43,047
- You lookin' at somethin', friend?
- You ain't my friend, palooka.

352
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,806
- What was that?
- I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

353
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:49,366
Vincent Vega's in the house?

354
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:54,205
My nigger,
get your ass over here.

355
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,523
- What's up?
- Man, I'm really sorry.

356
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:04,682
You shouldn't worry about it.

357
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:09,201
Pack of Red Apples. $1.40.

358
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:13,840
And some matches.

359
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,679
Thanks.

360
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,998
It's as if it turns every part
of your body into the tip of a penis.

361
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:26,798
- Whoa.
- I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

362
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,117
That gun to pierce your ears,
they don't use that to pierce
your nipples, do they?

363
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:34,876
Forget that gun. That guns goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

364
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:39,595
All my piercing, 18 places on my body,
every one of 'em done with a needle.

365
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:43,034
Five in each ear, one through
the nipple of my left breast,

366
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:46,113
two in my right nostril,
one in my left eyebrow,

367
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:48,913
one in my belly,
one in my lip, one in my clit,

368
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:52,312
- And I wear a stud in my tongue.
- Excuse me.

369
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,232
I was just curious,

370
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:57,991
but, um... why would you wear
a stud in your tongue?

371
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:01,430
Sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

372
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,909
Vincenzo.
Step in my office.

373
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,747
This is Panda from Mexico.
Very good stuff.

374
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:18,106
Now, that's Bava.
Different, but equally good.

375
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,986
And that is Choco
from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

376
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:25,305
Now, the first two are the same.
300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

377
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:28,224
But this one
is a little more expensive.

378
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:30,584
This is 500 a gram.

379
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:33,903
But, when you shoot it, you will know
where that extra money went.

380
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:37,902
There's nothing wrong with these two.
This is real, real, real good shit.

381
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:41,501
But this one
is a fuckin' madman.

382
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,221
Remember, I just got back
from Amsterdam.

383
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:47,180
Am I a nigger?
Are we in Inglewood? No.

384
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,299
You're in my home. Now, white people
who know the difference...

385
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,219
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

386
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:56,538
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi
Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...

387
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,737
- Any old day of the fuckin' week.
- That's a bold statement.

388
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:03,536
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
This is a seller's market.

389
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:07,415
Coke is fuckin' dead
as... dead.

390
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:12,374
Heroin, it's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way.

391
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:15,734
- All right.
Gimme three grams of madman.
- Okay.

392
00:27:15,974 --> 00:27:19,093
Now, if it's as good as you say it is,
I'll come back and buy another thousand.

393
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,812
I just hope that I still
have some left for ya,

394
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:25,931
but I'm givin' you some
out of my own private stash.

395
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:29,011
That is what a nice guy I am.

396
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:33,010
- I'm outta balloons.
Is a baggie all right?
- Yeah, that's cool.

397
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,009
All right.
I'll just get one for ya.

398
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,808
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

399
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,768
Okay.

400
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:45,207
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?
She ain't got a boyfriend.

401
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:48,446
- You wanna hang out and get high?
- Which one's Trudi?

402
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:52,526
- The one with all the shit in her face?
- No, that's Jody.

403
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,925
That's my wife.

404
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:59,404
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

405
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,163
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace.
- All right, no problemo.

406
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,843
- I'll take a rain cheque.

407
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,122
- Oh.
- Thank you, Jody.

408
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:12,361
Still got your Malibu?

409
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,401
Oh, man, you know what some fucker
did the other day?

410
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
- What?
- Fuckin' keyed it.

411
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,839
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
- Tell me about it.

412
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,479
I had it in storage
for three years.

413
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:27,718
It was out five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

414
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:32,037
They should be fuckin' killed,
man. No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

415
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,636
I wish I could've caught him
doin' it. I'd have given
anything to catch that asshole.

416
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:41,235
- It'd been worth him doin' it
just so I could've caught him.
- What a fucker!

417
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,994
What's more chicken-shit
than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

418
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:46,834
- Don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
- You don't do it.

419
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:49,193
- It's just against the rules.
- Thank you.

420
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:51,353
Thank you.

421
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:54,112
- Mind if I shoot up here?
- Hey, mi casa es su casa.

422
00:28:54,352 --> 00:28:57,311
Muchas gracias.

423
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,929
Hi, Vincent.
I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

424
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:44,008
Come inside and make yourself
a drink. Mia.

425
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,446
Hello?

426
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,845
# Billy Raye was a preacher's son
and when his daddy would visit
he'd come along #

427
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:02,564
Vincent.

428
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:05,323
Vincent.

429
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,243
I'm on the intercom.

430
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,842
Where is...
Where is the intercom?

431
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:13,081
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

432
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,801
To your right.

433
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,200
Warm.

434
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,279
Warmer.

435
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,279
Disco.

436
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,838
Hello?

437
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:30,078
Push the button
if you want to talk.

438
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:32,117
Hello?

439
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,876
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

440
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:40,835
The bar's by the fireplace.

441
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:42,995
Okay.

442
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,394
## When he started
sweet talkin' to me #

443
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:48,114
# He come and tell me
everything is all right #

444
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:50,713
# He'd kiss me and tell me
everything is all right #

445
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,633
# Can I get away
again tonight #

446
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:55,192
# The only one who could
ever reach me #

447
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:57,792
# Was the son
of a preacher man #

448
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:00,791
# The only boy
who could ever teach me #

449
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,710
# Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was #

450
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,990
# He was #

451
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,189
- # Lord he knows he was #
- # Yes he was #

452
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,428
# How will I remember #

453
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:16,108
# The look was in his eyes #

454
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,587
# Stealing kisses from me
on the sly #

455
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:21,147
# Taking time to make time #

456
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:23,626
# Telling me that
he's all mine #

457
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:26,505
- # Learning from each other's knowin' #

458
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,585
# Looking to see
how much we've grown #

459
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,984
# And the only one
who could ever reach me #

460
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,224
# Was the son
of a preacher man #

461
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:36,143
# The only boy
who could ever teach me #

462
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:38,503
# Was the son of a preacher man
Yes, he was #

463
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:41,222
- # Was, was #
- # He was #

464
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,902
- # Oh, yes he was ##

465
00:32:44,141 --> 00:32:47,341
Let's go.

466
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,020
What the fuck is this place?

467
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:56,419
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

468
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,738
- An Elvis man should love it.

469
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:02,817
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak.
- You can get a steak here, daddy-o.

470
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,577
Don't be a...

471
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,936
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

472
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,211
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, how may I help you?

473
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:34,011
- There's a reservation under Wallace.
- Wallace?

474
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,850
- We reserved a car.

475
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:42,209
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em
over there in the Chrysler.

476
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:45,528
## School get out, baby
Gonna tell you some news #

477
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,648
# Sure do look good

00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:52,286
# One, two, buckle the shoes
Three, four, get out on the floor #

479
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:59,045
# Five, six, come get your kicks down at

480
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,364
# All right #

481
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:07,403
# I've been waitin' in school
all day long #

482
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:09,483
# Waiting on the bell to ring
so I can go home #

483
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:11,922
# Throw my books on the table
Pick up the telephone #

484
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,002
- # Come on, baby #
- Coffee, please? Decaf.

485
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:16,281
- Just a minute.
- # Heading down to the drugstore
to get a soda pop #

486
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,641
# Throw a nickel in the jukebox
Then we start to rock #

487
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:20,680
# School's out, baby
Gonna tell you some news #

488
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,720
# You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes #

489
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,359
# Well, it's one, two
Buckle the shoes #

490
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,639
# Three, four
Get out on the floor #

491
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,438
# Five, six, come get your kicks
down at the corner of Lincoln and 46th #

492
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:38,956
# Gonna rock all night
Just wait and see ##

493
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:44,235
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

494
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,114
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

495
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:52,073
- Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.
- Vincent!

496
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,432
Just to let you
all know, Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show,

497
00:34:57,672 --> 00:35:01,871
so we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jackrabbit Slim's.

498
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:04,231
Thank you.

499
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:07,590
Call for...

500
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,069
- Phil-lip Mor-ris.
- What do you think?

501
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:16,668
I think it's like
a wax museum with a pulse.

502
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:20,387
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

503
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:26,986
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh,
yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

504
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,745
- I'll have that.
- How do you want that cooked?

505
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,984
- Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?
- Bloody as hell, and...

506
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:35,664
Oh, yeah, look at this...
vanilla Coke.

507
00:35:35,904 --> 00:35:37,623
What about you, Peggy Sue?

508
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:40,863
I'll have the...

509
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:45,102
Durward Kirby burger, bloody.

510
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:48,901
And... a five-dollar shake.

511
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,580
How do you want that shake,
Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

512
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,619
- Martin and Lewis.
- Did you just order
a five-dollar shake?

513
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:57,659
Mm-hmm.

514
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:00,778
That's a shake?
That's milk and ice cream?

515
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:05,057
- Last I heard.
- That's five dollars? You don't
put bourbon in it or nothin'?

516
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,417
- No.
- Just checking.

517
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:10,056
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

518
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,976
## To Lonesome Town #

519
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:17,455
# To cry my troubles away #

520
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:21,294
Could you, um...
roll me one of those, cowboy?

521
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:24,093
You can have this one, cowgirl.

522
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,013
- Thanks.

523
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:30,012
# The streets are filled
with regret #

524
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,531
Think nothin' of it.

525
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:36,250
# Lay me down
in Lonesome Town #

526
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,730
- # I can learn to forget ##
- So...

527
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,769
Marsellus said
you just got back from Amsterdam.

528
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:45,808
- Sure did.
- How long were you there?

529
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:49,927
Just over three years.

530
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,487
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

531
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:57,126
No kiddin'?
I didn't know that.

532
00:36:57,366 --> 00:37:00,005
Why would you?

533
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:07,484
I heard you did a pilot.

534
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:11,083
- That was my 15 minutes.
- What was it?

535
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:15,682
It was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five.

536
00:37:15,922 --> 00:37:18,361
- What?
- Fox Force Five.

537
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,601
Fox, as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks.

538
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:23,040
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

539
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,760
And five, as in there's
one-two-three-four-five of us.

540
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,359
There was a blond one,
Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

541
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,438
The Japanese fox
was a kung fu master.

542
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:36,397
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

543
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:39,237
French fox's speciality was sex.

544
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:43,396
- What was your speciality?
- Knives.

545
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,475
The character I played,
Raven McCoy,

546
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:49,274
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

547
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:53,433
According to the show,
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife.

548
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:56,153
And she knew
a zillion old jokes.

549
00:37:56,393 --> 00:38:00,192
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

550
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:03,391
And if we would have got picked up,
they would've worked in a gimmick...

551
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:08,270
where every show
I would've told another joke.

552
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,990
You know any of them old jokes?

553
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,629
Well, I only got the chance to say one
'cause we only did one show.

554
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:17,948
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

555
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:20,028
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

556
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:23,667
- No, you wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.
- You'd be embarr...

557
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:27,506
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

558
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:31,265
- I promise I won't laugh.
- That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

559
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:33,585
That's not what I meant.
You know it.

560
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,944
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you
'cause it's been built up too much.

561
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:40,543
What a gyp.

562
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:44,502
Martin and Lewis.

563
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:49,741
Vanilla Coke.

564
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:55,500
Mmm. Yummy.

565
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,019
You think I could
have a sip of that?

566
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,938
Be my guest.

567
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:05,898
I gotta know what
a five-dollar shake tastes like.

568
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:09,297
- You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.
- Yeah, but maybe I do.

569
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:12,096
Cooties I can handle.

570
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:15,655
All right.

571
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:23,534
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milkshake!

572
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:29,092
- Told ya.
- I don't know if it was worth $5,
but it's pretty fuckin' good.

573
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,365
- Don't you hate that?
- Hate what?

574
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:08,284
Uncomfortable silences.

575
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:12,963
Why do we feel it's necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

576
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,802
I don't know.
That's a good question.

577
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:21,401
That's when you know
you found somebody really special.

578
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:25,960
When you can just shut the fuck up for
a minute and comfortably share silence.

579
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,599
Well, I don't think we're quite
there yet, but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

580
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,398
I'll tell you what.

581
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:37,597
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

582
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:41,876
You sit here...
and think of something to say.

583
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:45,396
I'll do that.

584
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:49,515
Okay.

585
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,229
I said goddamn!

586
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:18,948
Goddamn!
Goddamn.

587
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:23,907
I need some hair spray.

588
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,826
Mmmm.

589
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:34,065
Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you?

590
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,424
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

591
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:39,504
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

592
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:42,543
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

593
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:45,582
- Which one? There's two Monroes.
- No, there's not.

594
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:47,862
That is Marilyn Monroe.

595
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:50,541
That is Mamie Van Doren.

596
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:55,340
I don't see Jayne Mansfield,
so she must have the night off.

597
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,700
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah. I got my moments.

598
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,578
- So did you think of somethin' to say?
- Actually, I did.

599
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:08,058
However...

600
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:10,977
you seem like
a really nice person, and I...

601
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:13,736
- I don't want to offend you.
- Oooh.

602
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:18,815
This doesn't sound like
the usual, mindless, boring,
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

603
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:21,735
This sounds like you
actually have somethin' to say.

604
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:24,534
Well, well, I do. I do.

605
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:28,493
- But you have
to promise not to be offended.
- No, no.

606
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:32,612
You can't promise somethin' like that.
I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

607
00:42:32,852 --> 00:42:37,371
You can ask me what you're gonna
ask me, and my natural response
could be to get offended.

608
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:39,691
Then, through no fault of my own,
I would have broken my promise.

609
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:42,370
- Let's just forget it.
- That's an impossibility.

610
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,329
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility.

611
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:48,489
- Is that a fact?
- And besides,

612
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:53,408
- Isn't it more, uh, exciting
when you don't have permission?
- All right, all right.

613
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:56,127
Well, here goes.

614
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:59,126
What did you think about
what happened to Antwan?

615
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:02,486
- Who's Antwan?
- Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

616
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:05,645
- He fell out of a window.
- Hmm. Hmm.

617
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:10,204
Well, that is one way to say it.
Another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out.

618
00:43:10,444 --> 00:43:13,323
Another way would be
he was thrown out by Marsellus.

619
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:18,322
Yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

620
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,722
- Is that a fact?
- No.

621
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:23,801
No, it's not a fact. It's just what
I heard. That's just what I heard.

622
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,640
- Who told you?
- They.

623
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,080
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

624
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:33,719
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

625
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:37,998
- Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did "they" say?
- I'm... I'm not shy.

626
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:40,477
- Um...
- Did it involve the "F" word?

627
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:45,996
No, no, no, no, no.
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

628
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:48,395
- And?
- And... And nothin'.

629
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:51,195
That's it.

630
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:53,234
You heard Marsellus...

631
00:43:53,474 --> 00:43:57,513
threw Tony Rocky Horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

632
00:43:57,753 --> 00:43:59,433
- Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

633
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:03,832
Well, at the time
I was told it sounded reasonable.

634
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:06,871
Marsellus throwing Tony out
of a fourth-story window...

635
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,871
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

636
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,270
No, it seemed excessive,
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

637
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,909
I understand that Marsellus
is very protective of you.

638
00:44:16,149 --> 00:44:20,428
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

639
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:24,068
A husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife's feet is something else.

640
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:26,627
But did it happen?

641
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:32,266
Only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand when he
shook it... at my wedding.

642
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:34,665
Really?

643
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,905
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus
threw Tony out that window...

644
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,824
except Marsellus and Tony.

645
00:44:40,064 --> 00:44:44,903
When you little scamps get together,
you're worse than a sewing circle.

646
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:47,582
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

647
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:52,461
The world-famous
Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

648
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:58,940
Now, this is where
one lucky couple...

649
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,299
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

650
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:06,778
Now, who will be
our first contestants?

651
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:09,018
- Right here!
- All right!

652
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:11,977
- I wanna dance.
- No, no, no, no, no.

653
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:16,576
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss,

654
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:19,935
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

655
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,575
Now I wanna dance;
I wanna win; I want that trophy.

656
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:26,134
- So dance good.
- All right. You asked for it.

657
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:30,653
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

658
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:38,491
Now let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.
Young lady, what is your name?

659
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:40,491
Mrs Mia Wallace.

660
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:43,090
And how 'bout your fella here?

661
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,890
Vincent Vega.

662
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,249
All right, let's see what you can do.
Take it away!

663
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:52,768
- Go for it.
- Come on!

664
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:14,083
## It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well #

665
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:19,842
# You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle #

666
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:25,761
# And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell #

667
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:31,760
# C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell #

668
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,558
# They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebucks sale #

669
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:43,477
# The 'coolerador was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale #

670
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:48,996
# But when Pierre found work
the little money comin'
worked out well #

671
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:55,114
# C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell #

672
00:46:55,314 --> 00:47:00,953
# They had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast #

673
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:06,992
# Seven hundred little records
all rock, rhythm and jazz #

674
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:12,591
# But when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell #

675
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:19,269
# C'est la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell #

676
00:47:42,264 --> 00:47:47,783
# They had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well #

677
00:47:48,303 --> 00:47:53,462
# You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle ##

678
00:48:25,854 --> 00:48:28,734
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

679
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:32,053
I don't know
what you call that.

680
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:35,532
- Drinks! Music!

681
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:37,732
I'm gonna take a piss.

682
00:48:37,972 --> 00:48:44,170
That's a little bit more information
than I needed, but go right ahead.

683
00:48:55,288 --> 00:48:56,928
## Girl #

684
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,767
# Bomp, bomp, bom #

685
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:03,806
# You'll be a woman soon #

686
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:07,605
# I love you so much
Can't count all the ways #

687
00:49:07,845 --> 00:49:10,565
# I'd die for you, girl
and all they can say is #

688
00:49:10,805 --> 00:49:13,684
# He's not your kind #

689
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:18,763
# You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around #

690
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:21,122
# What I'm gonna find #

691
00:49:21,362 --> 00:49:25,121
# Don't let them
make up your mind #

692
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:29,161
# Don't you know, girl #

693
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,720
# You'll be a woman soon #

694
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,759
One drink, and that's it.

695
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:41,118
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

696
00:49:41,198 --> 00:49:44,997
Say good night...
and go home.

697
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:50,756
# You'll be a woman soon #

698
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:53,915
# Soon #

699
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:58,754
# You'll be a woman #

700
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:01,433
# I've been misunderstood
for all of my life #

701
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,713
# But what they're sayin', girl
it cuts like a knife #

702
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:06,072
# The boy's no good #

703
00:50:06,312 --> 00:50:08,712
# Well, I've finally have found
what I been lookin' for #

704
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:12,991
# But if they get a chance
they'll end it for sure
Sure they would #

705
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:15,670
# Baby, I've done
all I could #

706
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:20,189
You see, this is
a moral test of oneself.

707
00:50:20,429 --> 00:50:23,389
Whether or not
you can maintain Ioyalty.

708
00:50:23,629 --> 00:50:26,628
Because... being Ioyal
is very important.

709
00:50:26,868 --> 00:50:31,107
# You never get tired of putting me down
and I never know when I come around #

710
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,706
# What I'm gonna find #

711
00:50:33,946 --> 00:50:37,586
# Don't let them
make up your mind #

712
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:41,985
# Don't you know, girl #

713
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:47,183
# You'll be a woman soon #

714
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:49,983
# Please #

715
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:54,702
# Come take my hand #

716
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,221
# Girl #

717
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:03,340
# You'll be a woman soon #

718
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,179
# Please #

719
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:10,938
# Come take my hand #

720
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:14,417
- Hello.
- # Girl #

721
00:51:14,497 --> 00:51:18,097
So, you're gonna go out there
and you're gonna say, "Good night".

722
00:51:18,337 --> 00:51:20,576
"I've had a very lovely evening."

723
00:51:20,816 --> 00:51:27,135
Walk out the door, get in
the car, go home, jerk off,
and that's all you gonna do.

724
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:34,573
# Now it's up to you, girl #

725
00:51:34,813 --> 00:51:40,052
# You'll be a woman soon #

726
00:51:40,212 --> 00:51:42,811
- # Please #

727
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:47,010
# Come take my hand #

728
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,049
- # Girl #

729
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:56,248
- # You'll be a woman soon #

730
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,128
# Soon #

731
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:03,767
# You'll be a woman ##

732
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:13,564
All right, Mia.

733
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:18,203
So listen, I gotta go,
all right?

734
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:22,842
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

735
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:25,522
You fu...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

736
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:27,801
Oh, fuck me.
Fuck me!

737
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:32,960
Oh... Come on, girl. We're gettin'
outta here. We gotta walk now.

738
00:52:41,878 --> 00:52:44,678
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

739
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:47,757
Fuck!

740
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,315
Answer.

741
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:57,715
- Have you got the ring?

742
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:01,474
- Why, certainly.
- Join hands, you two lovebirds.

743
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:03,873
- Please! Please!

744
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,473
Yes, yes.
Hold hands, you lovebirds.

745
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:14,551
Fuck you, Lance!
Answer!

746
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,270
Now what do you say?

747
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:24,149
I give up!
I'll marry you!

748
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:30,308
- Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

749
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:32,187
I can hear it.

750
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:35,546
I thought you told those
fuckin' assholes never to
call here this late!

751
00:53:35,786 --> 00:53:37,466
Yeah, I told them.

752
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:42,265
And that is exactly what I'm going
to tell this fucking asshole right now.

753
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,864
- Don't you dare strike me!
- Hello.

754
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,104
Lance! Vincent.

755
00:53:47,344 --> 00:53:49,983
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
I'm coming to your house.

756
00:53:50,223 --> 00:53:53,982
W-Whoa. Whoa. Hold your horses, man.
W-What's the problem?

757
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:57,182
- I got this chick,
she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me!
- Well, don't bring her here!

758
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:01,421
I'm not even joking with you!
Do not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

759
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,460
- No choice.
- Wh... She's O.D.in'?

760
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,620
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
- Just dandy.

761
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,699
Okay, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet, take her
to a hospital and call a lawyer.

762
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:13,098
- Negative!
- This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

763
00:54:13,338 --> 00:54:16,737
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

764
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:19,537
Uh, are you talkin' to me
on a cellular phone?

765
00:54:19,777 --> 00:54:21,936
I don't know you.
Who is this? Don't come here!

766
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,175
I'm hanging up the phone!
Prank caller! Prank caller!

767
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:37,373
- What the hell was that?

768
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:39,972
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

769
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:42,852
- You were talking about drug
shit on a cellular phone!
- Lance, help me.

770
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:45,731
- You crashed your car
into my fucking house!
- Grab her feet.

771
00:54:45,971 --> 00:54:49,090
Are you deaf? You are not bringing
this fucked-up bitch into my house!

772
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,970
This "fucked-up bitch"
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

773
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,369
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
- Yeah.

774
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:57,248
If she croaks on me,
I am a fucking grease spot!

775
00:54:57,488 --> 00:55:01,727
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help and
let her die on your lawn.

776
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:05,567
Now, come on. Help me, help me.
Pick her up.

777
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:09,086
- Shit.

778
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:11,725
Lance!

779
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:13,645
Shit.

780
00:55:13,885 --> 00:55:16,044
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

781
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:19,324
What the fuck's going on out here?

782
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:21,243
Who's she?

783
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:24,123
Go to the fridge and get the thing
with the adrenalin shot.

784
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,162
- What's wrong with her?
- She's O.D.ing!

785
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:28,202
- Get her outta here!
- Get the shot!

786
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:31,681
- Fuck you! Fuck you too!
- What a fuckin' bitch.

787
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,600
Just keep talking to her,
all right?

788
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,480
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going
to go get my little black medical book.

789
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,439
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

790
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:40,359
I've never had to give
an adrenalin shot before!

791
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:43,718
I don't go joy-poppin'
with bubble-gummers!
My friends can handle their highs!

792
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:46,118
- Get the shot!
- I am, if you'll let me!

793
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:48,997
- I ain't stopping you!
- Stop talking to me.
Start talking to her!

794
00:55:49,237 --> 00:55:52,556
- Get the shot!
- All right!

795
00:55:54,156 --> 00:55:57,275
- Hurry up. We're losing her!
- I'm looking as fast as I can!

796
00:55:57,515 --> 00:55:59,195
What's he looking for?

797
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:02,074
- I don't know. Some book.
- What are you looking for?

798
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:04,954
- A little black medical book.
- What are you looking for?

799
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:08,953
My little black medical book! It's
like a textbook they give to nurses.

800
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:11,832
- I never saw no medical book.
- Trust me. I have one.

801
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,711
- If it's so important,
why don't you keep it with the shot?
- I don't know!

802
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:18,551
- Stop bothering me!
- While you're looking, that girl's
gonna die on our carpet.

803
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:20,470
You're never gonna find
anything in this mess!

804
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,269
- I'm gonna fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!
- Lance, get in here!

805
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:28,388
- Right? Pig.
- Get the fuck outta my way.

806
00:56:28,628 --> 00:56:31,748
- Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.
- While I'm doing this,

807
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,027
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

808
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:38,506
- Does it gotta be exact?
- We're giving her a shot in the heart,
so it's gotta be exact.

809
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:41,386
I don't know exactly where her heart is.
I think it's right here.

810
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:44,985
- That's it.
- All right, what I need is
a big, fat magic marker.

811
00:56:45,225 --> 00:56:46,904
- You got it?
- What?

812
00:56:47,144 --> 00:56:49,544
A magic marker.
A felt pen!

813
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:52,143
A fuckin' black magic marker!
Christ.

814
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:58,662
- Come on, man. Hurry up!
- Fuck! Okay, okay.
Okay. I think it's ready.

815
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:02,501
- Hurry up, man.
- I'll tell you what to do.

816
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:05,380
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- No, you're gonna give her the shot.

817
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,260
- I ain't giving her the shot.
I never done this before.
- I never done this either!

818
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,219
I ain't starting now!
You brought her here.
You give her the shot.

819
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:14,538
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house, then I give her the shot.

820
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:16,458
Give it to me.
Give me that.

821
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:19,337
All right, tell me what to do.

822
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:22,257
Okay, you're giving her an injection
of adrenalin straight to her heart.

823
00:57:22,497 --> 00:57:25,136
- But she's got a breastplate...
You gotta pierce through that.

824
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:28,015
You gotta bring the needle
down in a stabbing motion.

825
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:31,375
- I gotta... I gotta
stab her three times?
- No, just stab her once!

826
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,734
But it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart.

827
00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:37,613
Once you do that,
you p-press down on the p-plunger.

828
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:40,093
- Okay. Then what happens?
- Kinda curious about that myself.

829
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,972
This ain't no fuckin' joke!
Am I gonna kill her?

830
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:46,331
- She's supposed to come out
of it like that. It's...
- All right, count to three.

831
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,491
- All right. Ready?
- One.

832
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,649
Two.

833
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:04,567
Three!

834
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:21,683
If you're all right,
then say something.

835
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:24,643
Something.

836
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:26,562
That was fuckin' trippy.

837
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:33,841
- Ohh.
- Oh, man.

838
00:58:56,076 --> 00:58:59,395
Mia. Mia.

839
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:02,195
What's...

840
00:59:02,435 --> 00:59:04,954
What's your thoughts on... on...

841
00:59:05,194 --> 00:59:06,954
on how to handle this?

842
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:10,473
What's yours?

843
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:15,552
Well, I'm of the opinion
that if Marsellus lived his whole life,

844
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:19,391
he doesn't need to know
nothing about this incident.

845
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,270
If Marsellus knew
about this incident,

846
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,310
I'd be in as much trouble as you.

847
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,789
I seriously doubt that.

848
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:31,268
I can keep a secret if you can.

849
00:59:31,788 --> 00:59:35,107
Shake on it?

850
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:40,666
Mum's the word?

851
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,586
Cool.

852
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:48,424
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go home and have a heart attack.

853
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:52,903
Vincent.

854
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:56,943
Do you wanna hear
my Fox Force Five joke?

855
00:59:57,183 --> 00:59:58,862
Sure.

856
00:59:59,102 --> 01:00:01,861
Except I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

857
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,741
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

858
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:07,980
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

859
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,180
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

860
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,979
Three tomatoes
are walkin' down the street.

861
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:15,379
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato
and Baby Tomato.

862
01:00:15,618 --> 01:00:19,458
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind,
and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

863
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:22,337
Goes back and squishes him
and says,

864
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,417
"Ketchup".

865
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:30,615
Ketchup.

866
01:00:33,135 --> 01:00:36,614
See you around.

867
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,729
Oh, that Paddlefoot.
He funny, silly dog.

868
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,608
He think totem pole alive!

869
01:01:01,848 --> 01:01:04,288
He arctic tenderfoot!

870
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:07,887
That totem pole been here forever!

871
01:01:08,127 --> 01:01:09,807
- Butch?

872
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:12,606
One more thing, and we'll start for...

873
01:01:12,846 --> 01:01:15,485
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
- Yeah?

874
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:20,684
- You've got a special visitor.
- Stand up. Stand up.

875
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:26,443
Now, do you remember when I told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

876
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,082
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

877
01:01:30,322 --> 01:01:34,601
He was in the P.O.W. camp
with Daddy.

878
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,960
Hello, little man.

879
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,959
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

880
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:47,118
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

881
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,078
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

882
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:52,517
over five years.

883
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:54,437
Hopefully...

884
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,316
you'll never have to
experience this yourself,

885
01:01:57,556 --> 01:02:00,675
but when two men are in a situation
like me and your dad were...

886
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:03,435
for as long as we were,

887
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:07,634
you take on certain responsibilities
of the other.

888
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:10,753
If it'd been me who'd...

889
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,673
not made it,

890
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:16,832
Major Coolidge'd be talking right now
to my son Jim.

891
01:02:17,072 --> 01:02:21,711
But the way it turned out,
I'm talking to you.

892
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:25,230
Butch...

893
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,549
I got something for ya.

894
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:35,148
This watch I got here...

895
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:39,827
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first World War.

896
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:44,386
It was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

897
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:47,865
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

898
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:50,744
Up 'til then, people just
carried pocket watches.

899
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,864
It was bought
by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

900
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,743
on the day he set sail for Paris.

901
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:59,143
This was your
great-grandfather's war watch,

902
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:02,422
and he wore it every day
he was in that war, and...

903
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:05,901
when he'd done his duty,
he went home to your great-grandmother,

904
01:03:06,141 --> 01:03:10,220
took the watch off,
put it in an old coffee can,
and in that can it stayed...

905
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,539
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

906
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:18,178
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

907
01:03:18,418 --> 01:03:21,578
This time they called it
World War II.

908
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:26,457
Your great-grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck.

909
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:29,376
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

910
01:03:29,616 --> 01:03:32,255
Dane was a Marine,
and he was killed...

911
01:03:32,495 --> 01:03:36,214
along with all the other Marines
at the battle of Wake Island.

912
01:03:36,454 --> 01:03:39,094
Your granddad was facing death.

913
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,013
He knew it.

914
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:44,852
None of those boys ever
had any illusions about
leaving that island alive,

915
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:47,972
so three days before the Japanese
took the island,

916
01:03:48,212 --> 01:03:53,051
your granddad asked
a gunner on an Air Force transport,
name of Winocki...

917
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,930
a man he'd never met before
in his life...

918
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,849
to deliver to his infant son,

919
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:03,328
who he'd never seen in the flesh,
his gold watch.

920
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:07,567
Three days later, your granddad
was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

921
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:11,727
After the war was over,
he paid a visit to your grandmother,

922
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:15,846
delivering to your infant father
his dad's gold watch.

923
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:19,365
This watch.

924
01:04:23,564 --> 01:04:28,603
This watch was on your daddy's wrist
when he was shot down over Hanoi.

925
01:04:28,843 --> 01:04:31,962
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

926
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,921
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

927
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:39,400
it'd be confiscated,
taken away.

928
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,000
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

929
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,839
He'd be damned if any slope's
gonna put their greasy, yellow
hands on his boy's birthright,

930
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:50,678
so he hid it in one place he knew
he could hide something... his ass.

931
01:04:50,918 --> 01:04:54,037
Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

932
01:04:54,277 --> 01:04:58,156
Then he died of dysentery...
He give me the watch.

933
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:01,916
I hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass two years.

934
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:03,835
Then...

935
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:07,794
after seven years,
I was sent home to my family and...

936
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:11,353
now...

937
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:16,472
little man,
I give the watch to you.

938
01:05:36,948 --> 01:05:40,267
It's time, Butch.

939
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:48,865
In the heavyweight division,

940
01:05:49,105 --> 01:05:51,985
- In the right corner
wearing the blue trunks,

941
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:55,184
weighing 210 pounds,

942
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:58,263
Floyd Ray Wilson!

943
01:06:01,382 --> 01:06:03,062
It's official. It's official.

944
01:06:03,302 --> 01:06:05,941
- Wilson is dead!
- Well, Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest,

945
01:06:06,181 --> 01:06:08,341
hands down, the most brutal fight
this city's ever seen.

946
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:11,860
Coolidge was out of there
faster than I've ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring.

947
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,740
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
- My guess would be yes.

948
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:18,099
I could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

949
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:21,458
- I think any man would've
left the ring that fast.
- Do you feel this tragedy...

950
01:06:21,698 --> 01:06:23,378
is gonna affect
the world of boxing?

951
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:27,217
A tragedy like this can't help
but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations.

952
01:06:27,457 --> 01:06:31,056
It's of paramount importance,
during the sad weeks ahead,
the eyes of the W.B.A. remain...

953
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,688
Man, you know I didn't...

954
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:09,567
- Marsellus.
- No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

955
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,487
I didn't do it.

956
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,966
- How you doing?
- Great.

957
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:17,966
I never thanked you
for dinner.

958
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:20,045
- What you got?
- He booked.

959
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,084
- His trainer?
- Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

960
01:07:23,324 --> 01:07:26,444
- I think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.
- No, we don't wanna "think".

961
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:29,963
We wanna know. Take him to
the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

962
01:07:30,203 --> 01:07:33,322
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

963
01:07:33,562 --> 01:07:35,242
Butch's search...
How do you want it done?

964
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:38,121
I'm prepared to scour the Earth
for that motherfucker.

965
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:41,480
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want
a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...

966
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,560
ready to pop a cap in his ass.

967
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,159
I will take care of it.

968
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:58,957
Mister.

969
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,516
- Hey, mister.
- What?

970
01:08:02,756 --> 01:08:07,195
You were in that fight,
the fight on the radio.

971
01:08:07,435 --> 01:08:10,554
- You're the fighter?
- Whatever gave you that idea?

972
01:08:10,794 --> 01:08:13,273
No, come on.

973
01:08:13,513 --> 01:08:15,193
You're him.

974
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:19,192
I know you're him.

975
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:21,072
Tell me you're him.

976
01:08:21,312 --> 01:08:23,991
I'm him.

977
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:27,990
You killed the other boxing man.

978
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,869
He's dead?

979
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:35,908
The radio said he was dead.

980
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:40,268
Sorry about that, Floyd.

981
01:08:40,507 --> 01:08:42,747
What does it feel like?

982
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:44,667
What does what feel like?

983
01:08:44,907 --> 01:08:48,186
Killing a man.

984
01:08:48,426 --> 01:08:52,185
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

985
01:08:52,425 --> 01:08:54,104
What are you, a weirdo?

986
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:56,024
No.

987
01:08:56,264 --> 01:09:00,983
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

988
01:09:01,063 --> 01:09:06,262
You are the first person
I have ever met who has killed somebody.

989
01:09:07,222 --> 01:09:09,381
So?

990
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:13,580
- What does it feel like to kill a man?

991
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,500
I'll tell you what.

992
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:20,939
Give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there, and I'll
tell you all about it.

993
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:40,614
So, Esmarelda...

994
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:43,934
Villa Lobos...
Is that Mexican?

995
01:09:44,173 --> 01:09:47,093
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

996
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:50,332
- That's some handle
you got there, honey.
- Thank you.

997
01:09:50,572 --> 01:09:52,252
And what is your name?

998
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:53,931
Butch.

999
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:56,371
Butch.

1000
01:09:56,611 --> 01:10:01,010
- What does it mean?
- I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1001
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,649
So, moving right along,

1002
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:05,569
Esmarelda,

1003
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,808
what is it you want to know?

1004
01:10:08,048 --> 01:10:14,167
- I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.
- I couldn't tell ya.

1005
01:10:18,366 --> 01:10:22,445
Didn't know he was dead
'til you told me he was dead.

1006
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:28,564
Now that I know he's dead,
you wanna know how I feel about it?

1007
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:35,442
I don't feel
the least bit bad about it.

1008
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,680
What the fuck'd I tell ya?
Huh?

1009
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,519
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man, the odds
went through the roof.

1010
01:10:50,759 --> 01:10:52,678
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1011
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:56,038
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was
a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1012
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:57,957
If he never
laced up his gloves,

1013
01:10:58,197 --> 01:11:00,357
which he never shoulda done in the first
fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1014
01:11:02,516 --> 01:11:05,796
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1015
01:11:06,035 --> 01:11:08,675
Yeah, well, enough about the poor,
unfortunate Mr Floyd.

1016
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:12,314
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr Butch.

1017
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:15,193
How many bookies did you
lay it around on?

1018
01:11:15,433 --> 01:11:19,193
All eight?
How long to collect?

1019
01:11:19,313 --> 01:11:21,952
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1020
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:25,071
A few stragglers aside.
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1021
01:11:25,311 --> 01:11:27,271
That is great news, man.

1022
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:31,350
Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1023
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,549
It'll probably take us
a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1024
01:11:34,789 --> 01:11:36,469
Okay, my brother.

1025
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,428
You're right.

1026
01:11:38,668 --> 01:11:40,748
You're goddamn right.

1027
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:44,147
All right, Scotty, next time I see you,
it'll be on Tennessee time.

1028
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:48,066
Cool, brother.

1029
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,943
$45.60.

1030
01:12:06,942 --> 01:12:08,622
And, uh,

1031
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:11,821
here's a little something
for the effort.

1032
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:15,660
Now, if anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1033
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,580
The truth.

1034
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:22,619
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1035
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:25,138
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1036
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:29,257
Buenas Noches, Butch.

1037
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:41,415
Whew.

1038
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:43,374
Keep the light off.

1039
01:12:43,614 --> 01:12:46,253
- Is that better, Sugar Pop?
- Oui.

1040
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:52,412
Hard day at the office?

1041
01:12:52,652 --> 01:12:54,332
Pretty hard.

1042
01:12:54,572 --> 01:12:56,531
Got in a fight.

1043
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:58,691
Poor baby.

1044
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:01,210
Can you make spoons?

1045
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:04,090
You know what?
I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1046
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:07,929
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
- I like the way you stink.

1047
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:11,928
Let me take this jacket off.

1048
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:15,807
- I was looking at myself in the mirror.
- Uh-huh.

1049
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:19,326
I wish I had a pot.

1050
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:23,165
You were looking
at yourself in the mirror,
and you wish you had some pot?

1051
01:13:23,405 --> 01:13:26,045
A pot. 
A pot belly.

1052
01:13:26,285 --> 01:13:28,204
Pot bellies are sexy.

1053
01:13:28,444 --> 01:13:30,484
Well, you should be happy,

1054
01:13:30,724 --> 01:13:32,403
'cause you have one.

1055
01:13:32,643 --> 01:13:35,803
Shut up, fatso.
I don't have a pot.

1056
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:39,562
I have a bit of a tummy,
like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star".

1057
01:13:39,802 --> 01:13:41,481
It's not the same thing.

1058
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:45,320
I didn't know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy.

1059
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,240
The difference is huge.

1060
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,599
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1061
01:13:50,839 --> 01:13:52,519
No.

1062
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:56,838
Pot bellies make a man
look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1063
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:59,877
But on a woman
a pot belly's very sexy.

1064
01:14:00,117 --> 01:14:05,156
The rest of you is normal... normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...

1065
01:14:05,396 --> 01:14:09,115
but with a big,
perfectly round pot belly.

1066
01:14:09,355 --> 01:14:11,995
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1067
01:14:12,235 --> 01:14:13,914
to accentuate it.

1068
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:16,314
You think men
would find that attractive?

1069
01:14:16,554 --> 01:14:19,433
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1070
01:14:19,673 --> 01:14:22,832
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye...

1071
01:14:23,072 --> 01:14:25,872
is seldom the same.

1072
01:14:28,191 --> 01:14:31,470
If you had a pot belly,
I would punch you in it.

1073
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,350
- You'd punch me in the belly?
- Right in the belly.

1074
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,269
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1075
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:40,108
- I'd drop it right on your face
'til you couldn't breathe!

1076
01:14:40,348 --> 01:14:42,028
- You'd do that?
- Yeah.

1077
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:43,948
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1078
01:14:47,507 --> 01:14:49,186
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1079
01:14:51,506 --> 01:14:53,665
Oh.

1080
01:14:57,145 --> 01:14:58,824
Did you get everything?

1081
01:14:59,064 --> 01:15:01,744
- Yes, I did.
- Good job, Sugar Pop.

1082
01:15:01,984 --> 01:15:03,663
Did everything
go as planned?

1083
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:06,343
- You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1084
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,262
You didn't listen to the radio?

1085
01:15:08,502 --> 01:15:11,502
I never listen to your fights.
Were you the winner?

1086
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:13,781
I won, all right.

1087
01:15:14,021 --> 01:15:16,700
- Are you still retiring?
- Sure am.

1088
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,340
So it all worked out
in the finish.

1089
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,699
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1090
01:15:31,497 --> 01:15:35,696
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1091
01:15:35,736 --> 01:15:40,015
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1092
01:15:40,535 --> 01:15:44,814
But they won't find us,
will they?

1093
01:15:46,134 --> 01:15:50,413
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1094
01:15:50,453 --> 01:15:55,412
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance. It's...

1095
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:02,370
Say it.

1096
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:04,930
- Fabienne,

1097
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:08,009
I want you to be with me.

1098
01:16:08,249 --> 01:16:12,568
- Forever?
- Forever and ever.

1099
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,888
Do you love me?

1100
01:16:15,128 --> 01:16:16,847
Very, very much.

1101
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:26,125
- Butch.
- Yes?

1102
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:30,284
Will you give me
oral pleasure?

1103
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:33,563
Will you kiss it?

1104
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:35,923
But you first.

1105
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:38,722
- Okay.
- Okay.

1106
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,720
Butch.

1107
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,679
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1108
01:17:09,116 --> 01:17:11,275
I think I cracked a rib.

1109
01:17:11,515 --> 01:17:14,634
- Giving me oral pleasure?
- No, retard, from the fight.

1110
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:17,994
- Don't call me "retard".
- My name is Fabby.

1111
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,473
- My name is Fabienne!
- Stop it.

1112
01:17:20,713 --> 01:17:22,393
- Stop it!
- My name is Fabi...

1113
01:17:22,633 --> 01:17:25,272
Shut up, fuckhead!
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1114
01:17:25,512 --> 01:17:28,311
Okay, okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1115
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:32,790
- I take it back.

1116
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,910
Will you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1117
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:39,749
- Oh, I like that.
I like being called a tulip.

1118
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,148
"Tulip" is much better
than "mongoloid".

1119
01:17:42,388 --> 01:17:45,028
I didn't call you a mongoloid.
I called you a retard.

1120
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:47,147
And I took it back.

1121
01:17:47,387 --> 01:17:49,227
- Butch?

1122
01:17:49,467 --> 01:17:51,146
Yes, Lemon Pie?

1123
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:54,506
- Where are we going to go?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

1124
01:17:54,746 --> 01:17:56,625
Wherever you want.

1125
01:17:56,865 --> 01:17:59,505
We're gonna get a lot
of money from this,

1126
01:17:59,745 --> 01:18:02,384
but it ain't gonna be
the kind of money...

1127
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:05,263
that we can live like hogs
in the fathouse forever.

1128
01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:09,102
I was thinking maybe we could go
down someplace in the South Pacific.

1129
01:18:09,342 --> 01:18:12,462
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna
carry us a long way down there.

1130
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:15,341
- If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?
- You betcha.

1131
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:18,700
And if after a while you didn't
dig that, we could go someplace else.

1132
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,620
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1133
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,540
But I do not speak Spanish.

1134
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:25,419
Well, you do not speak
Bora-Boran either.

1135
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,378
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1136
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:30,258
- ?Donde esta el zapatería?
- What does that mean?

1137
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:32,177
Where is the shoe store?

1138
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,097
- ?Donde esta...
- Spit, please.

1139
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:39,216
- ?Donde esta el zapatería?
- Excellent pronunciation.

1140
01:18:39,456 --> 01:18:41,255
- Mmm.

1141
01:18:41,495 --> 01:18:44,455
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1142
01:18:44,695 --> 01:18:46,974
- ?Que hora es?
- ?Que hora es?

1143
01:18:47,214 --> 01:18:49,094
- What time is it?
- What time is it?

1144
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:51,693
Time for bed.

1145
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:55,252
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1146
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:04,490
Butch?

1147
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:12,009
Never mind.

1148
01:19:17,248 --> 01:19:19,607
Aah!

1149
01:19:19,847 --> 01:19:23,566
Merde! You startled me.
Did you have a bad dream?

1150
01:19:33,764 --> 01:19:37,683
- What is this you're watching?
- A motorcycle movie.

1151
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:41,202
I'm not sure the name.

1152
01:19:41,602 --> 01:19:46,001
- Are you watching it?
- In a way.

1153
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:51,680
It's a little early in the morning
for explosions and war.

1154
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,039
- What was it about?
- How should I know?
You were the one watching it.

1155
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,918
- No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?
- I don't know.

1156
01:20:01,158 --> 01:20:02,837
I don't remember.

1157
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:05,717
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1158
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:08,636
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man in the morning.

1159
01:20:10,796 --> 01:20:13,435
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast.

1160
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:16,035
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1161
01:20:18,274 --> 01:20:21,193
- Satisfied?
- Yep.

1162
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:24,553
- Get up, lazy bones!
- Ohh!

1163
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:28,752
- Ohh. God.

1164
01:20:28,992 --> 01:20:32,191
- What time is it?
- Almost nine in the morning.

1165
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:35,870
- What time does our train arrive?
- Eleven.

1166
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:40,109
- You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?
- What, Lemon Pie?

1167
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:44,148
I'm gonna order a big plate
of blueberry pancakes...

1168
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:46,068
with maple syrup,

1169
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:49,427
eggs over easy
and five sausages.

1170
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,627
Anything to drink with that?

1171
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:55,186
Wow, that looks nice.

1172
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:58,465
To drink... A tall glass
of orange juice...

1173
01:20:58,705 --> 01:21:00,865
and a black cup of coffee.

1174
01:21:01,105 --> 01:21:05,304
- After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.
- Pie for breakfast?

1175
01:21:05,544 --> 01:21:09,143
- Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1176
01:21:09,383 --> 01:21:12,022
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1177
01:21:12,262 --> 01:21:14,982
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese.

1178
01:21:15,222 --> 01:21:18,501
Where's my watch?

1179
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,340
It's there.

1180
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,899
- No, it's not.
- Have you looked?

1181
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:30,058
Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1182
01:21:30,298 --> 01:21:32,178
You sure you got it?

1183
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:34,457
Yes.
Bedside table drawer.

1184
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:37,537
- On the little kangaroo?
- Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1185
01:21:37,777 --> 01:21:40,656
Yeah, well,
it's not here now.

1186
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,455
- Well, it should be.

1187
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:48,814
Yes, it most definitely should be,
but it's not here now!
So where the fuck is it?

1188
01:21:52,693 --> 01:21:57,452
Fabienne,
where's my father's fucking watch?

1189
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:01,691
Do you have any idea what he had
to go through to get me that watch?

1190
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:04,571
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1191
01:22:04,811 --> 01:22:09,730
All this other shit you could've set
on fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget the fucking watch.

1192
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,089
Now think.

1193
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:14,529
- Did you get it?
- I believe so.

1194
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:19,008
"You believe so"?
What the fuck does that mean?
You either did or didn't get it.

1195
01:22:19,248 --> 01:22:22,167
Then I did.

1196
01:22:22,407 --> 01:22:25,086
Are you sure?

1197
01:22:25,326 --> 01:22:28,645
No.

1198
01:22:29,205 --> 01:22:30,885
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1199
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,204
Motherfucker!
Motherfuckin'...

1200
01:22:35,204 --> 01:22:37,723
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1201
01:22:37,963 --> 01:22:41,283
No!

1202
01:22:42,362 --> 01:22:45,642
It's not your fault.

1203
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:52,600
You left it at the apartment.

1204
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:01,238
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1205
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:04,598
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1206
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:08,557
I reminded you about it,

1207
01:23:08,797 --> 01:23:13,196
but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me.

1208
01:23:13,436 --> 01:23:17,155
If all I gave a fuck about was
the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1209
01:23:17,395 --> 01:23:19,554
You're not a mind reader.

1210
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,073
Are you?

1211
01:23:31,352 --> 01:23:33,031
I... I'm sorry.

1212
01:23:33,271 --> 01:23:36,551
Don't be. Just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1213
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:40,830
Why does it mean that?

1214
01:23:41,869 --> 01:23:45,988
Because I gotta go back to my apartment
and get my watch.

1215
01:23:46,228 --> 01:23:48,468
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1216
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:52,627
Well, that's what
I'm gonna find out.

1217
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:55,786
If they are, and I don't think
I can handle it,

1218
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:57,706
then I'll split.

1219
01:23:57,946 --> 01:24:03,505
I saw your watch. I thought
I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1220
01:24:07,144 --> 01:24:09,903
Here's some money.
Go out and get those pancakes.

1221
01:24:10,143 --> 01:24:11,743
Have a nice breakfast.

1222
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:15,102
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back
before you can say "blueberry pie".

1223
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,502
Blueberry pie.

1224
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:19,661
Maybe not that fast.

1225
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:22,780
- But pretty fast. Okay?
- Okay.

1226
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

1227
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,979
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things
she could fuckin' forget,

1228
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:29,899
she forgets my father's watch!

1229
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:31,818
I specifically reminded her...

1230
01:24:32,058 --> 01:24:33,938
bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1231
01:24:34,178 --> 01:24:37,137
I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch".

1232
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:56,893
Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's
nearest you...

1233
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:10,610
i El burro!

1234
01:27:07,784 --> 01:27:11,063
Lookin' good, Butch.

1235
01:29:51,748 --> 01:29:55,187
## If I were walkin'
in your shoes #

1236
01:30:00,946 --> 01:30:05,985
# Countin' flowers on the wall
That don't bother me at all #

1237
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:10,304
# Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one #

1238
01:30:10,544 --> 01:30:13,183
That's how you're gonna
beat 'em, Butch.

1239
01:30:13,423 --> 01:30:16,343
- # Smokin' cigarettes and
watchin' Captain Kangaroo #
- They keep underestimatin' ya.

1240
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:19,862
# Now don't tell me #

1241
01:30:19,942 --> 01:30:23,101
# Countin' flowers on the wall #

1242
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:26,500
# That don't bother me at all #

1243
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:31,859
# Playin' solitaire 'til dawn
with a deck of fifty-one #

1244
01:30:32,099 --> 01:30:36,458
# Smokin' cigarettes
and watchin' Captain Kangaroo #

1245
01:30:36,698 --> 01:30:39,298
# Now don't tell me #

1246
01:30:39,538 --> 01:30:41,697
# I've nothin' to do #

1247
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,977
# It's good to see you
I must go #

1248
01:30:44,217 --> 01:30:46,016
# I know I look a fright #

1249
01:30:46,256 --> 01:30:48,456
- # Anyway my eyes #
- Motherfucker.

1250
01:30:48,696 --> 01:30:52,415
- # Are not accustomed... ##
- Uhh!

1251
01:30:58,813 --> 01:31:00,973
- Do you think he's dead?
- He's dead.

1252
01:31:01,213 --> 01:31:04,812
- Oh, my God.
- He's dead.

1253
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:16,409
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1254
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:19,289
He hit you, then he
crashed into that car.

1255
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:22,848
- Who?
- Him.

1256
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:27,247
I'll be damned.

1257
01:31:38,165 --> 01:31:39,884
- Ohh!

1258
01:31:42,404 --> 01:31:44,443
- Aaaah! I'm shot!

1259
01:31:51,162 --> 01:31:54,241
- Sally! Sally!

1260
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,440
- Aaah!

1261
01:32:01,879 --> 01:32:03,559
Motherfucker!

1262
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:09,398
- Can I help you with somethin'?
- Shut the fuck up.

1263
01:32:09,638 --> 01:32:12,277
Now you just wait
a goddamn minute, now!

1264
01:32:12,517 --> 01:32:14,237
What the fuck you up to?

1265
01:32:14,477 --> 01:32:16,836
- Come here, motherfucker!

1266
01:32:17,076 --> 01:32:19,676
- You feel that sting, huh, big boy?

1267
01:32:19,915 --> 01:32:21,595
That's pride
fuckin' with you, see?

1268
01:32:21,835 --> 01:32:24,954
You gotta fight through that shit!
Huh?

1269
01:32:25,194 --> 01:32:27,914
- You'd better kill me...
- Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.

1270
01:32:28,154 --> 01:32:30,433
Somebody's gonna get
their motherfuckin' head blown to...

1271
01:32:30,673 --> 01:32:32,913
- Hold it right there, goddamn it.

1272
01:32:33,153 --> 01:32:36,592
- This ain't none
of your business, mister.
- I'm makin' it my business.

1273
01:32:36,832 --> 01:32:39,271
- Toss the weapon.
- You don't understand, man.

1274
01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:41,311
Toss the weapon.

1275
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,310
## It's time #

1276
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,989
- # To find love #
- Take your foot off the nigger,

1277
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:50,909
- Put your hand behind your head,

1278
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,948
approach the counter right now.

1279
01:32:53,188 --> 01:32:54,948
- This motherfucker's trying to...

1280
01:32:55,188 --> 01:32:56,307
kill me.

1281
01:32:56,547 --> 01:33:01,586
Shut up.
Keep comin'. Come on.

1282
01:33:01,586 --> 01:33:04,826
# If love #

1283
01:33:05,066 --> 01:33:08,345
# Is shelter #

1284
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:26,461
Zed. Maynard.

1285
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:29,340
Yeah, the spider
just caught a couple flies.

1286
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:32,699
# Whoa, my angel #

1287
01:33:35,339 --> 01:33:38,658
# Down to you ##

1288
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:18,050
Nobody kills anybody
in my place of business...

1289
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:22,529
- Except me or Zed.

1290
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:26,568
That's Zed.

1291
01:34:37,245 --> 01:34:41,444
- I thought
you said you waited for me.
- I did.

1292
01:34:44,684 --> 01:34:47,323
Then how come they're all beat up?

1293
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:51,482
They did that to each other, man.
They came in fightin'.

1294
01:34:51,722 --> 01:34:55,721
Now, this 'un right here,
he was gonna shoot that one.

1295
01:34:55,961 --> 01:34:59,000
Is that right?
You gonna shoot him, boy?

1296
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:03,160
Huh?

1297
01:35:03,639 --> 01:35:06,439
Hey, is Grace
all right out front?

1298
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:09,598
- Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?
- No, it's Thursday.

1299
01:35:09,838 --> 01:35:13,477
- She oughta be fine.
- Mmm.

1300
01:35:13,717 --> 01:35:18,636
Well, bring out the Gimp.

1301
01:35:18,876 --> 01:35:21,316
I think the Gimp's sleepin'.

1302
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:26,794
Then I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up now, won't you?

1303
01:36:02,826 --> 01:36:06,146
Get up.

1304
01:36:17,423 --> 01:36:20,743
Get down.

1305
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:31,580
Which one of 'em
you wanna do first?

1306
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:36,859
- I ain't for sure yet.

1307
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:41,178
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

1308
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:43,737
catch a nigger...

1309
01:36:43,977 --> 01:36:46,297
by his toe.

1310
01:36:46,537 --> 01:36:49,976
If he hollers, let him go.

1311
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:55,615
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.

1312
01:36:57,095 --> 01:36:59,694
My mother said...

1313
01:36:59,934 --> 01:37:03,213
pick the perfect one,

1314
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:07,452
and... you... are...

1315
01:37:07,692 --> 01:37:10,971
it.

1316
01:37:11,771 --> 01:37:14,571
- Guess that means you, big boy.
- Fuck you!

1317
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:18,610
- Shh.

1318
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:23,089
- You wanna do it in here?
- No, let's take him back
to Russell's old room.

1319
01:37:23,329 --> 01:37:25,768
Sounds good to me.

1320
01:37:48,883 --> 01:37:53,322
You keep an eye on this 'un.

1321
01:38:16,757 --> 01:38:20,876
Yeah!

1322
01:38:23,516 --> 01:38:26,395
Now! Go! Come on, motherfucker!

1323
01:38:26,635 --> 01:38:29,754
- Now, motherfucker!
Aaah!

1324
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:35,193
- Come on! Yeah!

1325
01:38:40,192 --> 01:38:42,991
- Yeah!

1326
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:53,109
- Ohh!
- Yeah!

1327
01:38:54,549 --> 01:38:58,508
- Yeah! Yeah!

1328
01:38:58,748 --> 01:39:01,387
Yeee!
Yeeee-hah!

1329
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:24,662
Yeah!

1330
01:39:49,657 --> 01:39:54,775
Come on!
Get down there!

1331
01:39:55,855 --> 01:40:00,374
Aaah!
Do it! Yeah!

1332
01:40:15,371 --> 01:40:18,050
Yeah! Yeah!

1333
01:40:33,087 --> 01:40:37,806
- Shut the fuck up!

1334
01:40:38,086 --> 01:40:41,365
Fuck him!

1335
01:40:42,005 --> 01:40:45,324
Come on!

1336
01:40:47,324 --> 01:40:52,043
- Fuck him. Yeah.

1337
01:41:00,321 --> 01:41:02,521
Aaaaah!

1338
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,399
- Aaaaah!

1339
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:23,716
You want that gun,
don't ya, Zed?

1340
01:41:23,876 --> 01:41:26,475
Huh?

1341
01:41:26,715 --> 01:41:29,995
Go ahead and pick it up.

1342
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:32,914
Go ahead. Pick it up.

1343
01:41:35,273 --> 01:41:39,113
Come on...
Thatta boy!

1344
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:44,551
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1345
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:51,550
- Step aside, Butch.

1346
01:42:01,868 --> 01:42:06,227
Fuck!

1347
01:42:07,266 --> 01:42:11,146
- You okay?

1348
01:42:11,385 --> 01:42:13,305
No, man.

1349
01:42:13,545 --> 01:42:16,184
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1350
01:42:27,062 --> 01:42:31,341
- What now?

1351
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:35,060
"What now"?

1352
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,420
- Let me tell you what now.

1353
01:42:38,659 --> 01:42:41,299
I'm gonna call a couple of hard,
pipe-hittin' niggers...

1354
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:44,178
to go to work
on the homes here...

1355
01:42:44,418 --> 01:42:48,657
with a pair of pliers
and a blowtorch.

1356
01:42:49,137 --> 01:42:52,696
You hear me talkin',
hillbilly boy?

1357
01:42:52,936 --> 01:42:55,216
I ain't through with you
by a damn sight!

1358
01:42:55,456 --> 01:42:59,695
I'm gonna get medieval
on your ass.

1359
01:43:01,414 --> 01:43:05,654
I meant what now
between me and you.

1360
01:43:09,093 --> 01:43:12,532
Oh, that "what now".

1361
01:43:12,772 --> 01:43:17,971
- I tell you what now
between me and you.

1362
01:43:18,051 --> 01:43:22,010
There is no me and you.

1363
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,930
Not no more.

1364
01:43:27,049 --> 01:43:29,968
So, are we cool?

1365
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:32,248
Yeah, we cool.

1366
01:43:32,488 --> 01:43:35,967
- Two things.

1367
01:43:36,207 --> 01:43:40,206
Don't tell nobody about this.

1368
01:43:40,446 --> 01:43:43,765
This shit is between me, you...

1369
01:43:44,005 --> 01:43:48,084
and Mr "Soon-To-Be-Livin'
The-Rest-Of-His-Short-Ass-
Life-In-Agonizing-Pain"...

1370
01:43:48,324 --> 01:43:51,204
rapist here.

1371
01:43:51,443 --> 01:43:53,923
It ain't nobody else's business.

1372
01:43:54,163 --> 01:43:55,842
Two:

1373
01:43:56,082 --> 01:44:00,401
You leave town tonight.
Right now.

1374
01:44:00,641 --> 01:44:02,321
And when you gone,

1375
01:44:02,561 --> 01:44:04,241
you stay gone,

1376
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:07,120
- Or you be gone.

1377
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:11,599
You lost all your L.A. privileges.
Deal?

1378
01:44:11,919 --> 01:44:14,718
Deal.

1379
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:18,238
Get your ass outta here.

1380
01:44:42,192 --> 01:44:45,032
Oh, shit.

1381
01:45:16,065 --> 01:45:19,184
Fabienne!

1382
01:45:19,424 --> 01:45:23,183
Fabienne!

1383
01:45:23,423 --> 01:45:25,263
Fabienne!
Come on, baby.

1384
01:45:25,503 --> 01:45:28,622
- Come on. Get your shit.
We gotta go right now.
- I was so worried.

1385
01:45:28,862 --> 01:45:31,981
- What about our bags?
- Fuck the bags; if we don't split
right now, we'll miss the train.

1386
01:45:32,221 --> 01:45:33,901
- I'll be downstairs.
- Is everything well?

1387
01:45:34,141 --> 01:45:37,740
- Just come on! No talking now!
- Are we in danger?

1388
01:45:41,259 --> 01:45:44,539
Come on, honey!

1389
01:45:45,098 --> 01:45:47,298
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1390
01:45:47,538 --> 01:45:51,697
- It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper. Let's go.
- What happened to my Honda?

1391
01:45:51,937 --> 01:45:55,376
I'm sorry, baby,
I had to crash that Honda.
Will you come on now, please?

1392
01:45:55,616 --> 01:45:59,375
Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1393
01:46:02,295 --> 01:46:05,414
- You're hurt?
- No, no, I might've broken
my nose. It's no biggie.

1394
01:46:05,654 --> 01:46:08,293
Come on. Hop on.
Baby, please, we...

1395
01:46:08,533 --> 01:46:12,812
Honey, we gotta hit
the fuckin' road! Get on!

1396
01:46:12,972 --> 01:46:16,092
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1397
01:46:16,332 --> 01:46:18,011
I'm sorry. Mmm.

1398
01:46:18,251 --> 01:46:21,850
- I'm so sorry.
- You were gone so long, I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1399
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:24,730
I didn't mean to worry you.
Everything's fine.

1400
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,649
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1401
01:46:26,889 --> 01:46:28,569
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1402
01:46:28,809 --> 01:46:32,408
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get
buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1403
01:46:32,648 --> 01:46:35,287
Since I left you,
this has been, without a doubt,

1404
01:46:35,527 --> 01:46:38,447
the single weirdest
fuckin' day of my life...
I'll tell you all about it.

1405
01:46:38,687 --> 01:46:40,286
Gotta go. Come on.

1406
01:46:40,526 --> 01:46:43,006
Butch, whose motorcycle
is this?

1407
01:46:43,246 --> 01:46:45,565
- It's a chopper, baby.
- Whose chopper is this?

1408
01:46:45,805 --> 01:46:47,485
- Zed's.
- Who's Zed?

1409
01:46:47,725 --> 01:46:50,044
Zed's dead, baby.
Zed's dead.

1410
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:07,760
Yes, you did, Brett!

1411
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,200
You tried to fuck him,
and Marsellus Wallace
don't liked to be fucked...

1412
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,599
by anybody except Mrs Wallace.

1413
01:47:13,839 --> 01:47:16,638
- Oh, God, please. I don't wanna die.
- You read the Bible, Brett?

1414
01:47:16,878 --> 01:47:19,998
- Yes!
- Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1415
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:22,157
Sorta fits the occasion.

1416
01:47:22,397 --> 01:47:25,396
Ezekiel 25:17.

1417
01:47:25,636 --> 01:47:29,556
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1418
01:47:29,795 --> 01:47:31,475
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1419
01:47:31,715 --> 01:47:34,834
- And the tyranny of evil men."

1420
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:39,393
"Blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will,

1421
01:47:39,633 --> 01:47:42,353
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1422
01:47:42,593 --> 01:47:44,872
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1423
01:47:45,112 --> 01:47:47,552
and the finder
of lost children."

1424
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:51,711
"And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

1425
01:47:51,951 --> 01:47:53,870
and furious anger...

1426
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:58,149
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers."

1427
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:01,908
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1428
01:48:02,148 --> 01:48:05,228
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1429
01:48:13,146 --> 01:48:15,305
I'm fucked.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1430
01:48:15,545 --> 01:48:18,185
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1431
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:21,064
Hmm? Oh.
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1432
01:48:21,304 --> 01:48:23,944
- Better tell him to shut up.
He's gettin' on my nerves.
- Fuck.

1433
01:48:24,184 --> 01:48:27,103
Marvin. Marvin!
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1434
01:48:27,343 --> 01:48:31,142
- Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1435
01:48:58,336 --> 01:49:01,455
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1436
01:49:01,695 --> 01:49:04,255
Slip your mind? Did you forget
that someone was in there...

1437
01:49:04,495 --> 01:49:06,174
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1438
01:49:06,414 --> 01:49:11,653
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us? It was bigger than him.

1439
01:49:14,772 --> 01:49:17,212
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1440
01:49:17,452 --> 01:49:19,131
I know.
We was lucky.

1441
01:49:19,371 --> 01:49:22,171
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1442
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:26,290
- Yeah, maybe.
- This was divine intervention.

1443
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:29,809
You know what
divine intervention is?

1444
01:49:34,008 --> 01:49:35,688
I think so.

1445
01:49:35,928 --> 01:49:39,047
That means that God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.

1446
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,447
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1447
01:49:41,686 --> 01:49:45,486
God came down from Heaven
and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1448
01:49:45,726 --> 01:49:47,445
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1449
01:49:47,685 --> 01:49:49,845
Don't do that.
Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1450
01:49:50,085 --> 01:49:53,684
- What just happened here
was a fuckin' miracle!
- Chill. This shit happens.

1451
01:49:53,924 --> 01:49:56,403
Wrong! Wrong.
This shit doesn't "just happen".

1452
01:49:56,643 --> 01:49:59,763
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion in a car...

1453
01:50:00,002 --> 01:50:02,162
or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1454
01:50:02,402 --> 01:50:04,761
We should be fuckin' dead,
my friend!

1455
01:50:05,001 --> 01:50:08,880
What happened here was a miracle, and I
want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1456
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:15,079
All right, it was a miracle.
Can we go now?

1457
01:50:20,358 --> 01:50:25,037
Let's go, nigger!
Come on! Shit.

1458
01:50:26,157 --> 01:50:27,556
You ever seen that show Cops?

1459
01:50:27,796 --> 01:50:30,196
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on,

1460
01:50:30,436 --> 01:50:33,875
and he was talkin' about this
gunfight he had in the hallway
with this guy, right?

1461
01:50:34,115 --> 01:50:37,274
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin'
happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1462
01:50:37,514 --> 01:50:40,034
Okay? It was just
him and this guy.

1463
01:50:40,274 --> 01:50:43,233
I mean, you know, it's,
it's freaky, but it happens.

1464
01:50:43,473 --> 01:50:48,032
You wanna play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd,
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1465
01:50:48,272 --> 01:50:50,911
- What the fuck does that mean?
- It means that's it for me.

1466
01:50:51,151 --> 01:50:53,551
From here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.

1467
01:50:53,791 --> 01:50:55,710
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.
- Don't blaspheme.

1468
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,710
- I said, don't do that!
- Hey, why are you fuckin'
freakin' out on us?

1469
01:50:58,949 --> 01:51:01,709
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today...
I'm through.

1470
01:51:01,949 --> 01:51:04,588
- Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?
- Don't worry, I will.

1471
01:51:04,828 --> 01:51:08,507
- And I bet you $10,000
he laughs his ass off.
- I don't give a damn if he does.

1472
01:51:08,747 --> 01:51:11,547
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1473
01:51:11,787 --> 01:51:13,946
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1474
01:51:14,186 --> 01:51:18,065
You gotta have an opinion. You think
God came down from Heaven and stopped...

1475
01:51:18,305 --> 01:51:20,065
- What the fuck's happenin'?

1476
01:51:20,305 --> 01:51:21,984
- Aw, shit, man!
- Aw, man!

1477
01:51:22,224 --> 01:51:24,864
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
- Why the fuck'd you do that?

1478
01:51:25,104 --> 01:51:26,783
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

1479
01:51:27,023 --> 01:51:29,663
- Man, I seen some crazy-ass
shit in my time, but this...
- Chill out, man!

1480
01:51:29,903 --> 01:51:32,542
It was an accident. We probably
went over a bump or somethin'.

1481
01:51:32,782 --> 01:51:34,462
The car ain't hit
no motherfuckin' bump.

1482
01:51:34,702 --> 01:51:37,701
I didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1483
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:41,060
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on
a city street in broad daylight here!

1484
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:43,940
- I don't believe it!
- Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1485
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:47,339
We gotta get this car off
the road. Cops notice shit
like a car drenched in blood.

1486
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:50,218
- Just take it to
a friendly place, that's all!
- This is the Valley, Vincent.

1487
01:51:50,458 --> 01:51:52,618
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places in the Valley.

1488
01:51:52,858 --> 01:51:55,497
- Well, Jules, this ain't
my fuckin' town, man!
- Shit!

1489
01:51:55,737 --> 01:51:58,376
- What you doing?
- I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1490
01:51:58,616 --> 01:52:01,816
- Where's Toluca Lake?
- Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1491
01:52:02,056 --> 01:52:04,695
If Jimmie's ass ain't home,
I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,

1492
01:52:04,935 --> 01:52:07,574
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1493
01:52:07,814 --> 01:52:10,454
Jimmie, how you doin', man?
It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1494
01:52:10,694 --> 01:52:14,293
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we
gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1495
01:52:14,533 --> 01:52:18,092
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

1496
01:52:18,092 --> 01:52:20,732
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie situation.

1497
01:52:20,971 --> 01:52:24,291
He's one remark away
from kickin' our asses out the door.

1498
01:52:24,531 --> 01:52:27,170
- If he does, what do we do?
- We ain't leavin'
'til we make a couple calls,

1499
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:30,049
but I don't want it to reach
that pitch... Jimmie's a friend.

1500
01:52:30,289 --> 01:52:32,929
You don't come into your friend's house
and start tellin' him what's what.

1501
01:52:33,169 --> 01:52:34,848
Just tell him
not to be abusive.

1502
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:36,768
He kinda freaked out back there
when he saw Marvin.

1503
01:52:37,008 --> 01:52:39,887
Put yourself in his position...
It's 8:00 in the morning,
he just woke up.

1504
01:52:40,127 --> 01:52:41,807
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1505
01:52:42,047 --> 01:52:44,686
We gotta remember here
who's doin' who a favour.

1506
01:52:44,926 --> 01:52:48,525
If that favour means I gotta
take shit, he can stick that
favour straight up his ass.

1507
01:52:48,765 --> 01:52:52,365
- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd
you just do to his towel, man?
- I was dryin' my hands!

1508
01:52:52,605 --> 01:52:55,244
- You're supposed to wash 'em first!
- You watched me wash 'em.

1509
01:52:55,484 --> 01:52:58,723
- I watched you get 'em wet.
- I was washin' 'em.
This shit's hard to get off.

1510
01:52:58,963 --> 01:53:00,643
Maybe if he'd had Lava
I coulda done a better job.

1511
01:53:00,883 --> 01:53:02,562
I used the same
fuckin' soap you did,

1512
01:53:02,802 --> 01:53:05,442
and when I finished, the towel
didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1513
01:53:05,682 --> 01:53:08,321
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

1514
01:53:08,561 --> 01:53:12,320
It's shit like this that's gonna bring
this situation to a head, man!

1515
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,679
Look, I ain't threatenin' you
or nothin', all right?

1516
01:53:15,919 --> 01:53:20,038
You know I respect you and all.
But just don't put me
in this position, all right?

1517
01:53:20,278 --> 01:53:22,678
All right.
Fine. Fine.

1518
01:53:22,918 --> 01:53:25,557
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

1519
01:53:25,797 --> 01:53:30,036
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

1520
01:53:30,276 --> 01:53:32,836
Mmm! Goddamn, Jimmie!

1521
01:53:33,076 --> 01:53:34,915
This some serious
gourmet shit.

1522
01:53:35,155 --> 01:53:36,835
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

1523
01:53:37,075 --> 01:53:38,794
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice.

1524
01:53:39,034 --> 01:53:40,714
Right?

1525
01:53:40,954 --> 01:53:43,593
And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

1526
01:53:43,833 --> 01:53:45,633
- What flavour is this?
- Knock it off, Julie.

1527
01:53:45,873 --> 01:53:49,592
- What?
- I don't need you to tell me
how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1528
01:53:49,832 --> 01:53:52,031
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

1529
01:53:52,271 --> 01:53:53,951
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

1530
01:53:54,191 --> 01:53:57,510
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1531
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:01,349
But you know what's on
my mind right now? It ain't
the coffee in my kitchen.

1532
01:54:01,589 --> 01:54:03,509
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

1533
01:54:03,749 --> 01:54:06,868
- Jimmie, don't even worry...
- Don't tell me about anything.
I wanna ask you a question.

1534
01:54:07,108 --> 01:54:08,788
When you came pulling in here,

1535
01:54:09,028 --> 01:54:11,907
did you notice the sign
on the front of my house that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1536
01:54:12,147 --> 01:54:15,266
- You know I ain't seen no...
- Did you notice the sign on
the front of my house...

1537
01:54:15,506 --> 01:54:17,186
that said,
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

1538
01:54:17,426 --> 01:54:19,865
No. I didn't.

1539
01:54:20,105 --> 01:54:22,745
- You know why you didn't
see that sign?
- Why?

1540
01:54:22,985 --> 01:54:27,184
'Cause it ain't there,
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1541
01:54:27,424 --> 01:54:30,063
- We're not gonna store
the motherfucker...
- Don't you fuckin' realize...

1542
01:54:30,303 --> 01:54:34,382
that if Bonnie comes home and
finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced?

1543
01:54:34,622 --> 01:54:37,541
No marriage counsellor.
No trial separation.
I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1544
01:54:37,781 --> 01:54:40,821
Okay? And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced!

1545
01:54:41,061 --> 01:54:45,700
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you,
but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1546
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,779
Jimmie, Jimmie,
she ain't gonna leave you.

1547
01:54:48,019 --> 01:54:51,618
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules!
Okay? Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me.

1548
01:54:51,858 --> 01:54:57,097
There's nothin' you're gonna
say that's gonna make me forget
I love my wife. Is there?

1549
01:54:58,657 --> 01:55:02,976
Now, look, you know, she comes home
from work in about an hour and a half.

1550
01:55:03,216 --> 01:55:05,975
The graveyard shift
at the hospital.

1551
01:55:06,215 --> 01:55:08,975
You gotta make some phone calls?
You gotta call some people?

1552
01:55:09,214 --> 01:55:12,814
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here.

1553
01:55:13,054 --> 01:55:15,693
That's Kool and the Gang.
We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1554
01:55:15,933 --> 01:55:18,612
All I wanna do is call my people
and get 'em to bring us in.

1555
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:21,492
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

1556
01:55:21,732 --> 01:55:24,531
You're gonna fuck my shit up
big time if Bonnie comes home.

1557
01:55:24,771 --> 01:55:27,970
Do me that favour, all right?
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

1558
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:30,850
Well, say she comes home.

1559
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:34,849
What do you think she'll do?

1560
01:55:34,849 --> 01:55:37,008
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1561
01:55:37,248 --> 01:55:39,208
That ain't no kinda answer.

1562
01:55:39,448 --> 01:55:42,207
I mean, you know, I don't.
How much? A lot or a little?

1563
01:55:42,447 --> 01:55:45,007
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

1564
01:55:45,247 --> 01:55:46,926
this Bonnie situation is.

1565
01:55:47,166 --> 01:55:50,765
She comes home from a hard day's work,
finds a bunch of gangsters
in her kitchen...

1566
01:55:51,005 --> 01:55:52,685
doing a bunch of gangster shit,

1567
01:55:52,925 --> 01:55:55,684
there ain't no tellin'
what she's liable to do.

1568
01:55:57,964 --> 01:55:59,643
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1569
01:55:59,883 --> 01:56:02,203
All I'm doing is
contemplating the ifs.

1570
01:56:02,443 --> 01:56:05,082
I don't wanna hear about
no motherfuckin' ifs!

1571
01:56:05,322 --> 01:56:08,921
All I want to hear from your ass
is, "You ain't got no problem,
Jules. I'm on the motherfucker".

1572
01:56:09,161 --> 01:56:12,960
"Chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry,
which should be coming directly."

1573
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,080
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1574
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,199
I'm on the motherfucker.

1575
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:23,118
Chill them niggers out and wait for
the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1576
01:56:23,358 --> 01:56:25,518
You sendin' the Wolf?

1577
01:56:25,758 --> 01:56:27,677
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

1578
01:56:27,917 --> 01:56:29,917
Shit, yeah, negro!

1579
01:56:30,157 --> 01:56:32,996
That's all you had to say!

1580
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:36,155
- She the hysterical type?

1581
01:56:36,395 --> 01:56:39,035
- When is she due?

1582
01:56:39,275 --> 01:56:41,114
Mm-hmm.

1583
01:56:41,354 --> 01:56:43,034
Give me
the principals' names again.

1584
01:56:43,274 --> 01:56:45,913
Place your bets.

1585
01:56:46,153 --> 01:56:49,472
- Jules. Mm-hmm.
- Cards, please.

1586
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:53,032
Vincent.

1587
01:56:56,111 --> 01:56:58,910
Jimmie.

1588
01:56:59,150 --> 01:57:02,630
Bonnie. Mm-hmm.

1589
01:57:06,389 --> 01:57:10,668
It's thirty minutes away.
I'll be there in ten.

1590
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:28,144
You're... Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

1591
01:57:28,384 --> 01:57:31,663
- It sure is.
- I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1592
01:57:31,903 --> 01:57:34,543
- Good. We got one.
- So I heard. May I come in?

1593
01:57:34,782 --> 01:57:36,462
Uh, yeah. Please do.

1594
01:57:36,702 --> 01:57:40,061
You must be Jules.
Which would make you... Vincent.

1595
01:57:40,301 --> 01:57:42,461
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1596
01:57:42,701 --> 01:57:45,340
If I was informed correctly, the clock
is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1597
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:47,260
Uh, one hundred percent.

1598
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:51,099
- Your wife Bonnie comes home
at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?
- Uh-huh.

1599
01:57:51,339 --> 01:57:55,498
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here,
she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1600
01:57:55,738 --> 01:57:59,657
- She wouldn't at that.
- That gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1601
01:57:59,897 --> 01:58:03,016
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1602
01:58:03,256 --> 01:58:08,855
Now, you got a corpse
in a car, minus a head,
in a garage. Take me to it.

1603
01:58:14,854 --> 01:58:16,533
- Jimmie.
- Uh-huh.

1604
01:58:16,773 --> 01:58:19,893
Do me a favour, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1605
01:58:20,133 --> 01:58:24,851
- Would you make me a cup?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

1606
01:58:24,851 --> 01:58:27,491
Oh, uh, um,
how do you take it?

1607
01:58:27,731 --> 01:58:31,610
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1608
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:35,289
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1609
01:58:35,529 --> 01:58:38,648
Does it smoke? Does it make
a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1610
01:58:38,888 --> 01:58:42,008
- Aside from how it looks,
the car's cool.
- Positive?

1611
01:58:42,248 --> 01:58:45,367
Don't get me on the road and I find out
the brake lights don't work.

1612
01:58:45,607 --> 01:58:49,326
- As far as I know,
the motherfucker's tip-top.
- Good enough.

1613
01:58:49,566 --> 01:58:52,965
Let's go back
to the kitchen.

1614
01:58:56,924 --> 01:59:01,163
- Here you go, Mr Wolf.
- Thank you, Jimmie.

1615
01:59:04,363 --> 01:59:07,002
Mmm.

1616
01:59:07,242 --> 01:59:09,122
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1617
01:59:09,362 --> 01:59:12,001
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1618
01:59:12,241 --> 01:59:14,681
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1619
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,520
- That would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit.
- Yeah. Under the sink.

1620
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:21,879
Good. What I need you two fellas to do
is take those cleaning products...

1621
01:59:22,119 --> 01:59:25,838
and clean the inside of the car...
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1622
01:59:26,078 --> 01:59:29,677
Go in the back seat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull.

1623
01:59:29,917 --> 01:59:32,557
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1624
01:59:32,797 --> 01:59:35,436
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1625
01:59:35,676 --> 01:59:39,675
Just give it a good once-over.
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

1626
01:59:39,915 --> 01:59:43,674
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1627
01:59:43,914 --> 01:59:46,074
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1628
01:59:46,314 --> 01:59:48,953
I need blankets,
I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1629
01:59:49,193 --> 01:59:52,512
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.
No whites. Can't use 'em.

1630
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:57,671
We'll need to camouflage the front seat
and back seat and floorboards...

1631
01:59:57,911 --> 01:59:59,591
with quilts and blankets,

1632
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:03,430
so if a cop starts stickin'
his big snout in the car,
the subterfuge won't last,

1633
02:00:03,670 --> 02:00:06,229
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1634
02:00:06,469 --> 02:00:08,269
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1635
02:00:08,509 --> 02:00:11,388
"Please" would be nice.

1636
02:00:11,628 --> 02:00:15,867
- Come again?
- I said, a "please" would be nice.

1637
02:00:16,267 --> 02:00:21,386
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say please.
I'm here to tell you what to do.

1638
02:00:21,666 --> 02:00:24,305
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1639
02:00:24,545 --> 02:00:26,705
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1640
02:00:26,945 --> 02:00:30,504
I'm here to help. If my help's
not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1641
02:00:30,744 --> 02:00:33,783
No, Mr Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1642
02:00:34,023 --> 02:00:36,663
Mr Wolf, listen. I don't
mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1643
02:00:36,902 --> 02:00:39,422
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1644
02:00:39,662 --> 02:00:42,421
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1645
02:00:42,661 --> 02:00:46,940
I think fast, I talk fast,
and I need you guys to act fast
if you wanna get out of this.

1646
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:51,899
So pretty please, with sugar on top,
clean the fuckin' car.

1647
02:00:54,779 --> 02:00:59,737
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1648
02:01:00,897 --> 02:01:03,297
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1649
02:01:05,456 --> 02:01:08,775
Green.

1650
02:01:08,855 --> 02:01:13,134
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1651
02:01:13,774 --> 02:01:17,574
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1652
02:01:17,574 --> 02:01:20,853
Nobody who'll be missed.

1653
02:01:21,413 --> 02:01:25,052
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1654
02:01:25,292 --> 02:01:26,971
- How we comin', Jimmie?
- Pretty good.

1655
02:01:27,211 --> 02:01:30,051
- I got it all here, but, uh,

1656
02:01:30,291 --> 02:01:33,410
- Mr Wolf,
you gotta understand something.
- Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1657
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:36,889
Okay. You gotta
understand something, uh, Winston.

1658
02:01:37,129 --> 02:01:38,809
Uh... Uh, no,
thank you.

1659
02:01:39,049 --> 02:01:41,848
Uh, this is
our best linen here,

1660
02:01:42,088 --> 02:01:44,728
and it's, uh...
it was a wedding present...

1661
02:01:44,967 --> 02:01:47,127
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1662
02:01:47,367 --> 02:01:51,446
- They're not with us any more.
I wanna help...
- Let me ask you a question.

1663
02:01:51,686 --> 02:01:55,965
- If you don't mind.
- No, no, please. Go ahead.

1664
02:01:56,005 --> 02:02:01,564
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny,
were they millionaires?

1665
02:02:01,804 --> 02:02:03,483
No.

1666
02:02:03,723 --> 02:02:05,883
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1667
02:02:06,123 --> 02:02:09,282
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1668
02:02:09,522 --> 02:02:11,682
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here,

1669
02:02:11,922 --> 02:02:15,841
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1670
02:02:16,081 --> 02:02:20,520
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1671
02:02:22,879 --> 02:02:27,518
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1672
02:02:27,758 --> 02:02:30,557
How about you, Jimmie?

1673
02:02:30,797 --> 02:02:33,477
You an oak man?

1674
02:02:33,717 --> 02:02:36,996
Oak's nice.

1675
02:02:41,155 --> 02:02:44,714
Oh, man, I will never
forgive your ass for this shit.

1676
02:02:44,954 --> 02:02:47,114
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1677
02:02:47,354 --> 02:02:50,473
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he is wrong...

1678
02:02:50,713 --> 02:02:53,352
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1679
02:02:53,592 --> 02:02:56,232
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1680
02:02:56,472 --> 02:02:59,031
The motherfucker that said
that shit never had to pick up
itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1681
02:02:59,271 --> 02:03:02,710
- On account of your dumb ass.
- I got a threshold, Jules,
for the abuse that I will take.

1682
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:06,230
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1683
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:09,589
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1684
02:03:09,829 --> 02:03:11,508
That's all.
I could blow.

1685
02:03:11,748 --> 02:03:13,428
- Oh, you ready to blow?
- Yeah.

1686
02:03:13,668 --> 02:03:16,307
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1687
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:19,187
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1688
02:03:19,427 --> 02:03:21,106
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1689
02:03:21,346 --> 02:03:23,986
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1690
02:03:24,226 --> 02:03:27,145
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'.

1691
02:03:27,385 --> 02:03:31,184
I'm washin' windows, and you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1692
02:03:39,102 --> 02:03:41,982
Fine job, gentlemen.

1693
02:03:42,222 --> 02:03:44,381
You may get out of this yet.

1694
02:03:44,621 --> 02:03:46,781
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1695
02:03:47,021 --> 02:03:50,140
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1696
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:53,499
Phase one is complete... Clean the car...
which moves us right along to Phase two:

1697
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:57,058
Clean you two.

1698
02:03:57,098 --> 02:03:58,738
Strip.

1699
02:03:58,978 --> 02:04:02,417
- All the way?
- To your bare ass.

1700
02:04:02,657 --> 02:04:05,457
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1701
02:04:05,697 --> 02:04:08,336
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1702
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,775
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1703
02:04:11,015 --> 02:04:12,695
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1704
02:04:12,935 --> 02:04:15,094
- You know what you two look like?
- What?

1705
02:04:15,334 --> 02:04:18,454
Like a couple of guys
who just blew off somebody's head.

1706
02:04:18,694 --> 02:04:23,373
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1707
02:04:26,052 --> 02:04:28,252
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1708
02:04:28,492 --> 02:04:32,571
Don't do nothin' stupid,
like leavin' this shit out front
for the garbageman to pick up.

1709
02:04:32,811 --> 02:04:38,009
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1710
02:04:38,249 --> 02:04:39,929
- Vincent.
- Okay, gentlemen.

1711
02:04:40,169 --> 02:04:43,368
You both been to County before,
I'm sure. Here it comes.

1712
02:04:43,608 --> 02:04:46,248
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
- Yo! Yo! Yo!

1713
02:04:46,488 --> 02:04:49,407
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1714
02:04:49,647 --> 02:04:52,286
- Don't be afraid of the soap.
Spread it around.

1715
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:55,086
- Get 'em there a little bit.
Vincent's hair.
- Hey, get out of my hair!

1716
02:04:55,326 --> 02:04:58,925
- Come on. Do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um...

1717
02:04:59,165 --> 02:05:02,444
Towel.

1718
02:05:11,042 --> 02:05:13,922
You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1719
02:05:14,162 --> 02:05:17,121
Perfect.

1720
02:05:17,361 --> 02:05:20,480
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1721
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,400
You guys look like...

1722
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:24,799
What do they look like,
Jimmie?

1723
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:28,318
- Dorks. They look like
a couple of dorks.

1724
02:05:28,558 --> 02:05:31,758
- Ha-ha-ha. They're your
clothes, motherfucker.

1725
02:05:31,998 --> 02:05:34,437
Come on, gentlemen.
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

1726
02:05:34,677 --> 02:05:37,996
Don't make me beg.

1727
02:05:39,476 --> 02:05:42,595
Okay, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

1728
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:46,074
We're going to a place
called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1729
02:05:46,314 --> 02:05:48,954
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1730
02:05:49,194 --> 02:05:50,873
The place is North Hollywood,

1731
02:05:51,113 --> 02:05:54,753
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1732
02:05:54,993 --> 02:05:59,312
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1733
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:01,231
Vincent, you follow
in my Acura.

1734
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:05,070
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws,

1735
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:08,110
- Nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something.
- Right.

1736
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:10,989
- What did I say?
- Don't do shit unless.

1737
02:06:11,229 --> 02:06:13,229
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

1738
02:06:13,468 --> 02:06:15,628
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1739
02:06:15,868 --> 02:06:18,987
How about you, Lash LaRue?
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

1740
02:06:19,227 --> 02:06:22,986
The gun went off. I don't know why.
I'm cool. I promise you.

1741
02:06:23,226 --> 02:06:25,866
Fair enough. Now, I drive real
fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1742
02:06:26,106 --> 02:06:28,305
If get my car back
any different than I gave it,

1743
02:06:28,545 --> 02:06:31,185
Monster Joe's gonna be
disposing of two bodies.

1744
02:06:35,064 --> 02:06:38,143
Outta my way, Rex.

1745
02:06:38,183 --> 02:06:40,343
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

1746
02:06:40,583 --> 02:06:44,022
- All right.
- Boys, this is Raquel.

1747
02:06:44,262 --> 02:06:46,621
Someday all this will be hers.

1748
02:06:46,861 --> 02:06:49,421
Hi. So, what's
with the outfits?

1749
02:06:49,661 --> 02:06:52,780
- You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

1750
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:55,179
I'm takin' milady
out for breakfast.

1751
02:06:55,419 --> 02:06:57,899
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

1752
02:06:58,139 --> 02:06:59,298
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

1753
02:06:59,538 --> 02:07:02,658
It's...
It's your future. I...

1754
02:07:02,898 --> 02:07:05,377
I see a...
a cab ride.

1755
02:07:05,617 --> 02:07:08,296
Move outta the sticks, fellas.
Say good night, Raquel.

1756
02:07:08,536 --> 02:07:11,176
- Good night, Raquel.
- I'll see you guys around.

1757
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:13,575
Stay outta trouble,
you crazy kids.

1758
02:07:13,815 --> 02:07:17,414
Mr Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work.

1759
02:07:17,654 --> 02:07:20,294
Yeah, really.
And thank you very much, Mr Wolf.

1760
02:07:20,534 --> 02:07:23,813
Call me Winston.

1761
02:07:23,893 --> 02:07:26,532
- You see that, young lady? Respect.

1762
02:07:26,772 --> 02:07:30,612
- Respect for one's elders
shows character.
- I have character.

1763
02:07:30,851 --> 02:07:36,170
- Because you are a character
doesn't mean that you have character.

1764
02:07:41,009 --> 02:07:43,649
- Wanna share a cab?

1765
02:07:43,889 --> 02:07:47,808
- I'd go for some breakfast.
Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1766
02:07:48,048 --> 02:07:52,127
Cool.

1767
02:07:54,606 --> 02:07:57,406
I don't know why, I just thought
he'd be European or something.

1768
02:07:57,646 --> 02:08:00,765
- Yeah, he's about as European
as fuckin' English Bob.
- I know that now.

1769
02:08:01,005 --> 02:08:03,164
- But was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

1770
02:08:03,404 --> 02:08:05,564
Totally fuckin' cool,
in control.

1771
02:08:05,804 --> 02:08:09,563
Didn't even really get pissed when you
were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1772
02:08:09,803 --> 02:08:12,122
- Want some bacon?

1773
02:08:12,362 --> 02:08:14,042
No, man, I don't eat pork.

1774
02:08:14,282 --> 02:08:17,401
- Are you Jewish?
- I ain't Jewish; I just don't
dig on swine, that's all.

1775
02:08:17,641 --> 02:08:20,281
- Why not?
- Pigs are filthy animals.

1776
02:08:20,521 --> 02:08:22,200
I don't eat filthy animals.

1777
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:25,559
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
Pork chops taste good.

1778
02:08:25,799 --> 02:08:28,439
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie,
but I'd never know...

1779
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:31,318
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

1780
02:08:31,558 --> 02:08:34,198
Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal.

1781
02:08:34,437 --> 02:08:38,037
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got
sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1782
02:08:38,277 --> 02:08:42,236
- What about a dog?
Dog eats its own feces.
- I don't eat dog either.

1783
02:08:42,476 --> 02:08:45,515
Yeah, but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal?

1784
02:08:45,755 --> 02:08:48,394
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy,

1785
02:08:48,634 --> 02:08:50,314
but they're definitely dirty.

1786
02:08:50,554 --> 02:08:54,353
- But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.
- Ah, so, by that rationale,

1787
02:08:54,593 --> 02:08:57,832
if a pig had a better personality,
he would cease to be a filthy animal.

1788
02:08:58,072 --> 02:09:01,671
- Is that true?
- We'd have to be talkin' about
one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1789
02:09:01,911 --> 02:09:05,591
I mean, he'd have to be
ten times more charming than
that Arnold on Green Acres.

1790
02:09:11,149 --> 02:09:13,029
Oh, man, that's good.

1791
02:09:13,269 --> 02:09:16,548
That's good, man.
You're startin' to lighten up.

1792
02:09:16,788 --> 02:09:19,468
You've been sittin' there,
all serious and shit.

1793
02:09:19,708 --> 02:09:21,867
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
- About what?

1794
02:09:22,107 --> 02:09:24,746
- About the miracle we witnessed.
- Miracle you witnessed.

1795
02:09:24,986 --> 02:09:29,585
- I witnessed a freak occurrence.
- What is a miracle, Vincent?

1796
02:09:29,945 --> 02:09:34,464
- Act of God.
- And what's an act of God?

1797
02:09:36,344 --> 02:09:40,783
When, um, God makes
the impossible possible.

1798
02:09:41,023 --> 02:09:42,702
But this morning...

1799
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:45,382
- I don't think qualifies.
- Hey, Vincent.

1800
02:09:45,622 --> 02:09:49,021
See, that shit don't matter.
You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1801
02:09:49,261 --> 02:09:53,820
It could be God stopped the bullets,
changed Coke to Pepsi,
found my car keys.

1802
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:56,739
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

1803
02:09:56,979 --> 02:09:59,139
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

1804
02:09:59,379 --> 02:10:02,258
was an according-to-Hoyle miracle
is insignificant.

1805
02:10:02,498 --> 02:10:05,937
But what is significant is,
I felt the touch of God.

1806
02:10:06,177 --> 02:10:07,857
God got involved.

1807
02:10:08,097 --> 02:10:09,577
But why?

1808
02:10:09,817 --> 02:10:12,576
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me:
I don't know why.

1809
02:10:12,816 --> 02:10:15,455
- But I can't go back to sleep.
- You're serious.

1810
02:10:15,695 --> 02:10:17,375
You're really thinkin'
about quittin'.

1811
02:10:17,615 --> 02:10:20,014
- For life? Most definitely.
- Yeah.

1812
02:10:20,254 --> 02:10:24,493
Fuck.
What you gonna do then?

1813
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:28,612
Well, that's what I been
sitting here contemplating.

1814
02:10:28,852 --> 02:10:32,132
First I'm gonna deliver
this case to Marsellus.

1815
02:10:32,372 --> 02:10:35,171
Then, basically, I'm just
gonna walk the Earth.

1816
02:10:35,411 --> 02:10:38,530
- What you mean, "walk the Earth"?
- Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1817
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:41,450
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

1818
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:43,689
And how long do you intend
to walk the Earth?

1819
02:10:43,929 --> 02:10:46,928
- 'Til God puts me
where He wants me to be.
- What if He don't do that?

1820
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:51,727
- If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.
- So you decided to be a bum.

1821
02:10:51,967 --> 02:10:55,287
I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
No more, no less.

1822
02:10:55,526 --> 02:10:57,246
No, Jules,
you decided to be a bum,

1823
02:10:57,486 --> 02:11:00,485
just like all those pieces of shit
out there who beg for change,

1824
02:11:00,725 --> 02:11:03,365
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

1825
02:11:03,605 --> 02:11:06,284
They got a name for that, Jules.
It's called a bum.

1826
02:11:06,524 --> 02:11:09,843
And without a job,
a residence or legal tender,
that's what you're gonna be, man.

1827
02:11:10,083 --> 02:11:11,763
You're gonna be
a fuckin' bum.

1828
02:11:12,003 --> 02:11:14,642
Look, my friend,
this is just where you and I differ.

1829
02:11:14,882 --> 02:11:17,442
Garçon! Coffee!

1830
02:11:17,682 --> 02:11:21,841
Jules, look, what happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

1831
02:11:22,081 --> 02:11:24,880
- But water into wine, I...
- All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1832
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,919
- Don't fuckin' talk
to me that way, man.
- If my answers frighten you,

1833
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:32,118
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

1834
02:11:33,438 --> 02:11:36,717
I'm gonna take a shit.

1835
02:11:38,037 --> 02:11:40,317
Let me ask you something.

1836
02:11:40,557 --> 02:11:43,636
When did you make this decision?
When you were sittin' there
eatin' that muffin?

1837
02:11:43,876 --> 02:11:47,475
Yeah. I was sittin' here
eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,

1838
02:11:47,715 --> 02:11:49,395
replayin' the incident
in my head,

1839
02:11:49,635 --> 02:11:53,114
when I had what alcoholics refer to
as a moment of clarity.

1840
02:11:53,354 --> 02:11:57,793
Fuck. To be continued.

1841
02:12:07,871 --> 02:12:12,150
- I love you, Pumpkin.
- I love you, Honey Bunny.

1842
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:14,869
- Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

1843
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:19,748
Any one of you fucking pricks move,
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

1844
02:12:19,988 --> 02:12:23,067
- You got that?
You just be quiet over there!
- Waitresses on the floor!

1845
02:12:23,307 --> 02:12:26,067
Get on the fuckin'...
Get the fuck down!

1846
02:12:26,307 --> 02:12:30,666
You're in a blind spot.
Take your dames over to that booth,
on the count of ten!

1847
02:12:30,906 --> 02:12:35,105
- Mexicans, out of
the fucking kitchen!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1848
02:12:35,345 --> 02:12:38,144
What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1849
02:12:38,384 --> 02:12:40,583
- Get down!
- Throw those bags!

1850
02:12:40,823 --> 02:12:43,063
- Fucking move! Move!

1851
02:12:43,303 --> 02:12:45,302
- Move! Get the fuck...

1852
02:12:45,542 --> 02:12:48,262
Get down on the fucking floor!

1853
02:12:48,502 --> 02:12:50,181
Grandpa! Down!

1854
02:12:50,421 --> 02:12:53,501
I'm the manager here, and there's
no problem. No problem at all.

1855
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:56,380
- You gonna give me a problem?
- No, sir, I'm not.

1856
02:12:56,620 --> 02:13:00,299
Thought you said you were gonna
give me a fucking problem!

1857
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:04,858
- I think we got
a hero here, Honey Bunny.
- Well, just execute him!

1858
02:13:05,098 --> 02:13:06,778
- I am not a hero.

1859
02:13:07,018 --> 02:13:09,777
- I'm just a coffee shop manager.
- Get the fuck down!

1860
02:13:10,017 --> 02:13:11,537
The restaurant's ours!

1861
02:13:11,777 --> 02:13:14,416
- Just take whatever you want.

1862
02:13:14,656 --> 02:13:16,336
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

1863
02:13:16,575 --> 02:13:19,415
You tell them to be fucking cool
and everything will be over.

1864
02:13:19,655 --> 02:13:22,974
- You understand me?
- Yes!

1865
02:13:23,734 --> 02:13:25,294
Listen, everybody.

1866
02:13:25,533 --> 02:13:27,293
Be calm, cooperate,

1867
02:13:27,533 --> 02:13:30,172
and this'll all be over
in a minute!

1868
02:13:30,412 --> 02:13:32,132
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

1869
02:13:44,129 --> 02:13:47,249
All right, now, people, gonna
come around and collect your wallets!

1870
02:13:47,489 --> 02:13:50,648
You don't fucking talk. You just
throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1871
02:13:50,888 --> 02:13:52,847
I said, are we fucking clear?

1872
02:13:53,087 --> 02:13:55,727
Good!
Now, wallets out!

1873
02:13:55,967 --> 02:13:59,246
That's it.
Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1874
02:13:59,486 --> 02:14:02,125
- In the fucking bag!
- I don't
have nothin' on me, man.

1875
02:14:02,365 --> 02:14:04,005
In the bag.

1876
02:14:04,245 --> 02:14:06,884
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

1877
02:14:07,124 --> 02:14:09,764
Laura. Laura. Tips.
In the bag.

1878
02:14:10,004 --> 02:14:11,963
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

1879
02:14:12,203 --> 02:14:15,483
In the fucking bag.

1880
02:14:15,562 --> 02:14:18,722
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1881
02:14:18,962 --> 02:14:22,721
In the bag.
In the bag.

1882
02:14:32,959 --> 02:14:36,278
In the bag.

1883
02:14:49,315 --> 02:14:51,954
- What's in the case?
- My boss's dirty laundry.

1884
02:14:52,194 --> 02:14:54,434
- Your boss makes you do his laundry?
- When he wants it clean.

1885
02:14:54,674 --> 02:14:57,113
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1886
02:14:57,353 --> 02:15:01,592
- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

1887
02:15:02,112 --> 02:15:05,152
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

1888
02:15:05,392 --> 02:15:07,471
What's going on?

1889
02:15:07,711 --> 02:15:10,870
- Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.
- Shoot him in the face!

1890
02:15:11,110 --> 02:15:14,510
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

1891
02:15:14,749 --> 02:15:17,829
- If you don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.
- Stop causing problems!

1892
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:20,588
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

1893
02:15:20,828 --> 02:15:24,707
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

1894
02:15:24,947 --> 02:15:26,907
Be cool, Honey Bunny, be cool.

1895
02:15:27,147 --> 02:15:30,626
No problem.
I got it under control.

1896
02:15:30,666 --> 02:15:34,025
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1897
02:15:34,145 --> 02:15:39,344
If you don't open that case,
I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1898
02:15:42,143 --> 02:15:45,423
We clear?

1899
02:15:46,982 --> 02:15:50,302
One.

1900
02:15:50,622 --> 02:15:52,861
Two.

1901
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:54,901
- Three.
- Okay, Ringo.

1902
02:15:55,141 --> 02:15:56,980
You win.

1903
02:15:57,220 --> 02:16:00,499
It's yours.

1904
02:16:02,939 --> 02:16:06,978
- Open it.

1905
02:16:09,258 --> 02:16:11,217
Hey, what is it?

1906
02:16:11,457 --> 02:16:13,537
What is it?

1907
02:16:13,777 --> 02:16:16,096
Is that what I think it is?

1908
02:16:16,336 --> 02:16:20,375
Mm-hmm.

1909
02:16:20,415 --> 02:16:22,295
It's beautiful.

1910
02:16:22,535 --> 02:16:26,174
Goddamn it, what is it?

1911
02:16:26,414 --> 02:16:29,053
You let him go!
You let him go!

1912
02:16:29,293 --> 02:16:31,973
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
- Tell that bitch to be cool.

1913
02:16:32,212 --> 02:16:34,852
- Say, "Bitch, be cool"!
Say, "Bitch, be cool"!
- Be cool! Be cool!

1914
02:16:35,092 --> 02:16:37,531
- Tell that bitch to chill!
- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1915
02:16:37,771 --> 02:16:40,371
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1916
02:16:40,611 --> 02:16:42,170
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1917
02:16:42,410 --> 02:16:45,050
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right!
- I promise!

1918
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:46,929
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

1919
02:16:47,169 --> 02:16:48,849
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

1920
02:16:49,089 --> 02:16:52,208
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1921
02:16:52,448 --> 02:16:55,087
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1922
02:16:55,327 --> 02:16:58,527
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1923
02:16:58,767 --> 02:17:02,086
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like?
- He's cool.

1924
02:17:02,326 --> 02:17:04,005
- What?
- Cool.

1925
02:17:04,245 --> 02:17:06,805
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

1926
02:17:07,045 --> 02:17:08,724
We're gonna be cool.

1927
02:17:08,964 --> 02:17:13,483
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

1928
02:17:13,723 --> 02:17:15,563
And when I count three,

1929
02:17:15,803 --> 02:17:18,442
I want you to
let go of your gun,

1930
02:17:18,682 --> 02:17:22,801
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

1931
02:17:23,041 --> 02:17:24,841
And when you do it,

1932
02:17:25,081 --> 02:17:26,880
you do it cool.

1933
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,200
You ready?

1934
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,279
One,

1935
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:33,439
two,

1936
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:36,998
three.

1937
02:17:42,237 --> 02:17:45,076
- Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

1938
02:17:45,316 --> 02:17:48,596
I thought you were gonna
be cool. Now, when you yell
at me, it makes me nervous.

1939
02:17:48,836 --> 02:17:50,675
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

1940
02:17:50,915 --> 02:17:56,034
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

1941
02:17:56,154 --> 02:17:59,473
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1942
02:17:59,713 --> 02:18:02,793
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

1943
02:18:03,032 --> 02:18:04,712
But I don't want that.

1944
02:18:04,952 --> 02:18:06,632
And you don't want that.

1945
02:18:06,872 --> 02:18:09,311
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

1946
02:18:09,551 --> 02:18:13,030
So let's see what we can do.

1947
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:16,789
Now... here's the situation.

1948
02:18:17,029 --> 02:18:20,589
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

1949
02:18:20,829 --> 02:18:23,948
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

1950
02:18:24,188 --> 02:18:26,827
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

1951
02:18:27,067 --> 02:18:30,666
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

1952
02:18:30,906 --> 02:18:33,546
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

1953
02:18:33,786 --> 02:18:36,425
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

1954
02:18:36,665 --> 02:18:38,265
- Vincent!

1955
02:18:38,505 --> 02:18:41,144
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

1956
02:18:41,384 --> 02:18:43,824
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

1957
02:18:44,063 --> 02:18:47,863
- Come on. Point the gun at me.
Point the gun at me. There you go.

1958
02:18:48,103 --> 02:18:49,902
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

1959
02:18:50,142 --> 02:18:51,822
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

1960
02:18:52,062 --> 02:18:53,741
Tell her it's still cool.

1961
02:18:53,981 --> 02:18:57,900
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

1962
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:00,540
I... I gotta go pee.

1963
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:02,459
I wanna go home.

1964
02:19:02,699 --> 02:19:05,979
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

1965
02:19:06,219 --> 02:19:08,858
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

1966
02:19:09,098 --> 02:19:12,137
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

1967
02:19:12,377 --> 02:19:15,257
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

1968
02:19:15,497 --> 02:19:20,695
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

1969
02:19:21,695 --> 02:19:26,934
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker".

1970
02:19:39,171 --> 02:19:41,451
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

1971
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:46,130
Open it up.
Take out the money.

1972
02:19:49,489 --> 02:19:53,008
Count it.

1973
02:19:57,647 --> 02:20:01,486
How much is there?

1974
02:20:01,886 --> 02:20:03,566
About 1,500 dollars.

1975
02:20:03,806 --> 02:20:06,685
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

1976
02:20:06,925 --> 02:20:09,845
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

1977
02:20:10,085 --> 02:20:11,924
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

1978
02:20:12,164 --> 02:20:15,723
Jules, you give that fuckin'
nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll
shoot him on general principle.

1979
02:20:15,963 --> 02:20:19,083
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

1980
02:20:19,323 --> 02:20:21,162
Vince, shut the fuck up!

1981
02:20:21,402 --> 02:20:24,921
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

1982
02:20:25,161 --> 02:20:27,801
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

1983
02:20:28,041 --> 02:20:30,840
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

1984
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:33,999
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

1985
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:38,598
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

1986
02:20:38,838 --> 02:20:42,198
You read the Bible, Ringo?

1987
02:20:42,437 --> 02:20:44,117
Not regularly, no.

1988
02:20:44,357 --> 02:20:46,517
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

1989
02:20:46,757 --> 02:20:49,996
Ezekiel 25:17.

1990
02:20:50,236 --> 02:20:52,755
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

1991
02:20:52,995 --> 02:20:54,675
by the inequities
of the selfish...

1992
02:20:54,915 --> 02:20:56,594
and the tyranny of evil men."

1993
02:20:56,834 --> 02:20:59,914
"Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

1994
02:21:00,154 --> 02:21:02,313
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

1995
02:21:02,553 --> 02:21:06,312
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children."

1996
02:21:06,552 --> 02:21:10,511
"And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

1997
02:21:10,751 --> 02:21:13,511
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers."

1998
02:21:13,751 --> 02:21:16,470
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

1999
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:20,909
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2000
02:21:21,149 --> 02:21:23,308
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2001
02:21:23,548 --> 02:21:26,428
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2002
02:21:26,668 --> 02:21:29,307
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2003
02:21:29,547 --> 02:21:32,187
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2004
02:21:32,426 --> 02:21:34,586
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2005
02:21:34,826 --> 02:21:37,945
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2006
02:21:38,185 --> 02:21:40,825
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2007
02:21:41,065 --> 02:21:45,544
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2008
02:21:45,784 --> 02:21:48,423
and Mr 9-millimetre here,
he's the shepherd...

2009
02:21:48,663 --> 02:21:51,942
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2010
02:21:52,182 --> 02:21:53,862
Or it could mean...

2011
02:21:54,102 --> 02:21:57,221
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2012
02:21:57,461 --> 02:22:01,060
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2013
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:03,300
Now, I'd like that.

2014
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:06,139
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2015
02:22:06,379 --> 02:22:08,938
The truth is,

2016
02:22:09,178 --> 02:22:12,138
you're the weak...

2017
02:22:12,378 --> 02:22:16,737
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2018
02:22:16,977 --> 02:22:19,816
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2019
02:22:20,056 --> 02:22:22,695
I'm tryin' real hard...

2020
02:22:22,935 --> 02:22:26,575
to be the shepherd.

2021
02:22:39,812 --> 02:22:43,091
Go.

2022
02:22:58,608 --> 02:23:00,767
I think we should be
leaving now.

2023
02:23:01,007 --> 02:23:05,286
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
