01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:34,965
You'II be back here tomorrow
in time for Iunch.

827
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:37,522
Good.

828
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:42,765
Good taIking to you.

829
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,803
Why not Ieave your friend here?

830
01:01:45,887 --> 01:01:48,560
WhiIe you're gone, he can teII me
how to run my business.

831
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:51,605
-I think Frank wants to see him.
-No, that's okay.

832
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:55,202
You teII Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

833
01:01:57,847 --> 01:01:59,326
I guess so.

834
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:04,199
Let's finish our Iunch.

835
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:10,643
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

836
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,117
You got everything a man couId want.

837
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:18,680
I Iike you, Tony.
There is no Iying in you.

838
01:02:20,207 --> 01:02:24,200
UnfortunateIy, I don't feeI the same
about the rest of your organisation.

839
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:29,757
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

840
01:02:30,407 --> 01:02:32,716
I'm taIking about Omar Suarez.

841
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:38,683
This garbage was recognised
by my associate at Iunch...

842
01:02:39,607 --> 01:02:41,882
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

843
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:48,043
He was an informer for the poIice.

844
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:56,597
[Dramatic instrumentaI music]

845
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:00,961
[Omar screams]

846
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:09,240
SOSA: He put Vito DuvaI and NeIIo
and Gino Ramos away for Iife.

847
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:16,406
<i>So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?</i>

848
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,317
Let's get this straight now.

849
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:30,960
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

850
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,526
You got that?

851
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:37,076
AII I have in this worId
is my baIIs and my word.

852
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:40,438
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

853
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:44,041
That piece of shit up there,
I never Iiked him...

854
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,560
I never trusted him.

855
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:47,678
For aII I know, he had me set up...

856
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,042
and had my friend
AngeI Fernandez kiIIed.

857
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:52,436
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

858
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:54,802
You want to go on with me, say it.

859
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:57,526
You don't, then you make a move.

860
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,527
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

861
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:06,960
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

862
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:09,918
this Lopez, your boss...

863
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:13,680
<i>he had chivatos Iike that
working for him.</i>

864
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:16,125
His judgment stinks.

865
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:20,438
So I think to myseIf...

866
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:23,725
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

867
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:29,835
How can I trust his organisation?
You teII me, Tony.

868
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:34,840
Frank is smart, you know?

869
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,357
You can't bIame him for that animaI.

870
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:43,200
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

871
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,926
That couId happen to anyone,
even you.

872
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:54,880
Why don't I go back
and taIk to Frank...

873
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,240
and work it out?

874
01:04:58,087 --> 01:04:59,964
I'II fix things between us.

875
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:03,365
You got my word on that.

876
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:07,680
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

877
01:05:08,287 --> 01:05:10,596
we do business together
for a Iong time.

878
01:05:12,527 --> 01:05:13,801
Just remember...

879
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,837
I'II onIy teII you one time...

880
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,878
don't fuck me, Tony.

881
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:24,318
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

882
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:38,835
FRANK: You what?

883
01:05:40,967 --> 01:05:44,323
You made a deaI
for fucking $18 miIIion...

884
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,681
without even checking with me?

885
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,758
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

886
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:49,565
<i>-Coño. Take it easy.
-Coño, my ass!</i>

887
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:52,639
<i>At $10,500 a key. It's puro.</i>

888
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:56,357
You can't Iose money. No way.

889
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,643
We make $75 miIIion on this deaI.

890
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,557
$75 miIIion.

891
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:07,479
That is serious money.

892
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:09,519
What is Sosa going to do...

893
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:11,802
when I don't come up
with the first $5 miIIion?

894
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,560
What is he going to do?
WiII he send me a biII?

895
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:17,957
He'II send a hit squad up here!
There'II be a war in the street.

896
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:21,642
ReIax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

897
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:26,399
You short a coupIe of miIIion,
I go on the street for you.

898
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,364
I make a coupIe of moves...

899
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:31,322
a miIIion here, a miIIion there,
you got it.

900
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:39,077
You've been making moves
on your own?

901
01:06:41,207 --> 01:06:44,085
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

902
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:50,565
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

903
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:52,763
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

904
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:55,077
<i>What'll he do
when you start moving 2,000 keys--</i>

905
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:58,921
Fuck Gaspar Gomez
and fuck the Diaz brothers!

906
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:00,156
<i>Fuck 'em all!</i>

907
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:03,157
I'II bury those cockroaches!

908
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:06,365
What they ever do for us?

909
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:16,725
Look, Frank, the time has come.

910
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,759
We gotta expand.

911
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:23,280
The whoIe operation. Distribution.

912
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:27,439
New York, Chicago, LA.

913
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:31,800
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

914
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:34,239
We gotta think big now.

915
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:39,921
Think big.

916
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,325
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

917
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,838
Let me teII you something
about that greasebaII cocksucker.

918
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,835
He is a snake, that's what he is.

919
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:01,395
<i>You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.</i>

920
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:04,198
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

921
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:07,797
You want me to beIieve...

922
01:08:08,487 --> 01:08:12,400
Omar was a stooIie
because Sosa said so?

923
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:14,366
You bought that Iine?

924
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:18,326
<i>Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.</i>

925
01:08:19,727 --> 01:08:22,605
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

926
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:26,922
Like what?

927
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:29,440
Like what?

928
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:33,043
You teII me, ''Like what.''

929
01:08:37,087 --> 01:08:39,521
You caIIing me a Iiar, Frank?

930
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:42,199
That what you're caIIing me?

931
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:51,562
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

932
01:08:54,767 --> 01:08:57,235
You staII your deaI with Sosa.

933
01:08:58,887 --> 01:09:00,115
StaII it?

934
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:05,806
Okay, boss.

935
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:07,436
Come on.

936
01:09:09,847 --> 01:09:10,996
I am the boss.

937
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:14,636
TONY: Sure, you're the boss.
FRANK: Hey, Tony.

938
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:21,315
Remember I toId you
when you started...

939
01:09:21,487 --> 01:09:23,876
the guys who Iast
in this business...

940
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,843
are the guys who fIy straight...

941
01:09:28,087 --> 01:09:29,520
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

942
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,723
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

943
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:36,558
<i>chicas, champagne, fIash...</i>

944
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:39,846
they don't Iast.

945
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:42,515
You finished?

946
01:09:43,407 --> 01:09:44,556
Can I go now?

947
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,605
TONY: Hi, there.

948
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:16,205
ELVIRA: You just missed Frank.

949
01:10:19,247 --> 01:10:20,316
TONY: Too bad.

950
01:10:22,607 --> 01:10:24,598
OnIy I didn't come to see Frank.

951
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:28,885
ELVIRA: This is not the time
or the pIace, Tony.

952
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,835
ELVIRA: Make an appointment.
TONY: That's okay.

953
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,919
I got something important
I want to taIk to you about.

954
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:43,995
<i>So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...</i>

955
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:45,800
<i>act normal...</i>

956
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,719
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

957
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:52,358
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

958
01:10:57,047 --> 01:11:00,198
-Sure. Why not?
-Okay. I won't bite you.

959
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:04,638
We're aII normaI here.

960
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:11,796
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

961
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,441
That's right.

962
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:19,997
I think it's easier, don't you?

963
01:11:20,727 --> 01:11:22,365
Makes things easier.

964
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:25,876
Thank you.

965
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,203
Here's to ''the Iand of opportunity.''

966
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:31,606
ELVIRA: For you, maybe.

967
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:37,636
You Iike kids?

968
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:40,436
Kids?

969
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,197
Kids. You know, kids. LittIe kids.

970
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:46,923
Sure. Why not?

971
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:48,720
As Iong as there's a nurse.

972
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:51,640
Good, 'cause I Iike kids, too.

973
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:57,486
I Iike them. Boys, girIs.
Don't matter to me.

974
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:02,683
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

975
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:04,606
Come here.

976
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:12,356
Sit here.

977
01:12:13,207 --> 01:12:16,358
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

978
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,805
Okay, here's the story.

979
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:30,004
I come from the gutter. I know that.

980
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:33,879
I got no education...

981
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:36,206
but that's okay.

982
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:39,523
I know the street...

983
01:12:39,607 --> 01:12:41,996
and I'm making
aII the right connections.

984
01:12:43,087 --> 01:12:46,477
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

985
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,238
I couId go right to the top.

986
01:12:51,287 --> 01:12:52,322
Anyway...

987
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,237
what I got to teII you is this:

988
01:12:57,327 --> 01:12:58,806
I Iike you.

989
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:04,640
I Iiked you
the first time I Iaid eyes on you.

990
01:13:07,727 --> 01:13:10,195
I said, ''She's a tiger.

991
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:14,404
''She'II beIong to me.''

992
01:13:18,247 --> 01:13:19,600
Anyway...

993
01:13:20,847 --> 01:13:22,565
I want you to marry me.

994
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:28,325
I want you to be
the mother of my chiIdren.

995
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:33,959
Me? Marry you?

996
01:13:34,047 --> 01:13:35,241
That's right.

997
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:41,439
