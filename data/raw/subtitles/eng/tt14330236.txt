1
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,406
Bye, Mack.

2
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,445
Mack, sweetie,

3
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,558
don't you want to keep playing
with the other kids?

4
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,482
Nah. They all ride too fast.

5
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,294
I don't like to go that fast.

6
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,522
Me neither, kid. Me neither.

7
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,258
Life goes fast enough as it is.

8
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,731
I got it. This is the one.
This is the one. Do you love it?

9
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,566
- I love it!
- You love it.

10
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,604
Oh, you chickens wouldn't
mind scooching in a smidge

11
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:17,939
for an old gal, would you?

12
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,248
Huh?

13
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,877
<i>I grew up always feeling
like I was an older woman</i>

14
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,279
<i>trapped in the body
of a little girl.</i>

15
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,450
<i>I think that's why I was
so fond of the term "old gal."</i>

16
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,252
<i>I was raised by my grandma.</i>

17
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,388
<i>And she was
the coolest "old gal"</i>

18
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,723
I ever knew.

19
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,625
<i>Whenever I told her that,
she'd say...</i>

20
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,527
Well, that's because I'm old.

21
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,230
I got less time to live,
so I got less flips to give.

22
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,601
<i>All I wanted was to be
like Grammie Martin.</i>

23
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,738
<i>But, like any kid,
I had to fit in.</i>

24
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,449
<i>Over the years...</i>

25
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,776
<i>...I got better at hiding</i>

26
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:56,410
<i>what I thought was cool,</i>

27
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,514
<i>and getting into what
my friends thought was cool.</i>

28
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,449
<i>And you know what?
It worked out pretty well.</i>

29
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,827
<i>I wrote a book...</i>

30
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,019
<i>...and people liked it.</i>

31
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,789
<i>And I liked
being invited to the party.</i>

32
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,624
<i>And even though
I didn't always know</i>

33
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,291
<i>what to do with myself,</i>

34
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,895
<i>I surrounded myself
with people who did.</i>

35
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,663
<i>And I did my darnedest</i>

36
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,265
<i>to keep my inner old gal
to myself.</i>

37
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,953
<i>Um, hello,
are you listening to me?</i>

38
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,288
<i>I said, maybe,
you should write a short story</i>

39
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,323
<i>about the time
I projectile-vomited</i>

40
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,392
<i>into the Chex Mix bowl
at junior prom.</i>

41
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,937
<i>I think it's a good story.</i>

42
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,964
Uh, yeah. I'll, uh,
I'll think about it.

43
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,835
I actually, um,
I called to see what, uh,

44
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:56,571
Little Brown said
about my proposal?

45
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,372
<i>They rejected it,
which is so unfair.</i>

46
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,776
Oh. Okay.

47
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,778
<i>Listen, I can't get you
an advance</i>

48
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,412
on a book right now,
and I don't know...

49
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,749
<i>why you'd want to waste
your time writing one, okay?</i>

50
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:08,583
<i>No one reads</i>

51
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,984
<i>anymore.</i>

52
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,552
<i>Isn't like</i>
<i>every</i> Barnes and Noble

53
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,854
<i>an</i> Eataly <i>now?</i>

54
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,656
<i>What I can do is,
I can make some calls</i>

55
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,859
<i>and I can keep getting you
minor branding opportunities</i>

56
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:20,327
<i>so you don't feel
like a total sham,</i>

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,530
<i>calling yourself a writer,
every time someone asks</i>

58
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,163
<i>what you do at parties.</i>

59
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,803
Well, thank you for investing
in my talent.

60
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,538
<i>Was that sarcasm?</i>

61
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,373
<i>Mack, just remember,</i>

62
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,810
<i>if you're not getting paid
for something, it's a hobby.</i>

63
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,545
<i>And hobbies are disgusting.</i>

64
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,813
Got it.

65
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,447
<i>I love you, baby. Bye.</i>

66
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,304
Okay.

67
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,619
Blankets.

68
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,858
- Good morning, girls!
- Hi, Mrs. Coletti.

69
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,494
Come to do a little shopping
at Sharon's Vineyard?

70
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,831
Yes. And as I told you,

71
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:32,066
that joke's only funny
if your name's Martha.

72
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,367
Well, I think it works.

73
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,604
Take whatever you like.

74
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,606
Thank you. Love you.

75
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,608
I could have actually
done this shopping.

76
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,442
It is your bachelorette party.

77
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,513
But when I put you
in charge of my 21st,

78
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,747
we ended up with a tableful

79
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,061
of different flavors
of schnapps.

80
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,384
Whatever. That was
a super fun spread!

81
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,556
Okay.

82
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,993
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

83
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,129
Just posting for socks,
because that's what I do.

84
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,601
Had a very enlightening
conversation this morning

85
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,804
with my agent, who informed me,
in no uncertain terms,

86
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,106
that I am essentially
no longer a writer.

87
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,608
So, you know.

88
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,179
Instagram doesn't define you.
Instagram just pays the bills.

89
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,047
- Okay?
- Ugh! I know. I know.

90
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:23,050
I... I just need to write a book.
Another book.

91
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:24,795
- I'm gonna write another one.
- You should.

92
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,021
Mama, we're leaving.

93
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,658
Have fun, girls.
Enjoy the house.

94
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,961
You have no idea
how many yarn stores

95
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,198
I had to take Betty to
for her to let you gals use it.

96
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,633
Yarn stores?

97
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,601
So, see you back here Sunday
for the shower.

98
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,275
- Thanks, Mrs. C.
- Indeed.

99
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,905
Mack,

100
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,940
- get that hair out of your face.
- Ooh.

101
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,711
How does she do that?

102
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,046
This...

103
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:55,983
This.

104
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,451
Hey. Hey, there you are.

105
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,089
Here I am.
My house. Hanging out.

106
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,224
Packing up.

107
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,697
Yeah.

108
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,661
Oh, Cheesy! Hey.

109
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,763
Hi, buddy. Yes, come.

110
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,098
Yes. Hello. Oh, whoops.

111
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,634
Oh, Cheese... Cheesy!

112
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,569
God, I am so sorry. I'll, um...

113
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,804
- It's...
- Ugh!

114
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,573
I'm so sorry.
I promise I'll replace them.

115
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:20,908
No! You... you... you can't.

116
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,953
They're limited editions.

117
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,612
Oh.

118
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,089
Yeah, and I've already
worn them twice,

119
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,815
so, really, what am I
gonna get out of them

120
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,650
- at this point, right?
- Well, again,

121
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,687
so sorry about that.

122
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,224
So, um, anyway, each day's food
is in these little baggies,

123
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,660
so half in the morning,
then half at night.

124
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,228
Every day and night.

125
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,065
Yeah. Uh, I'll be able
to figure out how to...

126
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,968
- How to feed the dog.
- Right. Cool.

127
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,739
Wow, crazy plans this weekend?

128
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,007
Uh, yeah!

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,809
It's my best friend's
bachelorette

130
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,979
in Palm Springs.
I mean, it's gonna be wild.

131
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,814
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

132
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,550
Uh, well, if you're looking
for something

133
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,885
a little more low-key,
I like to every now and again,

134
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,687
just go for a rip
around the neighborhood

135
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:07,888
on my long board,

136
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,429
and if you wanted, maybe,
you could come with, some time.

137
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,194
Maybe.

138
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,009
Whelp!

139
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,932
I think that's everything.

140
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,668
- Great.
- Thank you, Jack.

141
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,170
No problem, Mack.

142
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,939
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,252
All right.
See you later, Cheesy.

144
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,256
Sorry.

145
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:44,792
Found it! So,
it was under the seat.

146
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,065
So, you said that he wanted
to go skateboarding with you?

147
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,697
Well, I think
that's definite proof

148
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,600
that Hot Dog-Sitter Guy is
completely obsessed with you.

149
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,914
Oh, my God. Why won't you give
this hot man what he wants?

150
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,806
I don't know. I mean, he comes
off like a total Lothario.

151
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,741
- I'm sorry, what?
- Who?

152
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:01,909
Lothario?

153
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,745
- You know, Lothario.
- What is that?

154
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,647
- Oh, you know...
- Thank you.

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,915
Lothario.

156
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,359
- Lothario? What is that?
- I don't know.

157
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,861
- I don't know what that means.
- A play a.

158
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,020
- Guys!
- Woohoo!

159
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,793
Okay, back to the SAT word.

160
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,728
Uh. I can't date my neighbor.
I can't do it.

161
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,229
Um, no one said "date."

162
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:24,131
No, I didn't hear that.
I didn't hear date.

163
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,267
Mm-mm. Cheers.

164
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,702
Cheers.

165
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,280
Okay, wait, can we look up
his socials real quick?

166
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,049
- Yes, what is it? What is it?
- Oh, that's the thing.

167
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,275
- He doesn't do social.
- Oh, hey, that's not good.

168
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:35,748
- Mm-mm.
- Right? That's what I said.

169
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,878
How do we know
he's not a stalker tracking you?

170
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,992
Working for the NSA?
Working for the government?

171
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,348
CAA?

172
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,851
- FDA?
- Yeah, weird.

173
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:47,021
Like, just so we're clear,
you're prejudging him

174
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,789
based on what
he shows to the world

175
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,658
without entertaining the idea

176
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,259
that there could
be something more?

177
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,162
- I see you.
- Loth... Lothario.

178
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,373
Careful with
your drinks, ladies.

179
00:09:56,397 --> 00:09:57,932
Betty's precious
about her carpet.

180
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,899
- Carpet?
- Yeah.

181
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,334
Fucking no. Carpets, ew.

182
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,807
I can't stay in
a place with carpets.

183
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,773
I stand corrected.

184
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,844
Okay. I bet our Betty
puts some parties in here.

185
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,822
- I bet our Betty did.
- Oh, for sure.

186
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:16,183
Oh, Betty, my God.
I'm in love with you.

187
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,284
Is she single?

188
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,396
Oh, my God. It's like as
if there's a filter in here.

189
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,031
This weekend is

190
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,690
going to be sick!

191
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,391
I'm getting married.

192
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,715
Oh, shit! We got it all

193
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,874
over Betty's carpet.

194
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,984
No, just leave it there,

195
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,385
and put the broken glass
on the side.

196
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,677
Oh, my God.

197
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,088
Okay, let's go.
I'll meet you outside.

198
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,849
Oh, my God.

199
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,285
They're gorgeous.

200
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,687
They're all...

201
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,422
...so gorgeous.

202
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,727
Hello.

203
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,432
Let's see.

204
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,206
There she is.

205
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,046
Mack, where the freak are you?

206
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,079
- We're at the bar already.
- Uh, nothing. Nowhere.

207
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,226
Okay, well, get your
cutie little booty tooty

208
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,752
out to the bar.
We're doing shots!

209
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,754
Yeah. I feel like if
I got my tonsils out,

210
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,722
I would just, like,
want to put them in a jar.

211
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,757
Ready?

212
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,835
Yeah, me, too.

213
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,860
Oh.

214
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,395
- No.
- You...

215
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,474
Okay. So, um...
...just so you're aware,

216
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,309
it is our best bebe's
bachelorette bridal brunch,

217
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,373
and you best come correct.

218
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,870
And, at the moment,
you're very incorrect.

219
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:47,408
Oh. Well, I'm not ready-ready.

220
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,777
You know, I wa... I was saying,
are you guys ready?

221
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,854
I would say one, two, three,

222
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,888
- yeah, we're ready.
- No problem.

223
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,414
- Okay.
- Okay. Great.

224
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,849
Just go get something
out of my suitcase.

225
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,018
Okay.

226
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:31,919
Why aren't we over there?

227
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,188
- Where?
- There.

228
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,500
I mean, look at them.
They've got it figured out,

229
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,859
those women. You know,
just eating toast

230
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,160
and laughing.

231
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,363
I wanna be like them.

232
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:47,001
Just sitting around
and falling asleep

233
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,979
till someone comes
and shakes me awake and tells me

234
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,514
it's time to go to sleep
somewhere else.

235
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,139
We need to know.
We need to know.

236
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:55,309
But we are gonna do
what you want.

237
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,544
Whatever you want.

238
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,947
I am, uh, really excited
for this weekend!

239
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,361
Carla, you're up.
Party of four?

240
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:06,096
Oh, Carla. That's me.
I mean, no. It's not me.

241
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,960
- It's us. I mean her.
- She's getting married!

242
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,522
What's up? I'm getting married.

243
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,404
What? No. Okay, the physical
therapist is not overrated.

244
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,139
When you have sex
with your physical therapist...

245
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,265
Okay, so he's not my
all the time, he was my sub.

246
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,876
Okay. He was just,
like, your substitute...

247
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,468
Babe, I told you,
wear the green ones.

248
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,437
These are not for the desert.

249
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:01,375
You guys, is anyone else,
you know, feeling like...

250
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:06,046
- ...anxious from this heat?
- No. I actually love it.

251
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,915
- Oh, shit.
- I feel like it's life-giving.

252
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,092
- You guys.
- Life... What?

253
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,393
Bad Bunny is playing
a private show

254
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,486
in a walk-in refrigerator
behind Ralph's.

255
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,021
Starts in an hour.

256
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:18,192
Wait. Can... we... ra-lly?

257
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:22,429
Yes, we ca-a-a-n!

258
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,365
- Meh.
- Bah!

259
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,600
- What was that?
- What?

260
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:26,900
What was that

261
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,546
sound that you made with,
like, your face and your mouth?

262
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,237
Oh, no. I mean, I'm kidding.

263
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,206
- Okay.
- Obviously. I just... no!

264
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:36,243
I thought it would be super fun,
uh, if we all, um...

265
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,347
take a break.

266
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,216
And lie down.

267
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:47,020
And, uh, did a... did a...
a past life regression!

268
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,389
- What?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,525
It could be, like,
a bachelorette activity.

270
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,393
Mm-hmm.
I've done one of these before.

271
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,204
Honestly, truly life-changing.

272
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,530
Saw a lot, but...

273
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,632
Bad Bunny in a refrigerator.

274
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,536
No, it's just, it's crazy.
You know, I was...

275
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:04,004
I was just thinking of
pitching a piece

276
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,239
on past-life regressions,

277
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,675
and... and there's a sign
for one right there,

278
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:12,179
and... and it kind of feels
like, well, a sign.

279
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,379
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

280
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,617
You should go do it.

281
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:20,020
I know this isn't your thing.
It's all good. I love you.

282
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,424
- Thank you.
- Mm, mm, mm, mm.

283
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,159
We'll just meet
back up at the house.

284
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,360
- Okay.
- Okay?

285
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,638
Have fun.

286
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:30,063
Regress and be blessed.
Regress and be blessed.

287
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,233
Regress.

288
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,072
Why can't I enjoy a stupid show

289
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,175
in a refrigerator
like everyone else?

290
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,278
I mean, I would lie down
in a refrigerator.

291
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,014
Hello?

292
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:57,191
Uh, okay. Did I just step
through the looking glass?

293
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,459
What is this?

294
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,395
Uh, hello?

295
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,331
Is anyone here?

296
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,399
Hello?

297
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,406
Welcome. Mm.

298
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:18,713
Hi. I'm, uh... oh,
I'm here to, um, regress.

299
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:21,716
Oh, lovely.
Do you have an appointment?

300
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,251
- I don't, no, but...
- Oh, no! Uh. Wait, wait, wait.

301
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,296
Please, please don't touch,
it... this is very expensive

302
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,689
equipment from Europe,
thank you.

303
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,456
Right, but the sign said

304
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,325
- lie flat.
- Yeah, you will, you will.

305
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,595
Just let me check the schedule,
okay? We're very busy.

306
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,597
Om!

307
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,233
Om... oh!

308
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,637
Today is your lucky day,
Moonchild.

309
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:45,439
Mercury must be in Gatorade.
I'm normally swamped,

310
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,642
but something
just popped open for you, so...

311
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,210
- So, I can just lie flat?
- Yeah. Yes.

312
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:51,522
- Okay. Here.
- Oh, ah, but I request

313
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,346
that you pay before
undergoing the regression.

314
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,449
Uh, after visiting
your other lives,

315
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,685
you may feel disoriented.

316
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,588
I take PayPal, cash,
Visa, MasterCard.

317
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,298
Thank you. Let's get you in.

318
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,767
No, I really just need
to lie down, so...

319
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,425
Oh, please, please.
Lay down, Moonchild.

320
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,194
Yes, there you go.

321
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,230
- Oh, yes. Oh, gosh!
- Ah, yes.

322
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,024
- Slide in there. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

323
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,635
All right, Moonchild.

324
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:16,236
Okay, Moonman.

325
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:21,241
Take a deep breath,
relax, and breathe.

326
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,112
Okay, once you are relaxed,

327
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,414
I want you to think
about who you are,

328
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,484
who you were,
and who you want to be.

329
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,154
Today's intention is to connect
with the person you once were.

330
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,558
Life can take you
on a winding path

331
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,292
that often moves
in both directions.

332
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:42,329
It's important to remember
that time is merely a construct.

333
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:45,633
Who you are, who you were,
who you want to be.

334
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,669
It's all within
you at this very moment.

335
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,169
You know what? I... I...

336
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,807
I, uh...
I don't need the whole spiel.

337
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,275
If you could just let me
lay here, that would be great.

338
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,411
Okay, uh, uh,
who do you want to be?

339
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,814
- What?
- Who do you want to be?

340
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,250
Who do I want to be?

341
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,553
I want to be
a person who doesn't, you know,

342
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,656
feel like they have to do
every little thing right.

343
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,291
You know, I want to be able
to lay down whenever I want to,

344
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,596
not have to wear
these tall, tall boots

345
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:16,731
and walk around
like I'm a giraffe.

346
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:19,601
And I don't want to have
to put a filter on every photo

347
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:22,570
to be deemed attractive
by everyone I meet.

348
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:23,847
And I... I...
I don't want to have

349
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,405
to pretend I like kombucha.

350
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,307
I don't. It's disgusting!

351
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,744
And I want to be able
to sit anywhere I want to,

352
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,345
lay anywhere I want to,

353
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,738
and I just want
to stay home, like,

354
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,247
and not be judged

355
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,759
for being a hermit.

356
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,186
I just want to be my Grammie.
I want to be Grammie Martin.

357
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,488
I want to be free
to say whatever I want.

358
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,190
I... I wanna be the women

359
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,560
at the Pancake House
eating pancakes!

360
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:46,593
Who are you?

361
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,295
I don't know! I don't know.

362
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,640
I just...

363
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:52,466
Who are you deep inside
your core? Who are you?

364
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:56,403
I'm... I'm a 70-year-old woman,

365
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,239
trapped in the body of
a 30-year-old

366
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,877
who really just needs
a minute to rest!

367
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:09,717
Hello? Hello?

368
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,321
Okay.

369
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,356
Oh. Oh.

370
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,562
Ooh.

371
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:24,665
Ah.

372
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,570
Oh, dear. Ow! Oh.

373
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh. Mm-hmm.

374
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:39,455
What's that guy's name again?

375
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,416
Luca? Oh, my God!

376
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,485
Oh! Oh, my God! No, no. Wait.

377
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,823
What is this?
This is...

378
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,459
Oh, my God, no.

379
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:55,429
Oh. Oh, my God. No.

380
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,766
No, no.
Where is that guy? Luca!

381
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,400
Get in here, fix this!

382
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:03,470
Luca! Luca!

383
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,873
Luca! Will somebody help me?

384
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,776
This is not me!
I'm not... Where am I?

385
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:14,716
Luca!
I'm not me. I'm not me.

386
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,921
I'm old. I'm really not okay.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

387
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:29,831
Oh, dear.

388
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:41,542
Oh, these stupid boots.

389
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,778
Oh, ow.

390
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:54,622
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Please.

391
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:59,292
Ah! Oh! No! Come on.

392
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,497
Oh, no.

393
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,567
Oh, my God.

394
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:13,807
What?

395
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,487
You can't be here.
I'm very sorry.

396
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:28,962
If you're on meth,
we don't have any.

397
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,625
What? No, no.

398
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,994
I'm not on meth, Carla. It's me.

399
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,072
- Ma'am, I'm serious.
- 'Okay, please.

400
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:36,396
Listen. Listen.

401
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,566
One more move and you get
an eyeful of pepper.

402
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:42,369
- It stings. Trust me.
- That is empty.

403
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,402
No, it's not.

404
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,006
Oh, I know that's empty,

405
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,407
because you've had it
since college.

406
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:48,943
How you know that?

407
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:52,547
Because we bought
those pepper sprays together

408
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:54,916
and we tested them out
on each other,

409
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,851
just to make sure
that they worked. And...

410
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,119
No, no, but I'm serious!

411
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:01,055
You're a ghost.
Please, ghost. Go away, ghost!

412
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,925
- Carla!
- Go away. Go away, ghost.

413
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,960
- Carla!
- Go away, ghost.

414
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,763
Carla, I'm not a ghost.

415
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:11,666
It's me! Mack!

416
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,568
- What?
- I don't know what to do.

417
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,003
Something really crazy happened
to me in that regression pod,

418
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,638
and I don't even look
like me anymore.

419
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,473
But I'm me, okay? The...
Well, look, look. See? See.

420
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,643
That's Mack's jewelry.
What did you do with her?

421
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,478
What do you mean?
You gave me this bracelet.

422
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,982
Because you said
all my other jewelry

423
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,152
looked like I bought
it at a Judge Judy estate sale.

424
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,486
Which I said is
a good thing because...

425
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,123
Judge Judy rich as hell.

426
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,159
What the hell?!

427
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,460
I don't know
what happened to me.

428
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,697
You're my best friend.

429
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:45,766
- I love you so much.
- Okay, okay, okay.

430
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,834
I love you, too.

431
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,111
- Carla?
- Carla?

432
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,546
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

433
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,930
Then I heard "ghost,"
and then I...

434
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,774
Oh, my God!

435
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:57,678
Are you okay?
'Cause we heard screams.

436
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:58,989
- I heard you literally scream.
- Yeah,

437
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,514
just one of Betty's friends.

438
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,786
Hey.

439
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:09,056
I'll meet you guys there.
I wanna change. I feel like...

440
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,567
- Sure, yeah.
- Definitely change, for sure.

441
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:12,526
- Yeah. You guys look hot.
- Thank you so much.

442
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,670
- Thanks. You can too.
- You can, too.

443
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,705
I'm trying try to get laid.

444
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,063
- Okay. Thank you.
- Ooh, yeah!

445
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,966
- Nice meeting the... you.
- Okay, just get us enough seats.

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,677
Okay, I want to make sure
they're not waiting.

447
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,469
Okay. I need a drink.

448
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:25,039
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

449
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:29,877
This like... it's like I'm me,
but I'm not me.

450
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:32,813
I mean, I'm me way up here.
But these things here,

451
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,815
like, I had them.
They're not mine.

452
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,853
Mine were like normal size.
Ah, this is horrible.

453
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:41,088
Okay, so what were
you thinking about

454
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:43,824
when he was asking you
who you wanted to be?

455
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:46,594
Well, I was thinking
about Grammie Martin,

456
00:23:46,794 --> 00:23:50,463
and about how sick
of all the bullshit I am. And...

457
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,633
Okay, so you were thinking
about old lady stuff

458
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,544
- and then you turned into one.
- Uh-huh.

459
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,537
So, he should be able
to turn you back into you.

460
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,140
Oh, God, this is really
a nightmare.

461
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:03,077
My hair is different.
It's, like, really weird.

462
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,145
Look at this.

463
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,847
It feels like it's well-coated
wire or something.

464
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,516
It's not hair.

465
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,785
Mack, we're going to fix this.

466
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,053
I'm just really tired

467
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,788
and overwhelmed,
and I need to rest.

468
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,623
I just don't know how
to explain this to you.

469
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:19,226
But you know what I can feel?
I can, like, feel the bones.

470
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,594
We're gonna figure this out.

471
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,196
Yeah. And if we don't, you know,

472
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,497
I'll just lose my friends
and my sponsors,

473
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:25,909
- and I'll just run outta money.
- No.

474
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,868
And I'll be one of those
old people, you know,

475
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:30,204
that dies in their apartment
and turns into flesh soup

476
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,206
because nobody finds
them for weeks.

477
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,675
Okay, I'm not gonna
let you turn into flesh soup.

478
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,844
- Really?
- Really.

479
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:39,647
I'm gonna call my mom,

480
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,750
and ask her if we can use
Betty's house another few days.

481
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,186
But wait a minute. Whoa!
What about your shower?

482
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:47,288
I'll cancel it.
This is a little more important.

483
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,124
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
No, you're not going to cancel

484
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,126
anything at all.

485
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,128
I got an idea.
Here's what we're gonna do.

486
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,564
You're gonna drive
the girls back to LA,

487
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,141
and you just tell them that,
I don't know,

488
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,800
some sort of
a work thing came up.

489
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,802
Anyway, I will go back
into town,

490
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,637
and I will see
if I can find him,

491
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:06,540
and I'll be back in LA
in time for your shower.

492
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,242
You don't want me
to come with you?

493
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:10,878
No.

494
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,015
I just think I need
to be alone right now.

495
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:18,119
This is... Whoo...
A lot to process.

496
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:20,554
And you're sure
there's nothing I can do?

497
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,791
Could you drive me somewhere
to rent a car?

498
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,627
- I have a better idea.
- Hmm?

499
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,030
Get some rest tonight.
I got you.

500
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:33,200
All right.
You look amazing.

501
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:36,837
I do not. Oh, dear.

502
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,041
Okay, I'll see you
at the shower.

503
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:43,210
- Yeah, wish me luck.
- You got this.

504
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,845
Okay.

505
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,189
- Love you.
- Love you.

506
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:52,987
No! Where did he go?

507
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:02,096
Where did he go?

508
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,121
Maybe this is just...
I don't know, what is this,

509
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:19,914
some sort of a dream?
Just a real, like,

510
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,382
terrible dream.

511
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,384
Yeah, well,
but still, nevertheless.

512
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,753
Let's just wake up, okay?

513
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:30,691
Damn it!
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

514
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,157
- Whoa.
- Here you go, buddy.

515
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,584
Oh.

516
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,927
Uh, can I help you?

517
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:11,098
Well, hello.
There you go. I'm...

518
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,268
I'm really not, um...

519
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,036
Uh, you know,
I'm not Mack's mom.

520
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:18,772
I'm Mack's, a... actually
I'm Mack's aunt.

521
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:21,408
And it's her Aunt Rita.
Is that...

522
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:23,310
She didn't tell you, though,
about me because,

523
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:24,778
she... she knows I'm her aunt.

524
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:27,047
Anyway, so what
we're doing is...

525
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,083
...uh, an...
An apartment swap.

526
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:32,052
And Mack is using my house
as a writer's retreat,

527
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:35,156
in Scottsdale or...
Yeah, Scottsdale it is.

528
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:37,424
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

529
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,093
I didn't know
she was writing again.

530
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,728
I... I really liked
her first book.

531
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:42,997
- You did?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,935
She'd be really flattered
if she knew.

533
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,808
But anyway, who cares,
right? And...

534
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,106
So, uh, how long
are you here for?

535
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,374
Me? Oh.

536
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,177
It's like I'm not really...

537
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,379
I don't know.
Right now, I'm not quite sure.

538
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,314
But you know,
it'll... it'll be a while, maybe.

539
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,749
Okay, well.

540
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,083
- Uh, I'm Jack.
- Hey.

541
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,485
Welcome to the building.

542
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,921
Uh, I usually take care
of Cheese

543
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,298
when Mack's out of town.

544
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,357
Oh, sorry. He's usually
a little cuter than this.

545
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:12,159
No, he's very cute,

546
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,470
but at some...

547
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,696
I don't know why.
Doesn't seem to like me.

548
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,132
Maybe it's just because
"Rita and Cheese"

549
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,277
doesn't have the same ring
to it as "Mack and Cheese."

550
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,312
- "Mack and Cheese."
- Right? It's "Mack and Cheese."

551
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:23,404
That's pretty funny.

552
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:26,740
That is... It's so stupid.
But it is, it's funny.

553
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:29,310
Okay, I don't know.
I think it's pretty cute.

554
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:31,011
- Yes.
- Yeah.

555
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:34,748
So, uh, Mack, s... she didn't,
uh, mention me?

556
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,117
She did not mention
a dog walker. No.

557
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,753
Oh, oh, okay.
Well, I'm... I mean, I'm also,

558
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:41,298
- like, a pretty good guy. Yeah.
- And you...

559
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:45,092
- And modest, huh?
- Yeah. Well, nice to meet you.

560
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,860
Uh, again, I...
I'm just next door

561
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:47,974
if... if you need anything.

562
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:49,940
Any... any help with the dog,
or... or whatever.

563
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,398
- Oh.
- I'm Jack.

564
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,234
- You're Jack. Good boy.
- Later, Cheese.

565
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,936
Thank you, by the way.
Got it, and I won't.

566
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,172
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, God.

567
00:28:58,205 --> 00:28:59,507
Whoa.

568
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,075
Wait.

569
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:05,112
What? This isn't gonna work.
It's ridiculous.

570
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,320
Forget it.

571
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:33,040
- Oh. Yeah.
- Okay.

572
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,163
Yes.

573
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,433
Oh, God. I love that.

574
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,069
[What about this?
With this, okay.

575
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,947
Oh, dear. Oh.

576
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:19,521
Well? Mm.

577
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:26,528
All right. I'm gonna make this...
I'm gonna make this work.

578
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,401
Oh.

579
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:37,438
- You cut your hair.
- Oh, I know. I had to.

580
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,373
It... it felt so weird.

581
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,519
- Do you think?
- This is very weird,

582
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,077
but you look amazing.

583
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,613
- No. Come on.
- Okay, we're gonna do this.

584
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:47,881
- Okay.
- Yeah. Ladies.

585
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,416
Oh.

586
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,453
Um, this is Mack's Auntie Rita.

587
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,188
- Oh. Hi.
- And, um,

588
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,256
these are the ladies
from my mom's wine club.

589
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,125
- Oh.
- Carol.

590
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,169
- Nice to meet you.
- Betty.

591
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,461
- Hi.
- Hey.

592
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,429
- Hey, Betty.
- Angela.

593
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:04,207
- Fabulous. All of it.
- Oh, oh.

594
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,400
Doesn't she look so cute?
And that's my mom, Sharon.

595
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:09,069
- She does.
- Oh, nice to meet you, Rita.

596
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:10,605
Where's Mack?

597
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,474
She's doing the writing retreat
in Scottsdale.

598
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:15,109
- We talk... I told you.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

599
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,144
Oh, odd timing.

600
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:19,046
But I'm glad
she's writing again.

601
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,548
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes. Thank you.

602
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:23,183
Auntie Rita. Can I talk
to you for a second?

603
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,520
- I want to show you something.
- Of course.

604
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:27,354
I wanna just...
I wanna show her something.

605
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,691
- Yes. Show me.
- We'll be right back.

606
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:32,594
We'll be here.
Oh, I love that outfit...

607
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:36,230
It was like
he was never even there.

608
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,198
We're... We're gonna find him.
We're gonna...

609
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,067
In all truth, you should
be focusing

610
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,135
on your wedding, Carla.

611
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,604
Please, girl.

612
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,749
Like she's gonna let me do
anything I want wedding-wise.

613
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,340
And this is for me.

614
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:48,151
How are we supposed to grow old
on the French Riviera

615
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,611
if you're 50 years ahead of me?

616
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,212
Ladies, can you come over
and sit down?

617
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,314
We've already started
opening the presents.

618
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:55,683
I did it. I...

619
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,152
- I don't like to wait.
- Oh.

620
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:04,191
Sorry about this.
Betty's in a race.

621
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,669
She's so old
that every second counts.

622
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,203
Oh. What do you
have there, Betty?

623
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,495
What... what do we have there?

624
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,666
Wait till you see.

625
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:13,967
So, Rita, what would
you like to drink?

626
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,437
Wine? Would
you like red or white?

627
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,575
- Oh, red wine with ice cubes.
- Oh, great answer.

628
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:25,245
You know, I love a woman
who knows what she likes.

629
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,648
A woman

630
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,015
who knows what she likes.

631
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,984
So, how often, I'm just curious,

632
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,487
do you ladies meet
for your wine club?

633
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,622
Every day.

634
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,323
- Oh, at least.
- And, uh, nights, too.

635
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:37,525
- Oh.
- A lot.

636
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,126
Sometimes we spend the weekend.

637
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,129
Oh, here you go.

638
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,541
- Oh. Thank you.
- Oh, there you go.

639
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,265
So, if you're gonna
be in town for a while,

640
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,339
you really should join us.

641
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,069
I mean, we really need
someone to help us get through

642
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:52,607
the garishly large wine cellar
my ex-wife left me,

643
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,208
you know, before she died.

644
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:56,343
Don't call Mama Tina
your ex-wife.

645
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,613
Well, you told me not
to call her my dead wife.

646
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,448
And don't call her Mama Tina.

647
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:05,085
Make me sound like I was married
to a spaghetti sauce legacy.

648
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:10,558
Let the girl call her Mama Tina.

649
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,427
- No, she will not.
- Oh.

650
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,663
See, Rita.
This is my house, my rules.

651
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:18,031
I say what I want,
and I do what I want.

652
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:20,602
And people that don't like it,
they know where the door is.

653
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,704
I've got a door back there, too.

654
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:24,506
Please, please, God.

655
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,608
Okay. What do you
have there, Betty?

656
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,375
- Carla.
- I'm getting another one.

657
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:29,811
Carla, I'm gonna keep this one.

658
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:32,346
It belongs on your side table.

659
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,182
Okay, who is this from?

660
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,660
Wow, I love the wrapping.

661
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,670
There's nothing there.

662
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:57,505
No, there's nothing there.

663
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,073
Look and see.
You would agree with me.

664
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,713
Damn thing.

665
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,148
We gonna do this.

666
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,587
I need you
to have positive thought.

667
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,455
You're gonna visualize
your boobs are higher,

668
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,092
your hair is softer.
You don't use the word "rest."

669
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,604
Carla, you gotta
get me out of this thing.

670
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:21,863
I'm freezing!

671
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,433
Where are you?

672
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,836
Where are you?
Where are you?

673
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,839
Did it work? Did it work?

674
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,541
Okay. Let's keep it going.

675
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,351
- What do you mean, another one?
- Keep it going?

676
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,579
This is my go-to
for a total body reset.

677
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:39,146
Oh, okay. Thank...

678
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,316
No! No, no. No.

679
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,451
- Women should be remembered...
- Luca.

680
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,653
- I know, I... I...
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,631
Hi, excuse me. Do you know
anyone by the name of Luca?

682
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,655
Get outta here.

683
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:52,125
- Oh, we're never gonna find him.
- Yes, we are.

684
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:06,774
<i>The most</i>

685
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:08,175
<i>effective anti-aging treatment...</i>

686
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,190
<i>I know you're there.
I heard you make a fear noise.</i>

687
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:15,683
Coming. Coming.

688
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:17,484
<i>- Are you sick?</i>
- No.

689
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:21,421
<i>Weird. You sound weird.
Your voice is, like, drier or...</i>

690
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:24,759
Uh. Yeah, well, yeah.
It's... I'm very thirsty.

691
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,393
So, that's it, probably, yeah.

692
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:28,796
Anyway, what do you want?

693
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,531
<i>Okay, well, I'm calling
to confirm you</i>

694
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,199
<i>for the All-Bodies
Pilates thing.</i>

695
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,636
The... I don't even know.
The All-what?

696
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,269
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

697
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,840
<i>You are scheduled to cover
the Pilates event today.</i>

698
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:42,744
<i>A job, may I remind you
is a gift to you.</i>

699
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,277
<i>You're welcome.</i>

700
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,789
<i>- Just remember, post pictures.</i>
- Post pictures.

701
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:48,281
<i>If people see you at a party,
they will think you're fun.</i>

702
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,652
<i>They don't have to be of you,
just post pictures</i>

703
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:52,954
<i>of, like, the swag
or, like, people's butts.</i>

704
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,555
<i>I don't care.</i>

705
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:58,291
<i>Just make sure you hashtag
#AllBodiesCanDoPilates</i>

706
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,536
<i>- on the post.</i>
- Pilates! Got it.

707
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,928
<i>Okay? Bye.</i>

708
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:06,199
<i>As a facelift
implant with no side effects.</i>

709
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,434
<i>Before you begin...</i>

710
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:08,736
I can't believe this.

711
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:14,542
- Hi.
- Good morning.

712
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:20,715
Hmm.

713
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:28,422
Okay, oh, excuse me. I have
to take a picture of you.

714
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:31,358
With your arm over ther...
Yes! Oh, good.

715
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,862
That is so... that's perfect.

716
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:37,565
Okay. So perfect.

717
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:42,870
Thank you.
So lovely. Oh...

718
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,273
Yeah. Yeah, there it is.

719
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:47,918
Stun me, woman.

720
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,945
- Oh.
- This look is slaying.

721
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,881
Oh, I... Thank you so much.

722
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:57,552
- Slay.
- Slay. Oh.

723
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:11,431
Yeah, oh, thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you. And, uh...

724
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:12,867
Do you need any help?

725
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,535
Oh, me? Oh, no, no, no, no.

726
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,771
No, I'm... Actually,
I'm kind of a pro at this.

727
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,840
- A pro?
- A pro. That's it.

728
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,575
- Fantastic.
- So...

729
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:21,843
I love having people who know

730
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:23,236
what they're doing
at these things.

731
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,979
- So good. Slay.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

732
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,948
Slay. I love that.

733
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:28,015
Yeah.

734
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,951
Okay, ladies, let's get started.

735
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,451
Whoa! That's not...

736
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,989
I'm gonna be fine.
Okay, here I go.

737
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,392
Okay. Okay, get ready.

738
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,462
Stop! No, no. Oh, God!
Okay, give me a sec. I got it.

739
00:37:42,864 --> 00:37:43,965
Yeah, I've got it.

740
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,333
Okay, ladies, right foot
forward on the hand rests,

741
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:49,369
left knee down on the carriage,
hands in short straps.

742
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,839
Enjoy the stretch.

743
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:54,407
Yes. Very nice, ladies.

744
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:57,344
Thumbs up, bicep curls.

745
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,379
Slowly press out into a lunge.

746
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,949
Lift your chest. Inhale.

747
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,751
Open your legs, bend your knee.

748
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:09,757
- Out, then in. Out, then in.
- Whoo!

749
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,893
And lifting up.
Straighten that back leg,

750
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,326
and arabesque, and jump.

751
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,496
Whoa! I'm getting it.

752
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:18,498
- Yeah, yeah.
- Beautiful.

753
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,077
- Yeah.
- Jump. Yes.

754
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,869
One blue spring,
hands in short straps.

755
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:24,806
Sure.

756
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,473
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

757
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,042
Like a gazelle.

758
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,343
- Beautiful.
- Whoa!

759
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:31,679
Wait, my leg!

760
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:34,715
Oh! A lit... Oh, damn. Cute.

761
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,620
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

762
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:41,388
- Looks great.
- Thank you.

763
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:42,941
Superwomen.
All of us.

764
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:47,360
Ow!
How do I get...? How do I get...?

765
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:53,668
Oh, okay, that's good.
Thank you. Oh, my God.

766
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:56,671
Oh, oh. Oh, my God. Sorry.

767
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:04,812
All bodies can do Pilates,

768
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:08,516
but not all bodies should
do Pilates, okay?

769
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:12,720
And let's reset.

770
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,656
Ow. Oh, no.

771
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,692
No. No. I posted that?

772
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:20,427
No, no, no.

773
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,597
- Hey, Rita.
- Oh, hi.

774
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,397
How's it going?
How's your face...?

775
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,634
Ah, oh. Yeah, this is... This...

776
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,803
I... I tried Pilates,
so...

777
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,906
- Nice. I used to do Pilates.
- Mm-hmm. You did Pilates?

778
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,507
Yeah. Well, I was doing
this thing

779
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,943
where I was trying to encourage
my mom to stay active.

780
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:38,145
So, I told her that
I would go with her, um,

781
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,147
but then she bailed and I just

782
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,725
- ended up going all by myself...
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:42,817
...for an entire year,

784
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,027
because I bought her
an annual pass

785
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,519
and I hate wasting money.

786
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,454
That is so sweet of you,
you know,

787
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,790
to be so invested
in your mom's health. It's...

788
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:52,627
- Uh, yeah, I guess. I try.
- Yeah.

789
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,004
- What about you? Look at you.
- What about me?

790
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,563
- You're pretty active. Right?
- Me?

791
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,965
I mean, not that you
couldn't be because of your...

792
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:00,534
Not to say that you're old.

793
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,037
No, I mean, let's face it. I am.

794
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:06,507
I mean, it's not an insult.
It's just where I'm at. I'm old.

795
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,577
Yeah, that's very cool.
I... I like that outlook a lot.

796
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,045
You're crazy.

797
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,480
Uh, hey, I'm about
to head up to the roof

798
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:16,217
because they're doing one
of those mid-month mixers.

799
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,818
- Do you want to come?
- No.

800
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,097
No, those things are always
full of people

801
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:21,561
who want to connect,
and they want to

802
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:22,589
talk about Linkedln,

803
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,467
- and, you know...
- Uh, yes, that is accurate.

804
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:25,993
There's plenty of people
to clown on,

805
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,862
which is arguably,
like, half the fun of it.

806
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:29,563
But also, there's shrimp.

807
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,967
Oh, wait a minute.
Are we talking big shrimp?

808
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,735
Oh, yeah. Jumbo shrimp,

809
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,837
like the for sure
genetically engineered ones.

810
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,639
- Okay.
- Yeah?

811
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:40,675
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right. Let's go.

812
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:41,943
Okay. Let's go.

813
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,791
Well, you know,
I have never been up here.

814
00:40:56,824 --> 00:40:57,901
Never.

815
00:40:57,925 --> 00:40:59,260
Really? I come up here

816
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,162
probably every night.
Yeah, and here's

817
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,697
- what I like to do.
- Okay.

818
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,598
So, I'll look out at
all the city lights,

819
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:07,735
and I try to estimate how much
the electrical infrastructure

820
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,704
of each building cost to build.

821
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,974
Then, I guess how much
money they would save

822
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,942
if they implemented
more modern technology.

823
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,713
Wow, you're a real party animal.

824
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:22,550
Yeah, I mean,
I... I used to be, to be honest.

825
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,018
- I used to be.
- Really?

826
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,853
I used to go out a ton.

827
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:31,759
But I hated having to pretend
to like it, so I stopped.

828
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,762
And as a result,
I hang out by myself a lot.

829
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,097
- Yeah.
- Uh, but it's okay.

830
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,032
I... I like hanging out
by myself.

831
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,835
I'm just curious. How does that
go into a relationship?

832
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:43,070
- Not ever good.
- No, I mean...

833
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:45,673
But no, I feel like...

834
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,184
I feel like you understand
that, though, right?

835
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,843
Well, you know, obviously,

836
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:51,579
I'm a woman of a certain age.
Have you noticed?

837
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,650
You know, who's had a full
spectrum of life experiences,

838
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,986
and just a few relationships.

839
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:03,190
- Right. Well, to not pretending.
- Yeah. Oh, hey, cheers.

840
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:07,028
Oh!

841
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,229
Wow. Wow. Wow.

842
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:10,097
No, no. That's not okay.

843
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:11,599
- Yeah.
- No, no.

844
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:13,768
I'm so sorry.
That's mortifying to me.

845
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,245
I'm gonna go get
some more shrimp.

846
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,771
- More shrimp.
- Shrimp.

847
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,181
More shrimp will
solve that problem.

848
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,608
You bet. Jumbo shrimp
solves everything.

849
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,877
- Okay.
- Oh, well. Uh. More shrimp.

850
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,211
- Yeah, yeah.
- More shrimp.

851
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,655
Can I say thanks
for the invite, Sharon?

852
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:35,990
This is so nice.

853
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:37,591
- Oh, please.
- Oh, this is...

854
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:40,161
No need to coop yourself up
in Mack's little apartment

855
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:42,129
all day, when you have us.

856
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,231
And, honey, we can always
use some fresh blood

857
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,505
- in this group.
- That's right.

858
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,836
So, Rita. You got a man?

859
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:49,970
- Oh.
- Huh?

860
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,739
You'll have to excuse Betty.

861
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,007
She lost her filter.

862
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,742
- Oh.
- I didn't lose anything.

863
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:56,343
- Oh, yeah?
- I just prefer

864
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:57,977
- to skip the small talk.
- That's right.

865
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,848
So, you know,
Mack has this neighbor.

866
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,116
- Oh.
- Now we're talking.

867
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:03,918
Oh! What does he do?

868
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:06,387
Well, I don't... I don't know.
I... I don't know much.

869
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,898
I guess maybe real estate
or something,

870
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:09,824
or maybe his parents
still pay for everything.

871
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:12,326
- That's a little weird.
- Well, who cares what he does?

872
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,161
It's not like
you're looking for somebody

873
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:16,106
to spend the rest of
your life with, at this point.

874
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,099
Well, you certainly aren't.

875
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,934
The rest of your life
could be the length

876
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,168
of one episode of <i>Ellen.</i>

877
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:22,837
That's so mean.

878
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,005
- Mm!
- I am mean. I am. I am.

879
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:26,974
- So, Rita?
- Huh?

880
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,843
This... this gentleman caller
of yours,

881
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,177
um, is he good-looking?

882
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,116
What do you...?
What do you mean? I mean...

883
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:36,684
Oh-ho! Oh!

884
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:38,886
Don't look at me like that.

885
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:42,156
Oh, I know that look.
We got a handsome one, girl.

886
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,091
Well, you know, he might...

887
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,993
He might be a little,
like, too handsome.

888
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,161
Oh, come on. Yeah.

889
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:49,063
When has a man
ever been too handsome?

890
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:50,698
I get it. I get it.

891
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:53,400
Sometimes I wish that
Harold were less handsome,

892
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:57,671
so I wouldn't have to keep
up the lie that I'm only 91.

893
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:59,249
Well, this guy's young.

894
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:00,774
He's young. He's young.

895
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,185
- Oh, my.
- What are you talking, 60?

896
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:03,711
Oh, my God.
I think he's younger.

897
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,746
- Cougar.
- Stop! You gotta stop.

898
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:08,682
I'm not gonna play this game.
I'm not interested in him.

899
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:09,917
- Fifty?
- Fifty?

900
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,051
Oh, come on.

901
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,888
Come on. Go, go.
Go, go, go, go for it.

902
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:17,057
The worst that can happen
is you wind up with herpes.

903
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:18,893
- Ah! Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jesus!

904
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,694
But once you move
into a retirement home,

905
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:22,129
you're gonna get 'em anyway.

906
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:24,698
You guys, you know what you are?
You're too much.

907
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,770
Okay, I have
an eye doctor appointment.

908
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,740
And, um, Rita,
would you mind giving me a ride?

909
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,276
Yes, I would like to.

910
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,144
- Okay.
- Oh, that's awful nice of you.

911
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:38,445
Okay, I got it.

912
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,080
- Okay.
- Okay.

913
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:43,083
- Yeah, come back.
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

914
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:44,961
- All right, here we go.
- Lock it up tight, girls.

915
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:46,665
- Yeah. Bye.
- All right, we will.

916
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:47,988
Phew.

917
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:49,957
You know, we're not
going to my eye doctor.

918
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,701
But wait a minute,
don't we have an appointment?

919
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:54,028
Yeah, but what they
gonna do about it?

920
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:59,033
Oh, God. You see, I love that.
I could never even do that.

921
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:01,735
Yes, you could, Rita.
You could do it now.

922
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:05,306
But first,
let's do what I want to do.

923
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,942
But I thought I shouldn't do
what people tell me to do.

924
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:10,244
I am an exception.

925
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,880
- Uh-uh.
- Because I'm always right.

926
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,181
Woo-hoo.

927
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,085
Mack lives here?

928
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,354
This is a raggedy-ass
neighborhood.

929
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:22,427
Yeah, well, this is the...
The back of the building.

930
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:25,125
Uh-huh. Well, okay.
Let's get these boxes.

931
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,003
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Is that his window?

932
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:28,362
- I thought... What?
- Yes, but...

933
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,331
All right, then we gotta
get it on, girl.

934
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:32,299
No. Wait a second.
This is a bo... don't do that.

935
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,134
Just help me move this.
By myself.

936
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,437
Sharon, I think this
is beyond the call of duty.

937
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,539
Rita, Rita...

938
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:39,240
Where am I supposed
to put it down?

939
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:40,551
- Just put it over here.
- I'm doing what you...

940
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:42,118
- What? Wait.
- Ooh, I messed up my nice bag!

941
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:43,887
- We just have to get up.
- I don't know. No.

942
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,312
No, no, no, no, no.

943
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,090
Ooh, lord. I think I done
pulled my back out.

944
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,225
No, don't pull your back out.

945
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:49,259
- Let's get this.
- Okay.

946
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:50,784
We're just gonna get up here.

947
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:52,886
Rita, you need to see what
he's doing up in there.

948
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,421
I'm gonna take a look.

949
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:57,891
No, no, no. No, I'm not looking.

950
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:02,196
- Typical. He's married.
- Sharon. What? He's married?

951
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:03,831
Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

952
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:06,000
I knew you were interested.

953
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,369
- I told you.
- What? Let me see.

954
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:12,306
- Oh, there he is. Look.
- Okay, that's it.

955
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:14,174
Don't do that. Don't.

956
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:21,815
- He's hung.
- Oh, no. Oh, no!

957
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:29,089
Hey, Google, how do you say,

958
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:33,027
"Roll over, Cheese" in Japanese?

959
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,930
<i>In Japanese,
that's, "Chiizu, koro."</i>

960
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,432
<i>What else should I translate?</i>

961
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,901
I see what you mean when you
say he's just too good-looking.

962
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:44,204
But if you ask me, I'd say
he's just good-looking enough!

963
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:45,973
Okay, that is it.

964
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,075
More than a couple
red flags there.

965
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,345
And a... a stupid skateboard?
I mean, that's immature.

966
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:52,547
What? What about it?

967
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,381
He tryin' to hold on
to his youth here,

968
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:56,216
- just like we are.
- It's my... Okay.

969
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,094
And don't tell me that
you don't like what you see.

970
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,219
What?

971
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:03,223
Because he's one of the finest
50-year-old men I ever seen.

972
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:04,892
Look at him.

973
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,428
Stop it!

974
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:19,607
No! I don't know about this,
Carla, really.

975
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,544
<i>Mushrooms are all about
being in the right head space</i>

976
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,612
<i>before going into them,
you know?</i>

977
00:47:24,646 --> 00:47:26,548
<i>So, just think, "30."</i>

978
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:28,616
But I've never done mushrooms.

979
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,218
Don't they make people nuts,
like crazy, or?

980
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:34,021
Just drink that tea.

981
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:35,623
<i>Think about changing back.</i>

982
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:37,891
<i>And just think, you're 30.</i>

983
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:41,095
I'm 30. We're flirty.

984
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:43,497
<i>Not dirty. We're 30.</i>

985
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:45,366
<i>Who's 30?</i>

986
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,434
- Thirty.
<i>- You're 30.</i>

987
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:49,370
- Thirty.
<i>- I'm 30.</i>

988
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:51,539
<i>- We're 30.</i>
- Thirty.

989
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:53,941
<i>Thirty, mm.</i>

990
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:58,379
<i>Thirty...</i>

991
00:47:58,613 --> 00:48:05,018
Oh... I think.
Oh, no, no. I think this...

992
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:07,287
Yeah. It might be working.

993
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:10,991
Oh.

994
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,360
Yeah, I think it's working.

995
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,995
Oh, yeah.

996
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:24,071
Woochi, woochi, woochi.

997
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:29,243
Woochi, oh,
your skin is so supple.

998
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:31,546
Supple, supple duppy.

999
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,696
Wow, oh, wow.

1000
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:53,233
Whoo! Is this really happening?

1001
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,209
Supple, supple duppy guppy.

1002
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:06,079
I'm 30.

1003
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:08,048
<i>Oh, that is so chic.</i>

1004
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,551
<i>Tell me more about this.</i>

1005
00:49:11,218 --> 00:49:12,687
I'm 30.

1006
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:15,790
Thirty.

1007
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,559
<i>I'm going to tell you something.</i>

1008
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:20,494
<i>Our age is
but a number, you see.</i>

1009
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:24,264
<i>It is all about what is on
the inside of a girl like you.</i>

1010
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,534
<i>What is inside you?</i>

1011
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:29,102
I'm 30 on the insides
in a new way.

1012
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:32,740
It's like I'm seeing the world,
like I'm... the world of 30s.

1013
00:49:32,774 --> 00:49:36,276
<i>I love you. Very chic.</i>

1014
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,078
<i>I would like a treat now.</i>

1015
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,647
<i>I don't tell lies for no reason.</i>

1016
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:43,283
I am 30. Inside me.

1017
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,752
Underneath.

1018
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,163
Well, that was super fun.

1019
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:59,399
But guess what?
I'm still Rita. Call me.

1020
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,178
<i>Clinically proven</i>

1021

<i>and a lifetime warranty.</i>

1022
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:07,040
<i>Time to look your best
with younger, more vibrant,</i>

1023
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,442
<i>more beautiful skin.</i>

1024
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:12,647
Yeah, no, but I submitted

1025
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,716
the article two weeks ago.

1026
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:17,552
And can you just chase down
that check for me, please?

1027
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,521
Why are you being so assertive?

1028
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:21,288
Oh, my God,
you joined Scientology.

1029
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,357
What are you... No!

1030
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:26,159
Whatever, it's fine. I joined.

1031
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,462
<i>I got kicked out
because I showed Tom Cruise</i>

1032
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,330
<i>a boob at a brunch,
and I apologized,</i>

1033
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,809
<i>so I'm kind of, like,
awaiting to hear back</i>

1034
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,333
<i>if I'm still in or not.</i>

1035
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:34,512
<i>Anyways, just please post</i>

1036
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:35,737
<i>more of My Glammy Grammie</i>

1037
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,238
to your Insta.
People are dying for her.

1038
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:40,642
Well, I mean,
I... I can try, okay?

1039
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,476
My friend Shelley says

1040
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:45,580
that Rita has the bone
structure for bangs.

1041
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:47,582
Let that sink in.

1042
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:50,484
I'm glad they're dying for her,
and she's great. I admit it.

1043
00:50:50,518 --> 00:50:52,319
But what...
What did you just say?

1044
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:55,757
Just post more of
that glamma, okay?

1045
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,793
<i>People are talking.
Buzz gets scuzz.</i>

1046
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:00,595
I made that up, scuzz is money,

1047
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:02,262
and I think
I made up glamma, too.

1048
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,565
<i>That's glamourous grandma.</i>

1049
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:09,837
Oh.

1050
00:51:13,608 --> 00:51:15,108
- How?
- Huh?

1051
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,678
- How did you do this?
- Oh.

1052
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:19,179
What even is this place?

1053
00:51:19,212 --> 00:51:20,724
They have five dresses,

1054
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:25,352
all cool, for my very
different bridesmaids.

1055
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:27,387
- Thank you.
- You know,

1056
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:28,590
I never told you this,

1057
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,391
but Grammie Martin
started taking me here

1058
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:33,427
when I was, like,
seven or something.

1059
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:35,195
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

1060
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:37,331
- Yeah, she did.
- You never told me that.

1061
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:39,399
I always thought you were
raiding Grandma's closet.

1062
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:43,805
No. No, I was just,
I... I don't know.

1063
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,673
I just... I was
kind of embarrassed

1064
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:47,618
to tell you about this place
because I thought maybe

1065
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:49,376
you'd think, "Okay, it's dorky"

1066
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:50,712
or something like that.

1067
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:53,313
Since when do you care
about seeming cool to me?

1068
00:51:53,514 --> 00:51:55,482
This place is
the opposite of dorky.

1069
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:57,652
- Look at all this stuff.
- Oh, I know.

1070
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,254
- Whoo.
- Just listen to me for a second.

1071
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,157
Just please don't tell anybody
about this place, okay,

1072
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,226
because I don't want some
lame-o coming in here

1073
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:08,362
and taking the good stuff.

1074
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,773
- My lips are sealed.
- Okay.

1075
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:10,832
Thank you, Macaroon.

1076
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,400
- Mack, I love you.
- Yeah.

1077
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,202
- My real wife.
- Yeah.

1078
00:52:15,402 --> 00:52:18,271
My wife for life. Okay.

1079
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,449
-Oh. Oh, sure,
-Let's get the blue.

1080
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:21,475
- Yeah. Okay.
- I don't know. I might be

1081
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:22,810
- a little... Mm.
- Hmm.

1082
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,679
Ooh.

1083
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:27,414
- Oh.
- Huh?

1084
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:29,182
We're not gonna
need the white suit.

1085
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:34,488
Well, we don't, but Aunt Rita.
Aunt Rita, she definitely does.

1086
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,531
Ah, I love the seashells.

1087
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:45,298
Oh, yeah?

1088
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,369
My grammie, she used to let
me take a seashell home

1089
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:52,774
every summer vacation.
Actually, you know what?

1090
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:54,742
It's not really silly.

1091
00:52:55,677 --> 00:53:00,347
I loved trying to hear the ocean
inside them when we got home.

1092
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,650
Although, you know,
quite honestly,

1093
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:05,653
I don't think I could ever
really hear it. Could you?

1094
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:08,923
No, I can't.
Can't hear the ocean.

1095
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:11,926
I can definitely smell
the ocean, but can't hear it.

1096
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,427
I don't know
why people say that.

1097
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,662
Why do people always say that?

1098
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:19,834
Hey, so what
are you thinkin' for lunch?

1099
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:25,540
Oh.

1100
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,875
Wow. Looking good, Aunt Rita.

1101
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:30,477
Thank you very much.

1102
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,580
Now, listen, I know
exactly what we're gonna do.

1103
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:40,287
Oh, man, I could
really get used to this.

1104
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,423
I mean, I'm...
Retirement, I mean, of course.

1105
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:45,325
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too, in a way.

1106
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:49,262
I didn't even know
that you worked.

1107
00:53:49,731 --> 00:53:51,699
What? What did you think that...

1108
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:53,868
That I was just sitting
around doing nothing all day?

1109
00:53:55,803 --> 00:53:57,471
- Wait, what?
- No, I mean...

1110
00:53:57,505 --> 00:53:58,873
Actually? I'll have you know

1111
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,408
that I'm a highly sought-after
private wealth manager.

1112
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:02,810
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1113
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:04,788
Wait, so you just thought
that I, like, did nothing?

1114
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:08,049
Well, I mean, you...
You never talk about it, ever.

1115
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:09,717
So, I mean,
what am I led to believe?

1116
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:11,251
Yeah, I mean, I guess, it...

1117
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,020
It... it's kind of boring.

1118
00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:15,690
You know?
And you are so not boring,

1119
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:18,960
so I didn't want to bore you
with how boring I am.

1120
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:23,236
- Are you folks ready to order?
- Oh.

1121
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:26,500
Oh, yeah. No, listen, I...
I need no time with the menu.

1122
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:30,037
Um, I just love this place
and I never even come here

1123
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:31,414
so I don't even know why.

1124
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,438
Yeah, me, too!

1125
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,942
Okay, I know what I want.

1126
00:54:34,976 --> 00:54:37,087
So, what I want is the garlic
cream fettuccine, please,

1127
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:38,613
and add bacon.

1128
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,348
Wow, I... I did not realize
that I was dealing

1129
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:42,583
with a professional here.

1130
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:45,352
Uh, I'm gonna get the OG
barbecue chicken pizza, please.

1131
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,723
Fantastic. I'll have that
right out for you guys.

1132
00:54:50,892 --> 00:54:52,026
Oh, damn it. Oh, shoot.

1133
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,628
- Wait a second.
- What?

1134
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,328
I forgot... no,
never mind. It's nothing.

1135
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:56,740
What? No.
What is it? Just ask for it.

1136
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:58,398
No, no, no, no.
It's nothing.

1137
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,870
Look, here's the truth.

1138
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:07,008
The truth is the bacon needs
to be extra crispy-crispy.

1139
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,644
Yeah, wow. I could not
agree more with you on that.

1140
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:11,121
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take
care of that right now.

1141
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:12,589
- No, you hang tight.
- Oh. Oh, no, sit...

1142
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,447
Let me see what kind
of magic I can do.

1143
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,391
Where are you?

1144
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:25,632
I'm at a lunch, Stephanie,

1145
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,929
and actually, I can't really
talk right now, okay?

1146
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:28,963
<i>Listen, I just wanted</i>

1147
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:31,675
to say that we're getting some
interesting offers for Rita.

1148
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:33,433
- Really?
<i>- They're mostly, like,</i>

1149
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:36,037
sensible adult
women's wear companies...

1150
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,380
- I mean...
<i>- ...but they're offering</i>

1151
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:38,405
<i>real money.</i>

1152
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,917
She could really
make a lot of money, right?

1153
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:42,076
I mean, enough that
she could actually, like...

1154
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:45,613
Whatever! I don't need to hear
her whole life's journey, Mack.

1155
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,124
<i>Okay, just make sure
she posts more pictures.</i>

1156
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:49,584
- Okay.
<i>- And have her make</i>

1157
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:50,861
<i>her own account.
The woman is regal.</i>

1158
00:55:50,885 --> 00:55:53,486
Hah! Regal!

1159
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:57,658
Wow.

1160
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:04,632
Hi, sorry to bother you.

1161
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:06,567
It's not a bother.
Not at all. No...

1162
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,978
Sorry. I was just sitting
over there,

1163
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:10,403
and you guys seem to be
having such a good time.

1164
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:11,915
You're obviously very funny.

1165
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:14,876
Oh, I don't know about that.
I am? I don't...

1166
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:18,411
Your son must get it from you.
He seems so funny, too.

1167
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:22,482
I love funny. Is he single?
Is he? Is he single?

1168
00:56:22,717 --> 00:56:23,951
No, no, no.

1169
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,054
You see, he's actually, he's...
He's not my son.

1170
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:30,457
Oh. O... Oh!

1171
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,760
- Oh. Damn. Okay.
- Yeah.

1172
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:35,029
Damn. All right.

1173
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,372
- I see you.
- We're just...

1174
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:40,568
We're friends. We're
just friends. Just friends.

1175
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:45,139
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1176
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:46,707
Well, well, well.

1177
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:48,509
A magician at work.

1178
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,511
Per the gentleman's request.

1179
00:56:50,544 --> 00:56:52,079
Oh, not bad, right?

1180
00:56:52,113 --> 00:56:54,181
Yeah. Um...

1181
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,017
- Yeah.
- Quick problem,

1182
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,484
that... that's mine.

1183
00:56:57,518 --> 00:56:58,962
So, we should, yeah...
We'll just tradesies.

1184
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:00,964
Oh, oh. Of course. I mean,
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1185
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,056
Yeah.

1186
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:03,724
- Oh.
- Okay.

1187
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:07,028
- Whoo. Yeah.
- Here you go.

1188
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:08,162
Thanks again.

1189
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,599
Yeah.

1190
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:13,601
Bon appétit.

1191
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:15,078
- You gonna eat that bacon?
- Yeah, me?

1192
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:16,862
- Get a little bit of this...
- Yeah, dig in.

1193
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,539
Oh, my God.

1194
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:21,742
Oh, you have
to taste this, ladies.

1195
00:57:21,776 --> 00:57:22,944
I made it myself.

1196
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:27,648
- Oh, did you rush?
- No, I took my time.

1197
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:28,983
No, no, I mean...

1198
00:57:29,016 --> 00:57:30,184
I'm sorry. Your shirt.

1199
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:31,686
Oh.

1200
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,130
It's my granddaughter's.

1201
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:34,789
Oh, that's sweet.

1202
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,062
She didn't want it, and I never
say no to a free T-shirt.

1203
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:38,693
Hey, what is your
granddaughter's name?

1204
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,861
Cindy Carpenter.

1205
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:42,663
- Cindy Carpenter.
- Mm-hmm.

1206
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:44,177
- Uh-huh.
- What's she doin'?

1207
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:45,800
Boom.

1208
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:46,977
- See?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1209
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,111
- That's it. That's it.
- Is it?

1210
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,537
- Yeah, that's right.
- Right?

1211
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,290
There she is, right there.

1212
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:53,140
- Let me see.
- All right.

1213
00:57:53,174 --> 00:57:54,775
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, look.
- Oh.

1214
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:56,644
- Sweet face! Sweet.
- Yep.

1215
00:57:56,677 --> 00:57:58,279
You know, while you guys
have been

1216
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,581
fooling around with your pocket
computer photo album...

1217
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:02,016
Mm-hmm.

1218
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:04,118
We could be deciding on
who's gonna go and get

1219
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,152
the next bottle of wine.

1220
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:07,955
You know, these pocket
computer photo albums

1221
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,890
are actually my job these days.

1222
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:12,226
- What?
- I get paid to post pictures.

1223
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:14,195
No. That's...
No, that's not a job.

1224
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:16,230
I mean, I... I post pictures
of my grand babies

1225
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:19,200
- all the time on my Instagram.
- All the time.

1226
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:21,969
I'm just saying
that nobody pays me.

1227
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:26,240
Well, you know, it's...
It's kind of a thing now.

1228
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:27,842
- Oh.
- Because sometimes

1229
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:30,611
a company will give you money
just to post a picture

1230
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:32,947
of yourself enjoying
the products.

1231
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,649
Oh, oh, is... is that what, uh,
all those hearts are for?

1232
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,886
Uh, no, no.
Those are my likes. You see?

1233
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:41,722
- Oh, yeah, okay.
- Who are all these people?

1234
00:58:41,756 --> 00:58:44,091
Yeah, well,
most of them are strangers.

1235
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,660
You have strangers
following you?

1236
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:48,038
- Creepy.
- You know what?

1237
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:50,197
That's what I don't understand
about social media.

1238
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:53,067
Why do they even care
about what you're doing?

1239
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:55,269
I don't know. I guess
if you just post something

1240
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:58,739
that resonates with someone,
or let's say it's 500 people,

1241
00:58:58,773 --> 00:59:01,342
or if you're me these
last few weeks...

1242
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,644
- Shall I tell you the truth?
- Yeah.

1243
00:59:03,677 --> 00:59:05,880
- Two hundred thousand people.
- What?

1244
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:07,181
Wait, what, what, what, what?

1245
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:08,949
Yeah, two hundred
thousand people.

1246
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:10,651
- All right.
- Get out of here.

1247
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:11,685
Oh!

1248
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:14,588
It's silly to call it a job-job.

1249
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:16,090
No, no, no, no. I mean, if you...

1250
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:18,626
If you can get a job like that,
I'd say good for you, girl.

1251
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,660
- You go.
- Mm-hmm.

1252
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:21,028
You know, I got an idea.

1253
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,739
Let's all get in.
Come on. Let's take a picture.

1254
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:24,899
All of us together.
Okay, here we go.

1255
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:26,743
- Let me get some followers.
- We're gonna get some.

1256
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,278
- Raise it up.
- Oh, raise it. Raise it!

1257
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,072
Don't you think... Tilt it more?
What if I tilt it...

1258
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:33,207
Now make your sexy face.

1259
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,608
All right, there. Go.

1260
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:35,609
Yeah-uh.

1261
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:36,777
No, no. I think...

1262
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,016
Look. Oh, baby.

1263
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,790
Oh, oh!

1264
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:51,158
You got it?

1265
00:59:51,192 --> 00:59:52,312
- These are...
- Okay.

1266
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,198
Okay, you know what?
I quit. You can have it.

1267
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,800
It's yours. Here. Take it.

1268
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:02,336
- Sushi. Ah!
- Whoa!

1269
01:00:11,045 --> 01:00:12,880
Never! No, I'm not kidding!

1270
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:17,818
Don't do that. Stop.

1271
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,898
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Whoa! Ow!

1272
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,367
No, no. Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. No, no.

1273
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,302
Knix just slid into my DMs.

1274
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:37,771
They saw my post
from the Pilates party,

1275
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:41,275
and, my God, they want me
to be a brand ambassador.

1276
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:44,178
Yeah, they said,
"We've been looking for..."

1277
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:47,948
"...a fierce,
sophisticated woman

1278
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:49,850
to slay on their feed!"

1279
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:51,886
Oh, that sounds pretty dope.

1280
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:55,222
It is. It is so dope! Man!

1281
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:58,192
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, wait a minute.

1282
01:00:58,225 --> 01:01:00,127
Look what I just...
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1283
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:03,063
They're... they're offering
100,000-dollar...

1284
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,466
exclusive engagement fee.

1285
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:07,468
- Whoa, 100,000 dollars?
- Oh, my God.

1286
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:09,236
You can take half
of that into an IRA

1287
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,481
and the rest in
a simple index fund,

1288
01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:12,406
- and you will be sitting pretty.
- Whoa!

1289
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:14,141
Surprisingly robust advice

1290
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:16,343
from a man
in daytime sweatpants.

1291
01:01:16,377 --> 01:01:17,745
Okay. It's a man

1292
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:19,089
whose life strategically
allows him to wear

1293
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:20,257
- daytime sweatpants. Thank you.
- Oh.

1294
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:21,749
Now please respond to this.

1295
01:01:21,782 --> 01:01:23,393
Well, of course.
That goes without saying.

1296
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,819
- Whoo!
- This is very cool, Rita.

1297
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:28,856
So cool. Wow!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1298
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,958
I'm so happy. Yeah.

1299
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:47,141
Oh, dear. Whoo, whoo. Yeah. Wow.

1300
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:49,977
Anyway, do you still
want to order, or...?

1301
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,522
- Yeah, that's... yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1302
01:01:51,546 --> 01:01:53,914
Yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna
go grab my laptop, I'll...

1303
01:01:53,948 --> 01:01:55,983
And so we can look together.
I'll be right back.

1304
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,819
Okay, yep. That's a...
A... a smart idea.

1305
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:00,054
Smart. Yeah.

1306
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:10,231
Um...

1307
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,009
- Honestly, we can just eat...
- What?

1308
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,902
- ...in my car.
- No, no, no, no.

1309
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:16,870
No way. No,
just watch and learn.

1310
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:19,974
Oh, uh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

1311
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:24,144
But you chickens
wouldn't mind scooting over

1312
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:25,846
just a little smidge
for an old gal?

1313
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,348
Oh, it's so sweet of you.

1314
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:28,983
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1315
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,184
Thank you so much.

1316
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:31,452
Oh, my goodness.

1317
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:33,787
Ooh. Ah.

1318
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:35,956
Okay.

1319
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,494
I kissed Jack.

1320
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:44,498
Like in one
of those for-real, big time...

1321
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,166
- What?
- Oh, my God.

1322
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,535
Carla, I just went for it.

1323
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:50,137
A real, big-time...

1324
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:52,773
...romantically interested kiss.

1325
01:02:53,073 --> 01:02:56,110
Stop! Carla, I just kind of said
to myself, "You go for it,"

1326
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:58,145
because when have
I ever even done that?

1327
01:02:58,178 --> 01:03:01,081
Initiate a kiss?
It's like a first kiss?

1328
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:03,017
I just don't even
do things like that.

1329
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,419
Okay. You're not
the only one with a surprise.

1330
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,987
What do you mean?

1331
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:12,426
Your boy is gonna be
downtown this weekend,

1332
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,161
- doing a pop-up.
- Uh-huh.

1333
01:03:14,194 --> 01:03:15,896
Regress and be blessed.

1334
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:21,402
You okay?

1335
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:25,205
Well, yeah. I mean,
I'm really good.

1336
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:28,876
I mean, it obviously would be
crazy to keep living like this.

1337
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,444
Yeah, Mack.

1338
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:33,280
Everything that's happening
for you right now

1339
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,251
is because you're showing
the world who you are, right?

1340
01:03:37,284 --> 01:03:40,321
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

1341
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:42,456
Oh, yeah. It's Stephanie.

1342
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,291
I gotta get this.
I'll be right back.

1343
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:47,629
Hey, listen, I'm kind of
in the middle of something,

1344
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:48,896
so can I call you back?

1345
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:50,497
Knix needs Rita

1346
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,933
to appear at
the <i>Marie Claire</i> Power Summit.

1347
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:56,638
It's a big deal.
Santa Monica Beach by the pier.

1348
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,372
Friday. They need me
to confirm today.

1349
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:01,909
Oh, wow. I mean,
that is so cool.

1350
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:05,012
- But what is that anyway?
<i>- Oh, I don't know,</i>

1351
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:08,516
just a major event that
celebrates the power of women

1352
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,417
thrown by a publication
you would die to have

1353
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,052
your little,
stinky pieces run in?

1354
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:13,229
- Oh.
<i>- Knix</i>

1355
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:14,388
<i>is a top spons,</i>

1356
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:18,092
and they wanna roll out
Rita's ambassadorship with them.

1357
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,561
I really can't. I...

1358
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,371
I mean, that's the night
of Carla's rehearsal dinner.

1359
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:23,139
<i>Yeah,
I don't think they really care</i>

1360
01:04:23,163 --> 01:04:24,965
if you're there.

1361
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,110
I mean, you could go if you
want to get a swag bag of,

1362
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:28,536
<i>like, free yoni eggs
or something,</i>

1363
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,437
but Knix has made it
crystal clear

1364
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:32,674
that the event is mandatory
for Rita.

1365
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:35,309
So, please make sure she shows.

1366
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:50,357
- Hey.
- Hey, nice robe.

1367
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:52,259
Thanks. Wore it home
from the spa.

1368
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:54,696
Um, I just don't understand
how someone

1369
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:58,600
so handsome, thank you,
could be quite so strange.

1370
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,535
Well, I was, uh,

1371
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,002
in the fifth percentile
for weight

1372
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:03,971
- until I was, like, 17, so...
- Oh.

1373
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:06,273
My personality just developed
before my looks.

1374
01:05:06,306 --> 01:05:08,175
And so that explains everything.

1375
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,010
- Yeah. Shall I?
- Yeah.

1376
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:11,945
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.

1377
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,916
- So, how was your day?
- So...

1378
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:18,952
What, uh... what's going on?
You all right?

1379
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:21,623
- You have a rough day or what?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

1380
01:05:21,656 --> 01:05:25,259
Oh, God. I have
to make a big decision

1381
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:27,629
and I just hate
making big decisions.

1382
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:32,534
Mm. That's so weird
because I love big decisions.

1383
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:34,234
- Hit me.
- Okay. I...

1384
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:38,038
So, there's this big
Knix partner event

1385
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:41,509
on the same day
as Carla's rehearsal dinner.

1386
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:43,410
So, skip the rehearsal dinner.

1387
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:47,047
Well, Jack, I mean, that's
a really huge thing to skip.

1388
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,017
I've never gotten married
before, but if I did,

1389
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,394
I don't think that
I would care that much

1390
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:54,254
if my best friend's
aunt wasn't there.

1391
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:55,456
- I can't miss it.
- Okay,

1392
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,691
well, then skip the event.

1393
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:59,761
No, but I... but, you know,
then I'll lose my contract.

1394
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:03,230
I'll lose the 100,000 dollars.

1395
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:07,034
Uh, okay.
Do you have the contract?

1396
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:08,411
Can I... can I see
the paperwork on it?

1397
01:06:08,435 --> 01:06:09,737
- Yeah, no...
- On your phone?

1398
01:06:09,771 --> 01:06:11,181
Oh, that... You don't have
to do that.

1399
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:12,583
No, I'm... I'm very good
at this kinda thing.

1400
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,784
- Trust me.
- Oh. Yeah, no. Okay.

1401
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:15,275
- Yeah.
- Sure. Of course.

1402
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,044
Okay. It's right... it's on here.

1403
01:06:17,077 --> 01:06:19,079
- Okay.
- See, it's right there. Okay.

1404
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:25,052
- Okay. Okay, so...
- What?

1405
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:27,689
Uh, this only says that
you have to attend the event,

1406
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,389
but it doesn't say anything
about how long

1407
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:31,034
- you have to stay there for.
- Oh, really?

1408
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:33,126
So, why don't you just
go to the event,

1409
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:35,362
and then leave early,

1410
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:37,435
and you'll make it in time
for the rehearsal dinner.

1411
01:06:37,464 --> 01:06:39,333
You know what?
This is such a great idea.

1412
01:06:39,366 --> 01:06:41,636
- Of course!
- You sound surprised.

1413
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:42,804
Well, I'm not surprised.

1414
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:44,739
I mean, you're...
You're very smart.

1415
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,508
- I'm smart.
- Yes, you are.

1416
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,710
Yeah. See, finally some honesty.

1417
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:51,378
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

1418
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:54,649
- Oh, boy. I need some wine.
- Yeah.

1419
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:00,153
Oh, excuse me, but, you know,
I have to leave early.

1420
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:01,388
But it's not a problem.

1421
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:04,124
Um, hi, hello.

1422
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:06,293
Rita Martin.
That's my name. Yes.

1423
01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:08,438
Rita, over here.

1424
01:07:08,462 --> 01:07:09,662
Is that Rita Martin?

1425
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:12,275
Here, Rita.

1426
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,583
- I am dead.
- Whoo! Excuse me!

1427
01:07:28,616 --> 01:07:30,685
- Aunt Rita in the flesh. You...
- Yes.

1428
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:33,320
- Are so freaking R-E-A-L.
- Oh!

1429
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:34,565
My friends and I are huge fans.

1430
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:36,323
- Well, thank you so much.
- I'm Sam.

1431
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,191
I'm the marketing
manager for Knix.

1432
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,326
- Oh!
- Not to brag,

1433
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,795
but I am the one
that told my bosses

1434
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:42,195
they had to reach out to you.

1435
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,197
Well, thank you.
Really? I...

1436
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:46,534
Wow. It's just,
I appreciate that so much.

1437
01:07:46,568 --> 01:07:47,745
- You've got to come...
- Where?

1438
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:48,879
...to the VIP area for Urth.

1439
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:51,271
Oh, oh, well. Earth?

1440
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:53,373
Urth. She's leading the
collective breathing seminar

1441
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,642
that's closing out the day.

1442
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:56,487
Oh, no. You know, I really...
Honestly, I can't do that.

1443
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:57,821
- Thank you so much.
- You crack me up.

1444
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,765
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, oh, what do you mean?

1445
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,081
- Oh.
- You know,

1446
01:08:01,315 --> 01:08:03,483
I was one of the 10,000
to unfollow Lil' Yachty

1447
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:05,496
after he commented
that your sweater was too loose.

1448
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,120
- What was that?
- Oh.

1449
01:08:07,154 --> 01:08:10,157
Oh, I don't know. You know,
he's obsessed with me.

1450
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:13,460
- It's honestly kind of weird.
- Well, so am I.

1451
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:16,598
So, anyway, just enjoy
the event, and I'm just gonna

1452
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,600
capture some video
of you in your natural habitat.

1453
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:20,535
- Okay?
- Okay, but wait, wait.

1454
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:22,570
I want to thank you
for this offer, of course...

1455
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:24,444
- Yeah, you bet.
- ...but just one quick thing.

1456
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,340
- Hmm?
- Um, I have my best friend's

1457
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:28,610
rehearsal dinner tonight.
So, actually, I'm...

1458
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:29,763
I'm gonna have to leave now.

1459
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,846
- I totally hear you...
- So, anyway...

1460
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:33,380
...but if you could just

1461
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:34,858
stick around for
a few more minutes, okay?

1462
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,760
We're gonna be streaming
this on Instagram Live,

1463
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:39,687
and I want to make sure
that you are front and center.

1464
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:42,356
Yeah, oh. Oh, but, you see,

1465
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,626
that's the opposite
of what I said I wanted to do.

1466
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:46,594
- Mm. Yeah. Mm.
- Uh-huh.

1467
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:48,572
But it's just, we have to make
sure that our new partners

1468
01:08:48,596 --> 01:08:50,163
are familiar with our followers.

1469
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:51,742
- Uh-huh. I see...
- That's how it works.

1470
01:08:51,766 --> 01:08:54,368
I've seen some incredible
partners lose contracts...

1471
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:55,679
- Yeah, but...
- ...just because the fans

1472
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:57,337
- don't see them as friends.
- Oh.

1473
01:08:57,371 --> 01:09:00,240
So, no pressure, you know,
but make it organic, you know?

1474
01:09:00,273 --> 01:09:01,843
Have your own experience and...

1475
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:04,244
And we are looking to create
some moments here.

1476
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,380
- So, energy up! Big smiles.
- Well... Wait, what?

1477
01:09:06,413 --> 01:09:08,215
Rah-rah-rah! Yeah.

1478
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:12,887
All right, my warriors.

1479
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,758
Who's ready to find their light?

1480
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:19,861
Oh, my warriors.

1481
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:23,731
I want you to repeat after me.

1482
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:24,931
For us!

1483
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:27,267
Okay. For us!

1484
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,303
For you! For me!

1485
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:31,739
Let me hear you!

1486
01:09:31,773 --> 01:09:32,773
For us!

1487
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:34,742
For you!

1488
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:36,410
For you!

1489
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:37,979
For me!

1490
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:39,246
For me!

1491
01:09:39,781 --> 01:09:41,248
For us!

1492
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:42,884
For you!

1493
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:45,787
- Yeah.
- For me! Oh, yes.

1494
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,723
Your chanting,
it nourishes my soul.

1495
01:09:48,756 --> 01:09:51,893
- Ah!
- We are not here to work out

1496
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:56,831
our abs or our glutes
or our triceps. No.

1497
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:00,500
We are here
to work on our souls.

1498
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:03,805
Our soul!

1499
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,238
Ho-ho.

1500
01:10:05,272 --> 01:10:08,241
We did not come here
to exercise our bodies.

1501
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:09,510
No.

1502
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:15,415
We came here
to explore size our demons!

1503
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,785
- For me!
- Let me hear you!

1504
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:20,888
For us! For you!

1505
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:22,924
For me!

1506
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:25,960
Oh, yes! I feel it.

1507
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:28,730
I feel it, you are powerful. Oh!

1508
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,898
That is a warrior right there!

1509
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:32,834
- Huh?
- Yes. Come on up here.

1510
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:35,770
- Really?
- Come on. Come on, yes!

1511
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,574
Come on up here!
Yes, warrior!

1512
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:42,810
Yes! Oh! Yes!

1513
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,321
I am a warrior.

1514
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:56,924
I am a warrior!

1515
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,994
Yes! Yes!

1516
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,929
Squat and feel it, yeah!

1517
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,033
No!

1518
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,002
- You're on fire!
- On fire!

1519
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,977
Everybody, let's not panic.
Let's just grab a buddy.

1520
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:15,510
Everybody calm down!

1521
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,012
Everybody, it's gonna be good!
We're gonna be okay.

1522
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,680
Everybody just... just...

1523
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:20,824
Yeah. That...
Move in that direction.

1524
01:11:20,848 --> 01:11:23,416
Are you all right? I'm so sorry.

1525
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,952
I... I think you should...

1526
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:26,353
Help!

1527
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:28,856
Carla, Carla, it's me.
I'm almost there.

1528
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:32,927
I'm really, I'm... I'm...
Quite frankly, I'm there.

1529
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,327
Really. I mean...

1530
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:40,601
So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

1531
01:11:40,635 --> 01:11:43,004
- Love you.
- Carla?

1532
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:46,974
Carla. Oh!

1533
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:49,811
- Are you okay?
- I...

1534
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:52,747
I just, I got stuck
at that <i>Marie Claire</i> thing,

1535
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:55,016
and, you know,
it's the kind of situation

1536
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,718
where you just don't know
what you can say no

1537
01:11:57,752 --> 01:11:59,754
to and... and what you can't.

1538
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:04,826
And I set myself on fire.
I know. It's crazy.

1539
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,700
I'm not gonna lie, Mack.

1540
01:12:12,733 --> 01:12:16,904
I'm really, really bummed
you didn't make it tonight.

1541
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:20,875
You missed my rehearsal dinner
for an influencer event?

1542
01:12:22,043 --> 01:12:25,112
- You're my maid of honor.
- I... I know. I...

1543
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:27,915
You've been my best friend
my whole life.

1544
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:30,885
And I've loved
every single version of you.

1545
01:12:31,152 --> 01:12:34,989
But right now,
Mack, Rita, whatever,

1546
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:38,526
I don't recognize the person
standing in front of me.

1547
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,128
And it has nothing to do
with what you look like.

1548
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:43,865
I'm... I'm so sorry, Carla.

1549
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,637
The one thing we've always done
for one another is show up.

1550
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:54,508
You didn't do that tonight.
And it just really makes me sad.

1551
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:06,654
Oh, God.

1552
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:08,990
I don't know
what I'm doing half the time.

1553
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:30,111
Hey, thought I'd find you
up here.

1554
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,184
- Is everything okay?
- Oh.

1555
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:32,947
Yeah.

1556
01:13:33,413 --> 01:13:34,715
- Hey.
- What?

1557
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:36,217
Rita, look at me.

1558
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,818
- Please, Jack.
- Whoa, whoa.

1559
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,587
Hey, hey, hey.
No. It's okay. It's okay.

1560
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,231
Look, you don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.

1561
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:42,623
- No.
- Here, here.

1562
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:45,760
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1563
01:13:45,793 --> 01:13:48,029
I'm just so really frustrated
with who I am right now.

1564
01:13:48,696 --> 01:13:51,766
Because I haven't always been
like this, Jack, you see.

1565
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:55,803
You know, I thought, like,
being in a different place,

1566
01:13:55,836 --> 01:13:57,538
you know,
it'd help me feel better.

1567
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,774
You know, it'd help me
be a better person.

1568
01:14:00,408 --> 01:14:05,980
But today, I was worse, just...
I was a bad friend.

1569
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,616
It just sounds
like you had a really bad day,

1570
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,786
but that doesn't make
you a bad person.

1571
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:13,921
- Jack...
- No, you are one

1572
01:14:13,955 --> 01:14:15,923
of the best people
that I've ever met.

1573
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:18,059
Why? Why are you
being so nice to me?

1574
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:20,194
Why? Huh?

1575
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:26,167
- Don't do that.
- Because I like you.

1576
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:32,673
What's the matter
with you anyway? Huh?

1577
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:34,542
I mean, you want,
like, a full list?

1578
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,577
No, no, I'm really serious.

1579
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,681
You spent the past month
hanging out with an old lady

1580
01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:42,883
like she's your girlfriend
or something.

1581
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,019
What are you trying
to avoid, Jack?

1582
01:14:45,052 --> 01:14:46,620
Nothing.

1583
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:49,557
Listen, I know that my life
doesn't look like

1584
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,134
what you think a 40-year-old's
life should look like,

1585
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:52,893
but I love it.

1586
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:55,763
And I have done enough therapy
to know that I like myself.

1587
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:58,232
And when I met you, I saw
someone who was comfortable

1588
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:01,802
being exactly who they are.
And I know that...

1589
01:15:03,204 --> 01:15:04,815
You know, you're not going
to be here forever.

1590
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:06,316
You've got your own
life to go back to.

1591
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,644
Exactly. I have a life, Jack.

1592
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:13,280
And I've lost sight
of who I really am.

1593
01:15:13,314 --> 01:15:14,849
Do you understand what I mean?

1594
01:15:14,882 --> 01:15:16,684
I mean,
I can't really stay here.

1595
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:19,120
I just can't stay here, Jack.
I can't do that anymore.

1596
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,309
Wha-oh!

1597
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:45,846
You wanna tell us
what's going on...

1598
01:15:46,113 --> 01:15:47,248
Mack?

1599
01:15:50,117 --> 01:15:52,286
Well, I need a refill.
Anyone else?

1600
01:15:52,521 --> 01:15:55,890
Yeah. If what
you just said is true,

1601
01:15:55,923 --> 01:15:58,893
I cannot possibly tell
you how stupid you sound.

1602
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:02,596
- Nobody wants to be old.
- No, no. Sure they do.

1603
01:16:02,797 --> 01:16:04,165
Yes.

1604
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:06,867
My grammie used to always say
this thing about, like,

1605
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:09,737
how when you're old, you get
the best seat at the table.

1606
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,272
Oh, you get any seat
at the table,

1607
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:13,040
because people know
your bones hurt.

1608
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:16,610
You get the best seat
at the table

1609
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:21,115
because you realize
what you want and don't want.

1610
01:16:21,148 --> 01:16:23,317
And maybe the best seat
at the table

1611
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:26,887
is in the other damn room,
where you're 30.

1612
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,789
Right.

1613
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:32,126
Rita, I... I mean Mack.
You know those 30 years

1614
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,229
you skipped so that you could,
uh, maybe wear, uh,

1615
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:37,364
elastic waistbands
and, uh, whatever?

1616
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,836
Those are the good years.
Those are the you years.

1617
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:44,238
And you really don't want
to skip those.

1618
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,674
- Nuh-uh.
- The 30 after that,

1619
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:49,677
they're good, too.
But, oh, those middle years...

1620
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:50,845
Oh, man. Mwah!

1621
01:16:50,878 --> 01:16:53,647
It's not magic, sweetheart.

1622
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:55,950
- It's just work.
- Oh.

1623
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:59,086
You? You had
to work on yourself?

1624
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,321
Oh.

1625
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:03,791
I was married
to a man named Steve.

1626
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:08,896
And then I spent my middle age
building a home

1627
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:10,931
with a woman named Tina, so...

1628
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:11,999
- Tina.
- Mm-hmm.

1629
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:18,172
Yeah, I did some work.
Mack, sweetheart,

1630
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:24,912
you didn't want to be old.
What you wanted was to be you.

1631
01:17:24,945 --> 01:17:26,113
Mm-hmm.

1632
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,891
- I gotta go, okay?
- You got to go.

1633
01:17:36,924 --> 01:17:38,459
- You go, girl.
- Yeah.

1634
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:41,395
You girls lock it up
on your way out, okay?

1635
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:43,063
And get that hair
out of your face.

1636
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:44,732
I'm trying.

1637
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:46,725
- Okay, now I'll have some more.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

1638
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:07,021
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay. Wow.

1639
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,965
Okay. Okay, hell. Okay.

1640
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:22,169
Luca! Luca!

1641
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:24,438
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

1642
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:27,107
Luca! Luca!

1643
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,978
Luca! Lu... oh!

1644
01:18:31,478 --> 01:18:34,181
- Do you have an appointment?
- No. No, Luca.

1645
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:35,535
I don't have
an appointment, Luca.

1646
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:37,885
Okay, you're coming in
with a lot of energy.

1647
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:39,296
- We don't really do that here.
- Uh-huh. Really?

1648
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,480
You didn't turn me into this?

1649
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:42,856
I happen to be
a 30-year-old woman...

1650
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:46,160
- Keep it down.
- ...and this is not my face!

1651
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:47,928
- Mm.
- And this is not my hair.

1652
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:49,463
And guess what?
This is not my body!

1653
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:50,907
Okay, look, lady.
I don't know what drugs

1654
01:18:50,931 --> 01:18:52,209
- you're on right now...
- You did this to me!

1655
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:53,801
But this is
an old broken tanning bed

1656
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,970
I got off Craigslist.
It doesn't do anything, okay?

1657
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,404
But wait a second, sir.

1658
01:18:57,672 --> 01:19:01,141
In Palm Springs,
I laid down in that pod,

1659
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:04,311
and when I came out,
I was in this body.

1660
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:06,380
Okay, I'm gonna go get you
a cup of water. Maybe...

1661
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:07,881
No, no, no! Don't you dare!

1662
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,416
You get over here.
You open

1663
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,784
that tin can up right now.

1664
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,052
- All right.
- Yes!

1665
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:13,196
All right.
Stop yelling at me. Jesus.

1666
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,321
What?

1667
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:18,192
- Just get in. It's...
- Oh. Oh, my God.

1668
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,426
Go.

1669
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:22,196
Okay.

1670
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:26,166
I'm sorry I yelled at you, lady.

1671
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,402
That... that was
not very Zen of me.

1672
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:31,272
Come on. Work, okay? Work!

1673
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:33,440
It's okay. Just calm down.

1674
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:36,877
Relax. Breathe.

1675
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:40,881
You're not saying
your whole spiel.

1676
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,216
Please just say it.

1677
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:45,119
- Please.
- Think about who you are.

1678
01:19:47,187 --> 01:19:48,255
Come on.

1679
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,710
- Think about who you wanna be.
- Work, damn it! Work.

1680
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:53,327
Come on.

1681
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,429
Life can take you
on a winding path

1682
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:57,264
that often moves
in both directions.

1683
01:19:57,298 --> 01:19:58,533
Come on!

1684
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:00,501
It's important to
remember that...

1685
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:03,404
- Okay.
- ...time is merely a construct.

1686
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:05,172
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1687
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,476
Who you are...

1688
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:12,514
...who you were...

1689
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:18,352
Who you're going to be...

1690
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,824
It's all within
you at this very moment.

1691
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:58,258
Oh, yes.

1692
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:02,396
Yes! Yes! Oh,
I missed you. I missed you.

1693
01:21:02,896 --> 01:21:07,234
Oh, my God. Hah!

1694
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:08,369
Whoa!

1695
01:21:13,675 --> 01:21:16,578
Oh!

1696
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:20,414
This thing...

1697
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:22,517
Yes!

1698
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,619
Oh.

1699
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:26,920
Oh, my God.

1700
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,091
I'm back. I'm back.

1701
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:35,496
Thank you. Thank you.

1702
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,541
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- What just happened?

1703
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:38,666
I know. It's crazy!

1704
01:21:39,734 --> 01:21:41,301
I need to go. I have to go.

1705
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:42,570
Thank you!

1706
01:21:44,606 --> 01:21:47,241
You're welcome.

1707
01:22:01,488 --> 01:22:02,624
Carla!

1708
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:05,560
- Oh!
- Oh!

1709
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,397
Don't cry.

1710
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:14,168
She's happy.

1711
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:17,438
- Well...
- I'm gonna cry.

1712
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,473
Don't cry.
You're getting married.

1713
01:22:19,507 --> 01:22:21,676
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.

1714
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:24,612
- Oh, my gosh.
- I kinda miss the gray.

1715
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:27,448
I know. Me, too.

1716
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:29,551
Oh, it's so good

1717
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,186
to see you, sweetheart.

1718
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:40,662
Hi!

1719
01:22:41,028 --> 01:22:44,131
I thought you were dead!

1720
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,365
Go change.

1721
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:46,577
Yes.
'Cause you are wearing white

1722
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:48,044
and jeans at a wedding,
and that's crazy.

1723
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,369
Close your mouth, honey.

1724
01:22:51,405 --> 01:22:53,040
We did it.

1725
01:23:03,785 --> 01:23:06,987
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

1726
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:18,566
Oh! Uh, hey.

1727
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,735
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh...

1728
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:27,040
Whoo, sorry. Hey, you.

1729
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:28,743
I'm sorry. It is...
It's weird

1730
01:23:28,776 --> 01:23:30,244
that I'm here right now.

1731
01:23:30,277 --> 01:23:31,613
I... I realize that.

1732
01:23:31,646 --> 01:23:35,215
I just... I didn't know if Rita...
She's... she's gone.

1733
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:38,118
Oh, yeah. We swapped back.

1734
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:41,054
Apartments, which is what
we swapped in the first place.

1735
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:44,324
So, yeah, she's in,
uh, Scottsdale.

1736
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:46,995
Seriously? I never
even got to say goodbye.

1737
01:23:47,562 --> 01:23:50,598
We, um... Yeah, we just kind
of were hanging out

1738
01:23:50,632 --> 01:23:51,712
while she was staying here.

1739
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:55,637
Oh? Hanging out?

1740
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,405
Well, we just both
had nothing to do,

1741
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:01,141
so we did nothing together.

1742
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:07,114
She's, um, really not like
anyone I've ever met before.

1743
01:24:10,952 --> 01:24:14,822
Well...
...for what it's worth,

1744
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:19,561
she told me that
you were really cool, too.

1745
01:24:19,994 --> 01:24:22,597
Maybe a little
too old for a skateboard.

1746
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,264
She said that? I...

1747
01:24:24,298 --> 01:24:26,109
I mean, the... the first thing,
about being cool?

1748
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:28,135
Because I knew how she felt
about my skateboard.

1749
01:24:28,502 --> 01:24:30,805
Yeah. She did.

1750
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:33,306
Cool.

1751
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:35,810
You think she's ever
coming back?

1752
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:39,313
Someday, maybe.

1753
01:24:39,614 --> 01:24:41,783
But not for a really,
really long time.

1754
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:44,852
Okay.

1755
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:49,356
Uh, if you do talk to her,
please just tell her I said hi.

1756
01:24:49,389 --> 01:24:50,457
I will.

1757
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:58,766
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I, um... ugh!

1758
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,269
I had too many shrimp.
But they were the big ones.

1759
01:25:02,302 --> 01:25:05,138
The jumbo, like, for sure
genetically engineered ones?

1760
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:06,249
For sure genetically
engineered ones.

1761
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:07,273
Yeah.

1762
01:25:13,815 --> 01:25:14,882
Okay.

1763
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:51,184
Congrats on your new book.

1764
01:25:51,218 --> 01:25:53,387
You know, I've been seeing
a lot of people

1765
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,790
posting pictures of it
on their legs on the beach

1766
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:58,760
- and they call that hotdogging.
- Oh, very cool.

1767
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,461
I gotta be honest,
I kind of miss Rita.

1768
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:04,666
Her French exit from the feed
was one of the sexiest things

1769
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:07,535
I've ever seen,
and I've seen porn.

1770
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:08,736
Mm-hmm.

1771
01:26:09,137 --> 01:26:12,305
Also, thank you for recommending
the Instagrammies to me.

1772
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:16,678
The drunkest one, she has
over 500,000 followers

1773
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:18,245
and it just makes me be like,

1774
01:26:18,278 --> 01:26:19,781
"What have you
ever done for me?"

1775
01:26:19,814 --> 01:26:22,215
Oh, yeah. They're...
They're awesome.

1776
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:26,319
Oh, wait. S... s...
Co... yeah, copy that.

1777
01:26:26,554 --> 01:26:27,622
Okay.

1778
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:31,826
Hi!

1779
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:38,833
Thank you so much for coming.

1780
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:42,770
Hi, bebe. I'm so proud of you.

1781
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:49,342
Ooh!

1782
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,831
- All right, you ready? Ready?
- Yes. Yes, sorry.

1783
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:53,322
All right, everyone,
let's get jazzed

1784
01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:56,283
for this reading.

1785
01:26:56,316 --> 01:26:58,351
- Yeah.
- You go, girl.

1786
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:01,354
Um, so that's me,
right? Uh...

1787
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:04,826
Hi. Uh, thank you
all for coming.

1788
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:06,027
Uh-uh.

1789
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,597
I... I really... I wanted
to share this book

1790
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:13,300
with the people in my life
who mean the most to me.

1791
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:17,337
My first book was a series
of essays about my grandma.

1792
01:27:18,706 --> 01:27:20,440
And until very recently,

1793
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:24,579
she was
the only person in my life

1794
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:29,449
who made me feel like
I had license to be myself.

1795
01:27:29,483 --> 01:27:30,885
And when she died,

1796
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,790
I... I thought
that I had lost that.

1797
01:27:36,423 --> 01:27:37,457
I, uh...

1798
01:27:38,526 --> 01:27:43,998
I had a really hard time
feeling like I was enough.

1799
01:27:44,632 --> 01:27:48,736
And, uh, I... I worried
so much about, you know,

1800
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:52,507
all the things that made me, me.

1801
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:57,645
That they were
too weird, too different,

1802
01:27:57,678 --> 01:28:00,681
and not fun, not cool.

1803
01:28:00,882 --> 01:28:04,552
And it took a, uh...

1804
01:28:06,386 --> 01:28:09,557
a near-death experience

1805
01:28:11,025 --> 01:28:13,961
to realize that that's not true.

1806
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:20,333
I realized that the people
in my life who I love...

1807
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:23,738
Love those things about me, too.

1808
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:27,440
And believing that gave me
the confidence

1809
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:31,846
to show myself,
you know, to new people.

1810
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:37,785
And to finally write
another book, so...

1811
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,689
Without further ado...

1812
01:28:44,025 --> 01:28:45,358
Okay.

1813
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:50,531
Here we go.
All right, let's see.

1814
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:01,776
<i>"I grew up always feeling
like I was an older woman</i>

1815
01:29:01,809 --> 01:29:05,112
<i>trapped in the body
of a little girl."</i>

1816
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:08,950
<i>"I think that's why I was
so fond of the term 'old gal.'"</i>

1817
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:11,786
<i>"I was raised by my grandma."</i>

1818
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:15,623
<i>"And she was the coolest
'old gal' I ever knew."</i>

1819
01:29:15,656 --> 01:29:19,126
<i>"All I wanted was
to be like Grammie Martin."</i>

1820
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,897
<i>"But like any kid,
I had to fit in."</i>
