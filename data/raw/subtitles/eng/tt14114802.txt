537
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,604
Some new gizmo
the Feds came up with.

538
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:05,742
Records sound, like a Victrola.

539
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:09,412
But you can hide it, 'cause
it's only the size of a...

540

Oh, you get it.

541
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:16,352
The Hoover boys planted
their bug in one of our spots.

542
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:17,653
But what they don't know

543
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,822
is that we have friends
in high places.

544
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:24,427
Friends who could do things like
smuggle us a copy of the tape.

545
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,329
But before I could listen to it,

546
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:27,898
La Fontaine's crew
rolls up on us.

547
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,633
See, we're making moves on them,
and if they get the tape,

548
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,069
then they'll know
how to hit back.

549
00:31:32,102 --> 00:31:33,503
Everybody wants this thing.

550
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:36,405
So throw it away.

551
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,608
Somebody's been ratting us out
to La Fontaine.

552
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:40,810
Now, somebody...

553
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:44,347
helped the Feds get a bug on us.

554
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,782
If we can listen to this thing,

555
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,451
then we'll know
where it was planted. Boom.

556
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:51,889
If I can find a machine
to play this tape tonight,

will be here in three hours.

touches this.

he taught me how to tie a tie

in life, kid."

1064
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:21,137
They're all I brought with me
when I came to Chicago.

1065
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:24,441
- Please.
- No, no, no, no.

1066
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:27,010
Oh, no, please. Please.

1067
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,481
(sighs)

1068
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:42,058
You never told me
why you left England.

1069
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:43,760
It was under attack.

1070
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,428
Ah, Nazis?

1071
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:47,063
Worse.

1072
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:48,765
They're called blue jeans.

1073
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,301
(laughing)

1074
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:56,239
I know what it's like

1075
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:58,475
to try to make something
of yourself.

1076
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,276
Yes.

1077
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,345
Just you and your trusted tools.

1078
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,415
For example...

1079
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:10,620
(Roy sighs)

1080
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:13,389
I use this thing here to kill.

1081
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:16,626
I don't even know
how many people.

1082
01:00:16,659 --> 01:00:19,162
All right.

1083
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:22,365
You got your tools, I got mine.
Here.

1084
01:00:22,398 --> 01:00:24,200
Take a look.

1085
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:29,506
I read something once

1086
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,375
about how the thing
that separates

1087
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,377
man from monkeys is tools.

1088
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,179
Do you believe all that?

1089
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,014
Evolution?

1090
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:40,517
I don't know.

1091
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:44,120
But I do know that a man
has a choice in this world

1092
01:00:44,153 --> 01:00:46,089
about how he uses his tools.

1093
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:49,259
He can destroy or he can build.

1094
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:50,527
And you think I destroy.

1095
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,830
But, no, with this,
I've built loyalty.

1096
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:57,333
I have built a crew.
I've built a neighborhood.

1097
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,604
And the men I've had to kill...

1098
01:01:03,439 --> 01:01:06,276
...well, you have to toss away
a few scraps, don't you,

1099
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:08,778
when you're cutting
a pair of pants?

1100
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:16,052
Have you ever heard of
the Outfit?

1101
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:20,156
Well, I make clothes, so...

1102
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:21,691
Oh, n-not that kind of outfit.

1103
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,626
It's an organization.

1104
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,262
What, like the Rotary Club?

1105
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:29,365
Maybe you've heard of Al Capone?

1106
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:30,600
Him I've heard of.

1107
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,302
Yeah. He started it.

1108
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:35,305
- The Rotary Club?
- The Outfit.

1109
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,674
Al Capone's dead, isn't he?

1110
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:39,609
After he died,

1111
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:43,613
his organization spread out,
became more of a network.

1112
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:50,320
Every big-time crew from
Santa Monica to Coney Island,

1113
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:53,389
Italians in the East,
Jews in the West,

1114
01:01:53,423 --> 01:01:56,459
Poles in St. Louis...

1115
01:01:56,492 --> 01:02:00,530
even a few sons of Killarney
here and there.

1116
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:03,132
The underworld United Nations.

1117
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,669
Anybody messes with anybody,
the Outfit has your back.

1118
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,471
It's like a stamp.

1119
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:11,207
- "You have arrived."
- And have you arrived?

1120
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,475
Almost.

1121
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:14,477
They've been
sending us messages,

1122
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,347
saying they like our style.

1123
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,616
They're considering us,

1124
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,551
if we can finish
what we started.

1125
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:23,686
And what have you started?

1126
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,356
Putting every one of
the La Fontaines in the dirt.

1127
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,225
See, the La Fontaines
aren't builders.

1128
01:02:29,258 --> 01:02:30,928
That family has been running

1129
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:33,129
the same numbers racket
for decades.

1130
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:36,232
Their neighborhood, their rules.

1131
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:39,469
Nobody ever had the balls
to move in on their operation.

1132
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:40,637
Until me.

1133
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,674
This tape
everyone's looking for,

1134
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:49,579
Francis said that
some powerful friends

1135
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,614
got you a copy.

1136
01:02:51,648 --> 01:02:53,549
The Outfit, they those friends?

1137
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,418
Yeah, so you understand.

1138
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:59,656
That tape gets into
the wrong hands,

1139
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:02,659
then the entire thing
comes crashing down.

1140
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:05,395
Mr. Boyle, why are you
telling me all this?

1141
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,230
Because that's Richie's coat.

1142
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,298
♪ ♪

1143
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,302
Is it?

1144
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,371
- It is.
- Oh.

1145
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,978
Well, I suppose he must have
left without it.

1146
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:22,545
In December?

1147
01:03:22,578 --> 01:03:24,380
He was in a bit of a hurry.

1148
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:27,650
December in Chicago,
and he went out without a coat?

1149
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:31,421
You're hiding something,
my friend.

1150
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:35,558
And I'm trying
to help you understand

1151
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:39,262
that even if I never find out
what it is, the Outfit will.

1152
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:41,497
So you want
to get clear of this,

1153
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:44,667
you need to tell me what really
happened in here tonight.

1154
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,371
Now.

1155
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:51,641
Mr. Boyle,
I'm telling you the truth.

1156
01:03:57,647 --> 01:03:59,215
Monk!

1157
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:03,352
Who walks out into the cold,

1158
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:06,756
in December, in Chicago,
without his coat?

1159
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:08,491
I ain't good at riddles.

1160
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:12,361
English, where's my goddamn son?

1161
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:16,332
You got five seconds...

1162
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:17,667
to tell me what happened.

1163
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,336
Five, four...

1164
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:21,637
(racks loudly)

1165
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:23,806
- ...three...
- He made me promise not to tell.

1166
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,808
Who? Who made you promise?

1167
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:29,512
He said he'd kill me
if I told you.

1168
01:04:29,545 --> 01:04:30,646
Who?

1169
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,648
Francis.

1170
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:38,621
Mr. Boyle,
what really happened to Richie

1171
01:04:38,654 --> 01:04:40,456
is that Francis shot...

1172
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,625
(door opens, bell jingles)

1173
01:04:42,658 --> 01:04:44,360
(door closes)

1174
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:45,561
Whoa.

1175
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:52,668
Full house tonight, huh?

1176
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,270
Mable.

1177
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:58,274
We got some questions
about Richie?

1178
01:04:58,909 --> 01:05:01,078
Realized I know somebody
who might have some answers.

1179
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:02,678
ROY: Francis, English was
just about to tell me

1180
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:04,680
what really happened to Richie.

1181
01:05:05,715 --> 01:05:08,085
English said you shot somebody.

1182
01:05:08,118 --> 01:05:09,852
Oh, yeah?

1183
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:13,523
ROY:
Hey, don't look at her,

1184
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:15,792
don't look at him,
you look at me.

1185
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,527
If you tell me the truth,

1186
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,363
there isn't a gun in this town
can hurt you.

1187
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:23,633
You are protected from him,
you're protected from him.

1188
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,701
You will be warmed
from the elements.

1189
01:05:26,702 --> 01:05:28,638
But you gotta tell me the truth.

1190
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,574
What did Francis do?

1191
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,777
Francis shot...

1192
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:35,845
(gun cocks)

1193
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:41,684
Francis shot...

1194
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:46,689
...four of La Fontaine's men

1195
01:05:46,722 --> 01:05:48,858
earlier this evening.

1196
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:54,463
But Richie,
he didn't shoot a single one.

1197
01:05:55,464 --> 01:05:58,668
He said he was embarrassed.

1198
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:00,938
Ashamed.

1199
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:04,540
He said he had to go and...

1200
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,509
go and kill someone.

1201
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:07,743
ROY:
Kill who?

1202
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:09,512
La Fontaine.

1203
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:13,917
Richie made us promise
not to tell you.

1204
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:20,456
He knew what he was doing
was dangerous.

1205
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:23,860
I suppose he didn't want you
to stop him.

1206
01:06:23,894 --> 01:06:26,362
You made Richie a promise,
English.

1207
01:06:27,898 --> 01:06:29,832
- We both did.
- Yes, we did.

1208
01:06:29,866 --> 01:06:31,767
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle.

1209
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:34,938
So...

1210
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:39,475
...where's Richie now?

1211
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:41,577
- You're the receptionist?
- Yes.

1212
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:46,415
After Richie left,
on the way to kill La Fontaine,

1213
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:48,484
I think he stopped by her place.

1214
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:49,819
No, he didn't.

1215
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:51,989
Why would he stop by
the receptionist's place?

1216
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:55,192
- Because she's Richie's girl.
- I'm not Richie's girl.

1217
01:06:55,225 --> 01:06:56,659
- FRANCIS: The hell you're not.
- I'm not. - You're not?

1218
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:58,661
- I'm not.
- MONK: Yeah, she is.

1219
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:01,530
Richie likes to brag.

1220
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:06,469
Mr. Boyle,
all I know about tonight

1221
01:07:06,502 --> 01:07:07,770
is that, at 2:00 in the morning,

1222
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:09,940
this ham-handed jerk
knocks on my door,

1223
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:12,808
tells me I gotta come with him,
and when I demur, he s...

1224
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:14,810
FRANCIS:
When I come into her place,

1225
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:16,579
there's a bloodstain
on the carpet.

1226
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:18,581
What?

1227
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:19,917
That's not true. That's a lie.

1228
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,952
- (gasps, screams)
- Stop! Stop!

1229
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,556
- Come.
- (Mable sniffles)

1230
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:32,662
You live close?

1231
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:35,865
Down the street.

1232
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:37,935
Lived on this block
my whole life.

1233
01:07:37,968 --> 01:07:39,970
- What's your name?
- Mable.

1234
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:42,705
Sean.

1235
01:07:43,706 --> 01:07:44,840
Shit.

1236
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:46,944
Your dad was Ryan Sean.

1237
01:07:46,977 --> 01:07:49,478
MABLE:
That's what they tell me.

1238
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,882
Did some work for me
