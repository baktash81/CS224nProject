00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:43,256
Oh, honey,
look at the view!

187
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,823
We're right
on the water!

188
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:45,833
Wow!

189
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,109
Whew!

190
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,084
It's a brochure.

191
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,915
It's a postcard.

192
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:02,548
Don't run up
those stairs.

193
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:03,556
Move, Bobby!

194
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,025
I'm trying.
They're heavy!

195
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:06,652
So is this.

196
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,322
Hi.

198
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,526
Archie!

199
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:14,538
It's O.K.
He's just barking.

200
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,665
Just barking.
Don't be afraid.

201
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,506
Come on, Arch!

202
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:21,377
He always barks
at people he likes.

203
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,939
Come on, Arch!

204
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,554
He must really like you.

205
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:29,216
Archie, get your ass
up here right now!

206
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:35,064
Where am I
putting these?

207
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,069
Don't throw off
my balance.

208
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:41,335
Finish emptying
the U-Haul tomorrow.

209
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:44,572
I'm putting my suffering
into one day.

210
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,079
I don't mind
unloading bags.

211
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,582
I just don't want to do
it for a living.

212
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,085
I'll go to
the grocery store.

213
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:54,886
You can take
the kids swimming.

214
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,589
Aw, gee! I forgot
my bathing suit.

215
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:01,599
I can't go swimming.

216
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,102
Nobody cares
what you look like

217
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,605
in a bathing suit.

218
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,106
That's just it.

219
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,110
I'll get you one.

220
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,611
I won't wear it

221
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,114
until I lose
a few pounds.

222
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,153
I love how you look
in a bathing suit.

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,621
My mother was right.
You're twisted.

224
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,952
Mm-hmm.

225
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,199
Grrr!

226
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,011
What are you
looking at?

227
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,521
Uh... nothing, Dad.

228
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,022
Yeah. Me neither.

229
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:43,750
Hey, Dad!

230
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,020
We want to go in!

231
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:47,529
You guys
go swimming.

232
00:10:47,597 --> 00:10:49,224
Aren't you coming?

233
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:52,963
I don't want to get
too wet my first day.

234
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:55,029
O.K. Can you hold these?

235
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:58,043
Sure.
There you go.

237
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:03,982

pretty good for 8 bucks.

[Music Gets Louder]

239
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:07,955
How do you shut it off?

Equalizer.

241
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,298

I'm your neighbor.

243
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:21,806
And you're...

244
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,140
Having lunch.

245
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,804
Mmm. Looks good.

246
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,010
Just enjoy.
I don't want to bother you.

247
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,954
I'll join you
later for martinis.

00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,524

249
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,825
Just watching my kids.

250
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,422
I'll be here.

251
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,899

252
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:10,004
Aah!

253
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:12,507
Don't worry. It's dead.

254
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,010
I told you
not to do that.

255
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,513
She told me to do it.

256
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:18,514
Enough!

257
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,517
Enough.
Just take it away.

258
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:21,780
Dad, you're red.

259
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,344
Good.

260
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:27,520
I wanted to get
a little color.

261
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:30,029
That's a good base.

262
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,033
That's a good base.

263
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,195
You got to do
this in stages.

264
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,034

make many turns.

A place called
the Yachthouse.

00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:56,063

274
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,441
Would that be
a 3-pounder?

275
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,242
3 1/4 pounds.

276
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,543
Perfect.

277
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,450
Yours is the next table.

278
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,510
Ahem.

279
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:14,714
Oh. Sorry.

00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:16,849
Excuse me.
You're next.

281
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,518
I'm not next.

282
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,028

Excuse me.
Pardon. Pardon.

00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,038
Sorry. Oops!

I got mints and toothpicks
to hold us over.

291
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,824
Hey.

292
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:48,628
The same guy is
in all the pictures.

293
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:52,532
Captain Al Pellet.

294
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:55,041
He's won
seven years straight.

295
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,701
I guess he's good.

296
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:01,511
Wow! They're big!

297
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:02,517
Excuse me, sir.

298
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,680
How much longer?

299
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:08,089
Yours should be
the very next table.

300
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,526
- Great.
- I'm starving.

301
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,529
So am I.

302
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,532
It's been hours
we've waited.

303
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,535
Excuse me, little lady.

304
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:17,538
Excuse me.

305
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,039
Excuse me.

Good evening,
Mr. Pellet.

00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,046
How were
your winds today?

308
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,638
Just fine.

309
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,548
There will be five of us.

310
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:30,349
Would you, uh,
part the waves

311
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,686
and let my party
through, please?

312
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,069
It's O.K.
It's O.K.

313
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:45,073
I thought we were
the next table of five.

314
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:48,578
Your table should
be ready shortly.

315
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,080
What about
that group?

316
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:53,585
Mr. Pellet had
a reservation.

317
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:55,484
You don't take
reservations.

318
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:58,080
We don't,
except for Mr. Pellet.

319
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:02,528
We'll have a table ready
for you any moment.

320
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:06,035
I see several are drinking
their coffees now.

321
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,400
Look at the menu.

322
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:11,669
I know what
we're having... lobster.

323
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:12,607
Bravo.

324
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,804
Bravo.

325
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,049
It's O.K.
I took care of everything.

326
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,050
We're next.

327
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,087
Nobody tells me I can't sit.

328
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,282
I'll sit when I want.

329
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:25,224
We sit next.

330
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,556
No need for those.

331
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:29,565
Let's all have the lobster.

332
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,861
Show us what you got.

333
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:33,096
And, Stan,
no arguments.

334
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:37,575
This dinner
is on you.

335
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:39,771
He thought I'd say,
"On me."

336
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:41,279
Huh?

337
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:45,477
Hey.

338
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,429
Maybe they're just
taking them for a walk.

339
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,434
Look at
these beauties.

340
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,095
Hey!
Don't serve those.

341
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,604
What are you doing?

342
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:02,437
These are my lobsters.

343
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,033
You got my table.

344
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,545
You're not getting
my lobsters.

345
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:08,549
This is your table?

346
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,551
My table!

347
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,451
Oh, I see.

348
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,821
This is your table,

349
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,826
and these are
your lobsters.

350
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:17,827
Right.

351
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:22,300
I suppose this
is your wife, hmm?

352
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,064
Is this your tie?

353
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:25,070
Nope.

354
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,572
Is this your shirt?

355
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,573
Mm-mm.

356
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,132
Is this your belt?

357
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,304
Are these your shorts?

358
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,315
I've been driving all day.

359
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,317
We just get into town.

360
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:36,580
I'm waiting two hours.

361
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:38,519
You just got into town.

362
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:41,252
I've been in town
for 30 years.

363
00:16:41,326 --> 00:16:42,418
30 years!

364
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:43,621
Every summer,

365
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:47,690
you renters think
you can take over the town.

366
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,099
Boil them.

367
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,866
Wait a minute.

368
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,135
Signore, we'll have
a table for you

369
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,233
in 20 minutes.

556
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,488
Don't worry.

557
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,494
I'll be around her.

558
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:16,927
I'll see you later.

559
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:19,363
O.K., ladies, let's go!

560
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,107
Hey, pops.

561
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,474
Take a bow.
Jack-off!

562
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,309
That guy looks
like John Madden.

563
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,816
Great.
Lifeguards next door.

564
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,822
A gaggle of them.

565
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,325
I guess I won't drown.

566
00:26:41,662 --> 00:26:43,892
[Whistling]

567
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:48,136
They whistled at us.

568
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,434
Don't look!

569
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,042
The one on the left
was so cute!

570
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,347
Ow! Hot, hot!

571
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,082
Oh, uh, boy!

572
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:05,284
We should've
brought shoes.

573
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,798
I can't walk.
My feet are burning.

574
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:12,801
O.K., just hop up on Daddy.

575
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,303
Hot!

576
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:17,308
There you go.
There's my girl.

577
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,638
Hold on.

578
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,972
Whew, boy!

579
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:21,479
Here we go.

580
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:23,516
We have
to find Mommy now.

581
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:24,516
Excuse me.

582
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:25,609
Ow!

583
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,120
Jeez, I'm sorry.

584
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,486
That was my hand!

585
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:30,991
Sorry about that.

586
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,493
Oh! Oh!

587
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,086
Oh! Oh!

588
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:37,367
It's this darn cooler.

589
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:39,369
The thing broke off.

590
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:42,875
I'm waiting for
a part from Minneapolis.

591
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,877
Lift up your foot!

592
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:47,881
You're getting
sand in my lens!

593
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:51,283
Send the bill to
415 Beach Lane.

594
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:52,787
Damn right I will!

595
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:54,288
You big bozo.

596
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:55,791
That's our lunch!

597
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,293
Watch it,
that's my hat.

598
00:27:58,362 --> 00:27:59,796
Hey, honky!

599
00:27:59,864 --> 00:28:00,796
Aah!

600
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:05,396
Oh, sorry.
It's just ice water.

601
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,742
Hey,
what are you...

602
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,277
You should've
covered it.

603
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:12,780
Watch it!

604
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,748
You shouldn't
cook here.

605
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,251
Where's your mother?

606
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,752
Sandy!

607
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,585
Jack!

608
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,593
Didn't you hear
me calling?

609
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,257
I've been all over.

610
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:28,267
O.K., sweetheart,
get down.

611
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:31,271
Am I glad
to be here.

612
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,273
I'm glad
you're here.

613
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:37,278
Can you finish
blowing up Bobby's raft?

614
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,776
Yeah.

615
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,787
I'm breathing out,
anyway.

616
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,289
What the heck.

617
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,790
Thank you.

618
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,064
How was
nursery school?

619
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:56,468
It was great.
She graduated.

620
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,471
What?

621
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,202
Mother Goose retired.

622
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:01,676
What a shame.

623
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:06,183
You want to build
a sand castle?

624
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:07,685
Yeah.

625
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,580
Hey, Sandy.

626
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:13,183
Yeah?

627
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,922
What's Jennifer
doing there?

628
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:16,931
Talking with
her new friend.

629
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,933
Do we want that?

630
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:20,435
They're just talking.

631
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:23,439
That's how she
got here, remember?

632
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:28,211
Hey, Dad!

633
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,976
Here's your raft.

634
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:35,544
I want
to play Frisbee.

635
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:37,056
Here, catch.

636
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,653
* O, say,
can you see? *

637
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:47,066
Bobby, throw long.

638
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:48,571
Go!

639
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:50,073
Hey, nice one.

640
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:02,090
Albert,
you octopus, you.

641
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,649
Hey, what are you doing?

642
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:07,253
Your wife's
on my Wham-O.

643
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,266
Get out of here.

644
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:10,767
Sure, why not?

645
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:13,771
Return it to
415 Beach Lane...

646
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,273
Beach Road.

647
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,494
Get back to it.

648
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:18,687
14-13.

649
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,631
Control's
the name of the game.

650
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,692
Pass it to me.

651
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:27,707
With your hands and my height,
we'll destroy them.

652
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,211
Are you ready, mister?

653
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,713
Yeah, we're ready.

654
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,215
Let's get them!

655
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,149
Let's eat them up!

656
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,517
Go, team!

657
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:50,430
Best two out of three?

658
00:30:50,505 --> 00:30:53,030
You're being too hard
on yourself.

659
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:55,669
You haven't played
volleyball for years.

660
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:58,806
Yeah?
Tell that to Bobby.

661
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:02,512
Right now he's wishing
you were a widow.

662
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:04,988
Have a grape.

663
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:08,084
I think your
blood sugar's low.

664
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,934
That's it!

665
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:16,938
How could I
be so stupid?

666
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,439
Of course.

667
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:21,510
I'm a sailor.

668
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:24,173
I'm a great sailor...

669
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,549
and I'm going to take
my son sailing!

670
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,522
Do you rent
sailboats?

671
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,023
We sure do.

672
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:33,185
All right!

673
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:35,058
We'd like a look
at them.

674
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,530
They're all rented up
for two weeks.

675
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,659
Everyone's practicing
for the regatta.

676
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:42,672
I want to teach
my son how to sail.

677
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,335
Any other place
we could rent one?

678
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,275
Well, there's one.

679
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:50,043
Which boat
will it be?

680
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,176
Tough choice,
isn't it?

681
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:55,689
Hey, Dad,
how about one like this

682
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:58,192
without the crud on it.

683
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,694
That crud is
crustaceous morticus,

684
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:03,130
pejoratively
referred to as barnacles.

685
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,001
She was
a fast lady in her day.

686
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:08,505
I'm sure.

687
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,132
We'll take
the 12-footer.

688
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,144
That's a fine choice.

689
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:15,148
You're your
own ballast in her.

690
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:16,649
That's good.

691
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,652
Yeah, O.K.

692
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,654
Ready to cast off?

693
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,156
You bet, Dad.

694
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,660
You get a free lesson.

695
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:26,161
I'll take them.

696
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,165
I already know how.

697
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,325
Thank you.

698
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:30,835
Ready, son?

699
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:32,336
Here we go!

700
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:34,101
I got it going!

701
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:35,835
Here we go.

702
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,543
Bye!

703
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:50,061
You just pull the sail
towards you

704
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:51,186
and you're sailing.

705
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,198
There's a boat there!

706
00:32:53,266 --> 00:32:55,700
I see him. It's O.K.

707
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,202
Sharp turn here.

708
00:32:57,271 --> 00:32:58,704
Yeah.

709
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:00,707
We made it.
Scared?

710
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,140
Not me.

711
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,644
I was.

712
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:07,149
I was a little
scared there.

713
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:09,652
Where did you
learn how to sail?

714
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,153
Camp Weehonk.

715
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,418
They had a big lake.

716
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,392
There's the lncisor.

717
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,590
Yeah.
Isn't she a beauty?

718
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:19,928
Let's get closer.

719
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,435
O.K., Captain,
here we go!

720
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,698
All right!

721
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,175
That's
a gorgeous boat.

722
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:29,678
Too bad a big fart
like that owns it.

723
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,680
Yeah,
the big fart.

724
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:36,653
Watch your
Language, will you?

725
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:40,090
Bear off to starboard.
That skiff's close.

726
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,927
We got the right of way.
Let him move.

727
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:46,365
We're heading
straight toward him!

728
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:50,530
Smaller craft have
the right of way.

729
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:53,270
I don't think
he knows that!

730
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:55,745
What are you doing?

731
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:57,577
My knee! My knee!

732
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,584
Your bad one, Dad?

733
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:01,086
Yes, yes, yes.

734
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:04,647
You put a hole
in my boat!

735
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,159
It's you again.

736
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:10,062
You hit my boat.
You hit my boat!

737
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:12,658
Why didn't
you give way?

738
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,672
You're telling me
how to sail?

739
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,005

Is something
wrong with your arms?

1456
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:49,900
You mean we're crew?

1457
01:10:49,968 --> 01:10:52,698
We can race with you?

1458
01:10:52,771 --> 01:10:53,796
What'd I say?

1459
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:55,238
Daddy,
that's excellent!

1460
01:10:55,307 --> 01:10:57,936
We're going
to win, right?

1461
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:59,843
Hell of a victory.

1462
01:10:59,914 --> 01:11:02,713
We'll have won
without a sail.

1463
01:11:02,785 --> 01:11:04,810
Why? Where's Angus?

1464
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:06,879
Last time I heard,
Savannah.

1465
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:13,194
I need a grand sally.

1466
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:15,700
50 foot high, she be.

1467
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:16,860
Sorry.

1468
01:11:16,936 --> 01:11:18,734
Never find her
by tomorrow.

1469
01:12:04,265 --> 01:12:06,324

be enough Jenny.

1470
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,834
Yes, it is.

1471
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:10,805
Tuck your shirt in, Floyd.
Look like a winner.

1472
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:41,245
Be of good cheer,
Angus is here!

The pecker
didn't show up.

1481
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,221
He's still coughing
up that dough.

1482

- Well, what do you know?
- What?

1483
01:13:21,265 --> 01:13:23,461
- We've got a late arrival.
- They just made it.

1484
01:13:23,535 --> 01:13:25,834
It hasn't started yet.

1485

Well, we made it.

Look.

1491
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,925
Well, lookie there.

Hey, there's
Gregg and Don!

1496
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:00,809
Hi!

1497
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,650
We have a start.

1498
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:09,717
Give them the gun.

1499
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:18,002
The boat feels different.

1500
01:14:18,073 --> 01:14:19,335
What's different?

1501
01:14:19,408 --> 01:14:22,139
She's twice as big
as I'm used to.

1502
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:23,839
Aw, she don't know that.

1503
01:14:23,914 --> 01:14:25,814
You'll get the feel of her.

1504
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:27,818
Just follow her lead.

1505
01:14:27,886 --> 01:14:30,651
It's their lead
I'm worried about.

1506
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:32,554
You're worried, are you?

1507
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:33,888
Good. That's
the proper attitude.

1508
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,122
It's a long race.
We'll catch them.

1509
01:14:36,197 --> 01:14:37,630
I hope so.

1510
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:39,132
Ease off on the jib.

1511
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,135
Ease off on the jib!

1512
01:14:41,203 --> 01:14:42,329
Aye, aye, Captain.

1513
01:14:42,404 --> 01:14:43,372
Sorry.

1514
01:14:44,674 --> 01:14:47,940
Mommy, can I play in
the basement with Yorku?

1515
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:49,605

With Yorku.

I'm going to head up
a little higher.

1519

Head her up higher.

01:15:07,704 --> 01:15:09,332
Heading up higher.

All right.
Hard to lee!

Let's not blow it
on the first marker!

1526
01:15:26,896 --> 01:15:28,091
All right.

Prepare to come about.

1531

the other jib sheet.

1546
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:16,986
Yeah.

1547
01:16:17,062 --> 01:16:19,588
Take off your hat
and wave.

1548
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:20,860
Steady on the helm!

1549
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:23,335

hand on the wheel!

1550
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:25,338
Sorry.
Got it, though.

1551
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:26,374
Thanks.

1552
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:30,637
Have we fetched
the second marker?

No.

1554

Damn!

01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:35,648
They're losing us!

1556
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,517
Prepare to jibe!

1557
01:16:37,589 --> 01:16:39,353
Check that turtle!

1558
01:16:39,425 --> 01:16:40,858
Jibe ho!

01:16:40,926 --> 01:16:42,861
Let's get it down!

1560
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:44,794

drop the jib!

Hoist the spinnaker
rounding the marker!

Hoist, damn it!
Move!

1565
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:58,146
Move! Move!
Get it up there!

1566
01:16:58,215 --> 01:17:00,980
Trim the backsail!
Come on! Hustle!

1567
01:17:01,052 --> 01:17:03,419
Easy aft.

1568
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,888
All right, everybody!
This is it...

1569
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,555
The run for the money.
Prepare to jibe!

1570
01:17:10,765 --> 01:17:15,704
Jibe ho!
Jibe ho!

1571
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:24,379
Har.

1572
01:17:25,752 --> 01:17:28,153
Ease the pull forward
about three inches.

1573
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:31,158
Take a bearing
on that last craft, Angus.

1574
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,159
How are
we doing, Dad?

1575
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:41,034
We're O.K.!

1576
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:48,077
We're not closing.

1577
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:49,672
Jack, you've
done beautifully,

1578
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:53,186
but this old gal ain't got
nothing else to give us.

1579
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:08,134
Yorku,
you think we'll win?

1580
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:09,401
Yes.

1581
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:11,671
What you got there?

1582
01:18:11,745 --> 01:18:15,079
Scrod.

1583
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,139
You want some?

1584
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:17,150
No.

1585
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:20,018
Where did you get it?

1586
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,523
From the freezer.

1587
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:25,620
Didn't I tell you
to remove all the food

1588
01:18:25,697 --> 01:18:27,164
and the freezer?

1589
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:31,169
Oh! I think you says
don't move the food

1590
01:18:31,237 --> 01:18:33,035
and the freezer.

1591
01:18:33,107 --> 01:18:36,043
Thank God
for my bad Spanish!

1592

Everything out!

1594

There's pounds
of ballast down here!

1595
01:18:42,252 --> 01:18:44,186
We're still in this race!

with the garbage!

1597
01:18:45,923 --> 01:18:47,550
Come on! Let's go!

1598
01:18:49,962 --> 01:18:52,022
Everything overboard!

1599
01:18:52,098 --> 01:18:53,190
Todo afueras.

1600
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:13,387
This old gal's got
the straightaway power

1601
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,052
to run the bastards down!

1602
01:19:15,128 --> 01:19:16,356
We give the squeeze!

1603
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:18,365
You're doing great, Dad!

1604

She's on her line!

1605
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:21,367
I can feel her.

1606
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:23,371

I'm coming to get you!

1607
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:24,566
Out of my way!

1608
01:19:24,641 --> 01:19:26,370
Eat hot waves!

1609
01:19:26,443 --> 01:19:28,639
We're catching up
with the big fart!

1610
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:30,180
Watch your Language.

1611
01:19:30,247 --> 01:19:32,182
The kid's right.
He's a fart.

1612
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,548
Thanks, Mom.

1613
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:34,711
So?

1614
01:19:34,787 --> 01:19:36,721
They look very natural.

1615
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:37,882
Vicki!

1616
01:19:37,958 --> 01:19:39,892
I value a judge's opinion.

1617
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,189
Thank you.

1618
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:43,697
We'll show
the people in the stands.

1619
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:45,199
Good idea.

1620
01:19:45,267 --> 01:19:46,701
Word from the committee.

1621
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:48,203
On the final leg,

1622
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:49,431
the Barnacle
is moving up fast.

1623
01:19:53,178 --> 01:19:54,475
Damn it.

1624
01:19:54,546 --> 01:19:56,208
What's going on?

1625
01:19:56,282 --> 01:19:58,216
The bastards
stole our wind.

1626
01:19:58,284 --> 01:20:01,289
- They can't, can they?
- They've done it.

1627
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:05,359
Can we turn the engine on
till we catch the son of a bitch?

1628
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:06,452
No.

1629
01:20:06,529 --> 01:20:08,053
I know.

1630
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:25,179
Falling off.
Stand by to trim.

1631
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,779
- Aye.
- What the hell you doin'?

1632
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:29,587
See that plane?

1633
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,891
It's in a maverick microburst,

1634
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:33,760
a low altitude
funnel gunnel.

1635
01:20:33,831 --> 01:20:37,063
I've seen it
at the airport a hundred times.

1636
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:39,867
All right!
Go for it, boy!

1637
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:43,034
Here it comes.
Here it comes.

1638
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,099
Here we go!

1639
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:46,204
Trim her in,
you dumb Swede!

1640
01:20:46,281 --> 01:20:48,773
Can't you see we're
in a funnel gunnel!

1641
01:20:48,851 --> 01:20:51,548
Aye, ya lovely sally!

1642
01:20:51,622 --> 01:20:53,385
We're going fast.

1643
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:54,550
We're gaining.

1644
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:56,992
Where'd they get
all that wind from?

1645
01:20:57,062 --> 01:20:58,121
Dad,
we're closing in!

1646
01:20:58,197 --> 01:21:00,392
You're doing great, Dad!

1647
01:21:00,466 --> 01:21:03,163
I want to get a picture
of Pellet as you pass him.

1648
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:05,364
Make a couple
of copies for me.

1649
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,740
We're closing in
on the scurvy bastard.

1650
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:11,042
Trim the main!
They're gaining.

1651
01:21:11,114 --> 01:21:13,811
When I tell you
trim it, trim it!

1652
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:15,545
We're beating him!

1653
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:17,383
That a way, Dad!

1654
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,597
Faster!
Faster, Dad!

1655
01:21:24,665 --> 01:21:26,223
We're gaining
on them!

1656
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:29,869
How do we get
more speed?

1657
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:32,567
Can't.
We need more sail.

1658
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:34,075
Aye. Damn it.

1659
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,078
With two more yards of sail,

1660
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,546
we could've made it.

1661
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:42,582
Scully, take the wheel.

1662
01:21:43,957 --> 01:21:46,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this moment,

1663
01:21:46,227 --> 01:21:49,094
the Barnacle's a real
threat to the lncisor.

1664
01:21:56,106 --> 01:21:57,971
We're in
a wind pocket?

1665
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,203
Come on!

1666
01:22:00,278 --> 01:22:02,474
I told you
she could fly!

1667
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:04,812
We're going
to beat them!

1668
01:22:04,884 --> 01:22:06,785
There's the finish line!

1669
01:22:06,853 --> 01:22:08,320
Floor it!

1670
01:22:08,388 --> 01:22:10,084
Go, Dad! Go!

1671
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,990
What is it? What?

1672
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,153
Are we
dragging something?

1673
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,993
What is it?

1674
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:18,796
Aye!
Mounty to the beasties!

1675
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:20,302
We'll show you!

1676
01:22:23,141 --> 01:22:24,574
Come on, Dad!
Let's go!

1677
01:22:24,643 --> 01:22:27,272
We got it.
We're so close!

1678
01:22:27,346 --> 01:22:29,281
Keep it up, Dad!

1679
01:22:31,151 --> 01:22:32,710

Whoo!

1687
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:53,712
We did it!

1688
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:58,620
We got beat by a restaurant
wearing pants!

1689
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,746
Trousers?

1690
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:01,154
Is that legal?

1691
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:03,717
I don't know, but I like it.

Yay!

1693

We did it!

We won!
