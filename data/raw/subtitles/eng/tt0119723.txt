1
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,500
Evans!

2
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,980
Don't come!

3
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,580
Those ruffians dead Gods
shan't have it all their own way.

4
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,220
Those gods who never lose
a chance of hurting, foughting...

5
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,340
and spoiling human lives...

6
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,100
are seriously put out
if all the same, you behave like a lady.

7
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,580
Of course, now I think there are no
Gods and there's no one to blame.

8
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,100
It's so very dangerous to live
for only one day.

9
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,980
I buy the flowers myself, Lucy.
Yes, ma'am.

10
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,780
And Mrs Walker
said not to forget that

11
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,940
Rumplemayers's men
will be here at eleven.

12
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,460
I won't forget.

13
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,300
Oh, what a day, Lucy!
What a day for my party.

14
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,980
What a luck!

15
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,500
What a plunge!

16
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,460
What a plunge!

17
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,380
Good morning to you, Clarissa.
Hugh!

18
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,820
And where are you off to?
To buy flowers for my party.

19
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,140
I love walking in London on a day like this.
It's better that in the country.

20
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,900
Evelyn wouldn't agree with you there.
She can't bear coming out to town.

21
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,780
I had to get her to come
up to see W. Bud.

22
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,380
He's putting her in a nursing home,
for a few days.

23
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,420
Nothing serious?

24
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,500
No, nothing serious. She's just
a good deal out of salts.

25
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,580
The war may be over,
but there is still the echoe of it.

26
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,500
The Boxborough boy
was killed, you know...

27
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,460
and she is very close
to Lady Boxborough.

28
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,420
And Evelyn takes things badly.

29
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,980
Yes, one does still hear
dreadful stories.

30
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,260
I must get on. The'll be
waiting for this, at the palace.

31
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,420
Will you still come to
my party tonight?

32
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,660
Oh, yes!
Evelyn absolutly insists I go.

33
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,100
Hugh Whitbread. I can forgive you
liking him, Clarissa.

34
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,900
He's a buffon. Even when he plays
tennis, his hair doesn't move.

35
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,300
He's a barbers block. An imbecil.
He thinks of nothing but his clothes.

36
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,060
I like him.

37
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,540
How can you? He's never read anything.
Never thought anything.

38
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,140
Never felt anything!

39
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,740
Stabel boys are more likeable than
Hugh.

40
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Sally says he tried to kiss
her in the smoking-room.

41
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,540
Oh! She didn't let him?
She rather die first.

42
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,020
Good for Sally. She sees through
that public school nonsense.

43
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,780
Old manners and breeding.

44
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,060
No country but England
could have produced Hugh.

45
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,460
He is sweet and unselfish
and he's very good to his mother.

46
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,780
You're so sentimental, Clarissa!

47
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,740
And you're impossible!

48
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,140
Oh, what beautiful flowers!
That's absolutly wonderful, Sally.

49
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,100
Oh, I thought Sally could be trusted
to do the flowers.

50
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,860
That's wicked. To cut off the heads
of those flowers. Really...

51
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
I think they're beautiful.

52
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,660
Peter, look at the flowers.

53
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,420
Yes.

54
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,700
Roses for the hall, I think.

55
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,580
And sweet peas for the table,
perhaps?

56
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,580
Yes! Sweet pea to the table.
It will be perfect!

57
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,260
Those awful motorcars.

58
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,380
Yes Of course,
it was a car.

59
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,060
- I'm loose it here.
- Septimus, please. We must go on.

60
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm loose it here,
and I don't know with what purpose.

61
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,220
Septimus, please, poeple are looking at us.
Am I blocking the way?

62
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,900
Allright, then.

63
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,580
Bye, Mrs. Dalloway.

64
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,340
Mrs. Dalloway, Mrs. Dalloway.
I'm not even Clarissa anymore.

65
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,860
No more marrying, no more having children.
Just Mrs. Dalloway.

66
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,940
Mrs.  Richard Dalloway,
who's to give a party.

67
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,620
You'll marry
a prime minister...

68
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,900
and stand
at the top of the staircase.

69
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,540
Who'll give parties.
You'll be the perfect hostess.

70
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,860
You have the makings
of a perfect hostess.

71
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,940
You could do so much,
be so much.

72
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,460
What you want me to be?

73
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,260
Life seems to me to be very dangerous.

74
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,980
But one must live life
dangerously!

75
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,300
Look! Look, Septimus!

76
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,540
Is no crime.

77
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,860
There is no death.

78
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,900
The birds are singing in Greek.

79
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,540
The whole world is clamouring.
"Kill yourself!" "Kill yourself!"

80
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,540
Septimus, I'm going to
walk to the lake and back.

81
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,540
"Kreemo". It says "Kreemo".

82
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,260
-So revigorating.
- I know what you meen.

83
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,580
The bushies, the flowers.
So well kept.

84
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,860
Yes, this is a wonderful garden.
Beautiful.

85
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,060
You should see the Milan gardens!

86
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,500
What a strange person.
She's a foreigner.

87
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,780
Make it now...
Make it now...

88
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,180
But there is a God!
No one kills from hatred!

89
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,420
Evans!

90
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,700
For God sake! Don't come!

91
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,620
T... O...

92
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,380
F... F...

93
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,180
E... And!

94
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,620
It says "toffee"!
I know it's "toffee".

95
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,020
Look, Lucy.

96
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,060
It sayed "Kreemo toffee".

97
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,696
There was a phone
message, ma'am.

98
00:15:04,722 --> 00:15:07,580
Mr. Dalloway sayed to tell you
he would not be home for lunch.

99
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,540
He would be lunching at lady Bruton's.

100
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,380
He did!

101
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,540
Lady Bruton. Well...

102
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,340
Clarissa, my darling. Parliament
sits so late...

103
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,220
and the doctor said
you must get your rest.

104
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,060
You must sleep undisturbed.

105
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,980
Fear no more the heat of the sun...

106
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,980
nor the furious winter's rages.

107
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,380
It's all over for me.

108
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,060
The sheets stretched and
the bed narrow.

109
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,820
What we need to do is abolish
private property...

110
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,780
because that really is what
causes all the problems.

111
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,980
Let's write
a letter to the Times about it.

112
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,900
Then, we should found
a society...

113
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,580
to abolish private property
and do away with it forever and ever.

114
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,460
This house as well?

115
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,060
You always
look so virginal, Clarissa!

116
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,660
I am virginal.

117
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,780
Are you in love with Peter?

118
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,540
Oh, love...

119
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,820
I don't know.

120
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,260
But you love me?

121
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,780
Damn and blust! I left my sponge
in the bathroom.

122
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Tell me to go and get it, like this!

123
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,620
You wouldn't!
I would!

124
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,580
Is it all over for me?

125
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I've come up to the tower and left
them all blackberrying in the sun.

126
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,540
Don't run, Clarissa!
Young ladies don't run.

127
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,780
Leipzig is good, but I think
Heidelberg is beautiful...

128
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,740
especially this time of year.
The "Philosopher's Walk".

129
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,380
It reminds me very much of here,
with the gardens.

130
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,100
You are most fortunate the way
your gardens are done.

131
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,820
And you have many trees. The colors and
the way it's all been orchestrated.

132
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,900
It's tremendously fine. I think this is a
great achievement of the English garden.

133
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
"Love in her sunny eyes,
just basking play.

134
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,980
Love walks the pleasant
mazes of her hair. "

135
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,780
"Love does both on her lips,
forever stray...

136
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,900
and saws and reaps
a thousand kisses there."

137
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,340
"N'or all her outfought parts
love's always seen...

138
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,420
but, oh, he never went within."

139
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,740
Clarissa.

140
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,020
What?

141
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,460
The men leed such
exciting lives...

142
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,940
but their poor wives
don't seems to do so well.

143
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,140
Marriage is a catastrophe
for women.

144
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,260
But it is inevitable, isn't it?

145
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,540
Sally...

146
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,180
Will we always be together?

147
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,380
Always! Always!

148
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,420
We'll do everything together.
We'll change the world! Come on.

149
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,380
Oh, Lucy!

150
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,940
Silver does look nice.

151
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,020
The doors are of the hangers in
the dining room, ma'am.

152
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,260
And Rumplemayers's men
will be here soon.

153
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,420
Can I help you with that, ma'am?
No, Lucy.

154
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,140
You've got enough to do.

155
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,140
Star gazing, are we?

156
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,940
Yes.

157
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,700
Come on, Joseph. You know the stars,
you can tell us which is which.

158
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,220
You see that star,
just above the horizon?

159
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
Yes.
That's Antares.

160
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,660
Heart of the Scorpio
constellation.

161
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,300
He's name means
"rival of Mars."

162
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,380
And that one?

163
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,900
Ask Libra, we have Alpha.
There goes bright star.

164
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,180
And see how Altair, the
brightest star of equality Eagle...

165
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,620
shines in the east for us today.

166
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,780
Ms. Kilman and I are going out.
Is there anything we can get for you, Mother?

167
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,060
Where are you going, Elisabeth dear?

168
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,940
Ms. Kilman is taking me
to meet the Rev. Whitacker.

169
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,900
Reverend Whitacker. Ah, yes.

170
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,620
Wasn't he the very instrument
in your conversion, Ms. Kilman?

171
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,140
Yes, he helped bring me
to our Lord.

172
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,780
And is today's visit part of
the history lesson?

173
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,260
The reverend Whitacker is also
a historian, Mother.

174
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,180
He can put this true religion
in a proper perspective.

175
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,580
I wonder what that is.

176
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,900
I've never wanted to convert anyone, I hope.
I just want everyone to be themselves.

177
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,340
I've often thought that religious
fanaticism can make a person...

178
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,940
rather careless.

179
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,420
Mother! We just going to talk to him.

180
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,860
You won't forget about my party
tonight, Elizabeth!

181
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,980
I was going to help Mrs. Kilman
sort the clothes for the mission.

182
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,660
Well, I dare say Ms. Kilman could
spare you for one evening.

183
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,820
I'll see, Mother. We must go,
or we'll be late.

184
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,300
It all seems useless. Going on
being in love. Going on quarreling.

185
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,820
Going on making out.
But Peter, you want so much from me!

186
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,220
You leave me nothing to myself.
You want every little bit of me!

187
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,020
Well, I do! I want us
to be everything to each other.

188
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,580
But that's all so suffocating!

189
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,940
God! God! God!

190
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Peter Walsh!

191
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,660
Clarissa.
Peter!

192
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,780
But you're in India.

193
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,340
No, didn't you get my last letter?
I said I'd be here in June.

194
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,060
No. Your last letter said
that you might be back...

195
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,980
But I never suspected it.

196
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,060
It's extraordinary how Peter can put
me in this state, just by coming here.

197
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,980
He looks awfully well.

198
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,780
It's heavenly to see you again, Peter.

199
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,140
I arrived last night.

200
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,940
Playing with his knife.
How is everything? How are you?

201
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,220
Oh, so like him.
How is Richard?

202
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,660
Richard's with some committee.
Something to do with his constituents.

203
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,340
What's this? What's all this here?

204
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,700
I'm mending my dress.
It's for my party tonight.

205
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,260
Which I shan't invite you to,
my dear Peter.

206
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,580
Why?
Why won't you ask me?

207
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,180
It is extraordinary that
you shown up this morning.

208
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,980
I've been thinking
about Bordon all day.

209
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,940
I heard about your father.
I should've written to you, of course.

210
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,460
Although I never really got on with him.
He never liked anyone who...

211
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,500
who wanted to marry you.

212
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,020
Herbert has Bordon now.
I never go there.

213
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,540
And what happened to you?
Millions of things.

214
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,620
Should I tell you?

215
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,740
Should I make a clean brast of it?

216
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm in love, I'm in love with a girl
in India.

217
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,820
And who is she?
A younger woman, of course.

218
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,980
Well, I'm not old, you know?
My life isn't over not by any means.

219
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Well, you of course...

220
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,980
think me as a failure, wich I
suppose I am compared to all that.

221
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,940
But who is she? Tell me.

222
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,900
A married woman.
Unfortunately.

223
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,140
She's the wife of a major
in the Indian Army.

224
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,300
She has two young children,
a boy and a girl.

225
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,060
And it's a bit of a mess.

226
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,740
I'm here to see the lawyers
about a divorce.

227
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,740
Just called Daisy.

228
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,300
Yes?

229
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes

230
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,740
But what should you do?

231
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,500
The lawyers and the solicitors
they can judge...

232
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,540
For heaven's sake,
leave that knife alone!

233
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,820
I know what I'm up against.

234
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,700
I know what I'm up against.

235
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,740
All is all up! And am I behaving like
a fool, weepping, being emotional!

236
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,740
Probably annoyed you,
turning up at this hour...

237
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,380
and told you everything,
as usual?

238
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,220
Are you happy, Clarissa?
Does Richard...

239
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,460
Excuse me, ma'am. The gentlemen
are here from Rumplemayers.

240
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,420
Oh, thank you, Lucy.

241
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,060
Good bye, Clarissa.

242
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,740
My party tonight

243
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,060
Please come to my party,
tonight.

244
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,780
Come on!
Let's get out of this.

245
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,180
I want to do another!

246
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,420
Come on.

247
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,780
Is this what you want?
Staying here and go to parties?

248
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,340
But I like parties!
Oh, Clarissa!

249
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,260
You always tie me up
with your queen standard, Breitl.

250
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,300
It's my turn to shuffle,
Herbert.

251
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,180
Hugh, do you
ever stop eating?

252
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,220
Did you know
Wingate's married again?

253
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,060
Yes, they came to call
last week.

254
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,140
The woman use to be his housemaid.

255
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,820
He had a nerve.
Bringing a housemaid to Cork.

256
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,900
Yes! She was absurdly overdressed.
She looked like a cockatoo.

257
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,420
And she never stopped talking!

258
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,980
She probably thought
you all knew.

259
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,980
Knew what?

260
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,900
That she had a baby
before she was married.

261
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,005
I don't think I should ever
be up to speak to her again!

262
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,765
Don't be ridiculous, Clarissa.

263
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,700
If this is true we should
certainly not receive her again.

264
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,709
I should think not.

265
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:29,405
If we start receiving women like that,
you don't know where it'll end?

266
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,540
Oh, you snob! You represent all that's
detestable in british middle class life.

267
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,980
It's men like you who's responsible
for prostitutes around Piccadilly.

268
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,180
Me!
Yes, men like you.

269
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,620
That's enough, Sally. We'll have no more
of this conversation.

270
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,820
I'm glad I walked out. They're all
such snobs and Hugh is a fraud.

271
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,020
Clarissa is so prudish
and arrogant.

272
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,180
Not really.

273
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,700
It's just what she's been brought up to.
Wish she would see things more clearly.

274
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,460
Clearly enough to marry you,
you mean?

275
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,340
I see.

276
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,780
This is Mr. Wickham, Peter.
My name is Dalloway.

277
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,260
Richard Dalloway.

278
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,260
But I've introduced you
to everyone as Mr. Wickham.

279
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,020
Still Dalloway.
My name is Dalloway.

280
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,260
Dalloway.

281
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,420
So definitly you're going
to go to politics?

282
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,100
Yes, I think so.
What is with your friend, Mr...?

283
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,260
"My name is Dalloway".

284
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,660
What's the matter?

285
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,780
Somebody's just walking
on my grave.

286
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,020
I took another friend.
She's gonna marry that man!

287
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,140
I went into the sea.

288
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,700
I have been dead.

289
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
But now I'm alive.

290
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,660
I must rest, I must rest.

291
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,580
Septimus, I'm going to ask
someone the time.

292
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,580
I think we have to go now.

293
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,580
It's nowhere to go,
nowhere to hide.

294
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Septimus, you know we are going
to see a doctor who will help you.

295
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,220
No more doctors!

296
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,620
No more lies!
Septimus, please!

297
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,580
Irvin!

298
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,300
Thank you.

299
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,940
Evans?

300
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,460
Evans!

301
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,620
For God's sake, don't come!

302
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,900
Septimus, it isn't Evans, allright?
It isn't Evans.

303
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,260
There is nothing to worry about.
The man is not Evans.

304
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,780
Really, he isn't.

305
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,380
Come on.

306
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,460
Let's go for a walk.

307
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,260
Clarissa! It's such a lovely evening.
Let's go to the lake.

308
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Yes! We can go boating.

309
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,020
Let's get our shoulds.
It might be cold.

310
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,740
Peter! We're going boating
on the lake. Aren't you coming?

311
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,580
I think Mr. Dalloway
likes you.

312
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh, aren't we being
the perfect hostess?

313
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,380
Oh, don't come than if you're going
to be beastly in the wood.

314
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,820
"Dalloway.
It's still Dalloway."

315
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,620
Come on.

316
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,580
They're all waiting.

317
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,580
Poor old woman.

318
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,220
Septimus, you won't tell
the doctor, will you?

319
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,820
You mustn't.
They will take you away from me.

320
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,500
Sir William BRADSHAW
M.D.

321
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,196
I've looked at
Dr. Holmes's notes.

322
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:03,420
He's been seeing your
husband for some six weeks?

323
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,500
Yes.
He is our landlady's doctor.

324
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,380
She send for him because
I told her I was worried about Septimus.

325
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,660
He threatened to kill himself?
He didn't mean it.

326
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,700
No. Of course not.

327
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,220
And Dr. Holmes prescribed...

328
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,260
bromine?
Yes

329
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,220
He said that there was
nothing really wrong.

330
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,380
But Septimus keeps talking to the dead man,
Evans, his friend who was killed in the war.

331
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,700
And Septimus wasn't like this
when I met him.

332
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,020
It's happened in just
the last few months.

333
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,820
He says people are talking
behind bedroom walls...

334
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,380
and he saw a woman's head
in the middle of a fern.

335
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,620
He says he's on trial
for some terrible crime...

336
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,140
but, of course, he's done nothing.

337
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:02,100
And then he seems to forget it all and
seems happy again, as he used to be.

338
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,020
We went to Hampton Court,
on top of a bus, the other day...

339
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,380
and told of red and yellow flowers.
He said they looked like floating lamps.

340
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,020
And he was fun, as he used to be
and made me laugh. I was so happy.

341
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,980
And suddenly, as we
were standing by the river, he said...

342
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,700
"We will kill ourselves."
Then, he held my hand...

343
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,340
and said he was falling
into the flames. And he cried and cried.

344
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,060
Ms. Warrensmith, your husband is
very seriously ill.

345
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,140
From everything you told me
and from Dr. Holmes's report...

346
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,140
I believe that his suffering
from delayed shell shock.

347
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,540
But he's not mad, is he?

348
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,620
I never use that word.
I prefer to say...

349
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
lacking the sense of proportion.

350
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,460
But Dr. Holmes said that there
was nothing what so ever the matter!

351
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Your husband needs rest.
Complete rest.

352
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,940
But not away from me!

353
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,860
My dear Ms. Warrensmith sometimes
we have to separate such people...

354
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,980
from their loved ones,
for their own good.

355
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,180
Dalloway! I met Clarissa
this morning.

356
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,780
So, she's giving another of her
famous parties tonight?

357
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,180
Right as usual, Hugh.

358
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,580
And Lady Bruton summond you as well.
Wonder what she wants from us?

359
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,020
Nothing we can't accomplish
ever at a good lunch, I'm sure.

360
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,460
Ah, good day, Miss Brasher.
Good day, sir.

361
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,900
How's your brother,
in South Africa?

362
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,820
I got you here under false pretenses.
I actually need your help.

363
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,620
But we'll have lunch first.

364
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,300
And how is Clarissa?

365
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,820
Quite well recovered, thank you. The doctor
told her he must take things easy...

366
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,860
But she does so want to
give her party tonight.

367
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,420
I trust we'll should have the pleasure
of your company tonight.

368
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,820
Of course, Richard. I wouldn't miss
one of your parties.

369
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,060
I met Clarissa in the park
this morning.

370
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,380
She was wearing
a yellow feathered hat.

371
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh, yes! I like that hat.

372
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,220
We'll you come in now, please?

373
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,500
Good.

374
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,740
Do sit down.

375
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:59,260
I see that you served with great
distinction in the war, Mr. Warrensmith.

376
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,900
At the war?

377
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,300
The European war.

378
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,220
A little shindy of schoolboys
with gunpowder.

379
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,860
Did I serve with distinction?
I'd forgotten.

380
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,380
In the war, itself, I failed.

381
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,620
No, he served with the greatest distinction.
He was promoted.

382
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,620
I...

383
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,660
I have committed a crime.
He's done nothing wrong whatever.

384
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,620
What did Dr. Holmes advised
you to do?

385
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,300
To my wife he said
to make me porridge.

386
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,860
Headache, dreams,
fears are just nerves.

387
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,340
Health is largely a
matter of our control.

388
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,660
I should take up some hobby.

389
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,980
Dr. Holmes...

390
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,140
throws himself into outside interests.
And throwing himself, he is able...

391
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,900
to switch off from his patients
on to old furniture.

392
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,460
Dr. Holmes is interested
in antique furniture.

393
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,980
Yes

394
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,980
So, when the damn fool came again,
I refused to see him.

395
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,620
Impulsive brute...

396
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,420
Blood red nostrils...

397
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,780
Once you stumble, human nature
is on you. Holmes is on you.

398
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,260
Our only chance is to escape
without letting Holmes know.

399
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,300
Anywhere,
away from Dr. Holmes.

400
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,580
There is no excuse.
Nothing whatever is the matter.

401
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,740
Except sin.

402
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,180
For which...

403
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,580
human nature has condemned me
to death.

404
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,500
I can not feel.

405
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,060
I did not care,
when  Evans was killed.

406
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,300
That was the worst...

407
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,420
but all the other crimes...

408
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,740
raised their heads,
shaked their fingers...

409
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,260
and they cheer and they sneer.

410
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,620
And the verdict of human nature
on such a beast...

411
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,940
is death!

412
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,460
We all have our moments
of depression.

413
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,180
He has impulses, sometimes?
That is my own affair!

414
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:41,260
There you are mistaken, sir. We are all
responsible one for another.

415
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,260
I am responsible
to Dr. Holmes?

416
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,660
Another humbug.

417
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,900
We...

418
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,020
have been arranging
that you should go into a home.

419
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,860
One of Holmes's homes?

420
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,380
No, one of my homes,
Mr. Warrensmith.

421
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,700
And there we will teach you to rest
and to regain a sense of proportion.

422
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,300
But I've confessed!
I confessed my crimes!

423
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,060
Why won't you had me off?
He's done nothing. Nothing!

424
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,260
He will be perfectly looked after.
I will visit once a week.

425
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,100
But my husband does not like
doctors. He will refuse to go.

426
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,158
Your husband has threatened
to kill himself.

427
00:46:29,184 --> 00:46:32,805
There is no alternative, it
is a question of the law.

428
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,180
It's a very beautiful home in the country.
Nurses are admirable.

429
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,740
Now, if you have no further
questions to ask...

430
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,100
I will arrange everything
with Dr. Holmes.

431
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,220
He will send somebody
around this evening...

432
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,300
between five and six.

433
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,460
It's the law, Ms. Warrensmith,
and it is for the best.

434
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,820
It won't be Dr. Holmes
who comes, will it?

435
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,940
Trust everything to me.

436
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,180
I do not like that man.
He's a humbug.

437
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,500
We are deserted.

438
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,020
Do you know who's in town?
Our old friend, Peter Walsh.

439
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,620
Back from India.
Peter Walsh back?

440
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,900
In trouble with some woman,
evidently.

441
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,980
Some woman in India.

442
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,100
Peter Walsh was always in trouble
of some sort.

443
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,340
Didn't he marry someone on the boat
going out?

444
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,460
I don't believe that lasted long.
I imagine that was all what...

445
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,740
I believe is known as "the rebound".

446
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,940
I suppose he'll try
to settle here now.

447
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,660
I'd say it will be difficult to help him.
He'll be quite a misfit.

448
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,740
I'm sure Clarissa will know
that he's here.

449
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,700
And I no doubt he'll be at her the party
tonight and all will be revealed.

450
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,020
Yes, if Peter Walsh is in town,
Clarissa will know.

451
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,860
This is better.

452
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,220
Come on, Peter.

453
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,100
We'll race you
to the top.

454
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,500
Well ..

455
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,820
my idea is this.

456
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,660
We all agree, do we not,
that Britain is overpopulated.

457
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,140
Yes, indeed.

458
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,780
And you agree...

459
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,060
that many of these men,
back from the war...

460
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,620
are finding it difficult
to find employment.

461
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,100
Indeed, in some cases,
their work...

462
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,500
has been commandered by women.
However...

463
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,020
We all know the rot
that's set in there.

464
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,820
Unfortunately!
Well ..

465
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,820
my idea is a simple one.

466
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,660
All the best ideas are simple,
as we know.

467
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,660
My project is to incourage...

468
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,060
by making it financialy easy
young people of both sexes...

469
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,580
to emigrate to Canada.

470
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,020
They will be set up with the fair chance
of doing well in Canada.

471
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,780
And Britain will gain financialy,
in the long run.

472
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,660
It's only so much that I can do,
being a woman.

473
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,740
But Richard, I ask you...

474
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,700
to make this suggestion
in the House. And Hugh...

475
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,860
I want you to help me start the ball
rolling with a letter to the Times.

476
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,860
I know, my dear Hugh,
that you will know, exactly...

477
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,300
how to phrase it for me.

478
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,220
I think someone is already typing a motion
against some kind of emigration plan going.

479
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,220
But I suppose a letter to the Times
will do no harm.

480
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,100
I take it further.
Make emigration obligatory...

481
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,220
if you couldn't get work
after a certain period of time.

482
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,300
I wouldn't go that far. These
things are never quite that simple.

483
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,020
There is a new chef at the Cafe Royal...

484
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,820
does marvellous things
with mollusces.

485
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,500
You'll just have time to catch
the three o'clock post, Mildred.

486
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,300
I think we can say if you say it,
that was a job well done.

487
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,420
I should take my rest now.

488
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,340
Go!

489
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,380
I wonder if Peter Walsh has
got in touch with Clarissa?

490
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,060
I think I might buy
something for Evelyn. She is very low.

491
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:15,620
And jewelry never
loses its price.

492
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,460
I think I buy Clarissa
some flowers.

493
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,940
Yes, I'll pop in to see her on my way
back to the House with some flowers.

494
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,540
Fresh flowers!

495
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,500
I wanted them to be red.

496
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,500
I know.
They're the red ones left.

497
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,740
Richard!

498
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,540
Red roses!

499
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,260
I put them somewhere
very special.

500
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,060
How was lunch? Amusing?

501
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,820
Hugh was there. He's "rely"
is getting quite intolerable.

502
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,700
She wants him to write
a letter to The Times.

503
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,220
One of her schemes
to put in the world in order.

504
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,980
What's all this?

505
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,580
Richard, you couldn't have forgotten!
It's for my party!

506
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,940
And now, it will all be spoiled.

507
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,100
Come here.

508
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,540
Let's sit down for five minutes.

509
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,140
Why would it all be spoiled?

510
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Ms. Marsham has just
sent me this note to say...

511
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,940
that she's quite sure
I wouldn't mind...

512
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,580
she's invited Ellie Henderson.
What's so dreadful about that?

513
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,020
Richard! She's one of the dullest
women in the world.

514
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,860
She'll bore everyone. And than Elizabeth said
she isn't coming to the party tonight.

515
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,940
She's gone off to pray
with that dreadful Mrs. Kilman.

516
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,980
You worry too much
about your parties, Clarissa.

517
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,460
Richard, it's all that I can do.

518
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,700
Give people one night
in which everything seems enchanted...

519
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,500
when all the women seem beautiful,
all the men are handsome...

520
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,340
and everyone's made to feel
they're amusing...

521
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,780
Yes, liked.

522
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,700
And go home thinking:
"Ah, what fun it was!"

523
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,900
"What a wonderful evening!"
"How good it is to be alive!"

524
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,340
I don't think poor old Ellie Henderson
could put a stop to that.

525
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,340
You're laughing at me.
Not in the least.

526
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,580
Richard!
You're so much nicer than I am.

527
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,380
You should never have
married me.

528
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,180
Then what would you've done?
Married Peter Walsh, I suppose.

529
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,740
Would you believe that
he was here this morning?

530
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,980
Yes, Minnie Bruton
tell me he was in town.

531
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,740
He's in love with some
woman in India.

532
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,700
He's here to see about
the divorce.

533
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,700
He's just the same.
He hasn't changed the slightest.

534
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,980
You choose a cake, sir.
Thank you.

535
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,940
Did you understand what
the Reverend was saying this morning...

536
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,140
about knowidge
coming out from suffering?

537
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,940
Not really, no.
But than...

538
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,740
I suppose I haven't really suffered
yet.

539
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,420
Maybe you'll never will.

540
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,820
Not that I wish that one.

541
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:28,140
But as he says, real
knowledge is only gained thru suffering.

542
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,380
What was you wanted to buy here?

543
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,900
A petticoat. Mine is in shreds,
I hung on to it as long as I could.

544
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,380
They have some pretty striped ones.

545
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,140
I couldn't possibly
afford the striped ones.

546
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,820
I might have to go to the party tonight.

547
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,860
I've forgotten all about it when I
said I'll help with the mission.

548
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,340
Mommy will be upset
if I don't go.

549
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,220
It's a great pity that women like your
mother have nothing better to do...

550
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,460
with their time than get parties.

551
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,980
Oh, I know it's not her fault.

552
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,540
Women like your mother can't help it
if they'll been spoiled.

553
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,220
She likes giving parties.
I never go to parties.

554
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,980
Why should they ask me?
I'm plain...

555
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,140
I'm unhappy. But I don't pity
myself. I pity other people more.

556
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,140
Your bill, madam.

557
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,740
You finish your tea.
I pay to set the desk.

558
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,580
I'll help another night at the mission.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

559
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,660
Fear not.

560
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,660
Fear no more.

561
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,180
Who you making that hat for?
Mrs. Filmore's married daughter.

562
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,220
And what's the name of Mrs. Filmore's
married daughter? Mrs. Peters.

563
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,420
I don't like it, but Mrs. Filmore
has been so good to us.

564
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,380
That's too small for Mrs. Peters.
She's enormous.

565
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,700
That's an organ grinding
monkey's hat.

566
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,700
There.

567
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,420
Now, the poor woman looks
like a pig at the fair.

568
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,100
Come on, let's see what else you
have in your workbox.

569
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,540
She shall have a beautiful hat.

570
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,460
There. Now, stitch that together
very, very carefully.

571
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,860
Evans?

572
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,780
Mrs. Filmore, I shall be to busy
looking after Septimus.

573
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,660
It will take a long time.
We thank you for the paper.

574
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,940
Evans?

575
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,940
It was only the evening paper.
Mrs Filmore with the evening paper.

576
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,540
They going to take me away, Rezia.

577
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,380
Sir William Bradshaw said that
you must learn to rest.

578
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,660
It's "must". "Must".

579
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,340
Why "must"? What right has he
to say "must" to me?

580
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,660
It is because you talk
of killing yourself.

581
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,100
So...

582
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,100
I'm in their power.

583
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,580
Where are my writings, Rezia?

584
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,900
Burn them!
Some are very beautiful!

585
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,900
I'm going with you, Septimus. They can't
separate us against our will.

586
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,620
You're a flowering tree.

587
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,140
You're a sanctuary.

588
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,980
You fear no more!

589
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,260
Not Holmes, not Bradshaw.

590
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,300
You've triumphed.

591
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,020
I'm going to pack our things,
Septimus.

592
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,140
I shall tie this with silk
and hide them away.

593
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,820
Good afternoon, Mrs. Filmore.
Good afternoon, dr.

594
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,740
They send Holmes.
I won't let him come in here.

595
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,780
Ms. Warrensmith, Sir William Bradshaw
is a physician of up most integrity.

596
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,180
He promised not to send you.
Is your husband upstairs?

597
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,700
Look! I will not allow.
It is the law.

598
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,220
Please, go away.
I can not allow you.

599
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,740
Leave my husband alone,
I beg you.

600
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,180
Mr. Warrensmith!

601
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,580
You want my life?

602
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,380
I'll give it to you.

603
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,820
God
God!

604
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,660
Why the devil did he do it?

605
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,380
One of the triumphs
of modern civilization.

606
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,060
Good afternoon.

607
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,300
I'm 12, please.

608
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,060
Thank you.
This came for you, Mr. Walsh.

609
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,780
Thank you.

610
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,500
Thank you.

611
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:13,020
" Peter, it was heavenly to see you,
I must tell you that. Clarissa. "

612
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,420
We could play tennis.

613
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,980
No. It's too hot
and scorchy for tennis.

614
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,620
Beside,
we need a fourth person to play doubles.

615
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,500
Hugh's gone to visit his mother.
And Herbert won't play.

616
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,580
Maybe "My name is Dalloway"
will turn up.

617
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,900
In his perfect whites
matching his perfect teeth.

618
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,860
"My name is Dalloway".

619
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,660
I think we've had enough of
that feeble joke.

620
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,540
She can't be
serious about him!

621
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,700
I'm gonna have this out.

622
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,100
You've come to an understanding
with Dalloway, haven't you?

623
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:30,420
Haven't you?

624
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,740
It's so difficult, Peter.

625
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:39,300
Just tell me the truth.

626
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,100
Tell me the truth.

627
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,980
Tell me the truth!

628
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,580
He makes me feel safe.
Safe? Is that what you want?

629
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,220
You want so much of me, Peter.
I just can't do it!

630
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,780
Throw everything away
and go across the world with you.

631
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,300
I'm just not brave in that way.
And Richard...

632
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,620
and Richard will pamper you

633
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,380
and keep you in a perfectly
beautiful safe prison...

634
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:13,820
filled with flowers and stuffed
with elegant antique furniture.

635
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,700
He'll make all the decisions for you
and you'll  never have to think again.

636
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:20,780
You demand so much from me!
Because I love you, for God's sake!

637
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,860
Richard will leave me room,
room to breath.

638
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:32,500
Clarissa, he is a fool!

639
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,940
And unimaginative,
dull fool!

640
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,500
You want to much of me, Peter.
I can't give it.

641
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,980
So, it's no use.

642
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,420
This is the end.

643
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,820
I'm sorry, Peter.
Clarissa!

644
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,900
Clarissa! Clarissa!

645
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:33,380
Lord Lexham.
Lord Lexham.

646
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,220
How delightful to see you.

647
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,220
I'm so sorry, but my dear wife
has a cold.

648
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,220
Oh, dear!

649
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,780
She simply would not wear her furs to
the garden party at Buckhurst.

650
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,260
And it was bitterly cold.
Richard!

651
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,460
Oh, dear! It's going to be a failure.
A complete failure.

652
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,620
How delightful of you to come.
Lovely to see you.

653
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,180
We're delighted to see you.
I'm glad you could come.

654
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,220
Why do I do it?

655
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:09,780
How lovely of you to come.
It was nice of you to invite me.

656
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,220
Mr. Peter Walsh.

657
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:19,980
Peter, you came!
How delightful to see you.

658
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,580
Peter! Back from India, right?

659
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,660
Yes, back from India.
Must be years since we've seen you.

660
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,700
It was a mistake to invite him.
You'll all know

661
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,180
when he's sorry to come.

662
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,460
And he's criticizing me.
I know he is.

663
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:40,580
Accusing me of being insincere.
Why do I do this things?

664
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:44,660
Why seek pinnacles
and stand drenched in fire?

665
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,220
I feel burned to a cinder.

666
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,380
Miss Henderson.

667
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,900
Better that...than
to brindle away like Ellie Henderson.

668
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,460
Ellie! I'm so glad you've come.
It's so grand!

669
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,020
Oh, dear! Why can she at least
stand up properly!

670
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,180
Well, well, I suppose
it's her weaponless state.

671
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,020
Wonderful to see you again.

672
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,860
Richard, how lovely.

673
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,700
Their graces, the Duke
and Duchess of Marlborough.

674
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,860
A duke?

675
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,300
Oh, why did the Marlboroughs
have to follow Ellie Henderson?

676
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,900
They must wonder what kind
of people I invite to our parties.

677
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,380
Clarissa, how lovely to see you.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

678
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,700
Bertie, how lovely of you to come.

679
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:38,220
It's a disaster! The party is
a disaster! I'm humiliated!

680
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,940
And now there's Peter wondering off.
I'm speak to him!

681
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:48,140
I know I get the chance, I know it.
Why's he like dirt? He thinks I'm absurd.

682
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:55,180
Oh, it's too much of an effort!
I'm not enjoying it at all.

683
01:11:55,180 --> 01:12:00,220
I feel like a stake
driven in on the top of this stairs.

684
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,580
Clarissa.
Delighted to see you.

685
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,660
Mr. Hugh Whitbread.
How did you find Evelyn today?

686
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:10,660
Bearing up, bearing up.
I shall visit her tomorrow.

687
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,300
I do hope she doesn't read
Lady Azquez's memories.

688
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,060
Oh, I doubt it.
Not Evelyn, she's not a great reader.

689
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:23,260
Lady Bruton.
Lady Bruton? So she came...

690
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,220
My dear Clarissa.

691
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,180
Maybe she doesn't dislike me as much
as I thought she did.

692
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:30,620
The essential condition
for a study of Milton...

693
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,220
an  in depth study of Milton...

694
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:37,180
A momentary sensation
of an embrace!

695
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,220
It's not a failure, after all!
It's going to be allright.

696
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:50,220
It's still touch and go,
but it's begun. My party has begun!

697
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:59,380
Lady Rosseter.
Lady Rosseter? Who I ask can that be?

698
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,020
Clarissa!

699
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,060
Sally
That voice!

700
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,980
Sally Seaton.

701
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:11,500
Goodness! She didn't look like that
when she kissed me by the fountain.

702
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:18,540
How wonderful to see you!
How extraordinary to see her again!

703
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,220
She's older, she's happier,
but less lovely.

704
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:27,780
But, oh, how wonderful that
she's come to my party.

705
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:33,260
Sally, I've been thinking about
Bordon all day.

706
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,020
Have you? Have you?

707
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,860
The Prime Minister.

708
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:02,860
Oh, my goodness, Sally, I must go.
Where's Richard?

709
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:06,500
Sorry, Ellie.
Duty calls.

710
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,420
How delightful to see you.

711
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,020
Unfortunately, my
wife could not come.

712
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,100
The Prime Minister!

713
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,180
It is the Prime Minister.

714
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,340
Clarissa is looking well,
considering how ill she's been.

715
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,300
I know that Richard was very
worried about her.

716
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,900
M.P.'s wives
really shouldn't get ill.

717
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,860
I believe it was her heart.

718
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:38,580
I think you can always pull
yourself together. Mind of a matter.

719
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:44,140
Harry Audle. You painted
your wife. Lovely picture.

720
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,940
Peter!

721
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,140
Peter Walsh!

722
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:01,980
Good Lord! Sally Seaton.
Lady Rosseter now.

723
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,460
Don't be absurd.
It's true. Lady Rosseter.

724
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,860
We live in Manchester
and I have five ennormous boys.

725
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,980
Either my eyes are deceiving me,
or that's Ellie Henderson?

726
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,860
It's our old vicar's daughter.
She's gaping at the Prime Minister.

727
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,700
Oh, do bring her over,
before she disgraces herself...

728
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,220
and faints with astonishment.

729
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:35,100
Mr. Prime Minister, how nice to see you.
What would you like?

730
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:39,060
She's always looked delicate to me.
But such charm.

731
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,500
Richard would've done a great deal better,
if he'd married a woman...

732
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:45,820
with less charm and more backbone.
It would've helped him in his work.

733
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,060
He's lost his chance in the Cabinet.

734
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,020
Lady Bruton and Lady Beckford.

735
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,460
What a pleasure to see you.

736
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,220
Lord, what snobbs the english are!

737
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:03,100
How they love dressing up
and doing homage. Listen to them!

738
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,420
I'd better have baboons chattering
and coolies beat their wives.

739
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,540
Still the same old Peter.
Still playing with your pocket knife.

740
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,780
It is delicious, isn't it?

741
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:24,820
We are not all the same, Peter. My husband
may have his own cotton mill now,

742
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,700
but he was a miner's son
and when he...

743
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:34,620
Oh, look! Look!
Isn't that Hugh Whitbread?

744
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:39,420
What a toady!
What an obsequious toady!

745
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,940
He's not changed at all.

746
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,300
How can she bear him?

747
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,220
It still makes you angry!

748
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,060
Look at her. Intoxicated, while they
all're thinking she's brilliant.

749
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:59,700
Don't be too hard on her. After all,
parties are a kind of performance.

750
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,940
She has to give a performance.
It isn't the real Clarissa.

751
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,260
The real Clarissa was lost
years ago.

752
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,300
Mr. Prime Minister, can I
introduce our daughter.

753
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,060
I'm sure, if you were alone with her,
you'll find the old Clarissa again.

754
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,740
Fat chance of that this evening!

755
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,860
Richard so enjoyed your lunch and party.

756
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,940
Richard was most encouraging.
And he's promised to drop my little idea...

757
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,260
into the right ear.

758
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:31,820
He and the Prime Minister are having
a quiet word now before he leaves.

759
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,140
My plan will save
the government a fortune.

760
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:38,260
Maybe Richard is sowing
the seeds this very minute.

761
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,020
Isn't that Peter Walsh
talking to old Mrs. Perry?

762
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,180
Yes, that's Peter.

763
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,380
Dear Peter.
So very sharp and clever...

764
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:53,700
sure had made a name for himself. But
he's allways in some trouble with women.

765
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,100
Do come and say hello to him!

766
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:02,580
Now, Peter, we can get it straight
from the horse's mouth.

767
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,700
What is going on in India?

768
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,500
Well, great deal, Lady Bruton.
Is a very complex issue.

769
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,020
It is a tragedy.

770
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,580
If my father, the general,
would be alive, he'll sort it out.

771
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,860
Hay, Mrs. Perry.

772
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,780
Clarissa, I must speak
with you, please...

773
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,260
Peter, I must go and deal
with Sir William and Lady Bradshaw.

774
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,500
Will talk later.
I promise.

775
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,740
Awfully good of you to come.

776
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:38,620
We are shockingly late.
We hardly dared to come in.

777
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,620
We couldn't resist the temptation.

778
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:46,220
But a rather sad occurrence held us up.
A young patient of mine killed himself.

779
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:49,300
Really, Richard, there must be
some provision...

780
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:52,300
in the government's bill for
this cases of delayed shell shock.

781
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:57,740
Yes, poor young man.
Awarded for bravery during the war.

782
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:02,180
And than this evening he just throws himself
out of the window. Impaled on the railings.

783
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,700
It's quite upset William.

784
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,740
She looks like a sea lion
barking at me.

785
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,660
Dear William. He does so hate
losing a patient.

786
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,700
When a young man's body is blown appart,
he loses an arm or a leg...

787
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,300
or half of face,
as we've seen so often it.

788
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,340
It's immediate.

789
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:21,380
Stop it! Stop it! Don't talk of death
in the middle of my party!

790
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,180
I don't like you.
I've never liked you.

791
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,860
You're obscurely evil.

792
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,860
And the poor creature will either
survive or he won't, but we all know...

793
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:30,900
and we do our best for him.

794
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,180
A young man came to you
on the edge of  insanity...

795
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,540
and you forced his soul...

796
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:41,020
made his life intolerable
and he killed himself.

797
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:45,420
Stucked there with lobs... It's frightful...
Every single mother does everything...

798
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,100
If you'll excuse me,
lady Bradshaw...

799
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,500
I have to...
Alice!

800
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,980
The problem is that politicians
are not really...

801
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:15,820
very interested in shell shock.
This is it. This is exactly it.

802
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:33,300
Hello, Henry, Eleonore.
Delightful to see you.

803
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:41,380
I see that sir William Bradshaw
is just arrived.

804
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:45,820
I think it would be most useful to bring
him in on your emigration scheme.

805
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:49,380
I know he's treating many of this
fellows from shell shock or whatever.

806
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,860
I'm sure, he'll think it's a good idea
to get some of them to Canada.

807
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:56,300
Open air life and all that...
excellent for mental disturbance.

808
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,100
What a good idea, Hugh.

809
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,940
She's disappeared.

810
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,540
Do you think she went upstairs?
She can't have gone to bed, can't she?

811
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,860
No. She couldn't leave
her own party.

812
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,340
I don't know. I don't know.
I didn't know she'd been ill.

813
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,380
Stop worrying, Peter.

814
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:30,340
He threw himself out of the window
and impaled himself on the railings.

815
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,700
Up flashed the ground
and through him...

816
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:37,660
blundering and bruising
went the rusty spikes...

817
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,380
and there he lay with a tut... tut! tut!
in his brain.

818
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:45,020
and then
a suffocation of blackness.

819
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:48,860
Why? Why did he do it?

820
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:52,300
Why did the Bradshaws talked
of it at my party?

821
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:57,540
He's thrown it all away. His life.
Just like that.

822
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,660
I once throw a shelling
into the serpentine.

823
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,420
But his thrown his life away.

824
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,300
You were going to write,
I remember.

825
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,180
Have you written anything?

826
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:20,100
Not a word.

827
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,700
Not a solitary word.

828
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:31,500
But then he will
always stay young.

829
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:38,460
All day long I've been thinking
of Bordon, of Peter and Sally.

830
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,180
We've grown old.

831
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,900
We'll grow older.

832
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:00,060
Have I lost the thing
that mattered?

833
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,620
Let it get obscured,
gradually...

834
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:09,180
every day in corruption,
lies and chatter?

835
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:19,700
Do you remember the night
we went boating on the lake?

836
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,020
Yes, I remember thinking:
"She's abandoned me."

837
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:34,100
And then, all of the sudden, she was
there, with her hand stretched out...

838
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:38,420
looking utterly beautiful, saying:
"Come on, come on.

839
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,700
They're all waiting. "

840
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,420
Why wouldn't she marry me,
Sally?

841
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,220
She was afraid.

842
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:03,220
Your parents just handed to you,
LIFE...

843
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,620
to be lived right through to the end.

844
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,420
We must walk it
serenely.

845
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,380
But in the depths of my heart,
there's been an awful fear...

846
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,340
sometimes that
I couldn't go on...

847
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:19,220
without Richard, sitting there
calmly reading the Times...

848
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:23,820
while I crouched like a bird
and gradually revived.

849
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,780
I might have perished.

850
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:33,620
I looked across the room
and wondered - "Who's that lovely girl?"

851
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,540
And then I realized:
"That's my daughter."

852
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:43,300
Maybe she needed someone
who found life simple.

853
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:48,540
She certainly cared for you,
more than she cared for Richard.

854
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:51,860
Oh, my life isn't simple.

855
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,060
My relationship with her
wasn't simple.

856
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:01,980
She broke my heart.

857
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,980
And you can't love like that
twice.

858
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,740
What makes us go on?

859
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,540
What sends roaring
up in us...

860
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,740
that immeasurable delight
to surprise us?

861
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,500
Than nothing can be
slow enough...

862
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,620
nothing lasts to long.

863
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:28,380
You want to say to each moment:
"Stay!" "Stay!"

864
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,220
"Stay!"

865
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,940
I cherrish the friendship
I had with Clarissa.

866
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,860
There was something pure about her.

867
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:58,500
She had such charm,
such generosity.

868
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:02,460
I can see her to this day, going
bye the house all in white.

869
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:07,460
She always seemed to be in white
and her arms were full of flowers.

870
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:09,540
And I wondered...

871
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,740
does absence really matter?

872
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,980
Does distance?

873
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,780
You'll think me sentimental
and so I am...

874
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:25,820
but I've come to believe that the only
thing worth saying is what you really feel.

875
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,980
But I don't know what I feel.

876
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:36,300
I know that I loved her once and that
it stayed with me all my life...

877
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,500
and colored everything.

878
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:45,300
I must go back to my party.
To Sally and Peter.

879
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,420
That young man killed himself,
but I don't pity him.

880
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,460
I'm somehow glad he could do it,
throw it away.

881
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,860
It's made me feel the beauty,
somehow feel...

882
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:04,340
very like him, less afraid.

883
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,620
I have to go.

884
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:24,340
Do you think he's made her happy?
Who can tell, Peter?

885
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,140
All our relationships are
just scratches on the surface.

886
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,460
We tought he wasn't
very bright.

887
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,020
But what does the brain matter?

888
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,380
Compared to the heart.

889
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,940
There you are.

890
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:29,220
Peter and Sally haven't left, have they?
Don't know.

891
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:31,500
Clarissa!

892
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,260
I couldn't leave without
saying goodbye.

893
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:40,980
And you can't leave,
until you danced with me.

894
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,780
Peter's in the library.

895
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,740
Here I am, at last.
