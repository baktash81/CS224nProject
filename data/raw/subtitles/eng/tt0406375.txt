1
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,086
Oh, man.

2
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,885
That's it.

3
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,930
Nice grab.

4
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,518
Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,107
- All right, Danny, your turn.
- What? I didn't get my full turn.

6
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,777
You did. I counted.
That was 25. That's what we said.

7
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,653
- That's not fair.
- It's exactly fair.

8
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,115
Come on, Danny. Time for your turn,
then I gotta work for an hour.

9
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,910
You're not the only one
who gets a turn.

10
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
"The only one who gets a turn."

11
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,372
Guys.

12
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,332
All right.

13
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,087
Keep your eye on the ball.
You got it this time. Ready?

14
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,218
All right, that's a good try.
It was a bad throw. It's a bad throw.

15
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,137
Sorry. My bad.

16
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,266
Okay. Here we go.
You can do this.

17
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,644
Here we go. Ready?

18
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,063
Okay.

19
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,982
A deep fly ball to right field.

20
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,069
Clemente back,
running on his horse real fast.

21
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,113
Can he get it? Can he get it?

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,408
Oh, and Milton Bradley with
his dive-and-roll catch.

23
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,744
- Dodgers win.
- You're such a dick.

24
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,167
What? It was a great grab.

25
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:20,426
Danny?

26
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,607
Danny, you should not be using that
kind of language with your brother.

27
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,735
But it's true.

28
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,113
Listen, kiddo,
when I was 6 years old...

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,116
- Six and three quarters.
- When I was 6 and three quarters...

30
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,452
...catching was hard for me too.

31
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, it's not hard for Walter.

32
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,372
Well, Walter's 10.

33
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,708
So? He's still better than me
at everything.

34
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,003
No way.
He's not better than you at piano.

35
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,213
I hate that stupid thing.

36
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,843
Someday you're gonna be
really happy I got you that piano.

37
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,306
- You'll be at a party, there'll be a girl...
- Like you and Mom?

38
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,980
Look, Danny...

39
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,982
...you and Walter
are different people.

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,236
He's good at some things, you're good
at other things. That's how people are.

41
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,739
He beats me at everything.

42
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,575
Listen to me, this is important.

43
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,286
You're a very special kid.

44
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,749
That's what people say
when they can't think of anything.

45
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,834
You know how you always
make up games...

46
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,504
...and pretend to be characters?

47
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,548
You have an incredible imagination.

48
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,096
Amazing imagination.
A whole universe of an imagination.

49
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,767
And I use my imagination for a living,
so I know what I'm talking about.

50
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,271
- Is it better than Walter's?
- What?

51
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,817
Is my imagination better
than Walter's?

52
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,782
You're different than Walter.

53
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,958
- Don't do that.
- You wanna play catch?

54
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,127
- We just played catch.
- No, football catch.

55
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,712
I have to work for an hour.

56
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,173
- But it's Saturday.
- Tell me about it.

57
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,303
- All you ever do is work.
- Nice try.

58
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
- This is so unfair.
- Hello.

59
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,474
Bill, I am so sorry.

60
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,477
I'll call you back in two minutes.
Is that okay?

61
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,895
Thanks.

62
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,982
I have an important meeting
this afternoon.

63
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,277
- I've... I really have to be ready for it.
- You're going out?

64
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,988
Yes, I'm going out.
Well, I'm going to a meeting.

65
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,074
You're gonna be at Mom's house.
She's coming to get you at 3.

66
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,576
We go to Mom's tomorrow.

67
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,953
- No, today.
- This is a four-day Dad week.

68
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,913
Three-day Dad week.
Four-day last week...

69
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,749
...four-day next week,
three-day this week.

70
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,542
Four-day Mom week this week.

71
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,461
But that's not fair.

72
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,338
- To whom?
- To anyone.

73
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,672
I have to work.

74
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,675
We'd have all the time
if Danny wasn't around.

75
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,719
Well, Danny is around.

76
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,014
All right, five throws.

77
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,225
How do I put this? Let me think.
I have to work.

78
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
Dad, I'm ready to play
"Smash Bros."

79
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,022
You told him you'd play
"Smash Bros."?

80
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,524
I didn't tell him I was gonna
play "Smash Bros."

81
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,944
- You're playing catch with Walter?
- He might if you weren't around.

82
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,405
You're so mean.
Everybody wants to ruin my life.

83
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,366
You never keep your promises.

84
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,117
There's only one of me, okay?

85
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,829
I don't like this situation either,
it sucks, is what it does...

86
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,040
...but it's the best I could
come up with.

87
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,211
So climb off my back and give me
about two inches of space, will you?

88
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:04,692
There are some days, boys,
when you gotta grow up all at once.

89
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,736
I need today to be
one of those days.

90
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,330
Wanna play Chutes and Ladders?

91
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,749
No, you'll cheat.

92
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,584
Stratego?

93
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,254
No, you cheat at board games.

94
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,923
But you can't even cheat at Stratego.

95
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,717
Trust me, you'll find a way.

96
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,261
Hey. Sorry about that.

97
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,679
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

98
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,348
I'm not meeting him till 3:30,
I can finish by then.

99
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,183
Walter, look what I found.

100
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,269
Those belong to me. Put them back.

101
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,396
But you never play with them.

102
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,356
So? They're still mine.

103
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,608
When did you get so mean?

104
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,193
I'm not mean, Danny.

105
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,529
I'm in fourth grade,
I have a girlfriend.

106
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,614
You know how Dad said
we have to grow up?

107
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,450
Well, this is what it looks like.

108
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,286
Can we please play "Army Men"?

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,250
Copy that.

110
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,879
Sergeant, there is a helicopter on fire.
Let's get it.

111
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,964
The drawings all match
the foam mock-up.

112
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,632
- Get back here.
- Let me hold it.

113
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,634
- Yes, red.
- Give me.

114
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,220
Cranberry, right.
It's whatever color they picked.

115
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,638
I worked from the chits.

116
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,310
Can I call you back one more time?
It's a small domestic emergency here.

117
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,062
I... I... I know. I know.

118
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,814
- Dad.
- It's not a problem. Okay, thanks.

119
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,983
- Look what he did.
- I was on the phone.

120
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,486
- It was an accident.
- You're such a baby.

121
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,571
- I'm not a baby.
- You break all my stuff.

122
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,573
- You can't catch a ball...
- Enough.

123
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,909
...and nobody wants you around.
- You shut up!

124
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

125
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

126
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,879
It's 10 minutes to the office.

127
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,173
I have to run off another copy.
I'll be back.

128
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,842
You're gonna leave us alone
in this creepy old house?

129
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,345
- It's not creepy, it's old.
- I like Mom's better.

130
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,430
Well, so did she, and now it's hers.

131
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,022
Look, this is a very special house.

132
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,276
The reason I'm working to fix it up
is I wanna make a home for us here.

133
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,613
I know it's not Mom's house,
and I know it's a little creaky...

134
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,449
...but give it some time,
it's gonna grow on you.

135
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,201
I don't wanna stay here alone.

136
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,621
Well, you're not gonna be alone.
I'm going to wake up Lisa.

137
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,873
- Don't wake up Lisa.
- What, are you crazy?

138
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,959
She's sleeping. Let her sleep.

139
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,545
Honey.

140
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,047
Lisa. Honey.

141
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,799
Get up.

142
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:38,053
I need to go out. I need you to
look after your two favorite people.

143
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,597
Come on.

144
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,227
I can't. I have a date tonight.

145
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,937
What time?

146
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,148
We're hooking up at, like, 8.

147
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,735
- It's 2.
- So?

148
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,529
- So that's six hours from now.
- What's your point?

149
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,072
I need you to look after the boys.

150
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,075
By the way, it makes me uncomfortable
when you say "hooking up."

151
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Why? It's not like it means anything.

152
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,914
- Hope it doesn't.
- It doesn't. It's just an expression.

153
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,834
- Hope it is.
- It is. God.

154
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,086
We never should have
rented Thirteen.

155
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,840
Keep your eye on them. Make sure
they don't burn down the house.

156
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,551
- Okay?
- I'm not deaf.

157
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,887
- I'm not deaf.
- What?

158
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,305
Dad, okay.

159
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,016
Fifteen minutes, just close the door.

160
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,769
Thank you.

161
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,284
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am.

162
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,119
Yeah, hold on.

163
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,978
Hey!

164
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,980
Dad said no video games.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,316
He did not.

166
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,443
Fine.

167
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,658
It's a giraffe.

168
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,500
- This is SportsCenter.
- Hey.

169
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,460
I was watching that.

170
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,172
It is Oakland. It is Boston.
It is Manny Ramirez.

171
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,967
- Can't we watch SpongeBob?
- No.

172
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,970
- You used to like it.
- Times change.

173
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,139
Tartar sauce.

174
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,515
I'm hungry.

175
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,392
What do you want me
to do about it?

176
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,310
Make me macaroni and cheese?

177
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,687
I don't know how.

178
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,856
I'm hungry.
What do you know how to make?

179
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,524
Water.

180
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,694
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

181
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,738
Next batter, Jason Varitek.

182
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,783
In the air to deep right field.
Down the line, towards the pole.

183
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,455
- How about if you and me play catch?
- No.

184
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,544
The first guy to give up
walk-off home runs...

185
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,714
...on consecutive days since 1998.

186
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,966
Bo Sox win it 6 to 5.

187
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,727
History-making moment for...

188
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,229
You're dead!

189
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,607
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

190
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,668
Danny?

191
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,963
Where are you?

192
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,095
Danny?

193
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,182
Where are you, Danny?

194
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,979
Danny?

195
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,816
Where are you?

196
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,070
- There you are.
- I said I was sorry.

197
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,115
Don't. No.

198
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,786
- Don't do that, it's not funny.
- You'll be safe here till Dad gets back.

199
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:34,873
You're just jealous because
Dad thinks I'm smarter than you.

200
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,459
I didn't mean that.

201
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:43,882
Walter. No. Pull me up. Don't.

202
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,300
What's the matter, Danny?

203
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,137
Not still scared of the basement,
are you?

204
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,223
Walter! No, Walter!

205
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,058
It's not funny! No!

206
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,813
Pull me up! Walter!

207
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,816
Three-year-olds
are scared of basements.

208
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,248
You're really mean.

209
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,084
Dad said not to play in there.

210
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,506
Look what I found in the basement.

211
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,800
Looks dumb and old.

212
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,927
I like it.

213
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,971
Yeah, you would, it's for babies.

214
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,481
Walter, this is so cool.
Check this out.

215
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,784
What's Zathura?

216
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,007
- Will you play with me?
- No.

217
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,843
- I won't cheat.
- Yeah, you will.

218
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,548
- A card came out.
- Fascinating.

219
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,220
"Me... Mete...

220
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,724
Meor sho...

221
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,394
Meeor sh... sho..."

222
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,396
Read this for me.

223
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,151
"Meteor shower.
Take evasive action."

224
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,861
What's evasive action?

225
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,612
It's when you get out of the way.

226
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,158
What exactly am I supposed to
get out of the way of, exactly?

227
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,411
I have no idea.
All it says is "Take evasive a..."

228
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,937
Grandma.

229
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,780
It's meteors!

230
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:03,243
Take evasive action!

231
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,228
Danny, in here.

232
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,729
Danny, hurry up. It's safe.

233
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,272
Danny, come on. Hurry.

234
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,899
Danny, come on, hurry up.

235
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,444
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on. Get in, get in.

236
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,670
This is SportsCenter.

237
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,465
Schilling deals no love...

238
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,742
I don't think we should play
that game anymore.

239
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,886
That's weird.

240
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:47,014
It only hit the living room.

241
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,617
Wow, outer space.

242
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,369
No, that's just nighttime.

243
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,166
I don't know, Walter.
Night never looked so close before.

244
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,716
Wait.

245
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,391
Walter, check this out.

246
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,481
- Tell her.
- You tell her.

247
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,524
You should,
she won't freak out as much.

248
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,485
We shouldn't really even be in here.

249
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,820
Dude, we're in outer space.
It doesn't matter.

250
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,530
Then you wake her.

251
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,366
Fine.

252
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,993
Lisa.

253
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,537
Lisa. Lisa...

254
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,165
- Go away.
- Lisa, you gotta get up.

255
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,167
What's the rule about
being in my room?

256
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,336
We're not allowed
unless it's an emergency.

257
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,380
And what's the emergency?

258
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,216
There was a meteor shower
and everything got wrecked.

259
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,385
- We can't get back to Earth.
- Shut up!

260
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,553
- Just look.
- Yeah.

261
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,392
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

262
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,435
It's already dark?
I'm gonna be so late.

263
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,396
- It's not dark.
- We're in outer space.

264
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,898
I saw Saturn outside.

265
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,235
Lisa, open up.

266
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,529
Shut up and listen to me.

267
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:50,614
Dad put me in charge
until he got home.

268
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,783
Which means you guys
need to do what I say.

269
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,494
Do me a favor. Go downstairs
and stay out of my face.

270
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,912
But it's an emergency.

271
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,747
- Is the house on fire?
- No.

272
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,416
- Is anyone hurt?
- No, but...

273
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,334
- Then leave.
- Lisa, please.

274
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,421
We're really scared. Can you just
watch what this game does?

275
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,677
lf this is some weird joke you guys
are trying to pull, you're dead.

276
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,137
No, it's not a joke.

277
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,597
Here, watch this. Watch this. Here.

278
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:19,184
- Okay. So wind the key.
- All right.

279
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,520
- So now I'm winding the key.
- Yeah, see?

280
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,689
- And then push the button.
- So I push it?

281
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,107
- Yeah.
- Pushing the button.

282
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,193
Then the number winds,
and whatever the number is, like nine.

283
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,945
Then your ship... The blue ship...

284
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,448
...because the red ship is mine,
I got a five.

285
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:36,201
So then it goes to nine,
which would be that thing.

286
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,370
- All right.
- Then the card's gonna pop out.

287
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,580
- The card.
- The card.

288
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,457
- The card!
- The card!

289
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,625
- The card.
- Here's the scary part.

290
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,295
"You're promoted to
a starship captain.

291
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:47,921
Move ahead two spaces."

292
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,550
Fascinating.

293
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,844
- Lisa, no, no! Lisa!
- No, wait, Lisa!

294
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:57,097
Wait, that one didn't count.
Let me go. Let me go. Here. Okay.

295
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,393
It's stuck.

296
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,480
Maybe we have to take turns.

297
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,648
See? It was my turn.

298
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,026
- Four.
- Yeah, four.

299
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,823
Card.

300
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,329
"Shipmate enters cryonic
sleep chamber for five turns."

301
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,498
What the heck does that mean?

302
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,138
Lisa?

303
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,016
Does "cryonic" mean ice?

304
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,018
Lisa.

305
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,439
Help.

306
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,052
I killed her.

307
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,595
You didn't kill her.

308
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:21,140
She's frozen in cryonic sleep.

309
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,227
I gotta melt her.

310
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,412
Are you crazy?

311
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,414
We can't just leave her here
like this.

312
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,334
Maybe we should read
the instructions.

313
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,883
"Zathura.
Attention, space adventurers.

314
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,676
Zathura awaits.

315
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,179
Do you have what it takes
to navigate the galaxy?

316
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,264
It's not for the faint of heart.

317
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,183
For once you embark
upon your journey...

318
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,602
...there's no turning back
until Zathura's reached.

319
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,729
Pieces reset
at the end of each game.

320
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,440
Play again and again
for different adventures."

321
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,193
That's it. We gotta keep playing.

322
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,236
I'm not playing that thing.

323
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,864
Yes, we are.
It says we go home if we win.

324
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,866
It... It didn't say that.

325
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,619
Yes, it did. "Pieces reset
at the end of each game."

326
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,788
That means we go home
when we're finished.

327
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,708
All I know is that when we play
this game, bad things happen.

328
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,211
All I know is that when I played,
I got promoted.

329
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,171
So I'm gonna win this
and get us home.

330
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,090
- Wait, can we...?
- Don't be a baby.

331
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,549
I'm not a baby.

332
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,809
Look, eight, I'm halfway there.

333
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,409
"Your robot is defective."

334
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,160
What does that mean?

335
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,745
Means my robot's broken.

336
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,331
But you don't even have a robot.

337
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:40,320
Emergency.

338
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,163
That's your robot?

339
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,707
- At least I got one.
- Well, what does it do?

340
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,336
Anything I want.
Get me a juice box, beyotch.

341
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,546
- Don't do that.
- Why not? It's my robot.

342
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,798
- You might make it mad.
- It's 3 inches tall.

343
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,384
I'll punt it across the room.
My robot, the card says.

344
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,554
I never said it wasn't your robot.
You don't have to be a jerk.

345
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,349
Dude, you're just jealous
I have a robot and you don't.

346
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,559
- Why would I want...?
- Emergency.

347
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,355
Emergency.

348
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,451
Alien life form.

349
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,495
Must destroy.

350
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,414
Walter, I think he's talking
about you.

351
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,557
Alien life form.

352
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,642
Must destroy.

353
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,312
Danny, take your turn.

354
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:49,199
- There's no key.
- Find it.

355
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,518
Take it, take it. Come on, hurry.

356
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,878
Take your turn!

357
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,232
Why didn't you go?
I could have been killed.

358
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,527
I was scared. But it's okay,
he's gone, isn't he?

359
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,783
Danny, take your turn.

360
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,548
- Danny, give me the card.
- It's still moving.

361
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,762
Hurry up, Danny.

362
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,973
The card.

363
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,079
What did the card say?

364
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:12,361
"You pass too close to Tsouris-3.
Enter gravity field."

365
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:54,528
Danny!

366
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,156
Walter!

367
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,791
What?

368
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,048
- What happened?
- It's Lisa.

369
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,933
Is she okay?

370
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,486
Walter, do you think she's okay?

371
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,989
I guess. She's still in one piece.

372
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,784
What happened to the robot?

373
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,679
What are you doing?

374
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,973
I think it's dead.

375
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,857
Get up here.

376
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,244
Do you think the door
will hold the robot?

377
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,871
No.

378
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,415
Great.

379
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:57,878
Yeah, once he fixes himself,
we're screwed.

380
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:59,630
He's fixing himself?

381
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,423
How should I know?

382
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,686
Looks about right.

383
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,604
You think she's okay?

384
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:18,607
I don't wanna be here
when she wakes up.

385
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,984
Where are you going?

386
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:24,446
Taking my turn.

387
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:28,283
Are you crazy?
That thing's messed up.

388
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:35,624
"You're promoted to fleet admiral.
Move ahead four spaces."

389
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:47,177
- Okay, your turn.
- I'm not playing.

390
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:56,603
- What are you doing?
- Making mac and cheese.

391
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,482
There's no water, dummy,
we're in outer space.

392
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,614
Why are you doing that?

393
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,868
Because I'm hungry and I know
you're not gonna take care of me.

394
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,162
Don't bother, the gas won't work.

395
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,624
Any more advice?

396
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,210
You've gotta turn it up more.

397
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,258
Can we at least talk about this?

398
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,594
There's nothing to talk about,
I'm not going.

399
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:36,018
Danny, I just wanna go home,
and I can't unless you play.

400
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,854
Don't you wanna get home?

401
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,689
What's so great
about home, anyway?

402
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:43,692
What do you mean? Everything
was great until you came along.

403
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,028
See? You treat me
like everything's my fault.

404
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,864
You're the one who pushed the button
in the first place.

405
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:52,326
I just wanted to play
a game with you, Walter.

406
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:54,495
Fine, what do you want?

407
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,874
I want you not to be mean to me,
not ignore me...

408
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,335
...and I want you to treat me
like your brother.

409
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,380
- Fine.
- Do we have an understanding?

410
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,215
Yeah.

411
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,009
Wasn't that easy?

412
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,399
Six.

413
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,412
"You are visited by Zorgons."

414
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,081
What's a Zorgon?

415
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,584
I don't think it's bad. Just visitors.

416
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:07,943
Zorgons!

417
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,400
Maybe they're friendly.

418
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,947
They're not friendly!

419
00:42:56,868 --> 00:43:00,162
The fireplace. Hide in the fireplace.

420
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,851
Run!

421
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:39,159
Told you I didn't wanna go.
You're the one who made me spin.

422
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:40,994
There's nothing else we could do.

423
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,674
- Are you crazy?
- Got any better ideas?

424
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:08,355
"Reprogram"?
What the heck does that mean?

425
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:09,982
How am I supposed to know?

426
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:15,571
Reprogram!

427
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,757
It didn't work.

428
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,383
We'll figure it out later.

429
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,559
Go.

430
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,519
- No.
- Go.

431
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:49,229
- No!
- Go!

432
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:14,797
"Rest on standing AstroTurf."

433
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:18,801
- What?
- Rest on standing AstroTurf.

434
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,178
- Let me read it.
- No, I know how to read.

435
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:25,808
- I know how to read.
- Let me read it. God.

436
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:27,893
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

437
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,937
What stranded astronaut?

438
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,440
I guess there's gonna be some
stranded astronaut or some...

439
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,889
Did you lock the door?

440
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,017
I don't know.

441
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:58,192
Which one of you spun me?

442
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:03,572
- Who was it?
- Him.

443
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,533
Don't be so quick
to sell out your brother, kid.

444
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,410
He's all you got.

445
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,876
Looks like you got a pretty serious
Zorgon problem.

446
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,336
Yeah, what do we do?

447
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,589
- Hide.
- Hide?

448
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:23,175
They'll just explode
the whole house.

449
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,886
We're gonna hide the house.

450
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,940
Turn off all the lights
and electrical appliances.

451
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,275
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Do it.

452
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:43,779
Okay.

453
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:48,283
You. Come on,
kill that flame on the stove.

454
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:49,535
Okay.

455
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:02,548
Burning gas. That's probably what
brought them in the first place.

456
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:11,265
Okay. Now get the pilot light
on the furnace.

457
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,808
What's a pilot light?

458
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,938
In the basement.
Little blue flame under the big heater.

459
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,649
Blow it out like a candle. Like this:

460
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:18,374
Walter, the astronaut guy
is wrecking Dad's couch.

461
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,632
Come on.

462
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,223
That's Dad's nap couch.

463
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,823
You wanna help me
get this out of here?

464
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:13,637
Hit it.

465
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:16,432
- What's happening?
- Come on.

466
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,767
Take it.

467
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:22,354
Follow it.

468
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,401
There you go.

469
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:29,737
That's it.

470
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,205
Zorgons.

471
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:42,499
They're big, gnarly lizards.

472
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,752
Cold-blooded heatseekers.

473
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:49,173
And the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths.

474
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:50,841
Flying all around the galaxy...

475
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,302
...looking for anything to burn up.

476
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,637
Why don't they just burn up
their own planet?

477
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,431
Oh, they already did.

478
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,141
That's not even the worst of it.

479
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,853
The real problem
is their ravenous appetite.

480
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:04,563
They never stop eating.

481
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,148
What do they eat?

482
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:09,610
- Meat.
- That's good.

483
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,989
Dude, you're meat.

484
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,688
Are you doing this
to keep Zorgons away?

485
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,774
Nope.

486
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:53,112
I'm doing this because I've been
eating paste out of a tube for 15 years.

487
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,175
- This totally sucks.
- Why?

488
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:17,011
He's eating all our food.

489
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:20,097
So? Lupe just went shopping.

490
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,433
How long do you think
we're gonna be out here?

491
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,268
It could be weeks. Then what?

492
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,020
I don't know.

493
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:29,565
What about air? How long is it gonna
last before he breathes it all up?

494
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:34,111
- I guess.
- I'm gonna say something.

495
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,031
No, wait. Walter. Walter.

496
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,368
Dude, that's our food.

497
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:45,831
Yep. And you're running low
on supplies.

498
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:48,250
Yeah, I know. You're eating it all.

499
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:53,964
Well, as I recall, the card said,
"Rescue stranded astronaut."

500
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:57,092
Looks to me like I'm the only one
that's doing any rescuing...

501
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,013
...so I don't think a couple Dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for.

502
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,474
Dog, you're eating it all.

503
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:08,312
I passed through a time sphincter
to get here.

504
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,272
You realize how difficult that is?

505
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:12,024
What's a time sphincter?

506
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:15,277
A wormhole, about yay big:

507
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,071
You squeeze through there...

508
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:20,199
...and tell me you're not
hungry enough to eat a carpet shark.

509
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,535
Sounds like you got a long trip
ahead of you.

510
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:26,288
Oh, you telling me to leave?

511
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:30,292
Well, I mean, once you get
finished eating, yeah.

512
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:33,629
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not your call.

513
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:37,132
He spun me, so it's up to him.

514
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,806
I'm fleet admiral,
and I'm telling you to hit the road.

515
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:52,439
I apologize, sir. I didn't... I didn't
realize you were a fleet admiral.

516
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,818
In fact, I...

517
00:53:56,861 --> 00:53:58,153
I'm a fleet admiral too.

518
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,782
It's just a card, bug nuts.

519
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,993
Well, he wants you to leave too.

520
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:06,995
That true, Danny?
You want me to split?

521
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:08,997
- Of course he does.
- Hey, mouthpiece...

522
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:12,501
...let him answer, all right?
I need to hear it from the big guy.

523
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,087
Well...

524
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:17,256
Danny, tell him
you want him to leave.

525
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:20,509
Well, he did help out a little.

526
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:23,637
Help? He burned our couch
and now he's eating all our food.

527
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:25,097
You call that helping?

528
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:28,100
You know what?

529
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:31,770
I'm just gonna go.
I feel like a third wheel anyways.

530
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:35,274
I mean, you guys are such a tight,
unified team here.

531
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:40,654
You're doing great too. I gotta tell you,
the house looks fantastic.

532
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,573
So I'll just get out of your hair...

533
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:46,535
...and let you guys whomp
some more Zorgon butt without me.

534
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,537
Wait.

535
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:50,497
Whose brother are you,
his or mine?

536
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:03,635
You can stay.

537
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:09,600
Orders are orders.

538
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:12,644
Come on, admiral, your turn.

539
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,485
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

540
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:20,903
I think he can help.

541
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:31,955
Okay. Why haven't
you guys started yet?

542
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,374
We're waiting for you.

543
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,543
Okay, well, I'm here,
so turn that clockwise...

544
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:39,546
- Yeah, I know how to play the game.
- Okay.

545
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,218
Hang on a second.
Something's wrong.

546
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,427
What?

547
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:48,263
I was ahead of you.

548
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:52,434
Somebody must have
kicked the board?

549
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:53,977
No, nobody kicked the board.

550
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:55,729
- You cheated.
- No, I didn't.

551
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:57,398
You cheated.
I knew you'd cheat.

552
00:55:57,565 --> 00:55:59,942
- "Cheater's" a strong word.
- I didn't cheat.

553
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,277
- I didn't cheat!
- Guys, guys. Please.

554
00:56:02,445 --> 00:56:06,073
Bring it down. Indoor voices.
Now, did you move the piece?

555
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:12,913
Maybe I moved the piece
by an accident.

556
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,873
Okay. It was an accident.

557
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,625
How can you move a piece
by accident?

558
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:19,128
It's stuck to the game.
It's impossible. You cheated.

559
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:22,297
No, no, no, let's not use that word.
No, stop saying "cheated."

560
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:25,134
- You cheated! Cheater!
- I didn't cheat!

561
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:29,304
Come on. Okay?
Now, where did you move from?

562
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,473
I was right here.

563
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:34,643
No, you weren't.
You were back there.

564
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,603
Okay.

565
00:56:37,063 --> 00:56:38,731
Okay. Here, careful.

566
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,901
- God.
- Okay, it's fixed.

567
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,903
- You're such a baby.
- I'm not a baby.

568
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,238
Slow down. Slow down.

569
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:47,906
- I'm not a baby.
- You're a baby.

570
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:49,324
Nobody is a baby here.

571
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,493
- I am not a baby!
- You're a little baby!

572
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:53,328
I'm not a baby!

573
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,333
Jeez, it won't stop! Please.

574
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,668
Okay, let's play the game.

575
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:01,462
Fine.

576
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,012
Won't stop spinning.

577
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:14,183
- What's wrong with it?
- You broke it.

578
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:17,770
Oh, look, there's the card.
See? It fixed itself.

579
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,858
"Caught cheating.
Automatic ejection"?

580
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,487
- Does it mean me?
- Well, you did move the piece.

581
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:27,863
He's the one who cheated.

582
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:35,204
Walter!

583
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:43,545
Hang on, Walter!

584
00:57:44,255 --> 00:57:46,006
I'll save you.

585
00:57:46,925 --> 00:57:47,966
Help!

586
00:57:49,344 --> 00:57:51,887
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

587
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:01,355
I'm gonna swing
this lamp up to you...

588
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:03,857
...and you grab it,
and I'll pull you down.

589
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,359
I can't hang on any longer!

590
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,867
Don't worry, I'll get another lamp.

591
00:58:15,912 --> 00:58:17,496
Stand back.

592
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,809
Walter?

593
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:48,027
Walter.

594
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,287
Oh, no.

595
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,096
You okay?

596
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,767
Are you okay?

597
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,188
Get away from me.

598
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:28,984
Sorry.

599
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:31,528
Don't talk to me till we get home.

600
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:35,949
That look cool from down here?

601
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,410
Because up there it was...
It was pretty intense.

602
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:42,164
My heart's pumping pretty good.
That was fun.

603
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:45,626
Can you just play so I can get
out of here and get away from you?

604
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,671
- I told him I was sorry.
- Whatever.

605
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:50,422
Okay, you know what
we need to do?

606
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,341
We need to get
our heads right, okay?

607
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:55,010
Pull it together. As a team.

608
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:56,428
The three of us.

609
00:59:57,138 --> 00:59:59,473
You're up, big man. Bring us home.

610
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:02,518
I got you, buddy. I promise.

611
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,875
- What's it say?
- He can't read.

612
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,965
"Lose map of galaxy.
Go back two spaces."

613
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:48,564
I'm freezing my ass off.

614
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:52,484
Forty degrees? Those savages.

615
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,753
Yes. Nine.

616
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:14,089
- Good roll.
- Good roll?

617
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:17,009
- Nine's a great roll.
- I meant great.

618
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,555
It's gold.

619
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,271
"Shooting star.
Make a wish as it passes."

620
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:32,274
That's gotta be the best card
in the whole game.

621
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:35,444
I'm almost to the end, look.
A few more and I win.

622
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,280
I hope you win.
I don't care who wins.

623
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,616
- Because you never win at anything.
- Hey.

624
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,618
That's why he cheats,
he can never win.

625
01:01:42,786 --> 01:01:43,994
- No, I don't.
- You do.

626
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:45,746
And you almost got me killed.

627
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,582
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's not your fault?

628
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,377
How is it not your fault?
This is all your fault.

629
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,003
Everything's your fault.

630
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:54,838
It's your fault Mom and Dad
got divorced.

631
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:57,299
- Hey.
- You suck.

632
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:00,594
Danny.

633
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,771
I get my wish now, don't I?

634
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,315
Yeah.

635
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:30,499
Don't do it.

636
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:33,919
Don't do what?

637
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,838
Don't wish what you're thinking.

638
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,840
You don't know what I'm thinking.

639
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,842
Yeah, well, I can tell it ain't good.

640
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:47,599
Listen. No matter how good an idea
seems like when you're angry...

641
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,394
...it never is. You gotta trust me
on this one, Walter.

642
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,037
What'd you wish for?

643
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:10,497
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

644
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:13,375
You know the rules about wishing.
lf I told you, it won't...

645
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:14,877
Tell me what you wished for.

646
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:16,920
Get off me.

647
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,844
Danny.

648
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:37,649
The card worked.

649
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:41,236
Yeah. It worked, congratulations.

650
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:44,239
We're stuck in space now forever.

651
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:46,408
Leave him alone.

652
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,083
What did you wish for?

653
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:59,004
- This.
- You wished for a football?

654
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:01,757
Signed by Brett Favre.

655
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,592
Why'd you wish for a football?

656
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,678
You could have
just wished the game over.

657
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:07,554
You could have wished us
out of here.

658
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:11,350
I was under a lot of pressure.
He was yelling at me.

659
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,396
Why were you yelling at him?

660
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:22,486
Okay, guys.

661
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:24,530
Here's the thing.

662
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:28,742
I've played this game before.

663
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:33,247
Okay? I played it
with my own brother 15 years ago.

664
01:04:33,707 --> 01:04:37,292
- You're a player?
- Yeah. Just like you guys.

665
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:40,170
We were fighting a lot back then.

666
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:43,257
And when the game started,
it got even worse.

667
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,553
Every time we spun, we got madder
and madder at one another.

668
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:50,222
And then I landed on the star space.

669
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,266
The same one
that Walter just landed on.

670
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:58,147
Well, I was so mad at him,
that when the star passed...

671
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,108
...I made my wish.

672
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,485
What'd you wish for?

673
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,613
I wished that my brother
had never been born.

674
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:08,991
Oh, my God.

675
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:11,035
Soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

676
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:13,412
I thought, you know,
if I could spin again...

677
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:17,499
...maybe I... I could land on another
star space and... And wish him back.

678
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:19,835
But the game wouldn't let me...

679
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:22,588
...because it wasn't my turn.

680
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,299
Walter.

681
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:27,676
There are some games...

682
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,012
...you can't play alone.

683
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:32,973
So, what do we do now?

684
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:37,269
We go back downstairs and
we finish this thing once and for all.

685
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:39,855
No more cheating.
No more arguing.

686
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:43,025
All you guys have to do
is spin a few more times.

687
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:45,444
I'll help you fight off
whatever comes out.

688
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,279
Deal?

689
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,115
- Deal.
- Deal.

690
01:05:51,576 --> 01:05:52,868
Is it getting hot in here?

691
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,956
You blew out the pilot light
on the furnace, right?

692
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:05,673
Stay put.

693
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,403
Zorgons.

694
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:31,824
My gerbil was in there.

695
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:34,159
This is bad.

696
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:35,911
This is very bad.

697
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:38,831
Why? We didn't get eaten.

698
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:40,708
Where did you leave the game?

699
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:45,879
In the living room.

700
01:06:46,047 --> 01:06:47,631
Great.

701
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:51,427
The game's our only way home,
and now the Zorgons are burning it.

702
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:54,555
There is one thing we can do.

703
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,937
Waiting for an invitation?
Come on.

704
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:15,075
- Put your back into it.
- Come on.

705
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,955
Why are we doing this?

706
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:42,644
Walter?

707
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:56,325
You guys actually
set the house on fire!

708
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:58,660
- Lisa's back.
- Lisa's unfrozen.

709
01:07:58,828 --> 01:08:01,163
You're okay. You're okay, Lisa.

710
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,667
Get off me! Get off me!
Try and find the fire extinguisher!

711
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:07,670
- No, Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, wait.
- No, Lisa, no.

712
01:08:07,837 --> 01:08:10,798
- Stop! Lisa, don't.
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire.

713
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:12,299
Lisa, stop.

714
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:13,509
No, Lisa, don't do it!

715
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,803
Lisa, don't do that.
We gotta keep the fire.

716
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:19,765
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire!
- Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, don't do it.

717
01:08:19,974 --> 01:08:21,475
No, Lisa.

718
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:26,980
- Great.
- Now we'll never get the game back.

719
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:31,026
Okay. Don't worry. They're back.

720
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:34,446
- Who the hell are you?
- The astronaut.

721
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:36,699
From the game we're in.

722
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:38,409
Danny spun me.

723
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:50,629
What is that? What is that?

724
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,840
What's going on? Where are we?

725
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:56,343
Somebody please
talk to me right now!

726
01:08:57,554 --> 01:09:01,473
All right, they're arming the harpoons.
They're gonna board us.

727
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:03,642
- What's gonna board us?
- Guys, look alive.

728
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,644
- What's gonna board us?
- The Zorgons.

729
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:08,939
- What's a Zorgon?
- They're lizard-men. They eat meat.

730
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:10,566
We're meat!

731
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:19,408
- Come on, let's hide downstairs!
- Okay, listen, when they dock...

732
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,119
...I'll sneak on the ship and
steal the game. Got it?

733
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,454
- Hang on.
- What?

734
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:26,457
- Did she say downstairs?
- Oh, no.

735
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:39,970
Hey, hey.

736
01:09:40,388 --> 01:09:42,931
Just stay with us,
and everything will be okay.

737
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,437
I'll never leave you.

738
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:56,904
Move, move, move.

739
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:02,284
Go, go.

740
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:43,701
Okay. It's gotten
pretty serious out there.

741
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,786
I need you guys to hide in here.

742
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:47,788
I'll keep in touch with these.

743
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,540
They won't work.
Danny broke them.

744
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,751
He pulled off the antenna.
They're completely destroyed.

745
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:56,296
Testing.

746
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:58,716
It works.

747
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:01,844
Listen, keep the volume low.

748
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:03,512
Only use that if you need me.

749
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,348
Wa... Wait, where are you going?

750
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:08,642
I'm gonna go find the game.

751
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:21,530
He has gorgeous eyes.

752
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:25,868
What?

753
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:29,663
He obviously feels
very protective over me.

754
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:32,333
I just...

755
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,376
I just feel so safe around him.

756
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,670
Zorgons.

757
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:38,297
Oh, my God.

758
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:42,134
The place is crawling with them.
They're all over the basement.

759
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:46,013
Wait, I think in the corner
I see the game.

760
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:47,806
Yeah, the box is right there.

761
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:51,560
Hang on, I'm... I'm gonna get closer.

762
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:55,230
Did he get the game?

763
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:05,366
- Hello?
- What's going on?

764
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,076
Are you there? Hello?

765
01:12:07,243 --> 01:12:09,328
- What's happening?
- Hello?

766
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:10,746
Is he dead?

767
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,616
The game was right there.

768
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:51,620
It was right across from the furnace.
I couldn't get it.

769
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,416
There's too many of them down there.
They're all over the basement.

770
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,626
Are there any upstairs?

771
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:00,337
Not yet. But as soon as
they're done down there...

772
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:02,423
It's okay. You tried your hardest.

773
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:05,134
- We believe in you.
- Will you please?

774
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:08,429
Okay.

775
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:11,640
- The dumbwaiter.
- What?

776
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,476
The dumbwaiter is across
from the furnace.

777
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:16,311
It's a little elevator.

778
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,731
You could sneak right in it...

779
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:20,816
...we'll lower you down...

780
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:22,776
...you could grab the game...

781
01:13:22,944 --> 01:13:24,987
...and we'll pull you right back up.

782
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,156
So easy.

783
01:13:27,323 --> 01:13:28,991
Right, Walter?

784
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,452
Yeah, but he's too big.

785
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,829
Yeah.

786
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:35,831
It was a good plan, though.

787
01:13:36,207 --> 01:13:37,583
It was a great plan.

788
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,001
Yeah, it was.

789
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,586
It was.

790
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,921
Too bad he wouldn't fit.

791
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:45,341
I wouldn't even fit.

792
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:53,015
I sure wish we knew someone
that was small enough.

793
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:57,186
Do we really need the game?

794
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:09,656
How you doing in there?

795
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:12,951
Okay.

796
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,372
Listen to me.
It's gonna be real easy, okay?

797
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:20,042
Just gonna lower you down there,
grab the game, and we'll pull you up.

798
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:21,835
Yeah.

799
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:24,254
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

800
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:26,799
- Yeah.
- Because I'm your brother.

801
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:29,426
And that's what
being a brother means.

802
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:31,887
Means I'll never let
anything happen to you.

803
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:35,182
- Okay?
- Yeah.

804
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:38,852
Okay. This is just gonna
take a few seconds, okay?

805
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,814
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

806
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,400
I'm sorry I cheated.

807
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,568
I know.

808
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,202
- You ready to do this?
- I'm ready.

809
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:54,595
He's right there.

810
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:58,057
Guys, why did you stop?

811
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,822
Guys, come on.

812
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,075
I'm not at the bottom yet.

813
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,170
Help me. Come on.

814
01:16:30,173 --> 01:16:32,424
That's it. Pull, pull.
Come on, come on.

815
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:34,468
Go. Go.

816
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:44,019
They're back.
They're coming up the stairs.

817
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:46,230
Get out of here. Go on.

818
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:47,773
Go, go, go.

819
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:36,030
Oh, no.

820
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:20,491
Guys.

821
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:23,494
It was just the box.

822
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:38,592
Wait. I see the game.

823
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:41,470
It's on the Zorgon ship.

824
01:18:45,975 --> 01:18:48,936
But I think I can get it.

825
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:52,981
Danny, do not get on that ship.

826
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:55,484
Just stay put.
We'll come and get you.

827
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:55,127
Danny.

828
01:19:56,254 --> 01:19:57,713
Danny. Danny, listen to me.

829
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:00,632
The Zorgons are up here.
Just stay put.

830
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,801
The pulley broke...
- figure out...

831
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:06,180
We got rope... So just stay put.

832
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:09,475
Danny. Danny, are you there?

833
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:11,435
Danny, the Zorgons are up here.

834
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:13,354
lf you can hear me, listen.

835
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:17,149
We're not pulling you up right now.
Stay put.

836
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,026
We just saw one. Hold tight.

837
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,439
It's just a goat. It's just a goat.

838
01:20:57,857 --> 01:20:59,775
It's just a...

839
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:03,612
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.
It's not a goat.

840
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,323
It's not a goat. It's not a goat.

841
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:11,412
It's not a goat.

842
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,221
Guys, pull me up.

843
01:22:55,308 --> 01:22:58,727
They got goats with four eyes.

844
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,028
Guys! Quick!

845
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:51,196
I have the game!

846
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:54,283
Come on.

847
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:56,952
Walter.

848
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,706
I told you I wouldn't let anything
happen to you. Come on.

849
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,188
Emergency.

850
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,318
Alien life form.

851
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:31,445
Must destroy.

852
01:24:31,613 --> 01:24:33,822
He still wants to kill me.

853
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:43,248
Use the card. Quick.

854
01:24:43,416 --> 01:24:45,167
Reprogram.

855
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:05,521
Alien life form.

856
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:09,983
Must destroy.

857
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:39,972
Alien life form.

858
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,349
Must destroy.

859
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:50,107
Guess that's what
the reprogram card's for.

860
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:52,192
I like that card.

861
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,403
It's a good card.

862
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,656
Where's Lisa?

863
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:04,705
Lisa...

864
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:06,373
...is upstairs.

865
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,417
What fell?

866
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:15,049
Little excessive, but I like it.
Come on.

867
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:17,760
Come on, come on, come on.

868
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:26,393
Okay, spin it, buddy.

869
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:37,780
Almost there.

870
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:43,327
I got it.

871
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,289
"Flunk space academy.
Go back one space."

872
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:53,295
I'm not even gonna
comment on that.

873
01:26:56,132 --> 01:26:57,466
My turn.

874
01:27:16,152 --> 01:27:19,154
"Hit time warp. Go back three
spaces. Repeat last turn."

875
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:31,000
I get another wish.

876
01:27:50,937 --> 01:27:52,771
Thanks for helping us out.

877
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:07,661
I wish the astronaut
had his brother back.

878
01:28:35,148 --> 01:28:37,399
You wished for two of me?

879
01:28:37,567 --> 01:28:38,817
No. I...

880
01:28:38,985 --> 01:28:41,403
I wished the astronaut guy
had his brother back.

881
01:28:48,703 --> 01:28:51,246
- Danny.
- Who are you?

882
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,415
It's me.

883
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:56,835
It's Walter. I'm your brother.

884
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:59,088
- What?
- Wha...?

885
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:01,340
No, you're not.

886
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:02,883
He is.

887
01:29:03,802 --> 01:29:05,260
Yes.

888
01:29:05,428 --> 01:29:08,222
I'm older, but I'm him.

889
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,183
- I came back for you.
- What's going on here?

890
01:29:57,981 --> 01:30:00,149
That was awesome.

891
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:10,200
Thank you.

892
01:30:10,994 --> 01:30:12,369
l...

893
01:30:12,537 --> 01:30:14,496
- I didn't...
- You did a good job.

894
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:17,124
You did better than I did.

895
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:19,585
Thanks.

896
01:30:20,086 --> 01:30:22,421
Now, make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

897
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:24,757
Okay.

898
01:30:53,828 --> 01:30:56,205
- He was me.
- Yeah.

899
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,540
Oh, my God. And I wanted to...

900
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,894
Ten. You need 10 to win.

901
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,313
Need a 10. Need a 10.

902
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:35,828
One. God, I suck.

903
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:48,340
"Would you like to swing on a star?
Move ahead nine spaces."

904
01:31:50,593 --> 01:31:52,511
- Danny, you won.
- I won?

905
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,097
- He won?
- You won, Danny. You beat the game.

906
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:57,099
You won the game.
We can go home.

907
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,934
I reached Zathura!

908
01:32:40,393 --> 01:32:43,729
"Game over.
Thank you for playing"?

909
01:32:44,356 --> 01:32:47,149
- That's it?
- Now what?

910
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,835
I think we're home.

911
01:33:11,299 --> 01:33:13,008
Walter!

912
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:19,473
Lisa!

913
01:33:28,608 --> 01:33:31,026
It's a black hole!

914
01:33:31,194 --> 01:33:34,154
Zathura is a black hole!

915
01:34:10,859 --> 01:34:12,568
Danny!

916
01:34:15,321 --> 01:34:20,951
No!

917
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,247
Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?

918
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:28,625
A's up 5-4. Keith Foulke
leads the bigs in home runs...

919
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:30,836
...given up by a reliever with six.

920
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,963
Bottom nine. Red Sox down, 5-4.

921
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:37,009
Octavio Dotel in for the save.
He ain't really saving a whole lot.

922
01:34:37,177 --> 01:34:38,927
He walks "Big Papi" Ortiz...

923
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:41,972
...to tie up the inning.
Kevin Millar up next.

924
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:45,100
After an Ortiz walk, ninth inning...

925
01:34:46,686 --> 01:34:48,270
Walter?

926
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:51,982
- Don't push that button.
- Let's get back to the here and now.

927
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,151
No way it's gonna
happen again, is it?

928
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:55,986
No way.
No, it doesn't happen again.

929
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:58,280
Millar pops out to left field.

930
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,128
Richard's back!

931
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:15,047
- I did it.
- You won the game.

932
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,591
- I won the game. I beat Zathura.
- We're home.

933
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:19,551
- We're home!
- We did it. We're home.

934
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:22,638
I distinctly remember asking you guys
not to kill each other.

935
01:35:22,806 --> 01:35:25,099
Dad, it was so awesome.
There was this game...

936
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:27,976
...it sent us to outer space.
- There was a black hole.

937
01:35:28,144 --> 01:35:29,645
We almost had to stay forever.

938
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:33,023
- I stole the game from the Zorgons.
- And I saw myself older.

939
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,693
Sounds like a lot of fun.

940
01:35:35,902 --> 01:35:38,404
It's almost 3:00,
and Mom's gonna be here any minute.

941
01:35:38,571 --> 01:35:41,573
Grab all games and books,
whatever you wanna take to her house.

942
01:35:41,741 --> 01:35:43,575
Come on, get ready to go.

943
01:35:45,912 --> 01:35:49,123
Good throw. Right to the chest.
Catch this one.

944
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,334
- Caught it.
- Nice.

945
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,548
All right, ready? Here we go.

946
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:01,093
Brett Favre takes the snap.
He's looking. It's a great pass.

947
01:36:01,886 --> 01:36:03,512
- Touchdown.
- Touchdown.

948
01:36:05,015 --> 01:36:07,099
- Just a second, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

949
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:12,021
What happened to the football
signed by Brett Favre?

950
01:36:12,188 --> 01:36:15,232
- It's gone.
- What happened to it?

951
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,026
It never happened.

952
01:36:17,193 --> 01:36:18,777
Oh, right.

953
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:23,282
We never speak of this. Okay?

954
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,660
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

955
01:36:29,539 --> 01:36:31,790
Still think I have gorgeous eyes?

956
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:34,543
- Walter.
- What?
