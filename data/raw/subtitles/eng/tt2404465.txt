00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,118
GIRL: Last summer, Mama gave me

3
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,663
this flashlight to signal the aliens.

4
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,165
She said, "Of course
there's life out there.

5
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,960
Now go outside."

6
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:10,130
But now it's just me and y'all,
the aliens of the universe,

7
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,883
so if you can hear me...

8
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:17,263
I am Christmas Flint, human female.

9
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,017
I think you'd like me.

10
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,104
I think you'd want to be my friend.

11
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,286
Dang it.

12
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,986
And I don't want no ketchup stains

13
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,196
- on those pages again.
- Yes, ma'am.

14
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,552
CHRISTMAS: Mama believed that sound waves

15
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,888
travel out into the universe.

16
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,057
(radio static warbling)

17
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,184
She said that if I ever got lonely,

18
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,144
I should just send my message out.

19
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,527
- (indistinct chatter)
- CHRISTMAS: Joseph!

20
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,779
EDDIE: All right, give me the ball.

21
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,031
- Uh-huh.
- Here you go.

22
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,327
(phone ringing)

23
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,622
RAMSEY: Ramsey Flint, attorney-at-law.

24
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,958
- CHRISTMAS: What it is, boss?
- RAMSEY: What it is, boss.

25
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,336
Now, now, hold up, Joe Frank.
I'm your attorney.

26
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,630
- Yeah, you got to listen to me.
- (country music playing)

27
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,091
Not about the property line now.

28
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,968
That is a big tractor, Joe Frank.

29
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,845
I'd advise you get out of the way.

30
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,723
This is legal advice.

31
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,266
You not hungry?

32
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,310
No, I'm talking to the dog.

33
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,437
Hey, I'm just trying to save your life.

34
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,231
CHRISTMAS: That's the boss man.

35
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,149
- He's my dad.
- (dial tone humming)

36
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,484
Damn it.

37
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:36,777
CHRISTMAS: He's doing his best.

38
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,529
It ain't his fault he loses so much.

39
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,614
- RAMSEY: Where are my pants?
- Since Mama died,

40
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,116
he's been losing everything.

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,201
Boss, when we're done talking,

42
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,121
you think our words travel
out into the universe forever?

43
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,790
I sure as heck hope not.

44
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,001
I swear...

45
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,586
I'm gonna pop somebody,
I don't get my damn money.

46
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,963
RAMSEY: Miss Rayleen?

47
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,589
I got to go down,

48
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,550
take care of Joe Frank in Live Oak.

49
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,884
Where are your pants?

50
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,803
You 400 in the hole, and you talking

51
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,430
- about Joe Frank.
- RAMSEY: Now, listen...

52
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,348
CHRISTMAS: That's Miss Rayleen.

53
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,559
She's an intergalactic warrior.

54
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,936
You know what? You the boss,
but you a broke-ass boss.

55
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,105
CHRISTMAS: But she crash-landed here,

56
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,482
working for my dad
instead of going to law school.

57
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,735
Ain't nothing wrong helping somebody.

58
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,194
CHRISTMAS: Still,
she's the smartest person

59
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,612
- you're gonna meet.
- We can discuss this later.

60
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,615
I got to find my pants. You move my pants?

61
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,242
I don't have anything to do
with your pants.

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,994
Mr. Ramsey, hi. I can't pay you yet,

63
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,787
but I brought you some avocados.

64
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,290
- Avo-what?
- A-Avocados.

65
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,793
It's the good Lord's way
of saying "mayonnaise."

66
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,170
Huh?

67
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,296
Uh, we'll get your payment soon.

68
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,547
RAYLEEN: You don't need no mayonnaise.

69
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,465
You need some money. You know how much

70
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,841
you have in your bank account?

71
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,718
- I do. It ain't pretty.
- You pay... Th-Thank you, miss.

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,219
You pay her no mind.

73
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,637
- Everybody's doing their best.
- I'm going to the deck.

74
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,640
RAYLEEN: I'm doing my best
not to whup your ass.

75
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:52,061
Boss... h-hold up.

76
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,979
Got to make contact, though.

77
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,397
I know you ain't walking around
looking like that.

78
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,440
Take that off.

79
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,108
Look at that hair.

80
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,278
People gonna think
you were raised by wolves.

81
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,322
♪ Oh, yes ♪

82
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,866
♪ I'm the great defender... ♪

83
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,035
- What it is, boss?
- RAMSEY: What it is, Dwayne.

84
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,328
What it is, Miss Rayleen?

85
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,871
If it ain't $200 for the petty theft,

86
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,873
- I don't want to hear it.
- RAMSEY: That can wait.

87
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,709
I'm gonna need his services, actually.

88
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,212
Let's go. Prepare to fall out.

89
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,130
RAMSEY: Joe Frank got himself
arrested again.

90
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,049
We got to go bail him out.

91
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,635
Hey, there are my pants. All right.

92
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,303
People ain't got no sense.

93
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,139
RAMSEY: Boss, don't you touch
that hair! You'll mess it up!

94
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:32,476
You be a real sweet, go grab me a beer?

95
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,604
Now, I know you already
offered one to Mr. Dwayne.

96
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,022
(bottles clinking)

97
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:41,401
- Isn't she sweet?
- Just like her mama.

98
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,028
CHRISTMAS: I can't do it.

99
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,155
- (clattering)
- Hey. What the hell?

100
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,740
(whispers): Why'd you say that?

101
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,575
Now, now, now, now, now, now.

102
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,994
Like this, boss.

103
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,871
That's how it go.

104
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,790
King of Beers. Clink it up.

105
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,583
King of Beers.

106
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,627
Mmm. Tell you what.

107
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,963
You don't back down till you
reach them aliens, huh?

108
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,131
Give me that.

109
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,549
Maybe they can come down here

110
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,217
and babysit or something. (chuckles)

111
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,635
Sir, yes, sir.

112
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,345
(chuckles) All right.

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,805
Uh, all right, come on, Fluffy.

114
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,515
- Y'all have a good time.
- (Fluffy barking)

115
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,725
- Whoop!
- Dwayne, fall out!

116
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,978
(indistinct shouting outside,
car doors open and close)

117
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,230
(car engine starts)

118
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,649
(country music continues playing)

119
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,821
CHRISTMAS: Miss Rayleen?

120
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,531
Can you help me get
my flashlight brighter?

121
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,616
You going up on that deck again?

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,368
Mm, I don't know.

123
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,704
Don't you have any girlfriends?

124
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,956
- I got you.
- Uh-uh.

125
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,333
I'm not a friend. I'm a grown-up.

126
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,544
Then I guess nah.

127
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,046
What about that little sparkly friend?

128
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,341
His daddy's making him football-practice.

129
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,760
(groans) God help that boy.

130
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,429
Nobody at school?

131
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,390
They all say I pee myself,
even though I don't.

132
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,018
No. No, no, no, I know.

133
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,399
What's that?

134
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,401
It's a curler.

135
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,195
What's it for?

136
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,530
Make your eyelashes look longer.

137
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,699
Weird.

138
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,409
(grunts)

139
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,329
Miss Rayleen?

140
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,581
You think I could be part alien?

141
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,333
(sighs)

142
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,336
I worry about you, Christmas.

143
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,548
Do you want to watch
The Outer Limits later?

144
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,427
I'm sorry, boo, but I'm busy tonight.

145
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,851
(door opens and closes)

146
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,981
(car door opens and closes)

147
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,068
(car engine starts)

148
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,153
(car departing)

149
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,281
(switch clicking)

150
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,663
CHRISTMAS: When Mama died, everyone said

151
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,373
all kinds of different stuff.

152
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,791
She's in Heaven.

153
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,501
She's here with me but invisible.

154
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,128
The boss man says
she got turned into stars

155
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,507
and comets and meteors,
and I think that's what's true.

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,636
I think she's stars
and comets and meteors.

157
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,658
WOMAN (on TV): I would like to introduce

158
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,412
this bill of sale as Defense Exhibit A.

159
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,414
That's what I would do, too.

160
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,499
MAN (on TV): ...were involved
in something more frivolous.

161
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,001
Well, there are those of us

162
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,919
who still side with the establishment.

163
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,921
- (gavel bangs)
- Case dismissed.

164
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,048
(whoops excitedly)

165
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,593
(birds chirping)

166
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,180
EDDIE: Go! Go, run, run, run!

167
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,391
Hey, get them legs up! Get them legs up!

168
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,393
Yeah! All right, now zigzag. Zigzag.

169
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,770
Zigzag. Serpentine. Yeah!
They ain't gonna catch you

170
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,480
- if you serpentine. All right.
- (panting)

171
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,857
Good hustle. All right.

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,734
All right, now go long,
go long. Go, go, go.

173
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,569
CHRISTMAS: I want you to tell Joseph

174
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,279
it gets better for people like us.

175
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,614
- For the ones with no mamas.
- (yelps)

176
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,700
Or the girl boys
and the falsely accused bed wetters.

177
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,076
Hey! Hey.

178
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,120
(whimpers, grunts)

179
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,455
- But you might have to lie.
- That's all right.

180
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,873
EDDIE: Come on, bring it back in.

181
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,416
Bring it back in.
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle.

182
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,460
- JOSEPH: Are we done yet?
- EDDIE: Give me the ball.

183
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,086
All right, now, you got to be faster.

184
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,297
- You have got to be fast.
- I don't need to be fast.

185
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,007
- No, you're gonna be faster.
- RAYLEEN: Joseph.

186
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,592
I've been watching you.

187
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,595
You're gonna have to learn
to run fast as all hell.

188
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,847
Right? All right. So go long.

189
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,390
Set, hut!

190
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,184
Okay, turn around.

191
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,269
Hands up. Back up.

192
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,313

193
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,647

00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,457
Let's get out of here!

202
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,543
Tax day. I'm y'all tax collector.

203
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,796
Give me y'all's tax!

204
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,547
CHRISTMAS: You'd be advised

205
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,092
to stay the hell away from Hell-No Price.

206
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,386
Hey, Betsy-Wetsy.

207
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,054
- It's not true.
- It don't matter.

208
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,347
Come on, just run.

209
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,057
HELL-NO: Hey! I will hunt you down!

210
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,517
CHRISTMAS: She's got the ferocity

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,103
of a T. rex and twice the appetite.

212
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,980
Hell-No Price, I heard
she done ate her parents.

213
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,316
HELL-NO: Get down here!

214
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,859
I said get down here!

215
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,238
- Crap.
- You got to pay.

216
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,365
You don't got tax...

217
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,075
Smash attacks.

218
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,493
(Smash growls)

219
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,204
- We ain't coming down.
- Nah.

220
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,498
We ain't got candy. We ain't got nothing.

221
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,166
Come on. We'll get 'em later.

222
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,168

CHRISTMAS: Beware of
nasty Principal Massey.

231
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,146
She grew up right next door
to Miss Rayleen.

232
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,440
She pretends she's better than everybody.

233
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,899
(blows whistle)

234
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,776
Good afternoon, Birdies.

235
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,612
ALL: Good afternoon, Miss Massey.

236
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,781
Have we got a treat for you today.

237
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,659
Who's excited for some Jamboree?

238
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,286
(whooping, laughing)

239
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,996
Who's excited for some winning?

240
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,248
- (whooping)
- And this year,

241
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,834
I know we're gonna bring home
that trophy like always.

242
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,878
Otherwise, y'all gonna be
staying in Marietta.

243
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,421
(chuckles) I'm playing.

244
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,547
I'm playing.

245
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,215
So...

246
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,968
there's something special
happening this year.

247
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:45,515
An opportunity for all of us
to be a part of science.

248
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,268
MAN: Hi. Hi, everybody.

249
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,228
This is Doctor... Pers...

250
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,730
- Persad.
- Persad.

251
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,733
- All the way from NASA.
- PERSAD: Hello. Hello.

252
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,778
Raise your hands if you like
to think about outer space.

253
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,451
They're girls.

254
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,119
That's okay, huh.

255
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,330
You know, someone who loves to think

256
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,707
about outer space is our president.

257
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,251
- Oh, my.
- He has sent some of us

258
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,212
on a mission across the Earth.

259
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,756
We are putting together a record of life.

260
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,216
MASSEY: A record?

261
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,051
Yes. The Golden Record.

262
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,761
The greatest hits of planet Earth.

263
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,889
An account of all of us
to be launched into space.

264
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,391
- Ooh.
- But I don't want to go to space.

265
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,727
Hush up, precious. Shh, shh.

266
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,438
We are recording people
from all over the world,

267
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,482
giving greetings
in their native languages.

268
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,027
If there is a chance there is other life,

269
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,197
there is a chance someone will hear this.

270
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,535
There's no such things as aliens, though.

271
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,079
Piper, please.

272
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,665
Don't interrupt.

273
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,627
Our president is a humble man
from Georgia,

274
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,839
so why not a little girl
from somewhere like...

275
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,801
- Wiggly.
- ...somewhere like Wiggly

276
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,220
be the keeper of our immortality?

277
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,180
- MASSEY: That's quite a job.
- (Christmas giggles)

278
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,598
Well, um, I appreciate your time.

279
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,809
A group of us will be there
at the Jamboree.

280
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,353
We are looking forward
to recording the winners.

281
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,981
All right, let's go get changed
into our Jamboree costumes.

282
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,357
(Birdies whooping)

283
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,693
MASSEY: Come on, get going!

284
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,279
Let's bring home the gold
like we do, right?

285
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,530
- JOSEPH: Christmas!
- CHRISTMAS: Ow!

286
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,533
Why you always got to be
the one in the front, Piper?

287
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,577
- I got more badges than you...
- CHRISTMAS: Piper! Hold up!

288
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,620
...so why don't you
pour yourself a big old glass

289
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,622
- of hush up.
- Hey. Hey.

290
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,957
(panting): Hey, Piper.

291
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,875
PIPER: Do y'all smell something?

292
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,962
Did somebody pee on themselves?

293
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,422
(laughter)

294
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,257
I want to be a Birdie Scout.

295
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,551
I want to go to Jamboree.

296
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,636
Go run into trees, bed wetter.

297
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
- I'm not a bed wetter.
- GINGER: Yes, huh.

298
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,098
She'll get the uniform nasty.

299
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,392
(gasps) You'll get the uniform nasty.

300
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,019
(laughter)

301
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,146
I just said that.

302
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,815
I can be good for you.
I know stuff about space.

303
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,317
I could help you win.

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,736
PIPER: Jamboree is a talent show.

305
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,696
The best of the best.

306
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,783
Is that you, or is trash you?

307
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,786
Why y'all so mean to me?

308
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,288
I don't know.

309
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,041
Just feels right.

310
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,543
I'm at the top, and you're at the bottom.

311
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,713
It's just how we was made.

312
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,591
- (laughter)
- GIRL: Go, go, go.

313
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,842
Open the locker!

314
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,261
Does this mean I'm in?

315
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,888
(sighs)

316
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,015
(girls laughing outside)

317
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,601
Ain't that some shit.

318
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,233
Greetings from planet Earth.

319
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,321
I am Krystal Massey.

320
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,031
(sighs)

321
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,533
And, um...

322
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,250
There we go.

323
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,260
And I wish you great tidings
and great joy.

324
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,137
I do.

325
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,139
Aliens out there.

326
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,184
(distant banging,
girls shouting indistinctly)

327
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,732
- (banging)
- CHRISTMAS (muffled): Hello!

328
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,151
- Anyone?
- (Massey sighs)

329
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,072
Oh, look, it's Christmas.

330
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,991
Bless your heart.

331
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,744
I'm gonna tell you something, precious.

332
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,247
When we get put in a locker, it's because,

333
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,126
one way or the other,
we got ourselves in there.

334
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,045
- You understand?
- No.

335
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,797
Oh, Christmas Flint. (chuckles)

336
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,800
We just don't know about you, do we?

337
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,387
You're sweet, but we just don't know.

338
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,930
(Massey clucking tongue)

339
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,265
(Massey sighs, mutters)

340
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,308
JOSEPH: Christmas!

341
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,560
Hey.

342
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,478
Oh, my God, I love your hair.

343
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,771
It's so different.

344
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:02,981
- Yeah.
- It's abstract.

345
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,607
You're abstract.

346
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,776
I want our band name to be Gemini.

347
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,778
We can dress in that shiny plastic.

348
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,447
CHRISTMAS: Shiny plastic?

349
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,657
(Fluffy barking, country music playing)

350
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,326
What the hell happened to your hair?

351
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,494
Fell off, I guess.

352
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,204
RAMSEY: You look ferocious, boss.

353
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,789
Nothing more important than that.

354
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,040
She didn't do this herself.

355
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,126
- Who did this?
- No one.

356
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,420
Just tell her she looks nice.

357
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,172
What's wrong with y'all?

358
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,507
Why's she letting people cut on her hair?

359
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,801
She ain't letting nobody do nothing.

360
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,554
- Clarification, boss.
- CHRISTMAS: Overruled!

361
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,347

- Yep.

362
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,433
That'd be the judge.

363
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,352
You tell him I'm on my way, all right?

364
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,271
Oh. Come on, Fluffy.

365
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,315
Can you make sure
she got something to eat?

366
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,442
I ain't got time for no children!

367
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,527
- And I ain't her mama.
- RAMSEY: Come on there, boss.

Gram Parsons? Rolling Stones?

532
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,205
No, more like Beethoven and them.

533
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,332
Well, then I'm not interested in space.

534
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,375
I don't care for that at all.

535
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,877
Yeah, well, I care.

536
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,922
There's some other life out there,

537
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,132
and they funna know me.

538
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,430
(sighs softly)

539
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,726
No.

540
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,229
- It-it'd be office hours.
- You already owe me back pay.

541
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,939
RAMSEY: Well, I'll get it. I'll get it.

542
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,483
I mean, ain't my fault everybody guilty.

543
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,526
Ain't my fault you can't
get people to pay you.

544
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,528
Joseph already started
our choreography, though.

545
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:30,696
RAYLEEN: No. No, sir.

546
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,990
I don't get on good with little girls.

547
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:36,452
I do arsonists, murderers
and state prosecutors.

548
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,703
Little girls give me the creeps.

549
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,288
Plus, you can't hit 'em no more.

550
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,581
They changed the laws.

551
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,333
All right.

552
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,669
"Lead us to glory." I like that.

553
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,962
And it would've been good

554
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,838
for you to be around other girls, boss.

555
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,133
Lord knows I raise you like one
of them hillbillies next door.

556
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,220
You'll be doing dip
if I don't take some action.

557
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:59,058
Miss Rayleen, take your
office days down to two.

558
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,434
No. Hell no.

559
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,727
I'm the boss man.

560
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,396
You the leader of the Birdies.

561
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,897
Me and Fluffy,

562
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,984
- we gonna go and try and get paid.
- (Fluffy barking)

563
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,196
Here you go.

564
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,450
RAMSEY: Fall out, Fluffy.

565
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:20,955
(chuckles softly)

566
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,625
I don't do nothing half-ass.

567
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,752
I don't want to do anything
with half an ass.

568
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,129
You know you're just setting yourself up

569
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,256
for your little heart to get broke.

570
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,758
No, setting myself up
to change my whole life.

571
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,261
(Rayleen yells, whoops)

572
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,515
(chuckles): He forgot to open
the damn beer can.

573
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,059
(both laughing)

574
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,311
(Rayleen sighs)

575
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,520
Mmm!

576
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,694
Rayleen Mosely?

577
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,070
Hi, Krystal.

578
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,572
Hey.

579
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,824
(chuckles) It's been a minute.

580
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,660
Mm-hmm.

581
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,288
Since, uh...

582
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,124
BOTH: Pavo Possum Fest.

583
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,794
Well, hey. Sure is nice to see you.

584
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:09,962
(chuckles)

585
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:13,382
And are you a... are you a mama?

586
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,177
I'm the Troop Mama.

587
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,263
(laughs)

588
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,348
(Rayleen chuckles)

589
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,641
RAYLEEN: Yeah.

590
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,477
For real?

591
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,313
- Are you playing?
- I don't play. You know that.

592
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,648
They can't be Birdies.

593
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,275
- Why not?
- Because these children

594
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,693
are not...

595
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,738
Because Birdies have
a strict quality code.

596
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,365
- My boos are quality.
- (quiet fart)

597
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,414
And you think you can get these children

598
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,916
to follow these standards?

599
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,877
Does a fat puppy poot? I got this.

600
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,089
That kind of language isn't necessary.

601
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,924
All right, then.

602
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,967
Got to give you a number.

603
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,719
Troop...

604
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,805
Oh, dear, well...

605
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:05,643
Huh. The only number left in
the state of Georgia is zero.

606
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,311
Isn't that sweet?

607
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,938
Perfectly appropriate.

608
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,314
Yes, precious.

609
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,733
Zero's the number of infinity.

610
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,277
Is that right?

611
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,571
- CHRISTMAS: Yeah.
- MASSEY: Well...

612
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:21,409
Troop Zero, welcome to Birdie Scouting.

613
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,077
(chuckling)

614
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,163
I don't know if you thought
this was gonna be easy.

615
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:30,042
Being a woman of substance is never easy.

616
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,752
It's not pageantry,

617
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,130
where you look pretty for the boys.

618
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:38,717
It's not 4-H, where you birth
a calf and call it a day.

619
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,220
Before you're taking care of your babies,

620
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,639
before you're
taking care of your husbands,

621
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,142
your old parents and whoever
else needs you to hold them up,

622
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,768
you're taking care of your troop.

623
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,105
You're making sure you're all winners.

624
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,649
Each member is required to earn one badge.

625
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,695
That's the bare minimum
to qualify for Jamboree.

626
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,238
You will earn them honestly...

627
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,575
no cheating... and if you earn 'em,

628
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,368
then you got a shot at Marietta.

629
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:08,539
So, welcome, Troop Zero.

630
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,749
We'll see you on the other side.

631
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,543
If you make it out alive.

632
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,545
(Massey chuckling)

633
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,547
- I'm playing. I'm playing.
- (Rayleen chuckles)

634
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,716
I'm not.

635
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,176
Come on, y'all.

636
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,927
- Come on. Don't take nothing.
- (slurping)

637
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,512
She'll say you got it dirty.

638
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,264
(kids screaming)

639
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,683
(kids yelling playfully, laughing)

640
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,193
- I will destroy you!
- Stop it! Stop it!

641
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,737
All right, all right.

642
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,780
(screams) Ow.

643
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,824
RAYLEEN: Y'all want to do this.

644
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,702
- Hey, hey.
- (shouting dies down)

645
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,829
(sighs, laughter continues)

646
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,666
(chuckling)

647
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,337
- Y'all my Birdies now.
- He can't be a Birdie.

648
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,214
Can't be a Birdie 'cause he's half boy.

649
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,507
Can't be a football player
'cause he's half girl.

650
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,509
No, ma'am, that would be a "no, ma'am."

651
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:02,718
We are sweet to each other.

652
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,136
Smash, get your finger out your nose.

653
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,930
Get the straw out of your mouth.

654
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,348
Hell-No, you get the straw
out of your mouth, too.

655
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,016
Put your foot down.

656
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,686
Joseph, welcome to the Birdie Scouts.

657
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,232
Smash, I don't care about the law.

658
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,317
Rayleen funna whup your ass.

659
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,945
(growls)

660
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,156
Joseph is one of y'all now, all right?

661
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,784
And we are gonna do the best we can.

662
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,202
- Yeah.
- HELL-NO: Nah.

663
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,370
- We funna lose.
- (Smash grunts)

664
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,829
This a bunch of losers and trash

665
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,122
- nobody wants.
- CHRISTMAS: No.

666
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,916
We funna win.

667
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,168
- MASSEY: Here we are.
- (laughter)

668
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,963
Leftovers for the leftovers.

669
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,966
(chuckling): I'm playing. Y'all know I am.

670
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,842
For real.

671
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,428
Good luck with whatever
you find in this badge jar.

672
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,514
My girls have won almost every one.

673
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,224
Can you believe it?

674
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,310
I'm sure there's something
in there for you.

675
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,812
I appreciate you.

676
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,481
- Mm.
- And let's see what we got here.

677
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,857
JOSEPH: What's that?

678
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,359
Dang, these are ugly.

679
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,652
Take it.

680
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,320
(kids laughing)

681
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,530
What the hell is this?

682
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,949
Oh, that's Survival in the Wilderness.

683
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,493
Can we have something
more in their ballpark?

684
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,830
I mean, "Dress-idge,"
that ain't gonna work.

685
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,082
"Dressage" is the correct pronunciation.

686
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,542
Whatever it is, it ain't gonna work.

687
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,044
- Ceramics. Table Settings?
- Hell-No.

688
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,255
- No.
- Just remind me,

689
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,049
what do they say about beggars again?

690
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,178
I'm playing. I'm playing.

691
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,471
(chuckles)

692
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,807
Y'all clean up this mess in here.

693
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,561
- These smell.
- Mm!

694
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,813
- (sniffs)
- RAYLEEN: All right.

695
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,441
All y'all got to do is win one badge each

696
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,234
to go to Jamboree.

697
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,694
So, it shouldn't be that hard.

698
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,947
Have y'all ever won
anything in your lives?

699
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:49,199
(cricket chirping)

700
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,246
All right, Troop Zero, let's just...

701
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,749
You know what? Let's just do what we can.

702
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,793
You too thick, wear the sash.

703
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:03,130
You don't want to wear
girl clothes, wear the sash.

704
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,757
You pee your pants, wear the sash.

705
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,468
- Just don't get any pee on it.
- I don't pee myself.

706
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,178
RAYLEEN: Yeah, that's just
in principle. Here.

862
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,348

for those who win.

00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,447
(grunts) Ow!

884
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,740
That poor thing can't afford

885
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,450
to do nothing easy, and you know that.

886
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,619
- RAMSEY: Come on!
- RAYLEEN: Come on, y'all.

887
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:15,330
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

888
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:20,335
CHRISTMAS: This badge was made
for Hell-No Price.

889
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,797
She eats obstacles for
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

890
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,007
ALL (chanting): Hell-No! Hell-No!

891
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,093
- Hell-No!
- (blows whistle)

892
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,720
You done good, Hell-No.

893
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,474
(chuckles, kids cheering)

894
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,900
Smash, I figure you take things apart,

895
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:47,154
you might be able
to put 'em back together.

896
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,321
Go on.

897
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,994
(giggles)

898
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,675
(radio static droning)

899
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,012
(indistinct broadcast plays)

900
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,681
(kids cheering)

901
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,932
My boo! (laughs)

902
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,355
(whooping)

903
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,441
CHRISTMAS: That Smash will surprise you.

904
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,610
And I will, too.

905
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,111
Promise.

906
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,114
Got to have one special skill.

907
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,742
This is almost impossible to mess up.

908
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,619
Even for you, Christmas.

909
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,162
Baking badge.

910
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,998
Bake a cake, get the badge.

911
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,500
Can't you just give me one?

912
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,004
- Are you a cheater?
- No, ma'am.

913
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,215
Oh, forgot the dang vanilla.

914
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,052
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

915
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,553
(chatter quiets)

916
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,180
What the "H" y'all doing?

917
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,974
Baking badge.

918
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,392
Why are y'all playing like this?

919
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,812
Yeah, y'all suck at being girls.

920
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,815
- Y'all suck at being girls.
- Yeah.

921
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,901
- Why does she always do that to me?
- It's okay.

922
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,277
You...

923
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:12,197
you ain't even got no eye.

924
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,866
And you...

925
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,286
you ain't even a real girl.

926
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,704
All of y'all.

927
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,289
I don't get y'all.

928
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,500
How do any of y'all even get out of bed,

929
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,877
being so weird?

930
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,837
Shut up.

931
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,135
What'd you say, girl boy?

932
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:37,889
I said, "Shut up."

933
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,141
And my name's Joseph.

934
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,894
Call me Joseph like a normal person.

935
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,563
You're not a normal person.

936
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,148
Don't talk about him like that.

937
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,566
Be sweet, Hell-No.

938
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,444
We're just doing our badge.

939
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,530
He didn't mean any harm.

940
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,698
ANNE-CLAIRE: He ours.

941
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,533
He our fellow Birdie Scout.

942
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,993
He's a freak.

943
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,995
No, you are.

944
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,039
Just let her say what she wants.

945
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,708
Don't matter.

946
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,335
I need this badge, though.

947
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,671
(sighs)

948
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,340
- It does too matter.
- (Joseph whimpers)

949
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,842
We funna win.

950
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,969
We funna get on that record.

951
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,807
You're just one piece of dirt
on a bigger piece of dirt.

952
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,311
We're gonna last forever,

953
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,730
and you're just gonna wash away.

954
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,736
(kids gasping)

955
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,031
(scattered laughter)

956
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,284
Oh, hell no.

957
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,244
(Piper gasps, others gasping)

958
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:42,787
(scoffs)

959
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,914
Let's get 'em!

960
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,584
(kids yelling)

961
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,842
(laughter, yelling)

962
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,017
Flour!

963
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,978
(yelling continues)

964
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,649
(laughing)

965
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,655
(gasping)

966
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:20,700
Stop!

967
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,382
(gasps)

968
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:36,966
(laughing)

969
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,719
Act right, y'all! Act right!

970
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,846
- Holy mother...
- (blows whistle)

971
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,307
Piper, stop!

972
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,017
Stop! You are sweet.

973
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,727
You are sweet!

974
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,896
Where are my young ladies?

975
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,231
Right here.

976
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,732
(sighs)

977
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:55,652
MASSEY: I have never seen

978
00:44:55,735 --> 00:45:00,281
such delinquency, such a lack of hygiene.

979
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,952
Oh, the trash, the trash of it all!

980
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,830
And y'all... y'all were raised better.

981
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,249
Troop Zero...

982
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,752
...you were so close.

983
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:15,588
You blazed through
all the badges on your level.

984
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:16,923
They sure in hell did.

985
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,134
- They're sorry.
- I ain't sorry.

986
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:22,387
MASSEY: Starting fights, acting ugly.

987
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,639
Y'all suspended.

988
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,391
(kids gasping, murmuring,
scattered laughter)

989
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,476
Oh, come on.

990
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,438
Can't I just use the cafeteria
to get my Baking badge?

991
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,898
No, ma'am. No.

992
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,276
I can't even pretend
y'all are cute anymore.

993
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,652
It's sad.

994
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,821
Sad, sad, sad.

995
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,532
And, my troop, y'all are on thin ice.

996
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,576
Let's go. Get on out.

997
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,494
- (Smash growling)
- Piper. Come on, get.

998
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,246
(Anne-Claire sneezes)

999
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,873
And y'all clean this mess up.

1000
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,675
(bell jingles)

1001
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,136
- Family special.
- WAITRESS: Coming right up.

1002
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,221
(quiet chatter)

1003
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,770
Think y'all would be happier just doing...

1004
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:17,567
I don't know... Bible school
or FFA or just watching TV.

1005
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,571
Whatever happened to watching TV?

1006
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,823
I can't give up.

1007
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:26,534
I mean, there must be
one badge I can earn.

1008
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,745
RAYLEEN: If y'all even get to Jamboree,

1009
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,081
which you won't, y'all ain't gonna win.

1010
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,709
I mean, I'm sorry, but...

1011
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,504
I wish someone had told me that.

1012
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,297
HELL-NO: No Jamboree?

1013
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,925
I made a dance, though.

1014
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,718
I really want to tell y'all
what you want to hear,

1015
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,095
but this situation just ain't salvageable.

1016
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,847
(sighs)

1017
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:49,807
(fierce grunt, Anne-Claire gasps)

1018
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,184
JOSEPH: Could've been gone from here.

1019
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,852
I could've been famous.

1020
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:55,271
I wanted to leave a permanent record.

1021
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,732
We still can.

1022
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,778
(Smash growls)

1023
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:02,862
(yells)

1024
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:04,155
- (banging on window)
- Smash!

1025
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,281
Quit it!

1026
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,616
- (kids chattering)
- Smash, come back.

1027
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,826
- (Smash growling)
- Calm down.

1028
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,203
(door opens, kids shouting)

1029
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,329
Smash, come back!

1030
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,455
- No, come on!
- Come on, Smash.

1031
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,790
This ain't us.

1032
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,500
- (Smash roaring)
- This is some candy-ass,

1033
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,627
B-grade version of us
'cause we ain't got nobody

1034
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,504
- to show us how to be better.
- Hey!

1035
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,548
Show us.

1036
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,467
Be that one for us, please.

1037
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,802
No one was that for me.

1038
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,595
Yeah, well, it can be different now.

1039
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,472
It's never gonna be different.

1040
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:32,141
Your life is gonna be the same
as you are right now.

1041
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,143
The sooner you learn that, the better.

1042
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,400
That can't be true.

1043
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,151
'Cause I'll die.

1044
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:44,487
(kids continue shouting outside)

1045
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,197
- (door opens)
- JOSEPH: You were running after her

1046
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,574
- just the same.
- HELL-NO: That doesn't mean

1047
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,117
you can yell at her like that.

1048
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,618
ANNE-CLAIRE: Will y'all help me
with this window?

1049
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:51,869
(whistle blares, chatter stops)

1050
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:55,206
Sit down! Sit down.

1051
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,918
Okay?

1052
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,087
(sighs) One badge. One more badge.

1053
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,047
Uh-uh. Give me that.

1054
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,257
(grunts)

1055
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:13,474
Surviving in the Wilderness.

1056
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,020
Like Jesus.

1057
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,938
(Smash sighs)

1058
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,528
(indistinct chatter)

1059
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,784
Enjoy your suspension.

1060
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,870
- CHRISTMAS: Ow!
- (laughter)

1061
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,205
- Wow.
- Stay down, bed wetter.

1062
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,166
RAYLEEN: We do not stay down

1063
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,417
because they tell us to, Christmas.

1064
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,085
That is a "no, ma'am."

1065
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,880
- (school bell ringing)
- (laughter, chatter)

1066
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:47,467
- Smash get a snack break?
- Hunger is good for you.

1067
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,053
You starving us. You putting us in danger.

1068
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,680
Y'all in danger every day.

1069
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,974
(birds calling, indistinct chatter)

1070
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,232
We ain't going into
the South Woods, are we?

1071
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:06,235
It's time y'all learned
to take it by the horns.

1072
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:11,407
HELL-NO: Smash, wait up.

1073
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:12,909
Smash.

1074
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,952
JOSEPH: I heard someone died in there.

1075
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,335
(kids chattering indistinctly)

1076
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,462
RAYLEEN: Don't touch nothing.

1077
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,592
(ominous birdcalls)

1078
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,136
JOSEPH: What was that? I'm ascared.

1079
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,263
Will it be fast when I die?

1080
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:35,807
RAYLEEN: Y'all get ahold of y'all selves.

1081
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,350
(kids chattering, gasping)

1082
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,102
(shuddering breaths)

1083
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,062
(screaming)

1084
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,564
(other kids laughing)

1085
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,652
Go. Go.

1086
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,612
(Joseph screams, other kids laugh)

1087
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,823
(various birdcalls, insects trilling)

1088
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,741
CHRISTMAS: And it's really cool

1089
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,952
because the aliens, th-they'll hear us

1090
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,370
because the sound waves,

1091
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,288
they go out, out, out into the universe

1092
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:00,415
until they hit something, then...

1093
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,166
That is not how it works.

1094
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,543
CHRISTMAS: Yeah, it is. My mama said.

1095
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,877
RAYLEEN: All right, now, y'all.

1096
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:07,964
We sleeping here?

1097
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,841
I'm not gonna sleep with Christmas.

1098
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,092
She funna pee on me.

1099
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,010
- I don't wet the bed.
- Yes-huh.

1100
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,721
- (murmuring)
- Y'all stop acting ugly.

1101
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,639
Smash.

1102
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:17,890
All right, my boos.

1103
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,435
It's time y'all earned
that badge fair and square.

1104
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,978
You leaving us?

1105
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,855
(stammers) We funna die.

1106
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,314
Ah, hell, hell no, I can't stay...

1107
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,400
Hell yes, Hell-No.

1108
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,402
And when y'all wake up
in the morning, y'all know that

1109
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,695
you spent the night in the wilderness,

1110
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,071
didn't no one help you.

1111
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,990
(whispers): What if we don't...

1112
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,491
All right, prove 'em wrong.

1113
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:36,909
- Make me proud.
- (kids murmuring)

1114
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,537
But what if we don't wake up?

1115
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,623
(kids clamoring)

1116
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,676
(night birds calling)

1117
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:58,639
Yea, though I walk through

1118
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,099
the valley of the shadow of death...

1119
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,517
(branch snaps nearby, Joseph gasps)

1120
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,729
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me...

1121
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,814
(prayer continues indistinctly)

1122
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,526
(bird squawking, animal squeaking)

1123
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,822
(radio static warbling)

1124
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,575
(rock music playing, Smash chuckles)

1125
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,292
DJ (over radio): It's rockin' WZPZ Rock.

1126
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,170
Coming up, David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel."

1127
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,757
(intro to "Rebel Rebel" plays)

1128
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,426
(chuckles): My dear and holy God.

1129
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,639
(music continues loudly, laughter)

1130
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,853

1145
00:52:30,857 --> 00:52:32,608
when we're together like this?

1146
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,986
Is our signal stronger?

1147
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,571
I think it is.

1148
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,533
(song ends)

1149
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,951
(quiet fart)

1150
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,078
- JOSEPH: Oh, Smash.
- ANNE-CLAIRE: Smash.

1151
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,497
(birds chirping, hooting)

1152
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:48,416
CHRISTMAS: If there is wild animals,

1153
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,294
I funna spit scuppernong seeds
in their eyes and blind them.

1154
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,588
And then... then they'll
run off and be scared.

1155
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,840
They'll be the ones who's scared.

1156
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,843
'Cause I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

1157
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,469
(Hell-No growls, Christmas screams)

1158
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,597
(laughing)

1159
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,893
Hell-No.

1160
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,770
You're out of the circle of protection.

1161
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,314
I don't need it.

1162
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,773
- Yes, you do.
- Nuh-uh.

1163
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,442
- Yes-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

1164
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,319
It's fixin' to be a meteor shower.

1165
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:20,197
Just... just go over there
and look for it.

1166
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,910
I'm responsible for you
not getting ate in the wilderness.

1167
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,579
Now, come sleep with the rest of us.

1168
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,165
I can't.

1169
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,417
- Why not?
- Because.

1170
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,589
And it's not true
that I wet the bed, but...

1171
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,426
...if I did,

1172
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,971
maybe, whenever I get
emotional or nervous,

1173
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,807
and maybe that's when I'd pee on stuff.

1174
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,143
If I did, I wouldn't know why.

1175
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,899
I used to wet the bed.

1176
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,234
Really?

1177
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,278
(laughs): Nah.

1178
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,449
But if I did, I'd be shamed.

1179
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,242
How come you pee the bed?

1180
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,162
- Can't help it?
- I don't.

1181
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,081
Okay.

1182
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,089
But maybe if I did...

1183
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,508
time was right after my mama's death,

1184
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,593
and then I couldn't stop.

1185
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:29,016
And so, you-you can just go, you know.

1186
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,602
I leave, and you die
all alone in the wild,

1187
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:33,187
covered in your own pee,

1188
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,855
and you'll miss every meteor shower

1189
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,191
that will ever happen
the whole rest of your life

1190
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,193
'cause you be dead.

1191
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,697
I'm gonna tell you some scary
stories to keep you awake.

1192
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,117
- Please don't.
- Too late.

1193
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,370
One night, in the pouring rain,

1194
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:53,207
a girl hears on the radio,
"Lock the doors.

1195
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,668
There's a maniac!"

1196
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,421
And all that was left of her...

1197
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,840
was her hand,

1198
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:04,427
scratching at the door.

1199
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,640
And when she came out,
she never spoke again,

1200
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:13,978
and her hair was bright white.

1201
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,814
- Bright white?
- Yeah.

1202
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,781
Christmas. Christmas.

1203
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,783
- What do you want?
- Get up.

1204
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,368
Get up now. Now.

1205
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,870
Look.

1206
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,223
Think they might have been peacemakers

1207
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,142
sent from-from the giant caterpillar?

1208
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,393
JOSEPH: Ah, something bit me.

1209
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:55,561
There is no giant caterpillar.

1210
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:56,812
- Yeah, there is.
- Yeah, there is.

1211
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:57,938
No, there isn't.

1212
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,106
How do y'all believe in that?

1213
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,357
ANNE-CLAIRE: Look what I found.

1214
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,526
I brought scuppernongs.

1215
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,361
- Hmm?
- Okay.

1216
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,905
I want one.

1217
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,115
- Three.
- Don't take all of them, now.

1218
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,201
Give me some.

1219
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:11,911
Mm-hmm.

1220
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,500
Anyone comes for you again,
I'm gonna beat their ass

1221
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,503
back to their gosh damn swamp shack.

1222
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:23,297
(laughs): Just come at them
with hair like that.

1223
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,301
(gasps)

1224
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,762
My boos! Y'all did it!

1225
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,722
Come on, get up.

1226
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:33,599
You done it, Christmas.

1227
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,768
- (laughing)
- There you go.

1228
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,354
(laughs) We funna go to Jamboree!

1229
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,064
CHRISTMAS: Yes, ma'am.

1230
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,233
(kids laughing)

1231
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,403
(chuckles): We got it, Miss Massey.

1232
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,405
We're gonna go to Jamboree.

1233
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,698
ANNE-CLAIRE: Praise the living Jesus.

1234
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:51,700
- And we funna win, too.
- (Smash grunts)

1235
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,910
We funna dance.

1236
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,620
Me and Christmas
made a dance that's amazing.

1237
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,373
Y'all have a lot to be proud of.

1238
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,958
Y'all do. I'm not even playing.

1239
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,167
CHRISTMAS (laughing): We're gonna go.

1240
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,836
- We are.
- We're going.

1241
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,045
(kids laughing)

1242
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,756
(sighs) Oh, precious.

1243
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,633
You're not.

1244
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:08,759
(thunder rumbling)

1245
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,261
We are. (chuckles)

1246
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,596
They don't have a legitimate troop leader.

1247
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,557
It's so, so sad,

1248
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,642
but what I discovered last night

1249
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,270
when I consulted statute 12,

1250
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,897
section eight of the Birdie Scout Code...

1251
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:24,191
Here it is.

1252
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:27,153
Troop Mothers must not have
any prior arrests.

1253
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,738
And, Miss Rayleen, don't you have one?

1254
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,448
- No convictions.
- For an incident

1255
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,867
in which a gentleman's tires were slashed,

1256
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,493
his trailer broken into,

1257
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,328
and all his mounted deer heads
spray-painted pink.

1258
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,330
- You can't prove it was me.
- It was you.

1259
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,833
- Nuh-uh.
- Yes-huh.

1260
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,836
(thunder rumbling, rain pattering)

1261
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:47,047
That gentleman, if you recall...
and I think you do...

1262
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,924
was some fool named Yellow-Teeth Davis

1263
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:51,510
that saw a lot of silly-ass girls
back in the day.

1264
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,013
And the reason why
Yellow-Teeth Davis wasn't at home

1265
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,765
when his trailer got broke into
is 'cause he was running around

1266
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,517
with one or more of those silly-ass girls

1267
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,728
instead of being
at my house like he promised

1268
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,897
to pick me up to take me
to Boutte's Chicken.

1269
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,232
And then I started wondering
what was wrong with me

1270
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:07,902
that made him treat me like trash.

1271
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,862
And then I waited so long figuring out

1272
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,239
what was wrong with me
that I didn't go to law school

1273
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,866
and I missed my whole life.

1274
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:16,160
(thunder rumbling)

1275
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:21,081
But lately, I've been wondering,

1276
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,875
"You know what, Rayleen?

1277
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,960
Who cares what people want?

1278
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,921
What do you want?"

1279
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,423
So, from now on, my life is on me,

1280
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,383
not some fool with crowded yellow teeth

1281
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,219
that put dead deer all over his walls.

1282
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,012
It's on me.

1283
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,847
And I feel sorry for you, Miss Massey,

1284
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:38,432
'cause you gonna spend your whole life

1285
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,226
trying to impress fools,

1286
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:43,229
and you ain't never gonna
be enough for them, either.

1287
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,439
What ever happened to you, Krystal?

1288
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,863
You a bad example.

1289
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,657
This is my example.

1290
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,243
(thunder rumbling)

1291
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:01,330
I'm going to law school,
you sad snake lady.

1292
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,540
I don't like being like this.

1293
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:06,043
I don't like being Nasty Miss Massey.

1294
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,294
(kicks desk)

1295
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,546
Y'all will find life gets easier

1296
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,507
if you don't want so much.

1297
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,592
(thunder rumbling)

1298
00:59:13,676 --> 00:59:16,262
- CHRISTMAS: Hey!
- "Hey" yourself.

1299
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,264
What'd you mean, law school?

1300
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,975
I mean I'm out. I'm out.

1301
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,812
I can see about law school.
I can see about a job.

1302
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:26,313
You leaving me?

1303
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,483
There's no leaving you
if I was never with you.

1304
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,485
You're supposed to stay here with me.

1305
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,322
How can you ask me to be there for you

1306
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,908
when I was never there for myself?

1307
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:43,497
So, is it over?

1308
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,876
We find a new Troop Mama now.

1309
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,670
Everyone we know got felonies.

1310
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,588
There ain't no one else.

1311
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,215
Why'd you make me want it so bad?

1312
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,845
I never wanted anything, and I was fine!

1313
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,596
Hell-No!

1314
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,143
Why'd you do this to me?

1315
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,394
I was happy before this.

1316
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,772
I was happy before I thought
I could talk to anyone or be permanent.

1317
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,774
Why'd you make me so unsatisfied?

1318
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:11,942
(Christmas grunts)

1319
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,652
Stay down!

1320
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:16,530
You can't tell me to stay down!

1321
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,907
Jesus wept.

1322
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,869
(thunder rumbling)

1323
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,750
Hell-No!

1324
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,002
- Get away from me!
- Don't leave me!

1325
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,462
Why don't you just leave me alone!

1326
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,588
No!

1327
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,965
We funna be permanent!

1328
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,015
You're a dang fool.

1329
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,017
(whimpers) Nuh-uh.

1330
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,478
- Yes-huh.
- Nuh-uh!

1331
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,771
(panting)

1332
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,647
HELL-NO: No one ever chased me before.

1333
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,692
(both laughing)

1334
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:56,278
Here's your damn sash.

1335
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:58,322
(both laughing)

1336
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,993
(sighs)

1337
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,540
(birds chirping, insects trilling)

1338
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:11,001
(country music playing)

1339
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:13,045
RAMSEY: Now, you said you borrowed it,

1340
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,798
but you didn't say whether
they knew you borrowed it.

1341
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,050
Do they know you borrowed it?

1342
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:21,011
(indistinct chatter over phone)

1343
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,806
Now, hold up. Hold on.

1344
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,641
These little boos need a mama.

1345
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,851
Uh, Miss Rayleen, I ain't their mama.

1346
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,229
- (chuckles)
- You are now.

1347
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,235
MAN (over phone): Boss, you there?

1348
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,778
Let me call you back.

1349
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,988
(chuckles)

1350
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:43,700
You ask for the boss man,
the boss man steps up.

1351
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,620
- Big Eddie, let's go.
- Joseph!

1352
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,455
EDDIE: Sam, Buddy, Robby, let's go!

1353
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,917
Miss Massey gonna learn a thing or two.

1354
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,294
Nancy. Mary.

1355
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,671
Let's go.

1356
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,798
WOMAN: Y'all gonna want to see this.

01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,633

1372
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,629
I ain't got time for this, Ramsey Flint.

1373
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,006
Listen, devil woman.

1374
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,799
I read your rule book.

1375
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,677
Nobody beat the boss man
when it come to rule books.

1376
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,474
Nothing in that book say
the Troop Mother has to be female.

1377
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:52,603
Therefore, I am proud
to be the Troop Mother

1378
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,813
for Birdie Scout Troop Zero of Wiggly.

1379
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:58,233
There are ways things are done, Mr. Flint.

1380
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,944
What kind of world
would it be if every homely,

1381
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:03,864
strange little girl
thought she could just go out

1382
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,616
and do whatever she wanted?

1383
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:09,411
To be laughed at
and humiliated and ruined?

1384
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,622
I'm helping them more than you do.

1385
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,374
You think this was easy for me?

1386
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,128
These are our girls. All of us.

1387
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:20,005
Whole damn town of Wiggly.

1388
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:22,090
I don't care how many eyes they got

1389
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,051
or who wet the bed or...

1390
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,095
if some of them debatable as girls.

1391
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:31,308
They our Birdies,
and I'm their Troop Mama.

1392
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,685
- (crowd murmuring)
- WOMAN: You tell her, Ramsey.

1393
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:38,232
How you gonna pay the $500 entry fee?

1394
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,359
Son of a puppy.

1395
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,153
Five...

1396
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,947
It costs money to pay
for these judges' time.

1397
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,449
You got $500, Ramsey Flint?

1398
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:48,784
You don't.

1399
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,663
Because Ramsey Flint,
he just keeps on losing.

1400
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,840
You know I'd give you

1401
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,343
the whole gosh damn
solar system if I could.

1402
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,303
Yeah, I know that.

1403
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,146
WOMAN: Mr. Ramsey?

1404
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:24,695
I know I've been owing you 50 for a while.

1405
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,071
Thanks.

1406
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,323
And this is for Big Sam's legal fees.

1407
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:31,827
And the broken furniture.

1408
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,998
Buddy's public... urination.

1409
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,791
A-And Robby's truancy.

1410
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,460
I-I'm sorry it took me so long
to get it to you, Ramsey.

1411
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,963
- That's all right.
- (woman clears throat)

1412
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,591
You know what for.

1413
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:48,010
- Yeah.
- WOMAN: Here you go, Ramsey.

1414
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,886
Oh. Thank you.

1415
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,847
- WOMAN: Here's mine.
- RAMSEY: Thank you.

1416
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,515
Ramsey, I got 17.

1417
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,730
What you don't seem
to understand, Miss Massey,

1418
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,566
I'm the boss man,

1419
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,694

01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,241
- MAN: Yeah!
- (murmuring, laughter)

1422
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,493
- Good day, ma'am.
- MAN: Yeah, Ramsey!

1423
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,953
- Let's fall out!
- Falling out.

1424
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:16,955
- All right, here we go.
- (whooping, applause)

1425
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,749
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

1426
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,792
♪ No more to roam ♪

1427
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:23,545
♪ In the search of fortune and fame ♪

1428
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,756
♪ The hand of fate... ♪

1429
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,342
CHRISTMAS: If it's all gonna be okay,

1430
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,511
will you please give me a sign?

1431
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,472
Anything?

1432
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,725
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

1433
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,104
DWAYNE: Look, I know
one thing... y'all funna win.

1434
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,231
- Oh...
- No, I can feel it.

1435
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,151
That's gas. You eat like
you got a train to catch.

1436
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,444
- DWAYNE: Nah.
- (laughter)

1437
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,279
What if I lose in front of everybody?

1438
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:50,864
Ah, so what?

1439
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,203
Boss, get over here.

1440
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,246
Yes, sir.

1441
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,959
Sit here.

1442
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:09,257
Boss, you know I lose
in front of everybody

1443
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,717
- every day.
- RAYLEEN: Mm-hmm.

1444
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,386
- (laughter)
- Sure as hell do.

1445
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,306
When the judge says to me it's over,

1446
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,226
I go over to the prosecution,
and I shake their hand.

1447
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,144
Give me your hand.

1448
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:24,106
'Cause that show them they may beat me,

1449
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,233
but I'm strong as hell,

1450
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,403
and one day, maybe tomorrow,

1451
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,613
I'll kick their ass.

1452
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,949
Right?

1453
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:36,284
But you still lost.

1454
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,911
(laughs)

1455
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,289
Yeah, boss, but it's the principle.

1456
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:46,086
- What?
- Forget it.

1457
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,880
- You a little young for it.
- JOSEPH: Christmas!

1458
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,173
Christmas!

1459
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,968
RAMSEY: Not too long. Big day tomorrow.

1460
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,303
Y'all gonna win. I can feel it. I know it.

1461
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,930
You know you're drunk again.

1462
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:57,931
- Nah.
- (Rayleen laughs)

1463
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:58,974
RAMSEY: You're drunk.

1464
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:00,517
Yeah, he drunk as all hell.

1465
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,227
- You drunk.
- Yeah.

1466
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:06,148
And you the best damn employee I ever had.

1467
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,734
Well, I'm the only one that
hasn't stole from you, so...

1468
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:10,736
(laughter)

1469
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:14,948
You know, I-I don't want you
breaking my daughter's heart.

1470
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,451
Well, it's gonna break
if she let one of those

1471
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,619
nasty girls tell her who she is.

1472
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,038
Well, now, that ain't what I mean.

1473
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,832
What do you mean?

1474
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,459
You could, uh...

1475
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,879
you could stay, right?

1476
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,883
I can't.

1477
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,302
There's a spot at Emory.
I start in the fall.

1478
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,304
Yeah. All right.

1479
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,682
I-I know. I know.

1480
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:44,269
(chuckles): We'll be fine.

1481
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:46,229
We'll be just fine.

1482
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,148
(quiet chatter)

1483
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,152
RAMSEY: Come on.

1484
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,862
BOY: Hurry up!

1485
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,655
RAMSEY: Come on, get on, get on.

1486
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,407
(indistinct chatter)

1487
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:59,367
WOMAN: Here you go, honey.

1488
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,369
Here you go.

1489
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:06,249
WOMAN: Here you go, baby.

1490
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,418
- What it is, Dwayne?
- What you say, boss?

1491
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:12,047
Where'd you get that bike?
Dwayne, you are on parole.

1492
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,133
I'm gonna give it back. I...
Look, I'm here for protection.

1493
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,135
Yeah, I just, I just want to do

1494
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:18,845
something nice, Miss Rayleen.

1495
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,932
Dear God, blanket us with protection,

1496
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,767
and I ask, God,

1497
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,603
give these children
a long life with no fears.

1498
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,105
And that you put the love
that's on your heart

1499
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,148
unto my heart.

1500
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,150
Shut your face up.

1501
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:34,820
You don't know what you talking about.

1502
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,404
See you in Marietta.

1503
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,281
(grunts excitedly)

1504
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:40,283
(motorcycle engine starts)

1505
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,286
(excited chatter outside)

1506
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,957
(bus brakes hiss)

1507
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,923
(horn honking, engine backfires)

1508
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,305
Hey, that's my motorcycle.

1509
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:04,015
He stole that.

1510
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:53,607
(brakes squealing)

1511
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,152
All right.

1512
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,904
Here we are.

1513
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,405
(Ramsey grunts)

1514
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,159
Prepare for battle.

1515
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,912
(chuckles)

1516
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,955
(Rayleen sighs)

1517
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,716
I want y'all to know that y'all my boos.

1518
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,093
And I wish I had y'all around

1519
01:10:22,177 --> 01:10:25,722
when I was little and dumb and sweet.

1520
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:30,101
Come on, we funna win.

1521
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:32,395
- We funna win! Come on.
- (light laughter)

1522
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:34,481
(Rayleen chuckles)

1523
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,530
Hey.

1524
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,658
"Hey" yourself.

1525
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,912
Uh, if I was, um...

1526
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:55,752
If I got on the record, I'd be important.

1527
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,631
And you'd stay here with me.

1528
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:02,008
Oh, God.

1529
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,928
I'm gonna be all alone again.

1530
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,429
You are not alone.

1531
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,014
- Yeah, I am.
- No...

1532
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,557
And you don't need that record.

1533
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,310
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

1534
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:15,981
Who's smarter, me or you?

1535
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,692
- You.
- Right now.

1536
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,903
When you speak, it creates a sound wave,

1537
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,489
and then it vibrates through the air,

1538
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,449
and it keeps traveling out.

1539
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,159
That means, if someone's listening

1540
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:30,870
for life on this Earth,
they gonna hear you.

1541
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,706
Are you sure that's even true?

1542
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,917
Shoot, no.

1543
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,086
Probably not.

1544
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,255
(sighs)

1545
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:43,883
Probably all you can wish for

1546
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,594
is someone fool enough to show up.

1547
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,971
RAMSEY: Hey, you want me to help?

1548
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,556
DWAYNE: I got it, I got it.

1549
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,641
- RAMSEY: I don't mind helping.
- DWAYNE: I got it.

1550
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:52,767
RAMSEY: Now, the wings, you can't...

1551
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:54,602
Hey, I don't want them to bend.

1552
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,604
- Big Eddie, you got that?
- EDDIE: I got it.

1553
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,732
- I-I'm cool. I got it.
- All right. I'm happy to help.

1554
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,108
(kids laughing)

1555
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,360
EDDIE: Hold on to that rocket, all right?

1556
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,237
Coming down. Coming down.

1557
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,239
- Let's fall out!
- Coming down!

1558
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,949
We funna kick some butt today.

1559
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,701
DWAYNE: Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1560
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,120
- Got it?
- Pull it on down.

1561
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,164
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1562
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,750
Oh, oh, oh, I ain't got it.
I ain't got it.

1563
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,631
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

1564
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,306
GIRL: Don't touch.

1565
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:32,849
Stop.

1566
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,477
(indistinct chatter continues)

1567
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,562
(gasps) Bed wetter.

1568
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,736
(woman chuckles)

1569
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,946
RAMSEY: All right. Troop Zero, Wiggly.

1570
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,490
Oh. (chuckles)

1571
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,284
Precious. And you are?

1572
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,702
Oh, uh, Ramsey Flint.

1573
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:54,454
- Troop Mama.
- Oh.

1574
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,414
(chuckling): Isn't that something?

1575
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,124
Hmm.

1576
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,585
Did y'all bring your... your fees?

1577
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,295
Oh. (laughs) Of course I got it.

1578
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,838
Yeah, that's part of Jamboree.

1579
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:05,340
(chuckles): Yeah, there you go.

1580
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,800
Thank you.

1581
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,635
I'm gonna need you to count that, please.

1582
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,428
Well, we look forward

1583
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:13,306
to seeing what you little girls
are made of. (chuckles)

1584
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,601
Uh-huh. What is it, angel?

1585
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,604
We're made of organs and tissues.

1586
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,314
(chuckles)

1587
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,316
You guys got a latrine here?

1588
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,818
Mm-hmm, we do have a latrine.

1589
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,487
We have about eight latrines all around.

1590
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,905
They are made for little girls,

1591
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,615
so you're gonna have to squeeze in there.

1592
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,033
I could just use the woods.

1593
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:33,952
Do not use the woods. I repeat,

1594
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,412
- do not use the woods.
- All right. All right.

1595
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:38,248
Well, y'all have some time to rehearse,

1596
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:41,960
and then we will see you
over in the tent at 4:00.

1597
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,378
Let's fall out.

1598
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,131
See you by 4:00 for the show. (chuckles)

1599
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:48,716
Fly, Birdies, to that tent,

1600
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,469
'cause at Jamboree, fun and talent abound.

1601
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:53,346
Don't get too loose with that fun, though,

1602
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,807
'cause you are being judged.

1603
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,309
- Let's have a blast.
- (feedback squealing)

1604
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,520
The tent at 4:00.

1605
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:29,591
They are judging us. Do you understand?

1606
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,176
Act right.

1607
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:33,136
(quiet chatter)

1608
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,099
Welcome, Birdies, to Jamboree.

1609
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:41,060

- (applause, cheering)

1610
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,937
Yes.

1611
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,232
Now...

1612
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:48,902
you have all worked so hard to get here,

1613
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,070
and that work is not gonna stop now,

1614
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,323
because this... this is the place

1615
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,283
where we're gonna see
the best of the best.

1616
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,077
And who knows?
There may be a little bit of

1617
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:01,122
international prestige
in with this as well.

1618
01:15:01,206 --> 01:15:03,499
- (applause)
- Uh, Dr. Persad.

1619
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:08,004
Young ladies are here on this Earth

1620
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,424
to create beauty
wherever they set their feet.

1621
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,384
So go on, now.

1622
01:15:13,468 --> 01:15:15,720
Show us your gifts.

1623
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,681
We're gonna begin
with Troop 28 from Moultrie.

1624
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,391

Knock-knock. Who's there?

1627
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,412
- (chuckles) The Holy Spirit.
- MAN: Amen.

1628
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:45,833

1754
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,682
We have seen some examples today:

1755
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,560
of how to be...

1756
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,480
and how not to be. (chuckles)

1757
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,567
Y'all, we've come to possibly

1758
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,319
the most exciting part of the day.

1759
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:36,447
Dr. Persad is gonna hand out the awards.

1760
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,783
Here he is. Dr. Persad.

1761
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:40,326
(applause)

1762
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,540
(applause ends)

1763
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:53,964
We were really touched by
the courage every troop showed.

1764
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:56,967
It wasn't an easy call to make, because...

1765
01:24:57,051 --> 01:25:00,763
what does "the best"
even mean in the big picture?

1766
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:04,600
Who decides what's good, what's worth it?

1767
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:08,479
Who knows?

1768
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:11,649
The winner of this year's Jamboree...

1769
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:15,861
and the troop whose voice
will go into outer space

1770
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:18,405
- is Troop Five from Wiggly.
- (cheering)

1771
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:22,660
Congratulations to our
ambassadors of the human race.

1772
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:25,538
You all right, boo?

1773
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:29,333
PERSAD: If there's life out
there, they'll know about you.

1774
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:35,339
EMCEE: Thank you, and
congratulations to Troop Five.

1775
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,550
You sparkly Birdies. (laughs)

1776
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,677
You sequined lovelies.

1777
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,179
Oh, inspiring, inspiring.

1778
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:44,348
How inspiring in all capital letters...

1779
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,058
Congratulations.

1780
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,937
You gonna be okay, Christmas?

1781
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,689
- Oh, heck yeah.
- EMCEE: Simply the best.

1782
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,357
- You?
- And that's what we're

1783
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,901
working for here at Jamboree:
to be clearly the best

1784
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:58,487
and to clearly beat everyone else here,

1785
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:00,322
and they did it, y'all.

1786
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:03,951
Now, Mr. Persad, can you please record?

1787
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,411
(girls laughing)

1788
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:09,248
Can you give me a puff?

1789
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,839
PERSAD: So, who'll come up
for the statement?

1790
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:21,302
Whenever you're ready.

1791
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:25,264
Greetings from the children
of planet Earth.

1792
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,641
I hope you kick everybody's ass
in law school.

1793
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,894
PIPER: The human race
is beautiful and peaceful...

1794
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:31,979
Hmm. Sure. (scoffs)

1795
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:33,606
You will, though.

1796
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,275
PIPER: ...tells you who we were. (giggles)

1797
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,736
Don't take shit from anybody.

1798
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:41,530
(scattered applause, whooping)

1799
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,659
EMCEE: Thank you, Piper.

1800
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:49,079
What a perfect representation
of a Birdie. (chuckles)

1801
01:26:49,163 --> 01:26:51,165
That just warms up my heart.

1802
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,542
No, you can finish it.

1803
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,503
You always did.

1804
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,297
EMCEE: ...and raise our voices in song.

1805
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,258
Let's do that Birdie anthem, y'all.

I'm proud of you, Major Tom.

1820
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,928
I miss Mama.

1821
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:51,767
I know I'm not supposed to tell you that.

1822
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,437
But I miss her.

1823

Hey, um...

1825
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:02,945
you can tell me anything.

1826
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,906
Ain't nothing you can't tell the boss man.

1827
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:13,163
I'd do anything if you could have her.

1828
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:20,379
But it's... it's gonna have to
be just you and me, Christmas.

1829
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:25,467
Just the way it's got to be, I guess.

1830
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,639
I wish I, uh...

1831
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:32,725
I wish I could be better.

1832
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,520
Nah.

1833
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:41,108
