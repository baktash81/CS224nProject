1
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:43,038
Before Rome, before Babylon,
before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.

2
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:47,205
KAHNDAQ, 2600 BC

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,685
The first self-governing people on Earth,

4
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,648
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

5
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,196
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:05,139
But then...

7
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:11,058
came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:15,724
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,374
But he had even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,400
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:31,848
Ahk-Ton's real goal
was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:40,183
If infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world,

13
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,328
it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,166
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

15
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,149
A rare mineral of magic properties,
found only in Kahndaq.

16
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:51,820
So he enslaved his own people...

17
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,671
and forced them to dig.

18
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,287
Eternium.

19
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,134
Eternium.

20
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,741
Eternium.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,683
Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

22
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:30,937
What they needed...

23
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,035
Get off him.

24
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:35,651
Get off him.

25
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,783
...was a hero.

26
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:41,255
Why are we fighting each other?

27
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,036
Remember who our real enemy is.

28
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,776
Come with me.

29
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,100
Look. Eternium.

30
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,094
Let me see that.

31
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,431
The king thanks you.

32
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,450
He's supposed to reward him.

33
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:01,810
Is that right?

34
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:03,555
I want what I'm owed.

35
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,610
You want a reward?

36
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,537
The king thanks you for your service.

37
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,495
You want the king's reward too?

38
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,865
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

39
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,858
I won't always be here to protect you.

40
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:41,717
I don't need protection.

41
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,212
I want to be free.

42
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,837
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

43
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,619
Let someone else be the hero...

44
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,859
the graveyards are full of them.

45
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,171
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

46
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:00,014
Someone to hold the hopes of the people.

47
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,984
Even when all hope seems lost.

48
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:09,047
If we had more heroes...

49
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,156
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

50
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,001
Freedom.

51
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:43,133
King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark
could quickley ignite a fire.

52
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,152
And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.

53
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,985
They thought they were getting a martyr.

54
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,231
Instead...

55
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,718
they got a miracle.

56
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:11,036
The Council of Wizards,
the magical guardians of the earth...

57
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,805
You have been chosen.

58
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:14,834
...sought to restore the balance.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,610
They empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient gods.

60
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,461
And turned a boy...

61
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,617
into a champion.

62
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:24,070
S-H-A-Z-A-M.

63
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,353
Hurry.

64
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,299
Give it to me.

65
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,159
But the crown had already been completed.

66
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:32,027
Give it to me.

67
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,576
And when the Champion arrived
at the palace to challange him...

68
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,999
King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

69
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,621
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

70
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,387
but the Champion was victorious.

71
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:52,210
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac...

72
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:55,273
 so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

73
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:58,611
And the Champion
was never heard from again.

74
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:03,134
KHANDAQ, PRESENT DAY

75
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,666
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

76
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:10,607
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.

77
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,443
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

78
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,322
the Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.

79
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,767
It has been a long, long wait.

80
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,106
Show me your papers.

81
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:42,061
INTERGANG CHECKPOINT
Sector 5 - North Shiruta

82
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:44,530
Have your documentation ready.

83
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,562
It's all our three documents, yeah?

84
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:52,101
Don't judge the picture,
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

85
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,060
Open the back. Need a look inside.

86
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,116
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

87
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,827
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,483
Watch where you're going.
You know the drill, back of the line.

89
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,548
Come on, man, you see me every day.

90
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:27,014
And every day I tell ya,
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

91
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,554
Back of the line, mate.

92
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,573
You're not my mate.

93
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,881
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

94
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:37,088
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

95
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:38,983
from halfway around the world,

96
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,650
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

97
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,198
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

98
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:48,191
oppress our heritage,
and make us wait in lines all day.

99
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:53,072
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

100
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,579
Go on, get out of here.

101
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,193
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,908
DETAIN

103
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,935
Adrianna, we're clear.

104
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:22,152
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

105
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,962
Let's just move the crown first,
and then we can worry about safe.

106
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,794
I got Intergang watching my house.

107
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,680
I gave up my job at the university
and moved four times.

108
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:31,245
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna abandon my country.

109
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm just saying,
no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

110
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,422
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

111
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,577
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

112
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,596
What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

113
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,435
You know it's too dangerous.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

114
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,413
Come on,
I want to help you beat those bastards.

115
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,193
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

116
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:56,026
You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

117
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,226
Go home, do your homework.

118
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:02,266
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

119
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:03,589
Go.

120
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,397
Go, little man. You did good.

121
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:38,604
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

122
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,494
Is that real Eternium?

123
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,400
Show us a little magic.

124
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,580
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

125
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,006
You guys should get some rest.

126
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:49,377
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

127
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,523
Hey, come on. Stop it.

128
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,173
I'm just curious how she got it.

129
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,843
My grandmother gave it to me.

130
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,579
How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

131
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,470
It's a family heirloom,

132
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,771
going all the way back to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

133
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,655
You happy now?

134
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,210
Cool story.

135
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,795
And all I inherited was a sweater.

136
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,534
That's not true.
Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

137
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,493
You know, some women like a bald spot.

138
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:19,161
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

139
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,490
Are you sure about this?

140
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,564
The inscrptions we found are clear.

141
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,351
And I'm positive about that translation.
There is something inside that mountain.

142
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,204
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

143
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,392
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

144
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:02,516
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

145
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:06,749
Get it out of the country if we have to.
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

146
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,291
This is it?

147
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,581
Not yet.

148
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,485
Are you coming?
- Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

149
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:39,049
This way. Almost there.

150
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,708
"Men were given the gift of magic,

151
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:51,749
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

152
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:56,440
Keep reading.

153
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:01,820
"The ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden... here."

154
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,892
Until now.

155
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:08,267
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

156
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:13,933
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs
certain that we want to move it?

157
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,071
We don't have a choice.

158
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,764
What happened to Ishmael?

159
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,506
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

160
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,189
Samir?

161
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,449
Samir, what happened?

162
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,444
What?

163
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,597
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

164
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:00,703
Don't move.
Unless you want to join your mate.

165
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,310
Stay where you are.

166
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:06,150
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

167
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,278
"Turn back."

168
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,176
That's what it says, no?

169
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,490
Yes.

170
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,250
Where is Samir?

171
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:23,130
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

172
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,814
Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

173
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,890
It's a tomb.

174
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,145
"Speak not his power,

175
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,945
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity" Teth Adam.

176
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:57,150
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

177
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,532
The legend was true.

178
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:02,621
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

179
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:06,280
If he was such a hero,
why'd they bury him down here?

180
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,942
The crown.

181
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,746
It's over.

182
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:20,038
Now, give me the crown.

183
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:22,263
Run, Addy. Run.

184
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,545
Hold fire.

185
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:29,538
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

186
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,803
Go. Move.
- Circle around.

187
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,834
Get down.

188
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,007
Say goodbye to your brother.

189
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,455
In five...

190
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:47,559
four...

191
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,077
three...

192
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:50,892
two...

193
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,234
one...

194
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:53,695
I'm over here.

195
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,437
One? You let them get to one?

196
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,923
Any last words?

197
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,585
Please tell my son...

198
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,893
"Mightiest of mortals...

199
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,320
god of gods,

200
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,277
Six Immortal Elders by name..."

201
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:31,146
What?

202
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,253
"Shazam."

203
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,435
Who the hell is that?

204
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,087
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

205
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,112
Check him out.

206
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:09,657
Boss say you go.

207
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,729
Chief say your turn.

208
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:26,872
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

209
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,702
Open fire.

210
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,599
Your magic is weak.

211
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,515
Go. Go.

212
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:38,487
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

213
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,077
Ishmael.

214
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:02,607
Ishmael.

215
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,825
Let's go.
- This is as fast as I can go.

216
00:19:59,904 --> 00:20:02,046
Samir. What happened?

217
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,716
What didn't happen.

218
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,922
Samir fell off of a cliff.

219
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:07,898
I had a gun to my head.

220
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,831
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

221
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:15,260
And you summoned some flying magic man.
All for what?

222
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:16,930
Nothing.

223
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,027
Not for nothing.

224
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:38,976
Light him up.

225
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,513
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

226
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,572
Rotor out. Go. Go.

227
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,728
I can't maintain altitude.

228
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:28,405
Oh, shit.

229
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:36,468
Stop. Stop the van.

230
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:14,158
Behind you.

231
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,705
Did he just catch a rocket?

232
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:22,723
ETERNIUM

233
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,703
God willing, we won't see him again.

234
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,722
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

235
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,650
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

236
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:15,733
Good point.

237
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,808
You get him, you're the electrician.

238
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,953
Raptor team, come in.

239
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,628
What's your status?

240
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,751
Help me.

241
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:37,253
I told you to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

242
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,641
Raptor team, come in. What is your status?

243
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,680
Status is that everyone is dead.

244
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:47,079
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

245
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:51,570
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

246
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:54,810
Do you have it?
- No. But I know who does.

247
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,288
Copy that.
We're en route to your location.

248
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:02,016
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

249
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:05,099
This rare, magical mineral
has been mined for centuries...

250
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:08,244
...reports of an Eternium blast.
It is unknown who or why...

251
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:10,575
...has decimated a number of troops.
We are waiting on...

252
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:13,385
...an unidentified male.
This being is somehow able to harness...

253
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,935
What do you think?

254
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:17,966
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down...

255
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,087
before innocent people start getting hurt.

256
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:21,946
Oh, and good mornig to you, too.

257
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,312
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

258
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,141
He's been asleep for 5,000 years.

259
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,164
He'll be disoriented at first.

260
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:32,521
The longer he has to adapt,
the harder it will be to take him down.

261
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,751
Wheels up in 30.

262
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:36,101
Who's on the team?

263
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:49,549
Welcome.
Please state your name for identification.

264
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:53,124
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr Hall.

265
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,853
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

266
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:55,832
Thanks.

267
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:58,327
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

268
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:02,168
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

269
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,844
Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.

270
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,741
Sounds delightful.

271
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:11,570
But please tell me you found someone
who can pack a punch.

272
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,592
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

273
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:16,676
Al Rothstein,
nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

274
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,737
He inherited his uncle's powers.

275
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:20,110
Uncle Al

276
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:21,459
How's my suit? Does it fit?

277
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:24,167
No, yeah. It's perfect.
Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

278
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,211
You know,
I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

279
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:28,750
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

280
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:30,847
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.

281
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,067
It's Vintage.

282
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,470
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

283
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,583
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

284
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,329
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al.
I promise.

285
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:41,897
They seem green.

286
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,553
That's why I called in Kent.

287
00:26:45,902 --> 00:26:47,956
Кent's been out of action
for a little while,

288
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:49,716
but I can't do this without him.

289
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:54,641
Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got nearly god-level powers.

290
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:03,941
It might take a lot than that.
Are you sure they can take him?

291
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:06,627
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

292
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,802
we'll take care of the rest.

293
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,145
Good luck.

294
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:17,833
This is gonna be fun.

295
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,288
We're here, sir.

296
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:36,823
Oh, right.

297
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,400
Was I staring again?

298
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,686
Only half an hour or so, sir.

299
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,978
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

300
00:27:47,104 --> 00:27:48,688
Of course, sir.

301
00:27:56,663 --> 00:28:00,226
HAWKMAN'S ESTATE
SAINT ROCH, LOUISIANA

302
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:04,890
So what's the op?

303
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,384
We're headed to Kahndaq to
apprehend and contain...

304
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,113
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

305
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,453
I didn't bring passport.

306
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:15,423
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

307
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:24,697
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

308
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:29,336
Everyting down to the screws.
Completely indestructible.

309
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:32,020
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

310
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,235
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

311
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:40,827
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

312
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,084
Here.

313
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:57,280
Oh. Thanks.

314
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:00,621
I'm Al, by the way.

315
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:02,532
Мaxine.

316
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,038
What do you do?

317
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,641
Wind. You?

318
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:11,995
I grow.

319
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,058
Сool.

320
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:43,664
Whoa.

321
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:01,480
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

322
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,419
My mom's not much of a doctor,
but you should probably leave th...

323
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,352
Or do that.

324
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:17,146
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

325
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,337
But, I was thinking
we could help each other.

326
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,528
Мove.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

327
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,214
I didn't ask for your name.

328
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,127
You're Teth Adam, right?
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

329
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:27,257
I said move.

330
00:30:27,383 --> 00:30:29,854
My mom said you took out a bunch
of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

331
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,417
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

332
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,356
So you can really fly and stop bullets,
'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

333
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,357
And is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit?

334
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:37,409
Wait, what's your top speed?

335
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,116
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast?
Like Flash fast?

336
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,860
Wait, did you not have
mirrors back then?

337
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,879
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

338
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,319
Five thousand years?

339
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:58,689
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

340
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,418
Until my mom woke you up.

341
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:03,344
So you've got stopping bullets, check;
flying, check;

342
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,893
and lighting thing, that's a big check.

343
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,410
I don't know this place.

344
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:14,087
This is your home.

345
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,724
Then my home is gone.

346
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,390
What happened to the crown?

347
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:38,014
Too much?

348
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,576
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

349
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:59,984
"Life is the... only path to death."

350
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,004
No shit.

351
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:08,671
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-god."

352
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:12,677
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

353
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:14,656
There. That's you. See?

354
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:16,964
That's the statue they built of you.
And now you're back.

355
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,631
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader...

356
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:21,155
after another over since you left.

357
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:24,349
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

358
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,872
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

359
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:29,061
I'm no hero.

360
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:30,399
What?

361
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:33,755
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...
You're way more stacked than any of them.

362
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:36,245
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

363
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,386
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

364
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:39,766
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

365
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:41,332
You're our only hope.

366
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:06,938
Wizards.

367
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,509
I can fix it. Don't worry.

368
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:13,161
I'm not a wizard.

369
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,449
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

370
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,647
I told you not to go in your room.

371
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,950
It was you who spoke.

372
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,265
You woke me.

373
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:28,448
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

374
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:30,517
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

375
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:32,376
Then your enemies are vanquished,

376
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:34,516
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

377
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:37,091
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

378
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,083
Then destroy them.

379
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,183
Intergang have guns and flybikes
and Eternium rockets.

380
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,751
We have my mom.

381
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:46,997
Prove your strength.
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

382
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:50,427
Make him beg for mercy,
but deny it until his final breath.

383
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:52,196
Interesting, okay?

384
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,865
I appreciate what you did to for me,

385
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,125
but I do not
want you teaching my son violence.

386
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:02,109
I understand.
You want his father to teach him violence.

387
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:04,053
Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

388
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,290
His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

389
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,410
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

390
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,117
Yeah, Mom.
Who do you want to teach me violence?

391
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:12,954
No one.

392
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,335
I want a champion
to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

393
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,636
Please, help us.

394
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:40,485
Wait. Wait.

395
00:34:41,188 --> 00:34:43,630
Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

396
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:46,312
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

397
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:47,547
Not really, no.

398
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:49,564
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

399
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,031
I don't know what is was like
in ancient times,

400
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:53,698
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

401
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,588
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,
get a cape, change your name.

402
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:58,545
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

403
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,274
It's a little outdated.
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

404
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,914
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

405
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,060
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

406
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,702
I don't waste words on the dead.

407
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:08,548
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

408
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:12,183
I was thinking, like,
"Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

409
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,788
Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

410
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:15,222
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

411
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,576
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

412
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:20,052
My point is, you could be famous.

413
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,460
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

414
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:25,224
And the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

415
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:27,350
I don't need a box for my lunch.

416
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:29,334
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

417
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:34,113
What else are you gonna do?

418
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:41,158
Wait. Where are you going?

419
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,882
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

420
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:02,734
Most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon.

421
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,624
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

422
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,164
When you've seen
as many different futures as I have,

423
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,234
you cease to believe in absolutes.

424
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,562
What are you laughing at?

425
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,781
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

426
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:19,210
I know. That's how you laugh.

427
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:23,774
I've missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

428
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,341
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around to ignore all my advice.

429
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:28,689
Carter...

430
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:31,895
This is not a very good plan.

431
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,483
Yeah, well...

432
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,766
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

433
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:44,406
If only there were a third option.

434
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,869
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

435
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:51,268
Why not?

436
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:53,659
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

437
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:55,072
It's millions of years old.

438
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:56,768
It chooses who it lets touch it.

439
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:59,397
Like Kent?
- Yeah.

440
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:03,023
Like, Kent is leterally possessed
when he puts it on.

441
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,697
What happens if I touch it anyway?

442
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:08,175
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

443
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:10,737
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

444
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,426
Coming up on it.

445
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:14,511
Ready stations in five.

446
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:17,141
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

447
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,566
He's not some dude.

448
00:37:18,692 --> 00:37:21,446
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

449
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,151
You don't have to raise your hand.

450
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:26,244
Question: if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

451
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,117
If we can get him to say the word,
"Shazam,"

452
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,552
Teth Adam will lose his power.

453
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:35,372
And we're hoping since he's had
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

454
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:38,720
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

455
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:40,031
From the footage you showed us,

456
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,872
he doesn't really seem
like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

457
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:44,202
Correct.

458
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,846
Look alive.

459
00:37:47,886 --> 00:37:49,124
We're here.

460
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,382
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

461
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,612
Forgive me.

462
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,592
This is a message
for all Intergang soldiers.

463
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:51,455
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

464
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:16,684
Тeth Adam.

465
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:20,119
Please.

466
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:23,231
There he is. Move.

467
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,590
Тeth Adam.
- Move.

468
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:27,720
Тeth Adam...

469
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:31,736
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

470
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,861
The statue?

471
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:39,072
That's my son.

472
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,770
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

473
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,173
What are you doing?

474
00:39:44,452 --> 00:39:47,401
Hang on. I recognize you.

475
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:49,188
Where is the crown?

476
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,090
Let's go.

477
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:09,128
You could've showed up a bit sooner.
But that was dope.

478
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:16,114
We need backup down here.

479
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:58,083
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

480
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,513
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

481
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,714
But before you zap them.

482
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,539
Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

483
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,371
He's here.

484
00:41:29,497 --> 00:41:30,570
You sense his presence?

485
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,195
No.

486
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:36,201
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

487
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,712
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

488
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:51,777
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

489
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:54,524
We're the anvil, you're the hammer.
You're ready.

490
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:57,650
He just dropped the...

491
00:41:58,179 --> 00:41:59,431
Shit.

492
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:06,392
Be prepared.

493
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,302
Behind you.

494
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,441
Let us be.

495
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,930
I don't know their crimes,

496
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:49,404
but whatever they are,
these men should face due process.

497
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:54,804
Then let the gods make their judgment.

498
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,391
Yeah.
- Yeah.

499
00:42:56,517 --> 00:42:58,276
You don't look like an Intergang.

500
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:00,946
We're the Justice Society.

501
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:04,116
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

502
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:07,455
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

503
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:11,695
And we will use force if necessary.

504
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,950
Force is always necessary.

505
00:43:15,076 --> 00:43:16,398
Teth Adam.

506
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:19,951
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

507
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:23,584
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

508
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:28,483
You have two choices: kneel or die.

509
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:31,054
I was a slave until I died.

510
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:34,849
Then I was reborn a god.

511
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:38,225
I kneel before no one.

512
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,260
Fate, give me a distraction.

513
00:44:40,164 --> 00:44:43,719
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

514
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:47,056
I don't have a home.

515
00:45:20,973 --> 00:45:22,342
Look at that suit. It's cool.

516
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:23,379
Thanks. You, too.

517
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:26,307
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

518
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:35,400
Hawkman just does not give up, does he?
- Nope.

519
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,974
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

520
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,661
To help him.

521
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,739
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

522
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:17,224
Let's roll.

523
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,369
What are you doing? Hey.

524
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,719
No.

525
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,679
I'll be right there.

526
00:47:18,013 --> 00:47:20,080
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

527
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:05,317
I can't hold him much longer.

528
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:11,802
Move.

529
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:35,866
I'm coming.
I'm zeroing in on your location.

530
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,795
I got him. Guys, I got him.

531
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:13,692
It's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

532
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:16,641
There's something different about you.
Can't quite put my finger on it.

533
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:18,808
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

534
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:20,218
But you... You're like a tornado.

535
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:22,603
I thought the two of you did great work.

536
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:24,939
First time out... Bravo.

537
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:27,388
Thanks. I mean,
I got a little turned around back there,

538
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:28,743
but, it all worked out, right?

539
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,263
You're damn right it did.

540
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:32,984
Let's hope Waller
has that cell ready for him.

541
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:40,767
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

542
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:42,912
You'd better not let him up.

543
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,452
What do I do? Guys?

544
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:08,350
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

545
00:50:08,476 --> 00:50:10,494
Long live the Champion.

546
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,815
Long live the Champion.

547
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:23,681
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

548
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:27,970
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

549
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,487
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

550
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,912
We're not strong enough.

551
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:52,652
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction...

552
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:55,037
to figure that out
before we gor our asses kicked.

553
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:56,504
I'm working on it.

554
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,877
Miss?

555
00:50:58,003 --> 00:50:59,825
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

556
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:01,281
Yes, I do mind.

557
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:02,738
Where are you going with this, Kent?

558
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,170
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

559
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:07,615
One catastrophe at a time.
We can't give him a chance to regroup.

560
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:09,415
He's been spotted entering the palace.

561
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:11,477
It safe to say
he's not going there to surrender.

562
00:51:11,603 --> 00:51:13,307
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

563
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,493
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

564
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:16,922
The Justice Society?

565
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:21,182
We have been living under
military occupation for 27 years,

566
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:22,539
and never seen you before.

567
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:25,201
You didn't come when Intergang
invaded our country,

568
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:27,934
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

569
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,406
But now, we finally have our own hero...

570
00:51:30,532 --> 00:51:33,485
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

571
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:36,253
Thank you, but... we're covered.

572
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:39,921
Go and protect inernational stability
someplace else.

573
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:42,612
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

574
00:51:42,738 --> 00:51:44,359
Let me spell it out for you.

575
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:48,228
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion
because he is not a hero.

576
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:50,055
Tell that...

577
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:54,033
to all the people he just liberated.

578
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:56,714
I know what this looks like. I do.

579
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,370
But I can assure you that my t...

580
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,287
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

581
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:08,206
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

582
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:10,228
Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

583
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:11,879
I...

584
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:14,273
Can we please just see the crown?

585
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,227
I don't have it.

586
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:36,235
We don't have time for this.

587
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,294
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

588
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,997
You don't have any authority here.
Teth Adam has done nothing...

589
00:52:42,123 --> 00:52:44,840
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

590
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,329
And how whould you know?

591
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,991
We have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries.

592
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:52,664
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

593
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,889
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

594
00:52:56,785 --> 00:53:00,793
And we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again.

595
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:06,258
You want to go in there alone?
Are you sure?

596
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:09,427
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

597
00:53:09,574 --> 00:53:12,073
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

598
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,137
without destroying the rest of my city,
I'm your only shot.

599
00:53:38,568 --> 00:53:40,044
You brought the invaders with you.

600
00:53:40,419 --> 00:53:42,075
They only want to talk.

601
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:46,139
They can talk. I won't listen.

602
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:50,382
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story...

603
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:53,460
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot...

604
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:57,480
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq
by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

605
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:00,953
But according to the Justice Society,
that's not really what happened.

606
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,124
They say that you didn't come here
to seek justice.

607
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:08,160
Hurry.

608
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,742
Give it to me.

609
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,860
That you came to exact revenge.

610
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,038
And in your anger...

611
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:38,354
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

612
00:54:40,149 --> 00:54:41,542
This is what I want.

613
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:44,814
...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

614
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:55,154
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy...

615
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,177
of the gifts that you were granted.

616
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,530
We have chosen recklessly...

617
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:01,412
and humanity has paid the price.

618
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:03,448
And now, Teth Adam...

619
00:55:03,574 --> 00:55:06,058
you must pay.

620
00:55:24,878 --> 00:55:27,911
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

621
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:32,646
It was your prison.

622
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,840
And now there's a statue of you.

623
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:39,801
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

624
00:55:39,927 --> 00:55:41,697
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

625
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,898
I never said I was a hero.

626
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:45,742
I never claimed to be anything.

627
00:55:46,108 --> 00:55:48,292
You may not have been a hero.

628
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:51,327
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

629
00:55:58,848 --> 00:56:00,183
I will hear them out.

630
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:03,323
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

631
00:56:08,228 --> 00:56:09,449
Uncle Karim.

632
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,371
I can't believe you're sitting around
watching TV...

633
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:12,985
when the most epic day ever is...

634
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:14,784
In here, little man.

635
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:19,772
Ishmael. My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

636
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:21,437
Funny story, he didn't.

637
00:56:21,563 --> 00:56:23,201
Where's Adrianna?

638
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:25,659
She's back at the square...
- We should go bail her out right now.

639
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:27,909
But she's the one who sent me home
to make sure the crown's safe.

640
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:29,720
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

641
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:32,260
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

642
00:56:32,386 --> 00:56:33,776
Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

643
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:36,415
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

644
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:41,307
Give him the bag. Give hime the bag.

645
00:56:43,218 --> 00:56:44,701
Very good. Back away.

646
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:48,240
Back away.
- Oké. I'm...

647
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,436
It's all going to be okay, little man.

648
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:01,685
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned...

649
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:03,087
in one of your mother's classes.

650
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:04,736
When we had a powerful king,

651
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:08,326
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

652
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:09,855
It used to be great.

653
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:11,496
Run, Amon, run.

654
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:33,204
Crash the building.
I lost the kid. He has the crown.

655
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:53,237
We're here to negotoiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender.

656
00:57:53,632 --> 00:57:57,299
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

657
00:57:57,425 --> 00:58:00,920
What have your powers ever given to you?
Nothing but heartache.

658
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,604
You have no idea.

659
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,664
Then why are you making this hard on us?

660
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,920
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

661
00:58:07,046 --> 00:58:09,454
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

662
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,970
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

663
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:15,701
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

664
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,510
How 'bout I rip
you little wings off instead?

665
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,154
I'd like to see you try.
- Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

666
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,542
I disagree.
- Me, too.

667
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,095
Looks like we found common ground.

668
00:58:25,221 --> 00:58:27,320
This can only end one way.

669
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:29,902
Мom?
- Amon.

670
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:31,879
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

671
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:33,222
Ishmael's dead.

672
00:58:33,348 --> 00:58:36,001
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

673
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:37,986
Ground forces...

674
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,407
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

675
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:42,142
They're coming.

676
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,002
Intergang are after my son.

677
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:47,149
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

678
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,856
I know you're not a hero.

679
00:58:48,982 --> 00:58:51,404
But you're not a monster, either.
I don't care what anyone says.

680
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,613
You saved me in that cave.

681
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,724
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

682
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:00,297
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

683
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:05,310
Check the whole place clean.

684
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:07,059
Cover all access points.

685
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,190
Keep looking.

686
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:19,677
Area's clear.

687
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:21,455
There. Take him.

688
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:22,892
Right there, right there.

689
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,592
Shit...

690
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:27,000
Move, move.

691
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:28,598
Don't shoot him, I need him.

692
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,813
End of the road, kid.

693
00:59:56,435 --> 00:59:57,730
Release the child.

694
00:59:57,856 --> 00:59:59,476
Whatever you say.

695
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:03,687
Yes.

696
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:04,442
Thank you.

697
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:07,288
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

698
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:13,113
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

699
01:00:17,362 --> 01:00:19,382
Time to go, Amon.

700
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,013
Where's the crown?
- What crown?

701
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,541
You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

702
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:34,151
That's the plan, little man.
We'er gonna go for a ride. Come one.

703
01:00:48,567 --> 01:00:50,628
Put me down. Put me down.

704
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:53,291
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

705
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,465
And tell them that the Man in Black...

706
01:01:00,976 --> 01:01:03,534
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

707
01:01:13,964 --> 01:01:14,971
Mom?

708
01:01:15,097 --> 01:01:16,335
Amon, where are you?

709
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,140
No, no, no, what?

710
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:19,567
I'm on one of their bikes.

711
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:21,080
What bikes?

712
01:01:40,293 --> 01:01:41,290
Amon.

713
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:42,340
Can you hear me?

714
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,718
Mom, I'm okay.

715
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,766
Shit.

716
01:01:57,832 --> 01:01:59,129
Activate infrared.

717
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:06,268
What are you doing?

718
01:02:06,394 --> 01:02:07,681
Searching for the child.

719
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,110
No, you're murdering people.

720
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:10,487
How else do I find the child?

721
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:13,069
I can help you,
but no more extrajudicial killings.

722
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:14,555
I don't need any help.

723
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:19,896
Smasher, Cyclone.
What are you waiting for?

724
01:02:20,022 --> 01:02:21,679
Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

725
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,298
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

726
01:02:24,424 --> 01:02:27,988
One, two...
This feels a lot higher than last time.

727
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:31,838
That was not cool.

728
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:43,886
Whoa, slow down.

729
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:49,692
I got you. I got you.

730
01:03:00,437 --> 01:03:01,787
ENGINE FAILURE

731
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,913
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

732
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,148
I am so sorry.

733
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:20,337
I don't really have peripheral vision
in the mask. It's my uncle's.

734
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,882
I'll get it tailored.

735
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,278
Me and you.

736
01:03:23,404 --> 01:03:24,622
Roger that.

737
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,465
Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

738
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:14,356
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

739
01:04:14,702 --> 01:04:16,656
I'm not that kind of doctor.

740
01:04:16,782 --> 01:04:18,540
But don't worry, I can see the future.

741
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,499
This isn't how you're going to die.

742
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,885
How do I die, then?

743
01:04:22,011 --> 01:04:23,644
Just stay away from electricity.

744
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,620
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

745
01:04:26,746 --> 01:04:28,927
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

746
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:41,173
OVER SPEED
ETERNIUM LEVELS CRITICAL

747
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:37,505
Oh, God.

748
01:05:38,379 --> 01:05:40,513
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

749
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,258
I'm counting on it.

750
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:54,584
Please don't.

751
01:05:55,058 --> 01:05:56,802
Teth Adam. Where are you?

752
01:05:56,928 --> 01:05:57,801
You followed me?

753
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:01,752
My mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time.

754
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:02,874
Did you find the boy?

755
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,985
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

756
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:07,276
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

757
01:06:10,338 --> 01:06:12,156
You killed him, didn't you?

758
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:20,783
He didn't make it.

759
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:26,263
The bullet's extracted.
The tissue damage has been repaired.

760
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:30,326
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

761
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:33,067
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

762
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,469
That is insane.

763
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,025
The nanobots did most of the work.

764
01:06:39,152 --> 01:06:41,254
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

765
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,035
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

766
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:46,221
What? I say something stupid?

767
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:49,417
No, it's just that you can transform
your molecular structure,

768
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:51,292
grow a hundred times your own size.

769
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:54,091
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

770
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:57,433
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

771
01:06:58,428 --> 01:06:59,848
Thank you.

772
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:02,547
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

773
01:07:04,025 --> 01:07:06,093
That's how you do your wind thing.

774
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,875
Well, the wind thing
is called aerokinesis.

775
01:07:09,001 --> 01:07:11,093
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream...

776
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:14,726
by this really messed-up scientist
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

777
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:20,247
I'm... so sorry.

778
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,223
No, you're good.

779
01:07:22,349 --> 01:07:24,267
It seems like you really turned it around.

780
01:07:24,393 --> 01:07:25,936
Found your calling.

781
01:07:26,779 --> 01:07:28,542
Hoping this is mine.

782
01:07:34,163 --> 01:07:37,125
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

783
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,574
It's already moved on from you.

784
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:46,456
Why did you say that?

785
01:07:46,582 --> 01:07:49,107
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

786
01:07:49,234 --> 01:07:52,288
Your thoughts are beter spent
on the things you can change,

787
01:07:52,414 --> 01:07:54,242
not those you can't.

788
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:56,577
You see the future?

789
01:07:56,703 --> 01:07:59,225
Tell me how I get my son back.

790
01:07:59,897 --> 01:08:01,362
By trusting us.

791
01:08:01,488 --> 01:08:04,489
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

792
01:08:04,615 --> 01:08:06,306
It's what we do.

793
01:08:11,023 --> 01:08:13,325
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

794
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:15,883
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

795
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:18,832
What I did there is called sarcasm.

796
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:21,234
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

797
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,427
Not yet, but I will.
The men who took him will suffer.

798
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:27,453
Maybe these guys can help.

799
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:32,925
There's an upside to keeping prisoners.
They can answer our questions.

800
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,378
What did you do with my son?

801
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:45,436
Adrianna. Adrianna.

802
01:08:45,562 --> 01:08:48,807
I've learned that in this modern world,
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

803
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:50,662
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

804
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,355
No.

805
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:57,705
Let's start with just one simple question.
Can either of you fly?

806
01:08:59,654 --> 01:09:01,428
Shit.

807
01:09:02,366 --> 01:09:04,385
I think I'll sit this one out.

808
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:12,604
Tell me what you did with Amon.

809
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,007
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

810
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:18,208
I'm not going to drop them.

811
01:09:19,396 --> 01:09:20,933
I'm going to drop one of them.

812
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:23,508
Whoever ansers first lives. Where is he?

813
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:24,875
I don't know.

814
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:33,267
He's at our mine in the desert.

815
01:09:33,393 --> 01:09:34,956
I can show...

816
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:42,703
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

817
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:46,063
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

818
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,877
That was sarcasm.

819
01:09:48,003 --> 01:09:49,686
No, technically, it was just a lie.

820
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,748
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

821
01:09:51,874 --> 01:09:53,125
Amon is there.
- I know it.

822
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:55,343
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

823
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:56,963
Let's go.

824
01:09:57,933 --> 01:10:00,078
I told you, stop killing people.

825
01:10:00,205 --> 01:10:01,469
They look alive to me.

826
01:10:01,595 --> 01:10:03,188
Because I saved them.

827
01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:04,929
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

828
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,872
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

829
01:10:07,998 --> 01:10:09,192
I did it your way.

830
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:11,042
He does have a point.

831
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:13,893
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

832
01:10:14,019 --> 01:10:16,167
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

833
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:18,323
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

834
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:19,980
There's no "we" here.

835
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:24,041
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

836
01:10:24,168 --> 01:10:27,606
You think yourself a hero,
but you would let these criminals go free,

837
01:10:27,732 --> 01:10:30,840
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now.

838
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:33,590
Heroes don't kill people.

839
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,390
Well, I do.

840
01:10:39,983 --> 01:10:41,349
Here we go.

841
01:11:42,396 --> 01:11:44,039
Is that what I think it is?

842
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:47,402
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

843
01:11:47,528 --> 01:11:50,056
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period.

844
01:11:50,183 --> 01:11:51,714
King must have had a really strong neck.

845
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,281
No, it snapped when I killed him.

846
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:56,948
What's that?

847
01:11:57,074 --> 01:11:58,888
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

848
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,722
"Life is the only path to death."

849
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:03,166
That's what it says.

850
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:06,305
Life is the only path to death.

851
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:11,286
Well, that's surprisingly obvious.
Could it have another meaning?

852
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,371
What if it means, like...

853
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:16,980
"Life is short.
You gotta hold on to what you love."

854
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,244
Stop.

855
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,590
Deep.

856
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:23,229
It doesn't matter what it means.

857
01:12:23,355 --> 01:12:25,358
It should be buried under the ocean
for eternity.

858
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:28,491
That's not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over.

859
01:12:28,617 --> 01:12:30,141
Or I could bury you with it.

860
01:12:31,811 --> 01:12:35,350
We can't get rid of it now.
It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

861
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:39,334
Believe me, I know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of.

862
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,341
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

863
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:46,107
Adrianna...
Trust me, we will get your son back.

864
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:48,314
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

865
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,083
Hand it over.

866
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:55,763
We can't risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands.

867
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,907
We will find another way.

868
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:01,202
No.

869
01:13:01,404 --> 01:13:04,299
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

870
01:13:04,425 --> 01:13:07,593
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

871
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:09,678
All I care about is Amon.

872
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:13,800
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

873
01:13:13,926 --> 01:13:18,042
And you... you will work together.

874
01:13:24,295 --> 01:13:26,803
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

875
01:13:27,126 --> 01:13:29,373
We'll go in at dawn.

876
01:13:30,161 --> 01:13:32,057
I hope you can be a team player.

877
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:33,724
I love teams.

878
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:35,816
That was sarcasm again, yes?

879
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:37,056
Very much so.

880
01:13:37,183 --> 01:13:39,386
Good. Just checking.

881
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:53,635
A wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

882
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:56,952
That was before we had a very bad plan.

883
01:13:57,078 --> 01:13:58,709
Let it go.

884
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,682
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

885
01:14:01,808 --> 01:14:03,442
He's a murderer, Kent.

886
01:14:03,568 --> 01:14:06,674
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

887
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:10,098
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

888
01:14:11,104 --> 01:14:13,265
That's... up to Fate.

889
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:15,709
What's the helmet telling you?

890
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:17,998
Somebody's gonna die.

891
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,240
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

892
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:23,274
Surprisingly, no.

893
01:14:23,718 --> 01:14:25,370
Is it me?

894
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:35,078
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

895
01:14:37,258 --> 01:14:39,428
All I can tell you is...

896
01:14:40,884 --> 01:14:44,052
There is still time to change the future.

897
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,317
Let's use it.

898
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:55,141
Well, I guess we're sticking
with a very bad plan.

899
01:15:03,576 --> 01:15:06,534
AL HADIDIYAH MINE
INTERGANG CONTROLLED OPERATION

900
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:10,661
The Al Hadidiyah mine
is Intergang's most valued asset.

901
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,151
I'm gonna land us right here,
cut off their access to reinforcements.

902
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:18,209
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

903
01:15:18,335 --> 01:15:20,467
There is only one way in, one way out.

904
01:15:20,593 --> 01:15:22,826
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

905
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:26,867
Communication is key.
We keep in step or we get outflanked.

906
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:30,254
We move through the mine, inch by inch,
until we find Amon.

907
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,035
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

908
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,511
Or we could just do that.

909
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:10,227
Pure Eternium Shield.
Unbreakable, even with your powers.

910
01:16:17,559 --> 01:16:18,793
Amon.

911
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,971
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

912
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:23,886
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

913
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,673
We don't have it.

914
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:30,234
Believe me,
nothing good will come from that crown.

915
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:34,952
No crown, no negotiation.

916
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,268
I have it.

917
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,458
It's right here.

918
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:44,354
Release my son, you can have it.

919
01:16:46,547 --> 01:16:48,514
What do you think you're doing?

920
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:54,776
Intergang killed my husband.
I'm not letting them take my son, too.

921
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:02,314
Not your son. Not your country.

922
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,151
Not your decision to make.

923
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,497
Stop there.

924
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,860
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

925
01:17:10,986 --> 01:17:12,279
Hand it over, now.

926
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,666
I'm sorry, Mama.
- No.

927
01:17:21,524 --> 01:17:22,907
Now, let Amon go.

928
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:29,850
I thank you.

929
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:33,209
And I thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner.

930
01:17:35,033 --> 01:17:38,644
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

931
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,008
You have what you want.

932
01:17:41,248 --> 01:17:42,106
Let him go.

933
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:43,852
Ishmael, what are you doing?

934
01:17:43,978 --> 01:17:45,578
Taking back what's mine.

935
01:17:46,472 --> 01:17:49,608
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

936
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:53,496
And you have just given me
everything I need to become the next...

937
01:17:53,622 --> 01:17:55,903
king of Kahndaq.

938
01:17:57,314 --> 01:18:00,826
My family passed the knowledge on,
you know, one to the next.

939
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:07,354
This crown, crafted by our ancestors,
stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

940
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,885
But still a source of great power,
if only we can wield it.

941
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:21,573
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

942
01:18:22,752 --> 01:18:24,516
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

943
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:25,710
Please, Ishmael.

944
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:26,900
Sorry, Amon.

945
01:18:29,262 --> 01:18:30,850
Fate, get ready.

946
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:35,189
Death is the only path to life.

947
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:41,252
Amon.

948
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:47,676
Amon.

949
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:54,261
He's alive.
But we need to get him to the medical bay.

950
01:19:54,387 --> 01:19:56,278
Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

951
01:19:56,404 --> 01:19:57,950
It was me.

952
01:20:06,572 --> 01:20:07,931
Come.

953
01:20:17,134 --> 01:20:18,772
We're going with you.

954
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:21,543
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

955
01:20:34,192 --> 01:20:37,867
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

956
01:20:48,562 --> 01:20:51,217
How long we gonna keep doing this?

957
01:20:53,945 --> 01:20:58,548
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

958
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:00,506
You're right.

959
01:21:01,349 --> 01:21:03,110
Only you can.

960
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:07,308
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

961
01:21:11,327 --> 01:21:12,791
Who's Hurut?

962
01:21:17,988 --> 01:21:20,216
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

963
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:28,457
And he was also... my son.

964
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,996
I won't always be here to protect you.

965
01:21:33,272 --> 01:21:34,716
I don't need protection.

966
01:21:34,842 --> 01:21:36,328
I want to be free.

967
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,295
Freedom is for the birds.

968
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:41,443
Let someone else be the hero...

969
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:44,749
the graveyards are full of them.

970
01:21:49,691 --> 01:21:51,560
I tried to protect him.

971
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:01,437
But I wasn't strong enough.

972
01:22:05,895 --> 01:22:07,233
Shazam.

973
01:22:08,955 --> 01:22:12,478
The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.

974
01:22:12,609 --> 01:22:15,121
But after the Champion's many victories,

975
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:18,430
the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.

976
01:22:20,114 --> 01:22:21,704
Our family.

977
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:41,033
Hold on, Father.

978
01:22:41,743 --> 01:22:43,257
Stay with me.

979
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:52,238
With my powers...

980
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:54,397
you'll be safe.

981
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,240
I couldn't protect your mother.

982
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:00,599
Repeat what I say.

983
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:02,768
Shazam.
- Shazam.

984
01:23:15,818 --> 01:23:18,280
Instead of battling the king...

985
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,264
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

986
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:24,507
Hurut chose to save...

987
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:26,722
me.

988
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:47,866
But he couldn't save himself
from the king's assassins.

989
01:23:50,296 --> 01:23:53,284
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

990
01:23:54,045 --> 01:23:55,493
but a curse.

991
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:07,959
Born out of rage.

992
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:12,885
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

993
01:24:16,025 --> 01:24:17,314
It's Hurut.

994
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:22,843
My son dreamt of a better world.

995
01:24:23,581 --> 01:24:25,671
That's why he saved me.

996
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:32,813
But the world was only a better place
with him in it.

997
01:24:48,193 --> 01:24:49,864
Kahndaq needed a hero.

998
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,256
Instead, it got me.

999
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,591
All this power...

1000
01:24:58,822 --> 01:25:01,714
And the only thing I can do with it
is hurt people.

1001
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:07,118
I will speak the word my son gave me,
and I will give up my power.

1002
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:13,077
And when I do,
you must ensure I never speak it again.

1003
01:25:18,932 --> 01:25:20,260
Shazam.

1004
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:30,717
Some men are not meant...

1005
01:25:30,843 --> 01:25:32,429
to be heroes.

1006
01:25:38,106 --> 01:25:42,944
TASK FORCE X BLACK SITE
SECRET LOCATION

1007
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:18,203
Hey.

1008
01:26:35,976 --> 01:26:38,909
So beautiful.

1009
01:27:04,408 --> 01:27:06,164
Surprised to see us?

1010
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,189
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1011
01:27:09,315 --> 01:27:11,748
Are you sure you can handle him?

1012
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:15,305
You're the one who can see the future,
you'll tell me if we can't.

1013
01:27:15,431 --> 01:27:16,852
Just be careful with this one.

1014
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:20,264
You know, they say the gods created us,

1015
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:23,518
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1016
01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:26,611
Waller sends her regards.

1017
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:34,864
They'll know how to deal with him.

1018
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:40,286
To keep him from regaining his powers,
they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1019
01:27:47,404 --> 01:27:51,636
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1020
01:27:55,548 --> 01:27:58,171
He'll never say another word again.

1021
01:28:16,735 --> 01:28:19,156
Hey. There he is.

1022
01:28:19,282 --> 01:28:23,171
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1023
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:25,623
Well, statistically,
most heroes don't wear capes.

1024
01:28:25,749 --> 01:28:27,642
But yeah, try it on.

1025
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,454
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1026
01:28:35,554 --> 01:28:37,452
That's a nice touch.

1027
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,793
Kent.

1028
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:21,491
Kent.

1029
01:29:24,382 --> 01:29:25,867
Mission accomplished?

1030
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:27,587
My vision hasn't changed.

1031
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:30,155
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1032
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:33,253
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1033
01:29:33,379 --> 01:29:35,488
What is the helmet telling you?

1034
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:39,538
My vision has always shown me
great calamity.

1035
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:41,718
The world in flames.

1036
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:43,387
We can stop it...

1037
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:46,862
but you die.

1038
01:29:48,419 --> 01:29:50,525
You should've told me sooner.

1039
01:29:53,129 --> 01:29:54,969
I have no fear of death.

1040
01:29:55,096 --> 01:29:57,260
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1041
01:29:57,386 --> 01:29:59,599
The world needs the Justice Society.

1042
01:29:59,725 --> 01:30:01,313
The world needs you.

1043
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,178
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1044
01:30:04,304 --> 01:30:06,191
That's Fate, right?

1045
01:30:06,894 --> 01:30:10,775
Well, that sounds familiar.

1046
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:15,989
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1047
01:30:16,783 --> 01:30:21,174
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1048
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:24,888
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1049
01:30:26,329 --> 01:30:28,428
But I didn't cheer.

1050
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,784
Even though I was only a boy.

1051
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:36,665
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1052
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:40,540
Thanks to this, I've lived longer
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1053
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:45,163
I have seen the world change
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1054
01:30:47,854 --> 01:30:49,705
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1055
01:30:51,256 --> 01:30:53,496
And I don't want my friend to die.

1056
01:31:00,964 --> 01:31:05,573
Ishmael said,
"Death is the only path to life."

1057
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:08,372
But that's not what the inscription says.

1058
01:31:08,498 --> 01:31:11,421
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1059
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:15,601
Maybe he got it backwards,
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1060
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:18,114
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1061
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,352
the souls of the damned
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1062
01:31:21,478 --> 01:31:26,394
The underworld is a mirror to our own.
Here, turn the crown around.

1063
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,357
Now mirror the letters.

1064
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,789
See? That's what I missed.

1065
01:31:31,914 --> 01:31:35,925
"Death is the only path to life."

1066
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:42,148
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1067
01:31:42,274 --> 01:31:44,629
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1068
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:48,613
And he believed the Champion's magic
would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1069
01:31:48,739 --> 01:31:52,336
As life is the path to death.

1070
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:56,112
Now your death is a path to life.

1071
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,504
The wizards have their champion,
now we have ours.

1072
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:03,405
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1073
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:07,194
and unleash hell on Earth.

1074
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:10,102
Speak our name.

1075
01:32:10,228 --> 01:32:12,084
"Sabbac."

1076
01:32:32,425 --> 01:32:34,847
What the bloody hell is that?

1077
01:32:34,973 --> 01:32:36,763
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1078
01:32:36,889 --> 01:32:38,696
Get me closer. Now, right now.

1079
01:32:38,822 --> 01:32:40,858
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1080
01:32:48,356 --> 01:32:51,280
The king has returned.

1081
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,129
The throne will be mine.

1082
01:32:55,925 --> 01:32:57,944
Brace yourselves.

1083
01:33:03,434 --> 01:33:04,934
Hold on.

1084
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,851
Now prepare to die.

1085
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:50,372
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1086
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:10,311
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1087
01:34:13,513 --> 01:34:15,409
Copy that.
- We're on it.

1088
01:34:15,535 --> 01:34:16,869
Heads up.

1089
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:02,453
Activate infrared.

1090
01:35:05,928 --> 01:35:07,814
Sabbac, show yourself.

1091
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,072
Adrianna.

1092
01:35:12,357 --> 01:35:14,085
Amon.

1093
01:35:17,137 --> 01:35:18,915
That's for my cruiser.

1094
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:58,913
This is it.

1095
01:35:59,834 --> 01:36:01,487
We can't win, Carter.

1096
01:36:01,613 --> 01:36:04,738
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't.
Right?

1097
01:36:07,115 --> 01:36:09,303
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1098
01:36:36,065 --> 01:36:38,326
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1099
01:36:38,452 --> 01:36:40,097
Giving us a third option.

1100
01:36:40,223 --> 01:36:41,557
It's supposed to be me.

1101
01:36:41,683 --> 01:36:43,981
I didn't tell you my whole vision,
old friend.

1102
01:36:44,652 --> 01:36:46,255
I did see your death.

1103
01:36:46,381 --> 01:36:48,635
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1104
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:53,365
It has been an extraordinary life,
but always with one foot in the future.

1105
01:36:53,491 --> 01:36:56,651
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1106
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:58,591
when I look ahead...

1107
01:37:00,665 --> 01:37:01,856
I see nothing.

1108
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:02,937
No, Kent.

1109
01:37:03,064 --> 01:37:04,467
And...

1110
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:06,337
it's...

1111
01:37:06,805 --> 01:37:07,886
beautiful.

1112
01:37:08,013 --> 01:37:09,022
Wait, Kent.

1113
01:37:09,107 --> 01:37:10,074
Goodbye...

1114
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,400
Kent.

1115
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,954
...my dear friend.

1116
01:37:13,081 --> 01:37:14,301
Kent.

1117
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:18,829
Hit it from every side.

1118
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,854
Kent.

1119
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:26,998
No.

1120
01:37:45,872 --> 01:37:50,666
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1121
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:53,989
defender against darkness and chaos,

1122
01:37:54,116 --> 01:37:57,736
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1123
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,410
There's no one that can defeat me.

1124
01:38:13,533 --> 01:38:17,968
There is one... There is one...

1125
01:38:18,095 --> 01:38:19,725
Teth Adam.

1126
01:38:20,589 --> 01:38:22,716
I know you can hear me.

1127
01:38:24,226 --> 01:38:28,194
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1128
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:33,323
Now you are the only one
who can defeat the Demon Champion.

1129
01:38:58,977 --> 01:39:02,921
You have the power
to be the destroyer of this world.

1130
01:39:05,479 --> 01:39:08,432
But you can also be its savior.

1131
01:39:25,272 --> 01:39:30,746
You believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you.

1132
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:34,626
But Fate does not make mistakes.
Neither did your son.

1133
01:39:38,686 --> 01:39:40,366
We were wrong about you.

1134
01:39:40,492 --> 01:39:43,589
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1135
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:46,022
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1136
01:40:01,901 --> 01:40:06,249
Don't you dare give up on us now.
The world needs you.

1137
01:41:13,168 --> 01:41:14,758
Kent.

1138
01:41:23,867 --> 01:41:25,098
No.

1139
01:42:29,283 --> 01:42:30,621
Mom?

1140
01:42:31,226 --> 01:42:32,975
What's happening?

1141
01:42:34,101 --> 01:42:35,893
It's Sabbac.

1142
01:42:36,245 --> 01:42:37,880
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1143
01:42:38,224 --> 01:42:39,919
Whatever happens...

1144
01:42:41,102 --> 01:42:42,683
you stay behind me.

1145
01:42:56,832 --> 01:42:59,556
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1146
01:43:01,123 --> 01:43:03,828
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1147
01:43:03,954 --> 01:43:05,344
Come and get it.

1148
01:43:05,884 --> 01:43:06,880
No, no. No.

1149
01:43:07,007 --> 01:43:09,436
Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1150
01:43:09,562 --> 01:43:12,443
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1151
01:43:50,398 --> 01:43:53,510
The Gods have brought us together again.

1152
01:43:55,237 --> 01:43:58,163
It's not your time, Father.

1153
01:44:01,475 --> 01:44:02,931
Hey.

1154
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,020
What are you all standing around for?

1155
01:44:06,249 --> 01:44:08,058
This is our chance.

1156
01:44:10,717 --> 01:44:13,789
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1157
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:16,139
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1158
01:44:22,203 --> 01:44:24,112
The people need a hero.

1159
01:44:25,716 --> 01:44:27,445
No, Father.

1160
01:44:27,842 --> 01:44:30,171
They need to be free.

1161
01:44:34,053 --> 01:44:36,072
What are we waiting for?

1162
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:00,723
Say the word.

1163
01:45:01,814 --> 01:45:03,115
Shazam.

1164
01:45:13,524 --> 01:45:16,644
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1165
01:45:45,092 --> 01:45:46,709
Yes.

1166
01:45:50,869 --> 01:45:52,358
I got this.

1167
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:54,913
Go get him.

1168
01:46:12,126 --> 01:46:13,928
You know what I have to do.

1169
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,108
Beat his ass.

1170
01:46:17,234 --> 01:46:22,432
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions.

1171
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:24,721
Let's end this.

1172
01:46:50,887 --> 01:46:52,141
It's a lot of them.

1173
01:46:53,758 --> 01:46:56,150
It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1174
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:57,479
Just a bit.

1175
01:47:05,057 --> 01:47:06,899
Hey, mom.

1176
01:47:13,735 --> 01:47:17,402
These are our streets. Our city.

1177
01:47:18,873 --> 01:47:21,041
Free Kahndaq.

1178
01:47:28,676 --> 01:47:31,293
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1179
01:47:31,419 --> 01:47:33,811
You are not a hero.

1180
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:38,961
No. I'm not.

1181
01:47:40,643 --> 01:47:42,114
But he is.

1182
01:47:53,318 --> 01:47:55,659
You cannot stand against me.

1183
01:47:55,785 --> 01:47:58,578
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1184
01:48:07,893 --> 01:48:10,926
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1185
01:48:49,567 --> 01:48:51,196
You can control it.

1186
01:48:55,293 --> 01:48:56,812
You have to.

1187
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,430
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1188
01:49:33,505 --> 01:49:36,873
Yes.
- Yes.

1189
01:49:59,982 --> 01:50:02,709
I never tought I'd be happy to see you.

1190
01:50:05,651 --> 01:50:07,789
I'm only here because of him.

1191
01:50:10,628 --> 01:50:12,945
That makes two of us.

1192
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:31,574
See you around, old friend.

1193
01:50:46,641 --> 01:50:48,373
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1194
01:50:48,499 --> 01:50:50,149
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1195
01:50:50,275 --> 01:50:51,859
Fair enough.

1196
01:50:53,258 --> 01:50:54,862
Just be careful.

1197
01:50:54,989 --> 01:50:58,138
The kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul.

1198
01:50:58,264 --> 01:51:03,719
It's his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot.

1199
01:51:05,211 --> 01:51:07,672
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1200
01:51:15,459 --> 01:51:17,662
I tought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1201
01:51:17,788 --> 01:51:19,320
Just saying.

1202
01:51:20,604 --> 01:51:22,518
We made a great team.

1203
01:51:28,049 --> 01:51:29,557
Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1204
01:51:30,153 --> 01:51:32,220
Smasher, let's go.

1205
01:51:43,336 --> 01:51:46,069
Long live the Champion.

1206
01:51:46,195 --> 01:51:51,884
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

1207
01:51:53,494 --> 01:51:55,392
You could lead them.

1208
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:30,361
How does it feel?

1209
01:52:31,889 --> 01:52:33,152
Wrong.

1210
01:52:44,452 --> 01:52:45,898
So... what now?

1211
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:49,129
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1212
01:52:49,255 --> 01:52:51,528
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1213
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:53,601
And it still does.

1214
01:52:54,447 --> 01:52:57,354
What is needs now is a protector.

1215
01:52:57,447 --> 01:52:58,948
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1216
01:52:59,074 --> 01:53:01,730
Perhaps that name is a little...

1217
01:53:01,855 --> 01:53:03,310
old-fashioned.

1218
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:06,145
So what should we call you?

1219
01:55:43,851 --> 01:55:47,696
BLACK ADAM

1220
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:03,967
Okay, "Black Adam."

1221
01:56:04,210 --> 01:56:09,163
My name is Amanda Waller.
Congratulations, you have my attention.

1222
01:56:09,289 --> 01:56:12,523
This is gonna be your only warning.

1223
01:56:13,221 --> 01:56:16,129
You don't want to stay in my prison,
that's fine.

1224
01:56:16,255 --> 01:56:18,562
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1225
01:56:18,854 --> 01:56:22,815
You step one foot ouside of it,
you will not live to regret it.

1226
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,020
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1227
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:30,798
I can call in a favor and send people
