1
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,565
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,257
- GOOD MORNING.
- MORNING.

3
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,744
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL
HEREON THIS GLORIOUS DAY.

4
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:05,780
WE'VE ALL COME TOGETHER
ONE AND ALL

5
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:08,956
TO GIVE PRAISE TO
OUR LORD JESUS.

6
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,200
AMEN.

7
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,273
AMEN.

8
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,896
BEFORE I GET STARTED
WITH TODAY'S MESSAGE,

9
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,211
I'D, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ALL
A LITTLE STORY.

10
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:25,835
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TRAVELING

11
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,596
WITH A VERY CLOSE FRIEND
OF MINE, A FELLOW PASTOR.

12
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,530
WE WERE DRIVING TO
A CHURCH CONFERENCE

13
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:34,947
AND WE HAD BEEN IN THE CAR
FOR QUITE A FEW HOURS

14
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:38,813
CHATTING ABOUT THIS AND THAT,
OLD TIMES,

15
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:41,540
AND IN GENERAL, PASSING THE TIME

16
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:47,822
AS THE ROAD AND TELEPHONE
POLES PASSED US BY.

17
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:52,275
BUT THEN THE TOPIC CHANGED,
I MEAN, HEY,

18
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,970
YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO PASTORSIN
A CAR FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME

19
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:01,491
WITHOUT THE TOPIC TURNING
TO OUR LORD.

20
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:11,225
THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO
A DISCUSSION OF REVERENCE,

21
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,748
SPECIFICALLY REVERENCE
OF OUR LORD

22
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:20,476
AND REVERENCE OF HIS HOLY NAME.

23
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,517
AND OUT OF THAT SPRUNG A
STORYMY FRIEND THE PASTOR TOLD ME...

24
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,726
ABOUT A TROUBLED YOUNG MAN,

25
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:37,761
A BOY REALLY,
16 OR 17 YEARS OLD.

26
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:41,842
A BOY THAT HAD BEEN MOVED FROM
FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME.

27
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:45,570
HE DIDN'T HAVE A SENSE OF PLACE.

28
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:49,988
DIFFERENT HOUSE, DIFFERENT
FAMILY, DIFFERENT FACES.

29
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:58,022
A BOY WHO, THROUGH CIRCUMSTANCE,
HAD BEEN LEFT ON HIS OWN,

30
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,796
ALL ALONE, TO FEND FOR HIMSELF
IN THIS WORLD.

31
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,317
HE JUST NEEDED A CHANCE.

32
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:14,046
HE REALLY JUST NEEDED
A FRESH START.

33
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:20,363
HE'S A BOY WHO MERELY NEEDED
SOMEONE TO CARE.

34
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:30,097
THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE PART
OF MY CHURCH.

35
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:35,033
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM,
AS I DO YOU.

36
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:39,451
I'VE READ YOUR FILE
AND SPOKEN WITH YOU

37
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:46,113
AND ALL I REALLY KNOW FOR SURE
IS HOW TOUGH YOUR LIFE'S BEEN.

38
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:50,738
BUT THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE,
SON, IN HERE.

39
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,568
YOU WILL DECIDE THAT.

40
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:58,056
SO TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU WANT
OUT OF LIFE?

41
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,713
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:02,060
WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE?

43
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,856
SAY WHATEVER COMES TO MIND.

44
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,342
OKAY.

45
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:10,862
MONEY, ENOUGH SO I DON'T HAVE
TO DEPEND ON ANYONE.

46
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,971
OH, I GOT YA ON THAT ONE.

47
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,697
ME TOO.

48
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,872
BUT THAT'S THE EASY ONE.

49
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,770
BESIDES MONEY.

50
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,878
YOU'D BETTER SPEAK UP.

51
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:30,399
YOU RAN OUT OF OPTIONS LONG AGO.

52
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,677
LISTEN, SON.

53
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,748
YOU SEE, I'VE GOT A WHOLE GROUP

54
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:37,751
OF THESE OLD PRAYER WARRIOR
LADIES.

55
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:40,409
THEY'RE IN THE OTHER ROOM
KNITTING SHAWLS.

56
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,894
WELL, I'M THINKING THAT THEY'D
LIKE NOTHING MORE

57
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,147
THAN TO BE ASKED TO COME IN HERE

58
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:46,829
AND PRAY OVER A TROUBLED
YOUNG MAN.

59
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:47,899
YOU WOULDN'T.

60
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,763
IT'D MAKE THEIR WEEK.

61
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:54,112
MAYBE EVEN THEIR MONTH.

62
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,391
OKAY, I'D LIKE TO BE
ACCEPTED FOR ME.

63
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,428
NOT THE POOR KID WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A HOME.

64
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:02,983
I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE FEELING
PITY FOR ME.

65
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,060
I GOT IT.

66
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:15,478
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HONESTY.

67
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,757
I MEAN, I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH
EITHER OF THOSE TWO AREAS

68
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,933
OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT, WELL,

69
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,074
'BLESSED IS THE MAN
WHO FEARS GOD,

70
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:28,836
WHO TAKES GREAT DELIGHT
IN HIS COMMANDS.'

71
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,460
THAT WOULD BE PSALM 112.

72
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:34,911
I THINK I'D RATHER LISTEN
TO THE PRAYER SHAWL LADIES.

73
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,681
YOU TAKING HIM
TO THE LEWIS' TONIGHT?

74
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,856
YES, LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

75
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,135
THEY'RE A NICE FAMILY, SON.

76
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,930
GO EASY ON THEM, OKAY?

77
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:58,072
OOH, I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THEM,
I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST LOVELY.

78
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,599
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

79
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,153
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I NEED
TO HANDLE SOMETHING.

80
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,914
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO THEM,
RIGHT, PASTOR?

81
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,571
I WAS JUST GOING TO GRAB THEM.

82
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:16,056
LADIES, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

83
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,885
TOM, WHITNEY.

84
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,093
- REVEREND.
- HELLO.

85
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:20,578
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH

86
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,003
FOR TAKING THIS YOUNG MAN
INTO YOUR HOME.

87
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:24,582
- OF COURSE.
- IT'S TRULY GOD'S WORK.

88
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:27,067
I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT
BEABLE TO SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE,

89
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:28,827
IN MY OFFICE PERHAPS,
IF YOU HAVE A MINUTE.

90
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,519
- SURE.
- OF COURSE.

91
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:31,668
NATE, WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK
WITH REVEREND FIELDS

92
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,038
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

93
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:36,179
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- I'M COMING TOO.

94
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,009
IT'S OKAY.

95
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,154
NATE, WHY DON'T YOU SCOOT
OVER HERE WITH US?

96
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:48,122
NO. I'M OKAY RIGHT HERE.

97
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:52,851
UH, TOM, WHITNEY,
IT WAS ACTUALLY NATE

98
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:56,234
THAT REQUESTED THE MEETING.

99
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,961
HE, UH... IT'S ABOUT
THE FOSTER CHILD.

100
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:04,069
HE'S NOT A CHILD!
HE'S A 17 YEAR OLD.

101
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:10,110
NATE HAS SOME CONCERNS
WITH THE PLACEMENT.

102
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:14,563
YES, AND WE'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

103
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,048
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE IGNORING
HIS CONCERNS,

104
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:23,917
IT'S JUST THAT, UM, WE FEEL
CALLED TO DO THIS.

105
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,333
THAT, THAT'S RIGHT.

106
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,991
WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS.

107
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,751
NATE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT YOU INTO IT.

108
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:33,098
I'M BRINGING HIM INTO THISBECAUSE
HE BROUGHT THIS TO YOU.

109
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,686
AND SURELY WE CAN ALL SEE THIS

110
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,585
AS SOME SORT OF ATTEMPT
TO REPLACE JACK.

111
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,621
NATE! SHOW SOME RESPECT.

112
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,323
- WHAT? HE WAS MY BROTHER!
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

113
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:41,693
THE DECISION'S BEEN MADE.

114
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,730
HE'S COMING. THAT'S FINAL.

115
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:48,113
OKAY.

116
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,186
BEST WE PRAY ON THIS.

117
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,913
HOW 'BOUT WE READ FROM...

118
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:58,814
NATE.

119
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,097
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

120
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,341
NO, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

121
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:23,735
THAT'S CUTE, BUT NOT HELPFUL.

122
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,151
HEY, WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE
UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS

123
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:29,638
BUT IT IS HAPPENING
AND IT WON'T BE FAIR TOO HIM

124
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:33,055
IF WE DON'T MAKE HIM
FEEL WELCOME.

125
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,091
LOOK, I'M SURE HE'S GOING
TO BE FEELING NERVOUS

126
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:39,613
AND TRYING HIS HARDEST
TO FIT IN.

127
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:43,065
HEY, WE LOVE YOU
AND WE LOVE JACK

128
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:49,174
AND NOTHING WILL EVER
CHANGE THAT, OKAY?

129
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,351
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE
AN EFFORT AND BE NICE?

130
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,909
THANKS, BUD.

131
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:06,260
PUSH YOUR HAIR BACK...
AND TRY TO SMILE.

132
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:07,986
YES, CAN I HELP YOU?

133
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,955
UH... I'M LOOKING
FOR MR. AND MRS. LEWIS?

134
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,266
OH, THEY LIVE NEXT DOOR.

135
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:13,405
WHAT'S HE DONE?

136
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,131
OH, NOTHING, MA'AM.

137
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,202
HE'S JUST A FOSTER PLACEMENT
WITH THE LEWIS'.

138
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,411
IS HE PART OF A GANG?

139
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,068
NO, MA'AM.

140
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:22,459
I LEFT THEM AND I'M
HOPING TO HIDE OUT HERE

141
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,175
SO THEY DON'T FIND ME.

142
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,040
HE'S GOT A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR.

143
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,352
WE'RE SORRY FOR THE MISTAKE,
MA'AM.

144
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:33,287
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START
LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME.

145
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:36,187
PLEASE TRY TO MAKE
THE MOST OF THIS.

146
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,016
HEY.

HELLO, MISS SWANSON,

NATE, THEY'RE HERE!

157

AND THERE'S LOTS OF KIDS
YOUR AGE AND LOTS TO DO, SO.

158
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,334
DO I REALLY HAVE TO BE HERE
FOR THIS?

159
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,026
YES.

160
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:25,857
THIS IS OUR SON, NATE.

161
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,826
HI, NATE! THIS IS MASON.

162
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,035

00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,933
NICE TO MEET YOU, MASON.

00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,797
- YOU TOO, CHIEF.

165
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,523
IT'S MR. AND MRS. LEWIS.

00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,145
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

167
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,251
HE REALLY IS TRYING HARD
TO FIT IN HERE.

168
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,253
OH, OF COURSE, I AM.

169
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,333
IT'S BEEN MY DREAM
TO COME AND LIVE

170
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,981
WITH YOUR PERFECT LITTLE FAMILY.

171
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,810
I'M SO SORRY.

172
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:51,365
YOU KNOW TEENAGERS,
AND IT'S A ROUGH TRANSITION.

173
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,471
I CAN SPEAK WITH HIM
IF YOU'D LIKE.

174
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,025
- WOULD YOU USE A CLUB?
- NATE!

175
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,236
THIS IS GREAT...

176
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:05,345
WE JUST HAVE TO GET TO
KNOWEACH OTHER A LITTLE, THAT'S ALL.

177
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:37,239
COME TO SEE THE NEWEST
ATTRACTION?

178
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,965
YOU'RE OUR FIRST.

179
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,554
IF THEY'RE ALL LIKE YOU,
I CAN'TSEE US GETTING ANY MORE.

180
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:45,178
WELL, ZOO'S CLOSED.

181
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,009
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE
OUR DOORS CLOSED.

182
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,504
YEAH, WELL, I'M OLDER.
DIFFERENT RULES.

183
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,150
JACK WAS OLDER TOO.

184
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,187
HE FOLLOWED THE SAME RULES.

185
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,947
WHO'S JACK?

186
00:12:57,052 --> 00:13:00,193
MY BROTHER.

187
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:02,229
THIS IS HIS ROOM.

188
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:06,199
WHERE'S HE, BESIDES
KEEPING AWAY FROM YOU?

189
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:11,894
HE'S IN HEAVEN NOW,
AND WE GOT ALONG JUST FINE.

190
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,483
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN HEAVEN.

191
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,592
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

192
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,947
DID YOU TELL HIM DINNER
WAS READY?

193
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:23,492
I TOLD HIM, BUT HIS DOOR
IS CLOSED,

194
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:25,839
SO WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S
DOING IN THERE.

195
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,635
NATE, WE HAVE TO LET HIM FIT IN,
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

196
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,464
WE HAVE TO EARN HIS TRUST
AND RESPECT

197
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:33,157
LIKE HE HAS TO FOR US.

198
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:46,135
MASON, DINNERTIME.

199
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,900
MASON.

200
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:56,283
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY,
YOU GOTTA TO LET ME KNOW.

201
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:08,882
MASON! OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!

202
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,505
NICE CALL WITH THE DOOR.

203
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,890
THAT'S IT.

204
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,893
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME
IN THERE, MASON.

205
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,865
WHY DID YOU HAVE
THIS DOOR... LOCKED.

206
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:30,559
- HE'S GONE.
- WHAT?

207
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,009
WAIT, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

208
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,700
I'M GOING TO GO TRY TO FIND HIM.

209
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:37,290
SHOULDN'T WE CALL PASTOR FIELDSOR SWANSON?

210
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:40,465
NO, NO, LET ME, LET ME TRY
TO FIND HIM FIRST.

211
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,502
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
INTO A BIGGER DEAL

212
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,124
THAN IT ALREADY IS.

213
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,541
STAY HERE IN CASE
HE COMES BACK OR CALLS.

214
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,346
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

215
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,279
THANK YOU.

216
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:06,629
LEAVE YOUR BAG ON
THE COUNTER, PLEASE.

217
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,390
WHAT FOR?

218
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,461
STORE POLICY.

219
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,464
YEAH, WELL, MY POLICY IS
TO KEEP IT WITH ME.

220
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:14,948
OKAY.

221
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:18,020
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY THEN.

222
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:20,402
YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS TO MAKE ME
LEAVE THIS BAG.

223
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,300
THIS IS DISCRIMINATION.

224
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:25,303
I HAVE TEENAGERS COMING IN
HEREAND STEALING ME BLIND.

225
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,203
IF YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM,
CONGRATULATIONS.

226
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,722
BUT YOU STILL GOTTA
TO LEAVE THE BAG.

227
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:40,629
I THOUGHT CHRISTIANS ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE TRUSTING.

228
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:44,978
'IN GOD I TRUST,
ALL OTHERS PAY CASH, '

229
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:48,637
AND LEAVE THEIR BAG UP HERE.

230
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,265
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

231
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,578
- I'M ABOUT TO CALL THE COPS.
- FOR WHAT?

232
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:01,408
FOR NOT FOLLOWING STORE RULES.

233
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,100
FINE! HERE.

234
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:08,312
HMM.

235
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,363
DON'T YOU WANT TO CHECK
MY POCKETS?

236
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,780
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

237
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:31,024
SCHOOL PROJECT.

238
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,510
WHAT, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT TO BUY TOO?

239
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:38,825
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE.
YOU WANT A BAG?

240
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,310
I GOT ONE.

241
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:14,067
GOOD EVENING. WHAT'S GOING ON?

242
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,665
A MALE TEENAGER BOUGHT
SPRAY PAINT FROM HER,

243
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,554
THEN VANDALIZED THE STORE.

244
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:22,593
UM, WHAT, UH, WHAT DID
HE LOOK LIKE?

245
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,873
AVERAGE BUILD, MAYBE 17.

246
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:32,361
CURLY DARK HAIR,
DARK BACKPACK, DARK CLOTHES.

247
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,675
THIS KID LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
GOING NOWHERE REAL FAST.

248
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:41,508
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SIR?

249
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:52,243
HEY, HE JUST GOT BACK.

250
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:54,418
I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM
BUT HE WENT IN HIS ROOM.

251
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,626
I BET.

252
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,869
JUST GO EASY ON HIM.

253
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,871
WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING
TO BE CHALLENGING.

254
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,115
HE VANDALIZED
A CONVENIENCE STORE!

255
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,840
THE POLICE ARE THERE.

256
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:04,497
WHAT?

257
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,154
HEY.

258
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:07,638
WHAT'S GOING ON?

259
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,606
WHERE DID YOU GO?

260
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,918
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

261
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,714
MASON, WE'RE NOT STUPID.

262
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,681
OKAY, OKAY, I JUST NEEDED
SOME AIR, YOU KNOW.

263
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:19,788
I BORROWED A BIKE AND RODE IT
AROUND, BUT I BROUGHT IT BACK.

264
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:25,138
YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE,
ESPECIALLY THROUGH A WINDOW1

265
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,830
WE WANT THIS TO WORK,
WE WANT YOU HERE,

266
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,522
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR PART.

267
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,282
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.

268
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:34,630
HEY, NO ONE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ME, BUT ME.

269
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:38,669
OH. SOUNDS TOUGH,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

270
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,291
WHILE YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE,

271
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,639
YOU'LL RESPECT US AND
THE RULESOF THE HOUSE.

272
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:45,814
OR WHAT? YOU'LL KICK ME OUT?

273
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,505
BEEN THERE.

274
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,921
MASON, CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP?

275
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,407
I MEAN, WE'VE WELCOMED YOU
INTO OUR HOME.

276
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,926
WE FEEL CALLED TO HAVE YOU
AS PART OF THIS FAMILY.

277
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,687
A CALLING, HUH?

278
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,620
WELL, THEN IT HAS TO BE RIGHT.

279
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,863
"TO VISIT ORPHANS AND WIDOWS
IN THEIR AFFLICTION,

280
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:06,559
AND TO KEEP ONESELF UNSTAINED
FROM THE WORLD."

281
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,182
THAT'S FROM JAMES.

282
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,737
GOD DOESN'T CARE
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

283
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,912
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU!

284
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,603
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DAD.

285
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:21,608
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HEAVEN.

286
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,610
YEAH, FORGET THIS.

287
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,647
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

288
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,235
GET BACK HERE YOUNG MAN.

289
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,419
WE STILL NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE GRAFFITI!

290
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:31,653
TOM, JUST, JUST GIVE HIM
A MINUTE.

291
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:39,730
GOD, IT'S NATE, JACK'S BROTHER.

292
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:42,250
PLEASE LET HIM KNOW

293
00:19:42,284 --> 00:19:45,322
THAT I THINK ABOUT HIM
ALL THE TIME.

294
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:51,845
LORD, TELL HIM THAT
I MISS HIM SO BAD.

295
00:19:55,297 --> 00:20:01,545
GOD, WHY IS IT THAT GOOD
PEOPLELIKE JACK GET TAKEN AWAY

296
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:06,860
AND THEN THE BAD ONES
LIKE MASON GET TO STAY?

297
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:10,761
WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE ONLY
GOOD PEOPLE GET TO GO TO HEAVEN?

298
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,695
ANYWAY, THANK YOU, GOD.

299
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,731
AMEN.

300
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,023
I TELL YOU AGNES, THERE'S
SOMETHING HORRIBLE GOING ON

301
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,371
OVER AT THAT HOME.

302
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,686
HELLO, MISS SWANSON,
PLEASE COME IN.

303
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:43,897
HE'S IN HERE.

304
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:53,918
YOU GOT THIS?
I'M GONNA GO DEAL WITH NATE.

305
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:56,634
YEAH, YEAH.

306
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,981
HELLO, MASON.

307
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,536
WE NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK
ABOUT THE VANDALISM DONE

308
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,686
TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE
ON PLEASANT AVENUE LAST NIGHT.

309
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,816
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

310
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,404
NO.

311
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:11,304
I WAS, I WAS HERE
ALL LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

312
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,376
IT WAS MR. LEWIS WHO CALLED ME
AND REPORTED YOU

313
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:17,345
AS MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE SUSPECT.

314
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,794
NICE.

315
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,831
GUESS YOU GOT A NEW CALLING?

316
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,936
THE STORE OWNER HAS ID'ED YOU
FROM A PHOTOGRAPH.

317
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:25,042
SHE'S GOING TO PRESS CHARGES.

318
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,699
YOUR FILE IS GOING
TO BE REVIEWED

319
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:29,805
AND A JUDGE WILL DECIDE
THE NEXT STEPS.

320
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,876
MR. LEWIS, THANK YOU
FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP.

321
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:33,878
I'LL JUST GRAB MY BAG.
I'LL BE READY IN FIVE.

322
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:38,642
AH, HOLD ON. STAY RIGHT THERE.

323
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:40,471
DON'T I HAVE TO GO WITH HER?

324
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,749
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF
HERE THAT EASILY, MISTER.

325
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,131
NOTHING HAS CHANGED BETWEEN US.

326
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,891
YOU ARE STILL PART
OF THIS FAMILY.

327
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:48,928
WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS TOGETHER.

328
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,043
LET ME KNOW WHEN
HIS COURT DATE IS

329
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,724
AND WE'LL MAKE SURE HE IS THERE.

330
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:55,106
OKAY, AND IT SHOULD BE
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

331
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,695
OKAY. GO AHEAD AND FINISH
YOUR BREAKFAST.

332
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,939
MISS SWANSON, I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

333
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:03,770
OH YEAH, AND BY THE WAY, YOUR
COURT-ORDERED GROUP MEETINGS

334
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:04,885
START AFTER SCHOOL TONIGHT.

335
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,877
YOU'RE ALL SIGNED UP.

336
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,956
THAT'S FUNNY, AGNES.

337
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,578
I THOUGHT FOR SURE

338
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,925
THEY'D BE DRAGGING THAT
HOODLUMOFF IN HANDCUFFS.

339
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,140
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK AT ALL

340
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:30,970
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

341
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:35,043
FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEONE WHO
BELIEVES IS GONNA HAVE

342
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,838
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
POINT OF VIEW

343
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,392
FROM SOMEONE WHO
DOES NOT BELIEVE.

344
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:40,911
YOU WITH ME?

345
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:45,881
HELLO LACEY, GLAD YOU
COULD JOIN US.

346
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,955
YOU WERE SAYING?

347
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,612
YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE.

348
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,959
BIG SURPRISE.

349
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,547
AND YOU DO?

350
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,067
YEAH, BUT NOT IN SOME
GOOD GUY IN THE SKY.

351
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:02,450
MORE LIKE A PUPPET MASTER
LOOKING FOR LAUGHS.

352
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:04,900
WHAT, DID YOU
READ THAT ON SOME T-SHIRT?

353
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,799
YOU HAVE A SMART MOUTH...

354
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:10,147
LOOKS LIKE THE NEW GUY'SGOT
A LITTLE BIT OF AN ATTITUDE.

355
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,045
RELAX, RELAX, RELAX.

356
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,117
WE'VE ALL GOT PROBLEMS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

357
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:19,121
THERE'S NO ONE HERE TO JUDGE
WHO'S RIGHT AND WHO'S WRONG.

358
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:21,469
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUTBETTER WAYS

359
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:23,505
TO DEAL WITH THOSE PROBLEMS.

360
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,094
TRY TO UNDERSTAND LIFE
A LITTLE BETTER.

361
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:30,201
AND HOPEFULLY, AS WE GO,
GET OVER OUR PREJUDICES.

362
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:36,069
RUBY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

363
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,973
I SEE YOU'RE FAMILIAR

364
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:45,872
WITH THE NEWEST MEMBER
OF OUR GROUP, HUH?

365
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,465
- MOM?
- MMM HMM.

366
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,191
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

367
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,469
MY FRIEND STEVE TO ME
YOU'RE TRYING TO COPE

368
00:23:56,504 --> 00:24:00,473
WITH THE LOSS OF JACK BY
REPLACING HIM WITH MASON.

369
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:03,821
STEVE, THE 14 YEAR OLD
ON YOUR BASEBALL TEAM?

370
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,616
YEAH.

371
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:09,551
SOUNDS LIKE STEVE NEEDS TO
STOPWATCHING DAYTIME TALK SHOWS.

372
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:18,215
HONEY LISTEN, LOSING JACK IS
JUST PART OF THIS.

373
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:22,150
WE REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN
HELP MASON.

374
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:25,705
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT YOU.

375
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,880
YOU'RE OUR SON.

376
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,194
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

377
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:36,026
HEY. WE'RE JUST, YOU KNOW,
JUST DOING DISHES.

378
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,270
WELL, HE'S AT THE GROUP.

379
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:41,963
HOPEFULLY WALLACE CAN HELP.

380
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,758
I HOPE HE DOESN'T GRAFFITI
THE CHURCH.

381
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,794
- NATE.
- WHAT?

382
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:47,831
LOOK AT HIS ROOM.

383
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:51,041
HE VANDALIZED MY STORE.

384
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,905
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF HER.

385
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:54,872
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE OF YOU
AND YOUR ACTIONS.

386
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,736
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOUR ACTIONS?

387
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:57,989
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
EVERYBODY, PLEASE SETTLE DOWN.

388
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,912
RUBY, HAVE A SEAT.

389
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,124
- COULDN'T YOU HAVE WARNED ME?
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

390
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,954
THE COURT MANDATED HE ATTEND.

391
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:10,957
DID THE JUVIE COURT SEND
LITTLE MASON FOR SOME THERAPY?

392
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:12,959
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
YOUR MOM SEND YOU?

393
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:15,237
DEE, SIT DOWN.

394
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:17,170
THE NEW GUY'S GOT A MOUTH
THAT NEEDS CLOSING.

395
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:19,241
NOT IN MY MEETING!

396
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:22,624
HE HAS ZERO RESPECT
FOR ANYTHING. GOOD LUCK.

397
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:24,039
BLAME YOUR GOD.

398
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,007
HEY! THAT'S IT, THIS ENDS HERE.

399
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,250
MASON, RUBY, YOU WANNA LEAVE?

400
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:29,907
I WILL TAKE IT UP WITH YOU
AFTERWARDS

401
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,358
AND WE'LL MAKE OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS.

402
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:35,119
I'M NOT LEAVING.

403
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:37,294
WHY SHOULD I LEAVE?

404
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:53,034
IS IT WORTH ALL THIS, DAD?

405
00:25:57,832 --> 00:26:00,282
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING'S
DIFFICULT

406
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:03,562
DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T
WORTH DOING.

407
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:11,846
I MISS HIM.

408
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,058
I DO TOO, SON.

409
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:21,269
SO ALL COMMENTS ARE
DIRECTED ONLY AT ME

410
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:25,031
AND ONLY ON THE SUBJECT
AT HAND, OKAY?

411
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:28,828
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT RULES.

412
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:30,899
WHY DO WE HAVE THEM?

413
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:33,108
TO KEEP EVERYONE IN LINE.

414
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:35,939
YEAH. TO KEEP PEOPLE
FROM ACTING LIKE FOOLS.

415
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,735
WELL, YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.

416
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,117
WITHOUT SOME SORT OF RULES,
THERE'D BE TOTAL CHAOS.

417
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:43,740
YOU COULDN'T PLAY FOOTBALL.

418
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:46,190
COULDN'T PLAY BASEBALL
WITHOUT RULES.

419
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:48,883
AND WE EVEN HIRE PEOPLE
TO ENFORCE THOSE RULES

420
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:53,025
LIKE JUDGES, REFEREES,
POLICEMEN.

421
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,199
AND THEN THEY MAKE UP
THEIR OWN RULES.

422
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:57,305
MASON.

423
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,238
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SET
OF BASIC RULES

424
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:03,863
MANY SOCIETIES BASE THEIR CODE
OF CONDUCT ON?

425
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:06,210
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE?

426
00:27:06,245 --> 00:27:08,281
NO.

427
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:10,905
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
FROM THE BIBLE.

428
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,979
WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS ARE HERE, RIGHT?

429
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:17,774
GOD'S LAWS.

430
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:22,364
YES, A SET OF BIBLICAL
LAWSRELATING TO ETHICS AND WORSHIP.

431
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,403
THE WORD OF GOD.

432
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:30,959
MASON, IF THERE'S ONE
COLLECTIVEKEY TO THESE LAWS OR RULES,

433
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:32,927
WHAT WOULD IT WOULD BE?

434
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:36,309
OBEDIENCE?

435
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:40,486
YEAH, THAT'S PART OF IT.

436
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,108
BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT WHY

437
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,499
WE SHOULD BE OBEDIENT
TO THESE RULES.

438
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:46,423
LOVE?

439
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,252
PRETTY CLOSE, LACEY.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

440
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,461
IT'S RESPECT.

441
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:54,155
RESPECT FOR GOD,
RESPECT FOR YOUR PARENTS,

442
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:57,710
RESPECT FOR OTHERS
AND THEIR PROPERTY.

443
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:00,437
SO THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S
SO MESSED UP.

444
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,198
SOME GUY LIVING IN A CAVE
LOOKING AFTER SHEEP

445
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,788
TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO IS
GOINGTO DICTATE HOW WE LIVE TODAY.

446
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:08,790
SO MASON, YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT CONSIDERATION

447
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,033
FOR OTHERS IS IMPORTANT?

448
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:13,174
WHY? HUH?

449
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:17,143
SO WE CAN HONOR PARENTS
WHO BEAT US?

450
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:22,217
SON, IF SOMEONE HAS HURT YOU,
I AM SORRY.

451
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:24,806
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

452
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,808
BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING
SEEMS OUTDATED

453
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:30,122
DOES NOT MAKE IT WRONG.

454
00:28:30,156 --> 00:28:32,469
LIKE WE CAN'T EVEN SAY
THE WORD, "GOD".

455
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,471
C'MON.

456
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,198
LITTLE KIDS SING 'STICKS
AND STONES MAY BREAK MY BONES'

457
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,338
BUT THE CREATOR OF THE
UNIVERSECAN'T HANDLE HIS NAME

458
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,477
BEING TOSSED AROUND?

459
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,548
I TOLD YOU.

460
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:45,793
MASON, ONCE AGAIN,
IT'S ABOUT RESPECT.

461
00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:47,553
IT'S ABOUT REVERENCE.

462
00:28:47,587 --> 00:28:49,935
AND WHO GETS THIS RESPECT?

463
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:51,522
- YOU?
- IF I'VE EARNED IT.

464
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:54,008
- HER?
- IF SHE'S EARNED IT.

465
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,354
THE MAN IN THE MOON?

466
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,252
IF THE MAN IN THE MOON
HAS EARNED IT.

467
00:28:57,287 --> 00:28:58,460
YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE YOU?

468
00:28:58,495 --> 00:29:00,048
WHY NOT HIM?

469
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,498
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

470
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,086
AND YOU DO?

471
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,812
AT LEAST I'M NOT OUT
VANDALIZING STUFF!

472
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,123
YOU'VE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE?

473
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:08,263
OKAY, GUYS, THAT'S ENOUGH.

474
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:10,300
AS WE'VE PROVEN TO EACH OTHER
TONIGHT,

475
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:14,545
RESPECT FOR OTHERS IS NOT
ALWAYS EASY.

476
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,410
NOR DO WE ALWAYS DESERVE IT.

477
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:20,517
BUT JUST THINK, RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW,

478
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,830
IF WE DO RESPECT EACH OTHER,

479
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:26,868
HOW DIFFERENT THIS CONVERSATIONMIGHT BE?

480
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:28,456
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE QUIETER.

481
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,286
GOOD GIRL.

482
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:35,497
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
FROM YOU.

483
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:36,982
YOU GOT SOME GUTS.

484
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,373
AND YOU'D ALREADY MADE UP
YOUR MIND?

485
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:40,502
PRETTY GIRL, NICE CLOTHES.

486
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:42,457
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE IN HERE
TO HAND OUT COOKIES.

487
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:46,405
KEEP IT UP, MACY.

488
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:50,616
NEXT TIME I'LL TEACH YOU
ABOUT RESPECT.

489
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,481
HEY, SOMETHING GOING ON?

490
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,447
I'VE GOTTA GO.

491
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:55,448
SEE YOU NEXT TIME?

492
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:59,073
YOU BRINGING COOKIES?

493
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:01,972
MAKING FRIENDS, THAT'S GREAT.

494
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,492
BUT YOU'D BETTER
STEER CLEAR OF THAT ONE.

495
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:06,287
- HER DAD IS...
- TOM.

496
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,876
MAY I, MAY I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

497
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,533
JUST GO WAIT BY THE CAR,
TWO MINUTES.

498
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,609
TOM,
IT'S GREATWHAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO,

499
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:19,610
BUT THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

500
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,474
THIS KID HAS ATTITUDE.

501
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:24,546
OH, JUST DISCOVERING THAT.

502
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,617
I'M NOT SURE HE CAN STAY
IN THE GROUP.

503
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:28,447
THE COURT MANDATED IT.

504
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,070
THE COURT MANDATED A GROUP.

505
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:32,900
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS ONE.

506
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:35,454
AND RUBY, THE CONVENIENCE STOREOWNER,
IS ALSO IN THIS GROUP.

507
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:37,180
- SHE COMES BY.
- OH?

508
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,906
YEAH, A FEW YEARS AGO
FOR ASSAULT.

509
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,082
SHE DID HER TIME,
BUT SHE LIKES COMING HERE

510
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:47,466
AND IT'S HARD TO ASK HER
NOT TO STAY, YOU KNOW.

511
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,883
BUT NOT FOR MASON?

512
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:54,956
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR THE GROUP, TOM.

513
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,131
AND IT'S PROBABLY TOUGH ON HIM
TO SEE HER HERE,

514
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,340
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

515
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,549
I'LL, I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.

516
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,378
- THANKS, TOM.
- YEAH.

517
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:08,901
GUESS HE DIDN'T SAY
I WAS HIS STAR PUPIL?

518
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:13,526
HE, UH, HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
IN THE GROUP.

519
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:14,641
TOUGH. THE COURT PUT ME THERE.

520
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,323
YES, BUT HE RUNS THE GROUP,

521
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,645
AND IF HE ASKS THE COURT
TO TRANSFER YOU,

522
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:23,329
THAT'LL, THAT'LL PROBABLY
HAPPEN.

523
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,228
TYPICAL.

524
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,507
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING EVERYONE?

525
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,095
WHITNEY AND I ARE TRYING TO HELP

526
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:31,486
AND YOU'RE TREATING US
LIKE ENEMIES.

527
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,926
EVERYONE DOES STUFF
FOR THEIR REASONS.

528
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,550
SO YOU'RE OKAY WITH BEING
TRANSFERRED?

529
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,725
NO. I WANT TO STAY HERE.

530
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,176
REALLY?

531
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,557
WHY?

532
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:48,216
LIKE I SAID, EVERYONE DOES
STUFF FOR THEIR REASONS.

533
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:58,502
ALMOST DONE, DAD?

534
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:02,127
JUST ABOUT.

535
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:04,612
I'M ON THE LAST DAY
OF THIS WEEK'S SCHEDULE.

536
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:06,717
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M HUNGRY.

537
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,722
HOW ABOUT PIZZA?

538
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:15,105
WORKS FOR ME.

539
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:33,503
LOVING FATHER, I NEED YOUR HELP.

540
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:37,610
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
PAY ALL THIS.

541
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:40,510
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING.

542
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:20,791
WHERE'S MASON?

543
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,690
I TRIED.

544
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,633
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH TOO HARD,
HE'LL JUST DO THE OPPOSITE.

545
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,763
DAD, I'VE GOT IT.

546
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,523
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

547
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:30,422
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, HONEY.

548
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:31,388
I'VE GOT TO RUN.

549
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:33,287
OKAY.

550
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:37,153
YOUR BREAKFAST IS ON THE TABLE.

551
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:38,440
YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES TO EAT
AND GET READY.

552
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:41,743
I'M NOT GONNA TO BE LATE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

553
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:45,644
COME ON, LET'S GO!

554
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:51,270
YOU MADE ME BREAKFAST?

555
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:58,726
DAD, WE NEED TO GO.

556
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,556
DAD, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

557
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,558
- LET ME GO GET MASON.
- DAD...

558
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,835
WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION ABOUT?

559
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,838
OH. WELL, GOOD MORNING.

560
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,840
LET'S GO.

561
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,441
HEY, LACE.

562
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,373
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

563
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,272
FINE.

564
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,796
THAT DIDN'T SOUND SO GOOD.

565
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,902
JUST SOME OF THE KIDS ARE
BEING MEAN.

566
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:38,490
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

567
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,733
PATTI'S IGNORING ME.

568
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,599
GRACE WON'T EAT WITH ME ANYMORE.

569
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,498
DID YOU DO SOMETHING?

570
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:47,878
NO!

571
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:50,709
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

572
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,745
WHY IS IT ALWAYS MY FAULT?

573
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,575
SWEETHEART, I'M JUST ASKING.

574
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,474
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW.

575
00:34:57,509 --> 00:35:02,686
I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

576
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,792
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW.

577
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:07,622
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

578
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:13,697
LACE?

579
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,713
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'D BE HARD?

580
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,808
NEW SCHOOL, NO FRIENDS?

581
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,475
AND YOU THINK MOUTHING OFF
TO YOUR TEACHERS

582
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:24,639
MAKES IT ANY EASIER?

583
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:26,676
I GIVE WHAT I GET.

584
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,678
BUT THEY'RE YOUR TEACHERS.

585
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,818
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

586
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:33,545
WHY SHOULD I?

587
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,901
YOU MIGHT GET WHAT YOU GIVE.

588
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,421
GO ALONG WITH THINGS.

589
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:51,459
MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER ON THEM,
THEY'LL MAKE IT EASIER ON YOU.

590
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:53,634
SO BE A PHONY?

591
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,738
NO, NO.

592
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,914
JUST SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT.

593
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,743
HEY DUDE, JUST BE SMART.

594
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:01,918
PLAY THE SYSTEM.

595
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:05,749
SCHEMERS AND PHONIES,
GREAT ROLE MODELS.

596
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:17,589
DINNER'S IN TWO HOURS, GUYS.

597
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,289
STUPID WINDOW.

598
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:46,928
GO AWAY.

599
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:49,448
I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

600
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:51,485
OKAY, FINE.

601
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,628
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

602
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:58,664
LET ME PAINT YOUR ROOM.

603
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,563
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

604
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:03,704
DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

605
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:05,050
OKAY.

606
00:37:05,084 --> 00:37:06,752
DON'T EXPECT ME TO RETURN
THE FAVOR THOUGH.

607
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:09,917
DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

608
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:12,609
THIS ABOUT JACK?

609
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:18,857
OKAY, GO AHEAD.

610
00:37:21,342 --> 00:37:24,414
HAVE WE MADE A MISTAKE?

611
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:29,730
I WAS NEVER SURE ABOUT IT,
BUT WE CAN'T BACK OUT NOW.

612
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,490
YOU SAID YOU FELT CALLED, RIGHT?

613
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,734
YEAH. FELT IT.

614
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:36,633
FIELDS SAID THE SAME THING.

615
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:39,049
WELL, THEN WE HAVE TO
HONOR THAT.

616
00:37:39,084 --> 00:37:42,605
IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD ON NATE.

617
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,435
I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE TWO
WILL EVER GET ALONG.

618
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:53,754
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT PAINTING.

619
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:58,068
YEAH, FOSTER FAMILIES NEED
A LOT OF MANUAL LABOR.

620
00:37:58,103 --> 00:38:00,899
WHAT'S THAT LIKE, LIVING
WITH DIFFERENT FAMILIES?

621
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:04,005
OH, WELL, SOME GOOD, SOME BAD.

622
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,491
I'VE HAVE FRIENDS WHO'VE
HAD GREAT FAMILIES.

623
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:08,872
BUT NOT YOU?

624
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:10,460
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

625
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:13,705
I'M JUST SAYING THAT SOMETIMES
IT'S HARD.

626
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,364
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

627
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:20,988
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY ON ME.

628
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,541
WHY'S THAT?

629
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:23,863
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS NEW
FOSTER BROTHER

630
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,718
WHO'S JUST MESSING UP
EVERYTHING.

631
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,547
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS TOUGH.

632
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,962
REAL JERK, HUH?

633
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,344
HE HAS HIS MOMENTS.

634
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:36,866
YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S EVER
CALLED ME BROTHER BEFORE.

635
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,939
NATE! MASON! TIME FOR DINNER.

636
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:44,011
JUST PUT A PLASTIC BAG OVER
ITAND I'LL PUT IT IN THE FREEZER.

637
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:46,116
IT'LL THAW AFTER DINNER
AND WE CAN CONTINUE.

638
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,946
THANKS.

639
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:54,159
YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST
CALLED HER MRS. TUCKER?

640
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:55,678
MOM AND DAD ARE GOING TO FREAK.

641
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:56,748
HER FIRST NAME IS ANN.

642
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:58,163
YEAH, BUT SHE'S A TEACHER.

643
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:01,925
TEACHERS ARE CALLED MR.
AND MRS. AND MISS.

644
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,996
THEY ONLY DO THAT TO KEEP US
IN OUR PLACE.

645
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,722
YEAH.

646
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:07,793
YOU'RE REALLY BAD WITH NAMES,
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

647
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:10,520
IT'S WHAT FIRST DEFINES US.

648
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:14,041
PEOPLE CAN USE NAMES TO PUT
YOU DOWN OR CATEGORIZE YOU.

649
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:16,871
BUT THE TEACHERS WANT
RESPECT ALSO.

650
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:20,116
MAKE THEM EARN IT. COME ON.

651
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,950
SO DO YOU KNOW LACEY AT ALL?

652
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,987
LACEY FIELDS?
THE PREACHER'S KID?

653
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,747
PREACHER'S KID, CAN'T BE.

654
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:31,897
SHE'S IN THAT GROUP WITH ME.

655
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,543
YUP, THAT'S THE ONE.

656
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:34,924
HER DAD'S THE PASTOR
AT OUR CHURCH

657
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,753
SO I SEE HER THERE ALL THE TIME.

658
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,479
SHE'S PRETTY.

659
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:40,723
SO YOU DO LOOK AT MORE
THAN JUST BOOKS.

660
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:42,138
OH, HA HA.

661
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,002
DO YOU LIKE HER?

662
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:48,006
I HEARD SHE GOT PUT
IN THAT GROUP

663
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,594
FOR BULLYING PEOPLE
ON THE INTERNET.

664
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:50,802
REALLY?

665
00:39:50,836 --> 00:39:54,840
HA! GOT YOU, I WIN.

666
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,877
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

667
00:40:07,163 --> 00:40:09,614
CAN I HOPE THIS IS ABOUT NATE?

668
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,999
HERE ARE THE ISSUES:

669
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:19,140
THE GROUP LEADER DOESN'T WANT
YOU THERE ANYMORE.

670
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:21,764
THE PRINCIPAL SAYS YOU'RE
OUT OF CHANCES.

671
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,144
THERE WON'T BE ANYMORE.

672
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:25,906
NEXT STEP IS SUSPENSION
OR EXPULSION.

673
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,218
AND THEN THERE'S
THE VANDALISM CHARGES.

674
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:31,187
ALL OF THESE IN JUST THREE DAYS.

675
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,992
WELL, ISN'T THERE SOME SORT
OF A GRACE PERIOD?

676
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:36,779
I MEAN, I THINK THAT WE'RE
DOING BETTER NOW.

677
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:37,918
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE.

678
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:40,058
THAT GROUP IS A MANDATORY THING.

679
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:43,199
IF HE DOESN'T ATTEND IT,
HE GETS SENT TO JUVIE.

680
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:46,961
AND IF HE'S NOT IN SCHOOL,
HE GETS SENT TO JUVIE.

681
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:49,757
AND IF THOSE CHARGES AREN'T
MITIGATED IN SOME WAY,

682
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:53,071
HE GOES TO JUVIE.

683
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:55,625
ANYTHING TO SAY, MASON?

684
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,011
LOOKS LIKE I'M HEADING TO JUVIE.

685
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,290
REALLY? THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO, JUST GIVE UP, MOVE ON?

686
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:08,604
YOU TELL ME.

687
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,606
COULD YOU EXCUSE US,
MASON, FOR A MINUTE?

688
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,058
I NEED TO SPEAK TO MR.
AND MRS. LEWIS ALONE.

689
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:24,965
CAN I BORROW SOMETHING?

690
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,587
YEAH, SURE, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

691
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:28,624
YOUR WINDOW.

692
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:36,010
I THINK IT'S BEST AND SAFEST
FOR EVERYONE

693
00:41:36,045 --> 00:41:40,083
IF MASON'S JUST HANDED OVER
TO JUVENILE DETENTION.

694
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:43,604
HE'S BEEN HEADED THAT WAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

695
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,057
WE'VE... BUT WE'VE ONLY HAD HIM
A FEW DAYS.

696
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,266
THIS ISN'T YOUR PROBLEM.

697
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,337
THE KID WAS MESSED UP
WHEN HE GOT HERE.

698
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:55,754
DON'T LET IT BECOME MORE
THAN YOU CAN HANDLE.

699
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:59,586
JUST LET US THINK ABOUT IT.

700
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,104
THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP
SESSION TONIGHT.

701
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:02,865
MAYBE HE SHOULD JUST GO TO THAT

702
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:05,868
AND WE'LL, WE'LL SEE
HOW IT GOES.

703
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:07,973
OKAY.

704
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,666
I'LL BE AROUND IF ANYONE
NEEDS ME.

705
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,348
WHERE ARE YOUR CHAPERONES?

706
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,326
I'M GOING TO BE SENT TO JUVIE
UNLESS YOU DROP THOSE CHARGES.

707
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,800
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

708
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:43,053
WE SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING LIKE THIS.

709
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:44,838
I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

710
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:47,012
OH, DID SOMEBODY ELSE PAINT
'BLAME GOD' ON MY STORE?

711
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,394
YOU ANTAGONIZED ME.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET BY.

712
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:51,948
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT HAS IT ROUGH.

713
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:55,331
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT YOU
HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

714
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,332
FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

715
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,059
YEAH, I GET IT.

716
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:00,992
NO ONE CARES ABOUT ANYTHING
BUT THEIR OWN STUFF.

717
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,752
NOT CHRISTIANS, NOT GOD.

718
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:04,271
HEY, SHOW SOME RESPECT.

719
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,100
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT HE THINKS,

720
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:07,861
WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING ME?

721
00:43:07,895 --> 00:43:11,140
MAYBE I AM BY NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

722
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:15,662
OR MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY SAIDYOU
WERE SORRY FOR WHAT YOU DID,

723
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,008
IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

724
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,906
NOT LIKELY.

725
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,224
MASON, OPEN UP!

726
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:28,709
MACE, COME ON. WE NEED TO TALK.

727
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:31,781
MASON!

728
00:43:31,816 --> 00:43:33,680
I'D LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE WAS PRETTY MAD.

729
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,095
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TALK.

730
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:37,373
DAD, MOM, HE JUST NEEDS A BREAK.

731
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,375
HONEY, HE'S NOT HAPPY HERE.

732
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,204
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T
FORCE HIM TO STAY.

733
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,035
WELL, IF JACK WAS IN TROUBLE,
WOULD YOU SEND HIM AWAY?

734
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:46,209
THIS IS DIFFERENT, NATE.

735
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:48,142
IF YOU SAY SO.

736
00:43:56,288 --> 00:43:59,429
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST SEE
WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT.

737
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:01,397
YOU THINK HE SHOULD GO
BACK TO THE GROUP?

738
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:02,881
WELL, YEAH.

739
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:05,021
I MEAN, HE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

740
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:06,481
YOU KNOW, WHY SHOULD
HE HAVE TO LEAVE

741
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:08,035
JUST BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE GROUP?

742
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:09,716
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT THEM?

743
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,925
YOU WEREN'T SO SURE
ABOUT HIM BEFORE.

744
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:15,169
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT HE'S
GOT A POINT.

745
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:17,275
YEAH.

746
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:19,139
MASON'S NOT JACK.

747
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:23,419
NO, BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
PART OF THIS FAMILY.

748
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:27,457
THIS IS SOMETHING WE TOOK ON
AND I JUST...

749
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:31,289
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

750
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,153
I LOVE YOU.

751
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:34,982
I LOVE YOU TOO.

752
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:39,815
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET DINNER GOING.

753
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,240
OH YEAH, OKAY,
I'LL GO GET IT READY.

754
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,439
OKAY, I'LL SEE IF I CAN
GET HIM OUT OF HIS ROOM.

755
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,169
MASON!

756
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:51,481
SHHHH! SHHH, SHHH!

757
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:54,208
MY DAD'S KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR!

758
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:55,831
MACE?

759
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:56,970
C'MON, OPEN THE DOOR.

760
00:44:57,004 --> 00:44:57,798
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

761
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,145
IT'S "MASON".

762
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,493
HOLD, HOLD ON.

763
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:05,047
MACE, OPEN UP! WE NEED TO TALK.

764
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:06,842
LET ME DO IT.

765
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,775
HE NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE RULES
OF THE HOUSE.

766
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,536
WELL, MAYBE IF WE GIVE HIM
A LITTLE RESPECT, HE WOULD.

767
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:16,161
LIKE, HE LIKES 'MASON'
NOT 'MACE," DAD.

768
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:18,508
ALL RIGHT.

769
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:34,007
OH, MASON, TIME FOR DINNER.

770
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,183
THANK YOU.

771
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:39,150
THAT'S WHAT
LITTLE BROTHERS ARE FOR.

772
00:45:39,184 --> 00:45:40,496
THANKS, NATE.

773
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,361
I'LL WASH MY HANDS
AND BE RIGHT OUT.

774
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:09,559
LACEY, SWEETHEART.

775
00:46:09,594 --> 00:46:10,560
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

776
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,286
JUST TEXTING WITH LORI.

777
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:14,116
MY HOMEWORK'S BASICALLY DONE.

778
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,601
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR HOMEWORK.

779
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,258
I AM WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

780
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,985
I'M FINE.

781
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,504
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
TEXTING, TWITTING, FACING,

782
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:25,506
ANY OF THAT STUFF.

783
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,198
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, DAD.

784
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:28,302
OKAY.

785
00:46:28,337 --> 00:46:29,234
SO WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

786
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:30,891
JUST GIRL STUFF.

787
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:35,413
FRIENDS, SCHOOL, BOYS...
HOMEWORK.

788
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:39,210
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
GOT YOUINTO TROUBLE LAST TIME.

789
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:41,626
IT WASN'T MY FAULT!

790
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,455
WHY CAN'T YOU TRUST ME?

791
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:48,840
THERE'S TRUST AND THEN
THERE'S BEING BLIND.

792
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,507
DID YOU SAYING ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYONE ELSE?

793
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:52,982
DAD! EVERYONE DOES IT!

794
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:56,468
WOULD ANYONE BE UPSET
WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID?

795
00:46:56,503 --> 00:46:58,022
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

796
00:46:58,056 --> 00:46:59,102
THEY'RE SAYING ALL
THIS STUFF ABOUT ME

797
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:01,542
AND I CAN'T POST BACK?

798
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:06,547
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT
THEY'RE CALLING ME!

799
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:14,582
LISTEN, IF YOU JUST IGNORE IT
THEY'LL LOSE INTEREST.

800
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:18,525
I'M NOT FIVE YEARS OLD!

801
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,977
I HATE THEM AND I HATE THAT
I'M THE ONLY ONE IN TROUBLE

802
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:25,152
AND I HAVE THAT I HAVE TO GO
TO THAT STUPID GROUP!

803
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:26,395
WE CAN CHANGE GROUPS?

804
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,879
THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

805
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:30,295
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN A GROUP!

806
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:37,475
LOOK, YOU JUST NEED TO
GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

807
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:38,994
YOU DO YOUR BEST.

808
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:41,548
YOU LEARN EVERYTHING
YOU CAN FROM IT.

809
00:47:41,582 --> 00:47:46,208
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
A GOOD GIRL, REALLY.

810
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:50,660
AND I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
BELONG IN GROUP.

811
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:53,353
HEY, LACE, I LOVE YOU.

812
00:47:56,321 --> 00:47:58,565
I ALWAYS WILL.

813
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:05,986
WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

814
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:11,129
I'LL BACK YOU TO STAY HERE,
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TOO.

815
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,446
WHAT ABOUT WHAT SWANSON SAID?

816
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,727
SHE SAID THAT WE HAVE TO
FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK.

817
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:25,385
LET'S FIND A WAY.

818
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,640
ALL THE LEGAL PARKING IS ON
THE EAST SIDE OF THE...

819
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:42,264
EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE.

820
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:47,476
AH, COME HERE A MINUTE.

821
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:56,450
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

822
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:58,728
DROPPING MASON OFF.

823
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,661
HE'S DISRUPTIVE.
HE WAS TOLD NOT TO COME.

824
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:04,424
NO, NO, IT WAS SUGGESTED
THAT HE NOT COME.

825
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,392
THERE'S A COURT ORDER THAT
SAYSTHAT HE HAS TO ATTEND A GROUP.

826
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:09,267
ALL RIGHT, MAN, WE CAN
ALWAYS FIND ANOTHER GROUP.

827
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:12,052
AND IF THIS IS A SUPPORT GROUP
FOR 'PEOPLE ON THE EDGE.'

828
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,447
AND DOESN'T BEING DISRUPTIVEKIND
OF COME WITH THE TERRITORY?

829
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:19,542
MAN, OKAY.

830
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:21,993
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL SWANSON.

831
00:49:24,478 --> 00:49:25,755
AWKWARD.

832
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,757
YOUR OLD MAN FIGHT
ALL YOUR BATTLES?

833
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:29,380
WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT?

834
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:31,382
WHY DON'T YOU TEACH
THIS GUY A LESSON?

835
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,693
STOP!

836
00:49:32,728 --> 00:49:33,660
OR BOTH OF YOU
WILL GET KICKED OUT.

837
00:49:33,694 --> 00:49:34,764
NOBODY WANTS YOU HERE.

838
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,042
EVEN SHE WANTS YOU GONE.

839
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,491
HEY, LEAVE ME OUT OF IT!

840
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:38,744
BET THERE WOULDN'T BE
MANY HERE WHO'D VOTE

841
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,391
TO KEEP YOU AROUND EITHER.

842
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:42,186
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN
IN THIS GROUP.

843
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,129
YOUR MOM JUST USES IT AS
AN EXCUSE TO SEND YOU AWAY.

844
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:45,637
WOW, NOW HE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

845
00:49:45,672 --> 00:49:47,018
LEAVE MY MOM OUT OF IT.

846
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:49,124
AHH. SORE SPOT.

847
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,057
SHE HAVE OTHER GROUPS FOR YOU
ON OTHER NIGHTS?

848
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:52,334
SLOW LEARNER'S CLUB?

849
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:53,438
MOUTH BREATHERS NIGHT?

850
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:54,519
TIME YOU LEARNED SOME RESPECT.

851
00:49:54,543 --> 00:49:55,371
STOP!

852
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:56,303
STOP IT!

853
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:57,028
OKAY, KNOCK IT OFF.

854
00:49:57,063 --> 00:49:57,684
NO, NO!

855
00:49:57,718 --> 00:49:58,547
HEY, HEY, HEY!

856
00:49:58,581 --> 00:49:59,237
ENOUGH, ENOUGH!

857
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:00,825
MASON!

858
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:04,449
HEYA, BUD.

859
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:06,382
I JUST WANTED TO SAY 'THANKS'.

860
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,419
WHAT FOR?

861
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:11,594
FOR MAKING AN EFFORT WITH
MASON AND FOR WORKING HARD

862
00:50:11,629 --> 00:50:13,665
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

863
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,495
AND FOR PAINTING THE ROOM!

864
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:16,703
HE HELPED TOO.

865
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:19,050
A LOT ACTUALLY.

866
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:21,363
HAS TO BE A GOOD SIGN, RIGHT?

867
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,679
LACEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

868
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,129
WELL, DEE WAS MOUTHING OFF
TO MASON.

869
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:30,510
OH C'MON! HE WAS ASKING FOR IT.

870
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:32,132
LET HER SPEAK!

871
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,385
- WHAT'RE YOU AFRAID OF?
- NOT YOU THAT'S FOR SURE!

872
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:34,490
HEY, HEY, GUYS! KNOCK IT OFF!

873
00:50:34,514 --> 00:50:35,549
OKAY, MASON!

874
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:37,344
NOT ANOTHER WORD, YOU GUYS!

875
00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:38,425
FRIGHTENED OF SOMETHING DEE-DEE!

876
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:39,346
KEEP IT UP SMART MOUTH!

877
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:40,761
HEY!

878
00:50:40,796 --> 00:50:44,420
COULD YOU GUYS PLEASE SIT DOWN?

879
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,319
SIT DOWN.

880
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:52,877
ALL YOUR GROUPS LIKE THIS?

881
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,673
HE'S GOT TO GO.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

882
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:57,226
HOLD, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

883
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,445
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT WAS
HIS FAULT.

884
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:00,126
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

885
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,448
MR. LEWIS, YOU CAN MAKE
THE DECISIONS AT HOME,

886
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:02,752
HERE MR. WALLACE RUNS THE GROUP.

887
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,889
WELL, WHAT'S HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

888
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:07,133
WE'LL FIND HIM ANOTHER GROUP.

889
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,825
AND ANOTHER GROUP,
OR SCHOOL OR FAMILY.

890
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,379
THEY'LL DECIDE I'M NOT WORTH IT.

891
00:51:12,414 --> 00:51:13,563
I'M THE EASY TARGET
SO BLAME IT ON ME.

892
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:15,417
WHY NOT?

893
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:17,902
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE
CHARGES AGAINST YOU

894
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,455
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

895
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,735
C'MON.

896
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:34,746
HOLD ON.

897
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:37,887
WHAT IF I DROPPED THE CHARGES?

898
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:39,717
WHAT?

899
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:43,169
WHAT IF I DROPPED THE CHARGES?

900
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:44,594
IT'S NICE THAT YOU'RE
FEELING SORRY FOR HIM,

901
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,758
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S
TO HIS BENEFIT.

902
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:49,761
I'M NOT FEELING SORRY FOR HIM.

903
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:52,695
I JUST WANT A SOLUTION
THAT BENEFITS EVERYONE.

904
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,594
LIKE?

905
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:04,604
HE WORKS FOR ME AFTER SCHOOL
AND SATURDAYS, FREE OF CHARGE.

906
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:09,471
FOR... TWO MONTHS.

907
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,887
CAN SHE DO THIS?

908
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,786
SHE CAN DROP THE CHARGES. SURE.

909
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:18,549
THEN SHE REQUEST RESTITUTION.

910
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,759
KNOWING THE JUDGE,
SHE'LL PROBABLY GO FOR IT.

911
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:24,555
KEEPS HIM OUT OF THE SYSTEM
ANDABIDES BY THE VICTIM'S WISHES.

912
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:26,453
WHAT ABOUT THE GROUP?

913
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:28,179
HE'D HAVE ATTEND IT,
OR SOMETHING LIKE IT.

914
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:30,216
IT'S BEEN MANDATED BY THE COURT.

915
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,218
WELL HE'S NOT DOING IT HERE.

916
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:35,773
YOU SAW WHAT WENT DOWN.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

917
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:39,225
IF HE'S NOT DOING THE GROUP,
I'M NOT EITHER.

918
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:42,987
I'M NOT MANDATED TO BE HERE
BY ANY COURT.

919
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:45,610
ME TOO.

920
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:46,956
YOU HAVE TO COME HERE.

921
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,442
MY DAD WANTS ME TO SWITCH.

922
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:52,307
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

923
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:56,552
IF YOU'RE NOW WILLING TO DO
THIS, NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

924
00:52:58,761 --> 00:52:59,900
FINE.

925
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:03,007
FINE ISN'T GONNA CUT IT.

926
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:08,633
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME
AND DO WHAT I SAY.

927
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:09,807
THAT GOES IN HERE TOO.

928
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,637
YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO WALLACE.

929
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,267
DO YOU STILL HAVE MY BACK?

930
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,889
I DO.

931
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:24,660
PART OF THAT IS POINTING YOU
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

932
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:27,031
THIS IS IT.

933
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:29,965
AH C'MON! HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

934
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:34,797
HE AIN'T GOING TO DO IT.

935
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:39,975
I'M SORRY ABOUT MY
BEHAVIOR, WALLACE.

936
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,564
I'D LIKE TO STAY.

937
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:45,670
I'LL DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

938
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,638
OKAY MASON.

939
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:51,262
WELCOME TO THE GROUP.

940
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:54,610
WE'LL TRY TO MAKE A FRESH
START OF THIS, HUH?

941
00:54:00,098 --> 00:54:02,929
HEY, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

942
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:05,276
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS
IS GOING TO WORK?

943
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,313
IT'S ALL GOING TO DEPEND ON HIM.

944
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:10,074
HE HAS ZERO CHANCES LEFT
AND NO OTHER OPTIONS.

945
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:12,352
AND THAT RUBY LADY SOUNDS TOUGH.

946
00:54:12,387 --> 00:54:13,905
I WOULDN'T WANT HER
TO BE MY BOSS.

947
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,805
NO, I WOULDN'T EITHER.

948
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:21,741
ALRIGHT.

949
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:23,674
LET'S GET BACK TO
THE COMMANDMENTS.

950
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:28,023
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY
ALL DEAL WITH RESPECT, RIGHT?

951
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:31,095
CLEARLY WE CAN SEE FROM
TONIGHT'S ALTERCATIONS

952
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:37,101
THAT WHEN THERE'S NO RESPECT,
THERE'S NO PEACE.

953
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:40,725
IF YOU RESPECT SOMEONE,
YOU DON'T STEAL FROM THEM,

954
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,383
OR LIE TO THEM, ETC.

955
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:47,801
AND IF YOU RESPECT GOD,
YOU DON'T WORSHIP ANOTHER ONE,

956
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:49,355
YOU DON'T TAKE HIS NAME IN VAIN,

957
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:53,531
AND YOU DON'T WORK
ON HIS DAY OF REST.

958
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:01,850
MASON, CAN YOU DISAGREE?

959
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,093
YOUR INTERPRETATION'S FINE.

960
00:55:04,128 --> 00:55:06,889
IT'S THE IDEA THAT GOD
DEMANDS RESPECT FROM US.

961
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:08,477
WHAT FOR?

962
00:55:08,512 --> 00:55:10,006
JUST SO HE CAN FEEL
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY?

963
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,929
SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS
AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX.

964
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:16,451
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.

965
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,729
I SUGGEST YOU SHOW SOME RESPECT,

966
00:55:18,763 --> 00:55:20,016
BUT I GUESS YOU THINK OTHERWISE?

967
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,973
'CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.'

968
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:23,975
AND YET HE'S GOING TO WORRY
WHAT I THINK OF HIM?

969
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:26,806
WHAT I CALL HIM?

970
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,429
WHAT IF IT WAS GOOD FOR US?

971
00:55:29,464 --> 00:55:30,672
WHAT, LIKE VEGETABLES?

972
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:33,882
EXACTLY.

973
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:37,644
WHAT IF HONORING GOD ACTUALLY
KEPT US SAFE AND HAPPY

974
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,992
AND LIVING GOOD LIVES?

975
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:45,169
'HOW GREAT IS YOUR GOODNESS,

976
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:49,898
WHICH YOU HAVE STORED UP
FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU.'

977
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:52,141
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.

978
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:56,076
I SAID "WHAT IF IT WAS".

979
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:59,701
WELL, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT SHOULD BE A COMMANDMENT.

980
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:02,876
'THOU MUST WORSHIP ME AND
ONLY USE MY NAME FOR PRAISE.'

981
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:04,775
THAT'S NOT SOMEONE
I WANT TO FOLLOW.

982
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:06,742
CLEARLY.

983
00:56:08,503 --> 00:56:09,987
BUT WHETHER YOU
FOLLOW HIM OR NOT

984
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:12,955
THOSE RULES ARE STILL THE SAME.

985
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,164
AND, YOU KNOW,
I WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE

986
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:17,408
WHO CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE IDEA

987
00:56:17,443 --> 00:56:20,791
THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE
OR SOME THING

988
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:24,450
THAT'S ACTUALLY MORE SIGNIFICANTTHAN HE IS.

989
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:27,073
YOU TALK ABOUT AN
INFERIORITY COMPLEX?

990
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:30,525
THE OPPOSITE OF THAT
IS A GOD COMPLEX.

991
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,115
SOMEONE WHO WON'T EXTEND ANY
COMMON COURTESY TO ANYONE

992
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:41,087
BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY BELIEVESHE'S
BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

993
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:42,019
WALLACE?

994
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:43,572
YES?

995
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:45,712
JUST A QUESTION ABOUT
WHAT YOU TOLD US BEFORE.

996
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:48,128
MMM HMM.

997
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:53,444
DID YOU SAY THAT WE'RE NOT HERETO
DECIDE WHO'S RIGHT OR WRONG,

998
00:56:53,479 --> 00:57:00,106
BUT UNDERSTAND LIFE
AND OUR OWN PREJUDICES?

999
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:07,113
YES, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

1000
00:57:07,147 --> 00:57:09,874
YOU SEE, BEING HUMAN
IS MAKING MISTAKES.

1001
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:13,602
WHAT DETERMINES WHO WE ARE IS
HOW WE HANDLE THOSE MISTAKES.

1002
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:17,882
SAYING 'PLEASE', 'THANK YOU'
AND 'I'M SORRY' ALL MEAN

1003
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:21,472
THAT YOU RESPECT AND CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE

1004
00:57:21,507 --> 00:57:23,139
RATHER THAN JUST THINKING
EVERYONE ELSE OWES YOU

1005
00:57:23,163 --> 00:57:25,856
SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU'RE
BETTERTHAN EVERYONE ELSE.

1006
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,099
SO MASON, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

1007
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:29,929
I'M SORRY.

1008
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:38,006
THANKS FOR STANDING UP
FOR ME IN THERE.

1009
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,147
NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED
FROM THE COOKIE SERVER?

1010
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:43,287
I SEE YOU AT SCHOOL A LOT.

1011
00:57:43,321 --> 00:57:45,289
MIND IF I COME OVER
AND TALK SOMETIME?

1012
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:48,810
YOU'RE ASKING FOR PERMISSION
TO TALK TO ME?

1013
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,121
I'M NOT MAKING MANY FRIENDS.

1014
00:57:50,156 --> 00:57:51,571
I MIGHT NOT BE GOOD
FOR YOUR REP.

1015
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:52,848
I THINK MY REP CAN TAKE IT.

1016
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,195
HELLO, MASON.

1017
00:57:57,163 --> 00:58:01,029
I SEE YOU'VE MET MY DAUGHTER.

1018
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:08,830
HEY, HELLO MR., I MEAN REVEREND,
REVEREND FIELDS.

1019
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:10,970
WOW.

1020
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:13,144
THAT IS A CHANGE.

1021
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:15,284
I GUESS THIS GROUP HAS BEEN
GOOD FOR SOMEONE?

1022
00:58:15,319 --> 00:58:17,045
IT MEANS HE CARES.

1023
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,979
ISN'T THAT RIGHT MASON?

1024
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:08,199
SO THE JUDGE OKAY'D MASON
TO WORK HERE?

1025
00:59:08,234 --> 00:59:10,995
YES, AND BECAUSE YOU DROPPED
THE VANDALISM CHARGES

1026
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,618
IT WON'T GO ON HIS RECORD.

1027
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:14,102
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1028
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,207
BUT, BELIEVE ME WHEN
I GET THROUGH WITH HIM,

1029
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:19,072
THAT JUVIE THING'S GONNA
LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

1030
00:59:19,107 --> 00:59:21,765
I KNOW THAT'S TRUE.

1031
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:23,939
SO WHEN DO I GET MY NEW
LITTLE HELPER?

1032
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:25,803
TODAY.

1033
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,358
THE JUDGE ORDERED HIM TO START
TODAY, RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

1034
00:59:29,393 --> 00:59:31,153
HEY, HOW'D IT GO WITH LACEY?

1035
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,303
I SAW YOU GUYS EATING TOGETHER.

1036
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:34,053
SHE'S COOL.

1037
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:36,642
BUT KIND OF SAD TOO.

1038
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:39,299
AND SHE WON'T TELL ME WHY
SHE'S IN THE GROUP.

1039
00:59:39,334 --> 00:59:41,370
AND NO VISITS TO THE OFFICE?

1040
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:44,132
NO.

1041
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:47,756
TURNS OUT PLEASE AND THANK YOU
REALLY ARE THE MAGIC WORDS.

HEY, WHEN WE GET HOME DO
YOU WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES?

1043
00:59:49,344 --> 00:59:51,001
I CAN'T.

1044
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:55,246
I GOTTA GO TO THAT LADY'S
STOREAFTER I WALK YOU HOME.

1045
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:58,387
HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO REDEEM MYSELF

1046

1047
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:03,323

1048
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,917
YOU'RE LATE.

1049
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:12,816
IT'S 4:00.

1050
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,199
YOU'RE KIDDING.

1051
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:19,788
IT'S PAST 4:00 AND YOU'RE LATE.

1052
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:21,376
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

1053
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,377
I DON'T LIKE HOW
THIS IS STARTING.

1054
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:24,068

1055
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:28,659

1057
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:36,322
IT'S MISS AND YOU CAN
CALL ME RUBY.

1058
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:37,920
THERE'S BEING RESPECTFUL
AND THEN THERE'S JUST

1059
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:41,430
MAKING ME FEEL OLD.

1060
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:46,953
THIS ENTIRE BUILDING NEEDS
TO BECLEANED AND REPAINTED.

1061
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:49,473

1068
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:24,050
YOU WANT A BAG OF CHIPS
OR A CHOCOLATE BAR?

1069
01:02:24,085 --> 01:02:26,501

SO I CAN HEAR YOU SAY THANK YOU?

1076
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:40,377
TO PUT ME IN MY PLACE.

1077
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:42,241
SURE.

1078
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:43,597
I DO NICE THINGS FOR PEOPLE
AL THE TIME

1079
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:45,554
SO I CAN PUT THEM
IN THEIR PLACE.

1080
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:48,109
THAT'LL TEACH YOU.

1081
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:02,330
- IT'S NATE.
- COME IN.

1082
01:03:02,364 --> 01:03:04,470
WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

1083
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:05,574
SHE'S LOVING IT.

1084
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:07,404
TREATING ME LIKE THIS.

1085
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:09,175
I WAS WASHING AND SCRUBBING
THE STORE THE WHOLE TIME.

1086
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,579
WOW. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.

1087
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:12,581
YEAH, I'M EXHAUSTED.

1088
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,480
JACK USED TO LOVE THOSE DAYS.

1089
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:15,629
THE DAYS HE FELT LIKE
HE COULDN'T MOVE

1090
01:03:15,653 --> 01:03:17,414
AT THE END OF THEM.

1091
01:03:17,448 --> 01:03:19,209
HE SAID IT MADE LIFE SEEM FULL.

1092
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:22,591
LIKE HE HADN'T WASTED ANY OF IT.

1093
01:03:22,626 --> 01:03:24,421
HE SOUNDS PRETTY COOL.

1094
01:03:24,455 --> 01:03:27,286
YEAH, HE WAS.

1095
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:35,639
HEY, MASON.

1096
01:03:35,673 --> 01:03:37,572
YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME TODAY.

1097
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,194
I TOLD NATE TO TELL YOU.

1098
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:40,955
YEAH, NO. HE TOLD ME.

1099
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:43,509
SO, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU WANTED
TO BE HERE ON TIME.

1100
01:03:43,543 --> 01:03:48,617
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOUR DAY DIDN'T GO TOO CRAZY.

1101
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:50,447
YOU MEAN, DID I CAUSE
ANY TROUBLE?

1102
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:53,484
WELL, THAT TOO.

1103
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:56,418
I WAS OBEDIENT.
I DID WHAT I WAS TOLD.

1104
01:03:56,453 --> 01:03:58,282
IT'S ALL A PART OF LIFE, BUDDY.

1105
01:03:58,317 --> 01:03:59,594
JUST WAIT TILL YOU'RE MARRIED.

1106
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:01,147
I'M GONNA TELL MOM
YOU SAID THAT.

1107
01:04:01,182 --> 01:04:03,253
GO AHEAD. IT'LL MAKE HER HAPPY.

1108
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:05,876
MAKE HER FEEL LIKE
SHE'S DOING HER JOB.

1109
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:07,671
ALL RIGHT, WELL.

1110
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:09,604
DOING GOOD. KEEP IT UP.

1111
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,261
DON'T BE TOO LATE.

1112
01:04:11,295 --> 01:04:12,652
REMEMBER YOU HAVE
GROUP MEETING TONIGHT TOO.

1113
01:04:12,676 --> 01:04:16,162
OH, JOY.

1114
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:25,068
ANYONE HERE NOT BROKEN ONE
OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?

1115
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:32,420
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

1116
01:04:32,454 --> 01:04:33,939
HMMM.

1117
01:04:33,973 --> 01:04:35,192
ANYONE COULD SET UP
A BUNCH OF RULES

1118
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:37,528
AND IN NO TIME THEY'D BE BROKEN.

1119
01:04:37,563 --> 01:04:42,188
GOOD POINT, SO WHY HAVE THEM?

1120
01:04:42,223 --> 01:04:44,950
LAWS ARE THERE TO PROTECT US.

1121
01:04:44,984 --> 01:04:48,988
STRUCTURE HELPS US FEEL SECURE.

1122
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:54,407
IT'S LIKE WITH A DOG.

1123
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:56,962
IF YOU LET IT KNOW
YOU'RE THE BOSS,

1124
01:04:56,996 --> 01:05:00,310
IT KNOWS WHAT IT CAN
AND CANNOT DO.

1125
01:05:00,344 --> 01:05:02,622
YEAH, BUT THAT'S A DOG.

1126
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:04,555
PEOPLE WANT FREEDOM.

1127
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,420
AND IF YOU HAVE TO DICTATE
THAT SOMEONE FOLLOW YOU,

1128
01:05:07,455 --> 01:05:10,285
WHAT HAVE YOU REALLY GAINED?

1129
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,979
PROBABLY RESENTMENT AND ANGER.

1130
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:16,740
AND IF YOU'RE JUST SETTING
UPRULES SO THAT PEOPLE FAIL THEM,

1131
01:05:16,774 --> 01:05:18,949
WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT?

1132
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:21,400
JUST TO MAKE THEM FEEL BAD.

1133
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:24,265
AND THAT THEY NOW OWE
YOU SOMETHING.

1134
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:28,338
HOW'S IT FEEL MASON TO HAVE
DEE SUPPORTING YOU?

1135
01:05:28,683 --> 01:05:31,582
OKAY... MAYBE A
LITTLE SUSPICIOUS,

1136
01:05:31,617 --> 01:05:34,137
BUT GOOD.

1137
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:36,725
LIKE MAYBE DEE AND LACEY
ARE LISTENING TO YOU

1138
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,453
AND RESPECT YOUR OPINION, HMM?

1139
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,041
SURE.

1140
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:46,494
AND THAT IN DOING SO,
THEY RESPECT YOU?

1141
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,530
THINK ABOUT IT.

1142
01:05:48,565 --> 01:05:52,396
OKAY, I GUESS.

1143
01:05:52,776 --> 01:05:57,263
LET'S ALL THINK ABOUT THAT.

1144
01:05:57,298 --> 01:05:59,300
THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT WE FIGHT WITH

1145
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:02,648
AND ARGUE WITH
AND DO NOT LISTEN TO.

1146
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:06,100
OR GOD.

1147
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:12,313
ARE WE DOING IT FOR GOOD
REASONS OR PRIDE?

1148
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,694
ARE WE PUTTING OUR EGO,
OUR WANTS, OUR NAME,

1149
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:20,597
AHEAD OF EVERYONE ELSE, AND HIM?

1150
01:06:20,631 --> 01:06:24,532
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING?

1151
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:50,385
IF YOU REALLY...

1152
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:55,563
IF I WAS...

1153
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:59,601
OH, FORGET IT.

1154
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:12,407
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1155
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:14,478
IT'S LATE.

1156
01:07:14,513 --> 01:07:18,206
YEAH, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FINISH UP.

1157
01:07:19,518 --> 01:07:21,416
YOU'VE A GIFT.

1158
01:07:22,659 --> 01:07:24,730
GRUNT LABOR. THANKS.

1159
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,766
AT WORKING HARD.

1160
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:30,701
AND BEING PRECISE AND DILIGENT.

1161
01:07:30,736 --> 01:07:34,774
YOU KNOW, GOD GIVES EACH OF US
A UNIQUE GIFT.

1162
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:39,331
IT WOULD BE A WASTE
TO LOSE THAT.

1163
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:44,129
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY
'THANKS' - MEAN IT.

1164
01:07:44,163 --> 01:07:46,510
YEAH, BUT WHAT YOU'RE
PRAISING ME FOR IS EASY.

1165
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:48,443
'HURRAY, I CAN PAINT AND CLEAN.'

1166
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,549
NOT LIKE THIS.

1167
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:54,104
PEOPLE CAN'T DO THIS
LIKE YOU DO.

1168
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:59,558
PEOPLE WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY
FOR WORK LIKE THIS.

1169
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:01,560
MATTER OF FACT,

1170
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:04,425
I THINK I COULD GET YOU
SOME WORK.

1171
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,220
REALLY?

1172
01:08:06,254 --> 01:08:09,602
YOU MEAN I'D GET PAID?

1173
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:13,192
IT'S 'GRUNT' WORK.

1174
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:15,505
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M GIFTED AT THAT!

1175
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,131
I COULD SET UP A MEETING
WITH SOME PEOPLE

1176
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:23,168
THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN YOUR WORK

1177
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:26,481
AND WE CAN HAVE IT
HERE AT THE STORE

1178
01:08:26,516 --> 01:08:29,795
AND SHOW OFF YOUR WORK.

1179
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,732
WOW!

1180
01:08:36,733 --> 01:08:38,769
RIGHT ON!

1181
01:08:38,804 --> 01:08:43,602
I MEAN, YES PLEASE!

1182
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:46,743
THANK YOU, RUBY.

1183
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:49,573
NOW THAT SOUNDED GENUINE.

1184
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,482
I NEED TO BORROW
YOUR WINDOW AGAIN.

1185
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:02,586
WHAT FOR?

1186
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:04,450
I SAID I'D MEET LACEY.

1187
01:09:04,485 --> 01:09:06,532
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT
AND YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL.

1188
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:08,385
I'M NOT SOME PUPPY.

1189
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,845
OKAY, I'M NOT JUST DOING WELL
WHEN I'M FOLLOWING ORDERS.

1190
01:09:09,869 --> 01:09:12,665
MIGHT WORK FOR YOU
BUT NOT FOR ME.

1191
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,805
OKAY. FINE.

1192
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:20,984
I LIKE IT OUT HERE.

1193
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:22,848
BIG AND OPEN.

1194
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:28,819
NO RULES. NO JUDGMENTS.

1195
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:32,996
THERE'S A SMALL CHAPEL
IN THERE THAT I LIKE TOO.

1196
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:37,828
IT'S PRIVATE AND NEVER USED.

1197
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:41,556
I LIKE BEING ALONE
SOMETIMES TOO.

1198
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:46,665
I GUESS WHEN IT FEELS LIKE
I CAN'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE.

1199
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:49,012
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE GROUP.

1200
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:53,568
I'M THERE BECAUSE OF BULLYING,
ONLINE MOSTLY.

1201
01:09:53,603 --> 01:09:55,018
I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE!

1202
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:56,444
IT'S NOT LIKE I THOUGHT
I WAS BEING MEAN.

1203
01:09:56,468 --> 01:09:58,228
I WAS JUST...

1204
01:09:58,263 --> 01:10:01,300
COMMENTING, BEING FUNNY,
AND THEN DISHING IT OUT

1205
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:03,889
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE COULD.

1206
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:06,236
THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

1207
01:10:06,271 --> 01:10:07,696
NEW KID WITH EVERYONE
WHISPERING AND MAKING FUN

1208
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,757
BEHIND MY BACK.

1209
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:12,242
WELL, WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE?!

1210
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:14,244
EVERYONE IS BENDING OVER
BACKWARDS TO HELP YOU

1211
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:17,730
AND YOU'RE TREATING THEM
LIKE DIRT!

1212
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:18,869
LACEY?

1213
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:20,699
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

1214
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:22,839
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1215
01:10:22,873 --> 01:10:25,600
AND MASON.

1216
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:28,845
SON, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

1217
01:10:38,682 --> 01:10:40,995
THAT WAS REALLY STUPID.

1218
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,583
DO YOU JUST NOT CARE?

1219
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:43,836
I MET A GIRL!
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

1220
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:44,930
OH DON'T MASON!

1221
01:10:44,964 --> 01:10:47,346
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

1222
01:10:47,381 --> 01:10:50,625
YOU WERE GIVEN SPECIAL
TREATMENTAND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

1223
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,558
YOU BREAK RULES.

1224
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:54,284
YOU BETRAY TRUST.

1225
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,631
YOU DISHONOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP YOU!

1226
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,805
THEY'LL GET OVER IT.

1227
01:10:57,839 --> 01:11:00,739
YEAH, WELL WHAT ABOUT NATE?

1228
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:04,018
HE'S IN TROUBLE NOW TOO.

1229
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:08,781
DON'T YOU EVER THINK
OF ANYONE BUT YOURSELF?

1230
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:28,387
HEY, NATE.

1231
01:11:28,422 --> 01:11:31,114
I'M SORRY, MAN,
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.

1232
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:32,943
WAS IT WORTH IT AT LEAST?

1233
01:11:32,978 --> 01:11:35,118
NO. SHE'S MAD,
AND I'M IN TROUBLE.

1234
01:11:35,152 --> 01:11:37,465
I DON'T THINK
I'LL SEE HER AGAIN.

1235
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,572
OH, SORRY.

1236
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:44,576
YEAH.

1237
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:49,132
IT'S YOUR RISK NOW.

1238
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:51,859
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO VOUCH FOR HIM?

1239
01:11:51,893 --> 01:11:53,619
YES, WE DO.

1240
01:11:53,654 --> 01:11:55,528
YEAH, WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO KEEP HIM HERE.

1241
01:11:55,552 --> 01:11:57,071
OKAY.

1242
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,763
ANYTHING GOES WRONG NOW
AND YOU'RE ON THE HOOK.

1243
01:11:59,798 --> 01:12:01,800
YOU'RE CALL.

1244
01:12:08,185 --> 01:12:11,706
OH, LOOKS LIKE THE AUTHORITIES
ARE BACK NEXT DOOR.

1245
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:16,470
AND I WAS JUST GETTING USED
TO THAT BOY.

1246
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:17,781
OKAY.

1247
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:20,681
SO THE NEXT STEPS ARE UP TO YOU.

1248
01:12:22,096 --> 01:12:25,133
GOT IT. THANK YOU.

1249
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:28,136
YOU BET.

1250
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:31,657
NO ONE'S EVER STOOD UP FOR ME
LIKE THIS.

1251
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:34,729
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1252
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:36,973
HEY, DON'T FORGET
YOU HAVE THAT MEETING.

1253
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:38,837
C'MON, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE MEETING

1254
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,736
WITH WALLACE AND
REVEREND FIELDS.

1255
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,602
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1256
01:12:47,121 --> 01:12:50,918
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE GROUPS?

1257
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,544
ARE YOU SURE?

1258
01:12:58,995 --> 01:13:02,205
BECAUSE TO STAY MEANS HARD
WORK FROM EVERYBODY IN HERE,

1259
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,552
ESPECIALLY YOU.

1260
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:11,708
IT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO START THINKING

1261
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:14,838
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE SON,
BEFORE YOURSELF.

1262
01:13:14,873 --> 01:13:18,946
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1263
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:23,088
HOW'S LACEY?

1264
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:28,645
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT HER,
THIS IS ABOUT YOU, MASON.

1265
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,925
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

1266
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,758
DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO
GET THROUGH ALL OF THIS, SON?

1267
01:13:40,968 --> 01:13:42,866
I DON'T KNOW.

1268
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:48,872
YOU KNOW, THINGS FINALLY
SEEMEDTO BE GOING GOOD AND NOW,

1269
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:51,565
NOW IT SEEMS EVEN WORSE.

1270
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:54,153
WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE

1271
01:13:54,188 --> 01:13:57,916
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
BE THANKFUL FOR IT.

1272
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:00,470
EVEN FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP YOU

1273
01:14:00,505 --> 01:14:01,851
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

1274
01:14:01,885 --> 01:14:04,543
IT ISN'T ALWAYS ALL GOOD.

1275
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:10,066
THAT'S JUST LIFE, PAL.

1276
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:18,488
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,
IF THAT'S ALLOWED.

1277
01:14:18,523 --> 01:14:22,941
SURE.

1278
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,133
I NEED HELP.

1279
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:50,209
AND I'VE ASKED YOU
FOR STUFF BEFORE BUT...

1280
01:14:50,244 --> 01:14:54,317
BUT I THINK I NEED
FORGIVENESS MORE.

1281
01:14:54,351 --> 01:14:56,215
THE LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT
AND LOVE I GET

1282
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,909
I DON'T EVEN DESERVE.

1283
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:05,535
BUT YOU, YOU DESERVE IT ALL.

1284
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:11,058
AND I CAN'T EVEN RESPECT
YOUR NAME...

1285
01:15:11,092 --> 01:15:12,922
I'M SORRY.

1286
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:15,856
I'M SO SORRY.

1287
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:19,687
HEAVENLY FATHER, LORD,

1288
01:15:19,722 --> 01:15:24,105
LET ME START BY JUST
HONORING YOUR NAME.

1289
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,143
LET ME JUST START
BY RESPECTING YOU...

1290
01:15:27,177 --> 01:15:28,938
AND WANTING TO PLEASE YOU.

1291
01:15:28,972 --> 01:15:32,804
NOT BECAUSE I HAVE TO,

1292
01:15:32,838 --> 01:15:35,772
BUT BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

1293
01:15:40,294 --> 01:15:45,575
SO, HOW MANY CHANCES
DO WE GIVE THE KID?

1294
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,301
I HAVE NO IDEA.

1295
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:49,061
I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR CALL.

1296
01:15:49,096 --> 01:15:53,065
BETWEEN THE FOSTER OFFICE
AND THE COURTS,

1297
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,929
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH.

1298
01:15:58,623 --> 01:15:59,382
WHERE IS HE?

1299
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:01,280
WE GOTTA LEAVE.

1300
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:18,712
AND PLEASE HELP ME TO THINK
OF OTHERS, LIKE YOU LORD,

1301
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:22,060
AND NOT JUST MYSELF.

1302
01:16:30,827 --> 01:16:33,658
LACEY.

1303
01:16:38,352 --> 01:16:40,803
LACEY.

1304
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:47,361
LACEY.

1305
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:53,401
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

1306
01:16:53,436 --> 01:16:54,817
I REALLY AM.

1307
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:55,334
I'M AN IDIOT.

1308
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:56,715
FINE.

1309
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,855
YOU'RE SORRY, PLEASE LEAVE.

1310
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:08,278
I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT
NOT LETTING ANYONE BE ABOVE ME

1311
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:11,109
THAT I'VE FAILED TO SEE
WHAT I'M DOING TO OTHERS.

1312
01:17:11,143 --> 01:17:13,283
AND I HAD NO RIGHT TO JUDGE.

1313
01:17:13,318 --> 01:17:16,114
OKAY, I WANT TO BE ALONE.

1314
01:17:19,289 --> 01:17:24,087
I WAS JUST OUTSIDE THINKING
WHAT WOULD A GIRL WHO LIVES

1315
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:27,677
BY TEXTING BE DOING WRITING
ON A CRUMMY PIECE OF PAPER?

1316
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:32,233
I'M GUESSING THAT'S A PRETTY
PERSONAL NOTE TRYING

1317
01:17:32,268 --> 01:17:38,067
TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING REALLY BAD,
THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE.

1318
01:17:38,101 --> 01:17:42,968
HEY, I'VE WRITTEN NOTES
LIKE THAT TOO.

1319
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:45,937
WHEN I'VE REALLY MESSED UP.

1320
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:49,285
WHEN I'VE FELT REALLY ALONE.

1321
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,841
I NEVER DID ANYTHING WITH THEM,
BUT CAME CLOSE.

1322
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:56,361
ALL MY FRIENDS
HAVE TURNED ON ME.

1323
01:17:56,395 --> 01:17:59,329
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF LOSER.

1324
01:17:59,364 --> 01:18:04,231
LIKE I DON'T COUNT FOR ANYTHING.

1325
01:18:04,265 --> 01:18:09,132
AND MY DAD, HE'S GREAT,
BUT HE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.

1326
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:14,759
BUT I DO.

1327
01:18:14,793 --> 01:18:18,003
AND YOU, YOU COUNT
FOR A WHOLE LOT.

1328
01:18:18,038 --> 01:18:21,351
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

1329
01:18:21,386 --> 01:18:23,181
I USED TO BE POPULAR.

1330
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:26,287
I CAN SEE IT.

1331
01:18:26,322 --> 01:18:27,979
THE PRETTY GIRL SERVING
PERFECT COOKIES

1332
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:30,429
TO ALL HER PERFECT FRIENDS.

1333
01:18:30,464 --> 01:18:32,224
NOT SO PERFECT.

1334
01:18:32,259 --> 01:18:34,848
LOOK AT ME NOW.

1335
01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:37,091
HERE WITH AN OUTCAST LIKE ME.

1336
01:18:37,126 --> 01:18:41,337
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
IT'S OKAY.

1337
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:44,202
CAUSE WE GOT A FRIEND IN COMMON.

1338
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:45,928
WHO?

1339
01:18:48,275 --> 01:18:50,380
JESUS.

1340
01:18:50,415 --> 01:18:52,210
MASON, I...

1341
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:54,764
I KNOW. I KNOW.

1342
01:18:54,799 --> 01:18:59,148
IT'S A LOT TO TAKE, ESPECIALLY
FROM SOMEONE LIKE ME, RIGHT?

1343
01:18:59,182 --> 01:19:04,325
YEAH, I HEARD IT ALL MY LIFE,
OVER AND OVER,

1344
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,328
BUT IT'S NEVER MADE
SENSE UNTIL TODAY.

1345
01:19:07,363 --> 01:19:11,988
UNTIL I REALIZED HOW
I WAS TREATING HIM.

1346
01:19:14,404 --> 01:19:17,304
I KNEW GOD BROUGHT YOU HERE
FOR A REASON.

1347
01:19:17,338 --> 01:19:18,522
REVEREND FIELDS...
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T COME...

1348
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,066
SON, IT'S OKAY.

1349
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:24,104
OH, SWEETIE...

1350
01:19:26,589 --> 01:19:28,798
I AM SORRY.

1351
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:38,049
THANK YOU, SON.

1352
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,291
REALLY.

1353
01:19:39,326 --> 01:19:41,190
THANK YOU.

1354
01:19:44,089 --> 01:19:48,404
AH, OH MY GOODNESS.

1355
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,061
YOU'RE LATE.

1356
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:51,452
WALLACE ASKED ME TO GET YOU
TO RUBY'S.

1357
01:19:51,476 --> 01:19:53,823
COME ON, WE GOTTA GO.

1358
01:19:53,858 --> 01:19:55,480
I PUT MY NECK OUT FOR YOU!

1359
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:57,516
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

1360
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:59,622
HANG ON A SECOND, RUBY.

1361
01:19:59,656 --> 01:20:03,419
LACEY WAS IN SOME TROUBLE.

1362
01:20:03,453 --> 01:20:04,454
MASON HELPED HER.

1363
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:07,112
HE DID. A LOT.

1364
01:20:07,147 --> 01:20:11,082
IT DOESN'T MATTER. HE'S GONE.

1365
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,532
WHY'S THIS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

1366
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,467
I, I WAS, I WAS GONNA SUPPLY
THE PAINT AND EQUIPMENT

1367
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:19,884
UP FRONT FOR THE JOB.

1368
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:27,546
I'M BEHIND ON BILLS AND THE
BANK'S READY TO FORECLOSE.

1369
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:31,378
YOU SHOULD, DAD.

1370
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:32,562
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS

1371
01:20:32,586 --> 01:20:36,555
TO BE DONE AT THE CHURCH.

1372
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,385
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

1373
01:20:41,215 --> 01:20:43,183
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, RUBY.

1374
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:45,461
WE'LL BUY THAT PAINT AND
THE EQUIPMENT FROM YOU.

1375
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:49,051
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1376
01:20:49,085 --> 01:20:51,260
YOU STILL INTERESTED, MASON?

1377
01:20:51,294 --> 01:20:53,262
YEAH!

1378
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:54,642
THANK YOU REVEREND!

1379
01:20:54,677 --> 01:20:57,956
I MEAN, IF THAT'S STILL OKAY
WITH RUBY?

1380
01:20:57,991 --> 01:21:03,375
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY BEST WORKER

1381
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:06,516
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING
TO COME BACK.

1382
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:08,484
OF COURSE.

1383
01:21:08,518 --> 01:21:10,658
THANK YOU RUBY.

1384
01:21:10,693 --> 01:21:12,143
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1385
01:21:12,177 --> 01:21:13,499
RUBY CALLED AND SAID YOU
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

1386
01:21:13,523 --> 01:21:15,353
TOM, IT'S OKAY.

1387
01:21:15,387 --> 01:21:18,528
MASON HAS A GOOD REASON
FOR NOT SHOWING UP.

1388
01:21:18,563 --> 01:21:21,566
HE WAS HELPING MY DAUGHTER.

1389
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,569
MASON JUST GOT HIRED BY
MY DAD TO PAINT THE CHURCH.

1390
01:21:24,603 --> 01:21:26,674
AND THEY'RE GONNA BY ALL
THE SUPPLIES AND PAINT

1391
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:29,229
RIGHT HERE AT MY PLACE.

1392
01:21:29,263 --> 01:21:30,713
WAY TO GO, MASON!

1393
01:21:30,747 --> 01:21:33,578
WELL, HE DID SUCH A GREAT
JOB PAINTING RUBY'S STORE

1394
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:35,280
IT WAS REALLY A NO-BRAINER
TO BRING HIM THROUGH

1395
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:37,651
AND HELP US REDO THE CHURCH.

1396
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,480
WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD
OF YOU, MASON.

1397
01:21:39,515 --> 01:21:41,034
THANKS.

1398
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:44,140
YEAH, WE REALLY ARE.
YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB.

1399
01:21:44,175 --> 01:21:47,040
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE THING TO SAY.

1400
01:21:49,249 --> 01:21:50,664
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

1401
01:21:52,424 --> 01:21:54,599
OH.

1402
01:21:57,636 --> 01:21:59,742
SO YOU SEE,

1403
01:21:59,776 --> 01:22:04,954
ALL THIS YOUNG BOY NEEDED
WAS A CHANCE.

1404
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:12,341
A FEELING THAT SOMEONE WOULD
STAND BY HIM NO MATTER WHAT.

1405
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:19,244
HE NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TEACH HIM REVERENCE.

1406
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:24,525
EXODUS 20:7.

1407
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,358
"THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME
OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN;

1408
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:34,225
FOR THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD HIM
GUILTLESS THAT TAKETH

1409
01:22:34,259 --> 01:22:38,263
HIS NAME IN VAIN."

1410
01:22:38,298 --> 01:22:42,164
"WILL NOT HOLD HIM GUILTLESS..."

1411
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:46,582
THE PASSAGE IS ALSO ONE OF THE
TEN COMMANDMENTS, AS WE KNOW,

1412
01:22:46,616 --> 01:22:49,723
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT IT
HAS THAT ADDITIONAL WARNING

1413
01:22:49,757 --> 01:22:52,070
ATTACHED TO THE END OF IT.

1414
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:55,798
"THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD
HIM GUILTLESS..."

1415
01:22:55,832 --> 01:23:00,009
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU ALL,
BUT I SURE DO NOT WANT TO BE

1416
01:23:00,044 --> 01:23:03,806
NOT FOUND "GUILTLESS"
WHEN JUDGMENT DAY COMES.

1417
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,050
CAN I GET AN AMEN TO THAT?

1418
01:23:06,084 --> 01:23:08,293
AMEN!

1419
01:23:08,328 --> 01:23:10,744
SO AS YOU SEE,

1420
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:14,817
MASON LEARNED
THIS SPECIAL COMMANDMENT

1421
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:22,169
FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE
OF SHOWING RESPECT,

1422
01:23:22,204 --> 01:23:24,206
BECAUSE RESPECT,
IT'S A HIGH STANDARD.

1423
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,692
IT DEMONSTRATES TO US THE WAY
WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE

1424
01:23:27,726 --> 01:23:33,698
WITH OTHERS AND THE WAY WE
SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH GOD,

1425
01:23:33,732 --> 01:23:38,737
TO THE LORD HIMSELF.

1426
01:23:38,772 --> 01:23:44,295
REMEMBER, IT IS RESPECT
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION

1427
01:23:44,329 --> 01:23:48,161
FOR EVERY RELATIONSHIP.

1428
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:53,545
IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE WAY
WE EXPRESS RESPECT FOR HIM,

1429
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:00,449
GOD ALMIGHTY, IN THE PRESENCE
OF OTHERS.

1430
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:03,590
LET US PRAY.

1431
01:24:03,624 --> 01:24:06,420
DEAR HEAVENLY FATHER,

1432
01:24:06,455 --> 01:24:14,455
WE COME BEFORE YOU TODAY
TO PRAISE AND HONOR

1433
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,879
YOUR HOLY NAME...
