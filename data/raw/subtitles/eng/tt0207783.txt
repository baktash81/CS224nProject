00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:04,816
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,806
(dramatic eerie music)

3
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:54,603
(light ticking)

4
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:55,436
- Hello?

5
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,738
(dark scary music)

6
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,203
(light screaming)

7
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,973
(bell ringing)

8
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,889
I'll be right back,
I'll get you some help.

9
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,198
Help, somebody help!

10
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:43,422
Help, somebody help!

11
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,548
(evil laughing)

12
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,298
(loud screaming)

13
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,312
(chirping)

14
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:19,038
(soft eerie music)

15
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,678
- Well, there it is.

16
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:41,678
- [Man] Home sweet home.

17
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,896
- It's so suburban.

18
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,582
- [Man] Wait until you see the school.

19
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:50,599
- [Woman] Best in the state.

20
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,781
- And this is supposed to excite me.

21
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,442
- There's a huge park.

22
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,968
- Just down the street,
fresh air for miles.

23
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,804
- You could take some amazing pictures.

24
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,603
- Of flowers and birds.

25
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,428
- Come on, give it a chance, honey.

26
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,444
- We're gonna love it here.

27
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:07,277
- Love it here, I highly doubt it.

28
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,817
(birds chirping)

29
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,039
Flowers and birds, just what I need.

30
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,336
I think I need some friends, not birds.

31
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,630
(light clicking)

32
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,686
- [Man] Come on, come on!

33
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:44,269
(exciting energetic music)

34
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,688
(people yelling)

35
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,625
(people cheering)

36
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,390
(tense slow music)

37
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,557
Hi, excuse me, could you tell
me where homeroom nine is?

38
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:19,657
(tense scary music)

39
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:34,641
- Hi.

40
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:43,434
I said hi.

41
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,294
- Oh, hi.

42
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:48,549
- I'm Mike.

43
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,382
- Dawn.

44
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,563
- So, what's your sign?

45
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,218
(giggling)

46
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:57,855
- [Dawn] Cancer.

47
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:58,688
- Oh.

48
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,455
- Oh, um, could you tell
me where homeroom nine is?

49
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,372
(deep scary music)

50
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:19,966
- Excuse me, I've gotta go.

51
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,649
- Watch yourself, new girl.

52
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,612
- What's your problem, that hurt?

53
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,281
- Accident (mumbles).

54
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:37,531
(giggling)

55
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,335
(people talking quietly)

56
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,421
- Can I sit with you guys?

57
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,254
- Sure.

58
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:16,953
(soft peaceful music)

59
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:31,174
- I'm Dawn.

60
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:32,007
- Frannie.

61
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,986
- I'm Flo and this is Mary.

62
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,878
- So, you're new here, huh?

63
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:46,961
- Yeah, yeah.

64
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,691
Totally sucks.

65
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,627
- Well, it could be worse, I mean,

66
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:57,879
you could've lived here
your whole life I guess.

67
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,216
(light laughing)

68
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,986
- So, where are you from?

69
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,348
- Different parts of California mostly,

70
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:07,333
LA for the last two years.

71
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,958
- Cool, LA.

72
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,429
- Was it like Beverly Hills 90210?

73
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,179
- Uh, no, not at all.

74
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,006
That show is unrealistic.

75
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,320
It's more like Baywatch.

76
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,714
(girls laughing)

77
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:27,047
(girls laughing loudly)

78
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,946
- You'll get used to her.

79
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:32,946
- Who?

80
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,629
- [Flo] Mercedes.

81
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,807
- She just thinks she's all that.

82
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,030
I mean, if you stay out of
her way, it's really not--

83
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,786
- It's Dawn, isn't it?

84
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,298
- Well, Dawn, I'm Mercedes.

85
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:44,610
I'd like to be one of the first to welcome

86
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,112
you to Pilgrim Town High.

87
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:48,933
I see you found yourself some buddies.

88
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,256
They can bring you up to speed on how

89
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,361
things work around here.

90
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:55,944
You can do that for
me, can't you, Frannie?

91
00:08:58,314 --> 00:08:59,815
Oh and Flo...

92
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,712
(tinkling music)

93
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:03,467
Enjoy your lunch.

94
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,335
(laughing)

95
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:08,585
(simple playful music)

96
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:20,144
(girl screaming)

97
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,398
- Cockroaches again.

98
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,425
- Oh, that's so not funny.

99
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:27,923
(girls laughing)

100
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:28,756
- Wait!

101
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,942
- You witch.

102
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,203
- What did you say to me?

103
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,797
- You heard me, why don't
you pick on somebody else?

104
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:42,964
- My pleasure.

105
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,548
- Oh no!
- It's okay.

106
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,548
- Oh, gross.

107
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,334
- It's a fuzz ball.

108
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:54,662
- Okay, it looked just like one.

109
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,882
- How did she do that?

110
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:59,483
Who has that many bugs at their disposal?

111
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:01,546
- [Frannie] I'm so sick of Mercedes and

112
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,629
all of her stupid pranks.

113
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:07,177
- You know what, she
probably spent like weeks

114
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,369
crawling around in her attic.

115
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,210
- No attic around here!

116
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,543
(screaming)

117
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,101
- What do you mean?

118
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,535
- This bug is only found in
certain parts of Eastern Europe.

119
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:22,432
It can't survive in our climate.

120
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:23,924
- [Frannie] Sometimes
I wish you weren't such

121
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,276
a damn brainiac, Mary.

122
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,946
(bell ringing)

123
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:29,323
- [Girl] I hope we
don't have to run again.

124
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:31,588
- [Girl] I know, I hate that part.

125
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:34,505
(deep tense music)

126
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:42,979
- [Teacher] All right, girls,
come on, let's go, let's go.

127
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:46,146
(deep rhythmic music)

128
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,010
(girls laughing)

129
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:23,133
- Looks like you put on a
few pounds there, fatty.

130
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,462
That's quite the fashion statement.

131
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,129
- Shut up, Mercedes.

132
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,916
(girls oohing)

133
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:34,333
- Now, that's not very nice, is it, Dawn?

134
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,798
I suggest you take a lesson
from your geeky little pals

135
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:41,131
and get in line.

136
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:46,054
I don't know where you come
from or who you think you are,

137
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:48,804
but this is my school, not yours!

138
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:51,987
You're nobody here, get it?

139
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,025
Punch ball.
(girls laughing)

140
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,192
- Come on, Dawn, let's go.

141
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,764
- Oh, Mercedes, why don't you keep this?

142
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,157
Something to stuff your bra with.

143
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,740
(girls oohing)

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,654
- I cannot believe you said that to her!

145
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,033
- The look on her face was like...

146
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:19,007
- Guys, that sucks, I liked those clothes.

147
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,034
My mom's gonna freak.

148
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,959
- (mumbles) she'll never notice.

149
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,417
- Yeah, but what am I gonna do until then?

150
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,775
- We can hang out at my house.

151
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:25,947
I have a cool CD collection.

152
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,438
- Yeah, it rocks.

153
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:28,271
- Really?

154
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,557
- Totally, hang out with us.

155
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:31,736
- Okay.

156
00:12:31,736 --> 00:12:34,486
(girls giggling)

157
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:53,905
- What you smell is the formaldehyde.

158
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,095
It keeps the specimens fresh.

159
00:12:56,095 --> 00:13:00,262
Although I can assure you
these frogs are quite dead.

160
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,560
(laughing)

161
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,999
- Hey, Michael Charming.

162
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,035
Who are you taking to the school dance?

163
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,040
One of your little specimen friends?

164
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,790
(girls laughing)

165
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,529
- Let's see, dead frog, Mercedes.

166
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:42,306
Mercedes, dead frog?

167
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:45,473
You make the choice so simple, ribbit.

168
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:56,216
(tinkling music)

169
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,714
- [Teacher] Okay class,
let's begin dissecting.

170
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,547
(deep dark music)

171
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,272
- [Man] Ow, that hurt!

172
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,047
(dark scary music)

173
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,694
Hey, (mumbles) to yourself.

174
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,636
(dark eerie music)

175
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:57,215
(loud explosion)

176
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:03,854
(soft mumbling)

177
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,661
- I think that's enough frogs for one day.

178
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,380
Will somebody walk Mr. Charming home?

179
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,401
- [Dawn] I will.

180
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,678
- Thank you.

181
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,558
Everyone else, back to work.

182
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,244
- Come on, Michael, let's go.

183
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,396
(soft relaxing music)

184
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,621
- A hallucination of some kind.

185
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,524
Maybe the light from the lamp
reflected off the metal tray.

186
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,774
Maybe the frog wasn't dead.

187
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,605
No, that frog had a beating heart.

188
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,736
I'm never gonna live this down.

189
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:38,298
- It looked kind of cool.

190
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,427
- Yeah?

191
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:40,260
- Yeah.

192
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:45,270
One minute you were
standing there and the next,

193
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,721
boom, you were on the floor.

194
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,067
- Oh.

195
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,817
- No really, don't sweat it,
tomorrow it will be old news.

196
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,067
- You think so?

197
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,789
- Yeah.

198
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,956
(soft peaceful music)

199
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:04,111
You know what I don't understand?

200
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:08,370
How is it that Mercedes is so
popular when she's so mean?

201
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,975
What's the deal with that?

202
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:14,685
- I don't know, it seems like
the Marie Antoinette thing.

203
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,157
She rules through terror.

204
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:19,223
- I guess, I know she
has something to do with

205
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:20,736
Michael getting all freaked out today.

206
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,161
- How?

207
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,469
- [Dawn] I don't know,
I just have a feeling.

208
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:29,071
- Michael Charming probably
imagined the whole thing.

209
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,483
- But it's not just Michael,
it's like weird things

210
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:35,177
happen to anyone who gets in Mercedes way.

211
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,847
- Yeah, creepy weird things.

212
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:42,531
- Guys, I say we start
watching Mercedes closely,

213
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,406
I mean her every move.

214
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:47,947
(slow dramatic music)

215
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:50,923
Between the four of us,
we should be able to

216
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,626
figure out just what she's up to.

217
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,959
Who's up for it?

218
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:09,747
Sweet, look out, Mercedes.

219
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:13,047
- Yeah, more like we should
be the ones looking out.

220
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,220
I got a bad feeling about this.

221
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,470
(giggling)

222
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:22,131
(tense deep music)

223
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:46,305
- Hey, you guys, you
gotta check out Mercedes,

224
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,304
she's doing her nails.

225
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,780
Come on, come on.

226
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,447
(intriguing rhythmic music)

227
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:20,945
- Who's there?

228
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:30,225
(scary deep music)

229
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:33,188
The powers of dark, the powers of light,

230
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,271
fill within me, strengthen my knight.

231
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,908
Now, could you make (mumbles)
fall in love with me?

232
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:46,355
Make Mr. Brett change
the math test Tuesday.

233
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,022
(deep rumbling)

234
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,879
(eerie soft music)

235
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:15,738
Whoever you are, I will find you!

236
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:32,154
- I don't know, she's got
like superpowers or something.

237
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:32,987
- Totally.

238
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:38,933
- Okay, she's all ready
got a hold over the school.

239
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,605
I mean, who knows what's next.

240
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:41,438
- The PTA.

241
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:43,565
- [Dawn] We have to figure out where

242
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:45,980
she gets her powers from.

243
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,813
- Wicca.

244
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,174
- Mary?

245
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,373
- Wicca.

246
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,858
It's the religion that witches practice.

247
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:57,263
From what I've read, she fits the profile.

248
00:20:57,263 --> 00:20:58,930
Mercedes is a witch.

249
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:04,546
- And we've got the proof.

250
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:09,970
- Do you really think this is gonna work?

251
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,688
- Why wouldn't it?

252
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,961
- You know, maybe because
of her evil powers,

253
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,531
she can't be photographed.

254
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,471
I bet she can't even see her reflection

255
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:20,511
when she looks at the mirror.

256
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:23,441
- She's not a vampire, Flo, she's a witch.

257
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,941
- [Flo] Oh, right.

258
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,706
(gasping)

259
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:31,635
- Geez, Michael, you scared us to death.

260
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:32,885
- Sorry, sorry.

261
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,171
- Good one, Michael, now we're
gonna have to reprint this.

262
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,331
- Michael, what do you want?

263
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,335
- I just--

264
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:40,703
- We're kind of busy right now.

265
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:42,403
- Can I please speak to Dawn?

266
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:43,236
Thank you.

267
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:48,718
(mumbles) I just speak to Dawn.

268
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:50,657
I've been trying to get you
alone for the past few days

269
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:53,354
but you guys always seem to be together.

270
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,655
- We're doing a project.

271
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:57,155
- Oh, right, cool.

272
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:04,975
- What is it, Michael?

273
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,895
- Well, you know the
dance is this Saturday,

274
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:11,062
and well, I was think
(mumbles) checking it out.

275
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:14,914
Anyways, I really didn't wanna go alone.

276
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:19,081
I mean, I wasn't sure if
you had any plans going on.

277
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:24,079
Because, I mean, if you're gonna be there,

278
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,579
maybe we could dance together.

279
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,834
- Are you asking me out?

280
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:30,834
- Mmm, yeah.

281
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:36,367
- I'm flattered.

282
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,918
But I don't think so.

283
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,136
Well, I wasn't planning on going anyway.

284
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:47,008
See, I'm a really bad dancer.

285
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,508
- No, that's cool.

286
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,886
- I'm really sorry.

287
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:53,136
- No, whatever.

288
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,567
I'll see you guys around.

289
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:02,049
(laughing)

290
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,359
- Frannie!

291
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,192
- Sorry.

292
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,933
(dramatic deep music)

293
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,342
- Well, we have the picture.

294
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,580
Now what?

295
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,913
(simple rhythmic music)

296
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,920
- Where are these?

297
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,494
- In the basement.

298
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:42,632
(loud banging)

299
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:44,882
(coughing)

300
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,097
In the basement stacks.

301
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:50,456
- Let's go.

302
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:55,349
(intriguing rhythmic music)

303
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:04,031
(light coughing)

304
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:27,257
- Find anything?

305
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,840
- No, just some stupid potions.

306
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:35,163
- Nothing in any of these about an amulet.

307
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,585
- Geez, they were really into
the eyes of newt back then.

308
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:41,116
- Yeah, what's the deal with that?

309
00:24:41,116 --> 00:24:43,449
- Why don't we ask for help?

310
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:45,544
- You mean...

311
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,619
- Well, she is the librarian, right?

312
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:55,684
(bell dinging)
(eerie slow music)

313
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,143
- Yes, precious?

314
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:17,989
- I was wondering if you knew--

315
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,739
- Speak up, precious!

316
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,411
- Do you have anymore--

317
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:24,244
- Shh!

318
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:26,227
- Do you--

319
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:28,471
- [Librarian] Shh!

320
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:29,632
- Do you--

321
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:30,465
- Shh!

322
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:36,273
- Do you, do you know
if there's anymore books

323
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:37,440
on witchcraft?

324
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:41,031
(light giggling)

325
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,673
We've looked at all the
books down in the basement,

326
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:49,840
we're trying to find more
information on this amulet.

327
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:14,607
(light footsteps)

328
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,261
(soft talking)

329
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:42,065
That is one freaky librarian.

330
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:45,287
I don't know what her deal is.

331
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,463
(screaming)

332
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:48,526
- Shh!

333
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:49,934
You maybe in the basement, girls,

334
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:52,878
but this is still a library.

335
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:56,461
So, you want to know
about that amulet, eh?

336
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:02,861
I always wondered when
someone would come looking.

337
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:05,111
See, where did that get to?

338
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,919
Pilgrimtown has a history of witchcraft,

339
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,586
just have to know where to look.

340
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:34,837
- That's it, that's the amulet.

341
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,930
- The devil stone was
said to have been born

342
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,347
from the fires of earth by Satan himself.

343
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:47,446
350 years ago, the devil
stone was under control

344
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,496
of Aubrina, a vicious and cruel witch

345
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:56,793
who terrorized the (mumbles)
of Pilgrimtown for years.

346
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,367
She tried to turn
innocent village children

347
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,284
into an army of slaves.

348
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,104
But one day, the townsmen
rose up against her

349
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,858
and hunted her down.

350
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:15,564
She used all of her powers
to be strong (mumbles)

351
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:19,358
and she could not (mumbles).

352
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:24,211
Finally, when she had no
escape, she vanished to thin air

353
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:27,578
leaving behind the
powerful amulet for the day

354
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,477
when she returned.

355
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:33,644
And she (mumbles) upon
the people of Pilgrimtown.

356
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,233
- There's a girl in school, Mercedes,

357
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,865
she has part of the
amulet, she can do things.

358
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:42,455
- She's a witch.

359
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:46,455
- Quiet, she's only have
the witch she could be.

360
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,450
(eerie dark music)

361
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,969
- [Fannie] I knew it, who
said small town rumors

362
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,367
were never true?

363
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,812
- Relax, you have nothing
to fear from me, precious.

364
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:02,366
I'm merely the keeper of the stone.

365
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,533
An honor passed down through the ages.

366
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:12,076
I only wish I'd found both
halves to guard them from evil,

367
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:15,783
but now, thankfully, I
can bestow that honor

368
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,283
upon a new keeper.

369
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:23,741
- Whoa, wait, you don't
want me to be the keeper.

370
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:26,241
I lose everything, ask my mom.

371
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:31,829
- My time is coming, I can't
protect the stone forever.

372
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:35,760
You must guard it now,
guard it with your life.

373
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,796
- But why me?

374
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:39,419
- I've looked into your soul, precious.

375
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,169
The amulet is safe in good hands.

376
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,943
Now...

377
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:54,614
Take this and go.

378
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,202
- Don't we at least check this...

379
00:29:59,202 --> 00:30:01,535
(screaming)

380
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:18,108
Couldn't we wait until morning to do this?

381
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,342
I mean, there are animals
and stuff out here at night.

382
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:22,780
- Yeah, vicious man eating squirrels.

383
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,458
We're in Massachusetts, Flo, relax.

384
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,960
(yelling)

385
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,567
- Gotcha.

386
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:32,400
- Cute, so glad you've
come out of your shell.

387
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,248
- Guys, we're here.

388
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:41,089
That's the tree.

389
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,256
(soft dramatic music)

390
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,210
- [Frannie] Now what?

391
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:01,317
- I don't know, there wasn't much to it.

392
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,716
- Well, what if we do it wrong,

393
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:05,547
I don't wanna accidentally
mess with (mumbles)?

394
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:08,737
- Please, if Mercedes figured
it out, how hard can it be?

395
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,062
- SHe's got a point.

396
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:12,710
- It says here that when a
convent of witches has cast

397
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,776
a spell, they have to all be touching so

398
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,500
the spirits pass through them.

399
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,984
- Is that what we are now, a convent?

400
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,067
- I guess so.

401
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,118
- Great, now everyone
at school's gonna think

402
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,026
we've gone goth.

403
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,609
- Okay, um, everybody
join hands and kneel.

404
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:33,445
(soft eerie music)

405
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,843
(owls hooting)

406
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,557
Close your eyes and repeat after me.

407
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:56,675
The powers of dark, the powers of light,

408
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:59,675
flow within me, strengthen my night.

409
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:07,009
- Powers of dark, powers of light.

410
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,926
(mumbled chanting)

411
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:20,816
- Ow, geez, Flo, you got
like Schwarzenegger grip!

412
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,580
- [Flo] Sorry, what do
you want, I got scared!

413
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,163
- Yeah, we noticed.

414
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:27,824
- So, is that it?

415
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:30,142
- I guess so.

416
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,991
- [Flo] Thank god.

417
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,550
- Look at my hand.

418
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,751
We're not like lost, are we?

419
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:48,024
This is a lot further than I remember.

420
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:50,146
- I know, I'm beat.

421
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,949
- Would you guys stop it and

422
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:53,399
we'll be home before you know it.

423
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,513
(loud rumbling)

424
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:56,346
Ow!

425
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,421
This thing's stronger than I thought.

426
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:04,195
- It's totally amazing.

427
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:05,028
- Yeah.

428
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:07,922
- [Woman] Dawn, is that you?

429
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:09,755
- Yeah, mom, I'm home.

430
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:14,036
- Oh, hi girls.

431
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,612
Have you been home long?

432
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:17,182
I didn't hear you come in.

433
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,849
- We just popped in.

434
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:23,316
- Well, Dawn, dinner's ready in five.

435
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:24,951
I'm sorry, if I'd known your
friends were coming over,

436
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,721
I would've made more.

437
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,081
- That's okay, Mrs. Reilly,
we were just leaving.

438
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,655
- Mom, I'll be down in a minute.

439
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,400
- All right then.

440
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,339
Don't forget, dinner's in five minutes.

441
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:38,589
(giggling)

442
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,684
- Okay, everybody give me your hands,

443
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:43,800
we have to make a pact.

444
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,462
- Is this gonna be a blood pact?

445
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:46,825
- Oh, Flo, you're such a wimp.

446
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,578
- No, I'm not, it's just, I'm sanitary.

447
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:51,229
- Just give me your hand, Flo, no blood.

448
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,823
We can all trust each other, right?

449
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:53,656
- Right.

450
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,197
- Okay, we make a vow, a solid pledge that

451
00:33:58,197 --> 00:34:01,590
everything we've learned
about, the devil stone,

452
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,796
the magic powers, the book, everything,

453
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:07,707
it remains a secret that
never leaves this room.

454
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:09,000
Agreed.

455
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,417
- [Girls] Agreed.

456
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:17,395
- So, where do you think we
should try our powers first?

457
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:20,228
- Boosters, we need more boosters.

458
00:34:21,634 --> 00:34:23,619
For those of you who don't know,

459
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:28,241
the boosters are a very
important part of the school.

460
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:32,437
They help with fundraising
and boost, if you will,

461
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,687
moral at our football game.

462
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,656
Well, we can't all be cheerleaders.

463
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,670
- He's the only man I know
that can actually bore himself.

464
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,835
- Wake me up when this is over.

465
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,516
- Dawn, why don't you try out some magic.

466
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:52,393
- Yeah, this is a perfect place.

467
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:54,153
- No, no, I'm not ready.

468
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:56,700
- Who wants to be a booster?

469
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,867
Let's get a show of hands.

470
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,458
- Talk, talk, talk.

471
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,400
- [Man] The freshman
dance is this Saturday.

472
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,746
- He could be a little shorter.

473
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:09,496
(tinkling music)

474
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,489
Did I do that?

475
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,746
- No, he's on a (mumbles) diet.

476
00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:19,164
Of course you did!

477
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,913
- What do I do, what do I do?

478
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,510
- Make him big, make him big.

479
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,593
- Make him big, big, big.

480
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,233
No, make him the way he was before that.

481
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:42,552
No, before that.

482
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,197
Make the principal his normal size.

483
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,508
- (mumbles) more interesting.

484
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:58,258
- Only slightly more interesting.

485
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:01,631
- Does anybody have any questions?

486
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:04,464
(people laughing)

487
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,539
(applauding)

488
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,379
Thank you, students.

489
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:18,841
Thank you for your kind attention.

490
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,508
(kids laughing)

491
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,527
- What'd I miss, what'd I miss?

492
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,610
(exciting fun music)

493
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,578
- I think it's time we try on Mercedes.

494
00:36:33,578 --> 00:36:36,995
- Turn her into a feral pig or something.

495
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,583
- Okay.

496
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,190
- Well.

497
00:36:59,447 --> 00:37:01,845
(mumbles)

498
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,421
Bummer.

499
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,855
- It's actually quite logical.

500
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,660
It says here that the magic of the amulet

501
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,544
is gathered by the wearers heart.

502
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,193
If the wearers heart is kind,

503
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,943
no evil will come from the magic.

504
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:17,193
- Sorry, I can't help it.

505
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,080
- Let me, I'm a Girl's Scout.

506
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,380
- No, the librarian gave
it to Dawn for a reason.

507
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,399
- So, we're like the good witches?

508
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,899
How unfun is that?

509
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,480
- But we can still beat
her at her own game.

510
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,529
We'll just undo all the
magic that she does.

511
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,862
She won't know what hit her.

512
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,611
- Oh, sorry, I'm very sorry.

513
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:54,840
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.

514
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,007
(fast exciting music)

515
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:13,779
(girls laughing)

516
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,937
- The cheerleaders are wearing (mumbles).

517
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:21,104
(fast rhythmic music)

518
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:55,770
- You're in my way, freshman.

519
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:03,848
(laughing)

520
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,501
- Whoa, what's happening?

521
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:21,751
(fast energetic music)

522
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:47,338
(groaning)

523
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:54,589
- Hey, Dawn, over here.

524
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,984
(light snapping)

525
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:53,846
- Oh, I almost forgot,
you guys are all invited

526
00:40:53,846 --> 00:40:55,495
to my birthday party on Friday the 13th.

527
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,745
Wear a costume.

528
00:40:59,057 --> 00:40:59,890
- Cool.

529
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:12,407
- Well, well, well.

530
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:16,157
It's not over yet (mumbles).

531
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:22,348
Let's go.

532
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,468
(high pitched eerie music)

533
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:41,718
(laughing)

534
00:41:43,797 --> 00:41:46,104
I have a little something for you, Dawn.

535
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:49,199
Consider it a birthday gift.

536
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,430
- I'm not afraid of you, Mercedes.

537
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,930
- [Mercedes] Oh, you will be, you will be.

538
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,233
(light fun music)

539
00:42:21,165 --> 00:42:23,832
(loud knocking)

540
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,743
- Hey.

541
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:30,640
(owl hooting)
(deep scary music)

542
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:37,159
- Spirits of darkness, grant me the spell.

543
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:42,923
The day is done, the sun is past.

544
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:47,325
Let night fall on Dawn and deep and vast.

545
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:54,557
- [Girls] Happy birthday, Dawn!

546
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:00,214
(people cheering)

547
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:05,563
- Happy birthday, Dawn.

548
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:06,769
- Happy birthday.

549
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,363
- [Flo] Don't forget to make a wish.

550
00:44:08,363 --> 00:44:09,196
- Right.

551
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,152
(people cheering)

552
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,463
(eerie dark music)

553
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:22,796
I feel so tired.

554
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:32,107
- Dawn.

555
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:33,786
Dawn!

556
00:44:37,118 --> 00:44:39,054
Something's definitely wrong here.

557
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,971
(dark scary music)

558
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,912
(creepy laughing)

559
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:03,994
- So, no cake?

560
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,794
- NO, no cake!

561
00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:07,083
We gotta figure out what
happened here because

562
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,882
clearly Mercedes cast a pretty evil spell.

563
00:45:09,882 --> 00:45:10,715
- Spell?

564
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:13,197
- It's a long story.

565
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:14,691
This is no ordinary
nap, Michael, trust me.

566
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:16,970
We have to wake her up.

567
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,553
(high pitched eerie music)

568
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,173
- Dawn, wake up (mumbles)!

569
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,911
(playful rhythmic music)

570
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:39,526
- What are we gonna tell Dawn's parents?

571
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:40,935
- We can't tell them anything.

572
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:42,657
- Well, we can't let
them find her like this.

573
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,131
- Bring her to my brother's tree house.

574
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,205
We'll leave a note saying we're having

575
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,196
a sleepover at my house.

576
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:49,636
- Let's change first.

577
00:45:49,636 --> 00:45:50,969
- Okay, come on.

578
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,292
(eerie soft music)

579
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,518
- Okay, Michael, stand guard,
I don't trust Mercedes.

580
00:46:21,518 --> 00:46:23,172
And no sleeping!

581
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:24,172
- All right!

582
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,383
(fast intriguing music)

583
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,514
- [Flo] She's not gonna be here, Frannie,

584
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:43,888
it's past midnight.

585
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:46,555
(loud knocking)

586
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,350
(light creaking)

587
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:55,099
- Go first, Mary.

588
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,374
You can go first.

589
00:46:56,374 --> 00:46:57,374
You're next.

590
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:02,649
(fast rhythmic music)

591
00:47:08,196 --> 00:47:09,029
- Hello.

592
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:12,841
Mrs. Hatch!

593
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:17,299
(deep rhythmic music)

594
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:26,721
Hello!

595
00:47:28,483 --> 00:47:29,316
Hello!

596
00:47:35,128 --> 00:47:36,192
- Looking for me?

597
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,525
(screaming)

598
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,464
- You're getting really good at that.

599
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,881
- Thank you, precious, I try.

600
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:48,879
What can I do for you?

601
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,389
- We need your help.

602
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:52,424
Mercedes has put a spell on Dawn.

603
00:47:52,424 --> 00:47:55,174
- Yes, I know, the eternal sleep.

604
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,789
The most vexing turn of events.

605
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:00,289
Give me the stone.

606
00:48:01,362 --> 00:48:02,862
Give me the stone.

607
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:11,893
Come with me, come with me.

608
00:48:16,095 --> 00:48:18,762
- Come on, Charming, stay awake.

609
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:41,012
- Amulet of destiny, show
forth, let us seize (mumbles)

610
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:43,376
never be.

611
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:47,412
(high pitched music)

612
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,214
- Oh, I've seen this kind of movie before.

613
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:01,194
He's gonna have to fight a
dragon or something (mumbles).

614
00:49:01,194 --> 00:49:02,027
- Shh!

615
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,951
- Hey, it's Dawn.

616
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:24,118
(soft peaceful music)

617
00:49:47,966 --> 00:49:51,851
- Dawn needs the kiss of a
brave and gallant fellow.

618
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:53,729
And she needs it quickly.

619
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:55,479
When did she fall under the spell?

620
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:56,645
- At 9:00.

621
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,478
- Then you have until
9:00 tonight to wake her.

622
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:01,619
If she should sleep for a full day,

623
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,904
she will sleep forevermore.

624
00:50:03,904 --> 00:50:05,416
- Brave and gallant?

625
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:08,412
Have you checked out
the guys in this town?

626
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:11,985
- Well, you'll just have to
conjure one up, won't you?

627
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:13,308
- Of course.

628
00:50:13,308 --> 00:50:15,725
- Now, where did that get to?

629
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:22,284
Ah, this is it.

630
00:50:26,234 --> 00:50:28,894
(coughing)

631
00:50:28,894 --> 00:50:32,394
Now, brave and gallant, brave and gallant.

632
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:35,495
(mumbles)

633
00:50:35,495 --> 00:50:36,662
That's not it.

634
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:40,981
Here we go, one brave and gallant fellow.

635
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:44,833
Under the rays of the morning sun,

636
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,831
concoct a brew of one eye
of newt, two toad stools,

637
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:52,748
three grasshopper wings
and a little old spice.

638
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:57,354
There, this shouldn't be
too hard for you girls.

639
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,713
- Couldn't you just conjure them up?

640
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:00,290
I mean, you seem to be
the most experienced

641
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,646
witch in the room.

642
00:51:01,646 --> 00:51:03,642
- I'm not a witch, precious.

643
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:05,059
Just a librarian.

644
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,292
- Yeah, but how do you know
so much about all this stuff?

645
00:51:09,292 --> 00:51:10,209
- Research.

646
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,624
(soft depressing music)

647
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:50,164
(fast intense music)

648
00:51:50,164 --> 00:51:52,914
(horse trotting)

649
00:51:59,832 --> 00:52:00,665
- Hello!

650
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:13,764
Awesome.

651
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,298
(soft enchanting music)

652
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:39,997
- Hi.

653
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:42,164
- Hi, you look just great.

654
00:52:44,368 --> 00:52:45,201
- Thanks.

655
00:52:46,498 --> 00:52:47,512
- Of course this is my dream,

656
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,312
I wouldn't have you looking any other way.

657
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:50,311
If a guy has a crush on a girl,

658
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:53,303
he doesn't dream of
her looking like a dog.

659
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,913
Not that you look like a dog.

660
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,163
I'll just stop talking now.

661
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:02,350
- I'm glad you came by.

662
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,424
- So, what are you doing here?

663
00:53:05,424 --> 00:53:06,257
- Waiting.

664
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,088
- Waiting for what?

665
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:13,096
- A prince, I guess, I don't know.

666
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:17,984
Between you and me,
it's getting (mumbles).

667
00:53:17,984 --> 00:53:19,739
- I saw a guy run by here earlier.

668
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,455
(mumbles), it could be your guy.

669
00:53:24,455 --> 00:53:25,288
- Maybe.

670
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:29,852
Personally, I prefer Leonardo Decaprio

671
00:53:29,852 --> 00:53:31,769
but what can a girl do?

672
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:36,032
(mumbles)

673
00:53:36,032 --> 00:53:37,585
Cool.

674
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:41,168
So, do you wanna play
frisbee or something?

675
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:45,550
- Can you play frisbees?

676
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,383
I mean--

677
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:51,763
- It is your dream, Michael, dream one up.

678
00:53:51,763 --> 00:53:52,930
- Yeah, right.

679
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:58,599
(soft tinkling music)

680
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,349
(light laughing)

681
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:18,731
(soft peaceful music)

682
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:21,108
- Michael!

683
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:23,456
Michael!

684
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:26,159
Michael.

685
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,993
Michael!

686
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:31,077
Wake up, you're on guard, remember?

687
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,385
What do you think you're doing?

688
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:33,671
- Playing Frisbee.

689
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:34,889
- What!

690
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:36,806
- I'm awake, I'm awake.

691
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:42,176
- All right, whatever,
stay put and stay awake!

692
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:45,133
Let's get cooking.

693
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,908
(slow dramatic music)

694
00:55:05,768 --> 00:55:08,685
(light whispering)

695
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:18,187
- [Girls] Bubble, boil, melts and mince,

696
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:20,854
conjure for us a gallant prince.

697
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:23,733
- Hey, guys.

698
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:24,566
What?

699
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:30,565
There's no sign of Mercedes
and I'm getting hungry.

700
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:31,398
What?

701
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:35,272
- Okay, we're definitely
doing something wrong here.

702
00:55:35,272 --> 00:55:38,303
- You know, maybe we should try
mixing it in something else.

703
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:40,411
I mean, the spell does
call for a cauldron,

704
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:41,830
not a crock pot.

705
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,680
- You know what, that's
just because when the book

706
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,120
was written, they didn't have crock pots.

707
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,635
Besides, my mother doesn't
cook in a cauldron, sorry.

708
00:55:49,635 --> 00:55:51,130
- Hey, don't get mad at me just because

709
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,860
you don't know what you're doing.

710
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,296
- Oh, like you do?

711
00:55:54,296 --> 00:55:56,239
- [Flo] At least I read the stuff.

712
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:57,648
- [Fannie] You know what, I read it,

713
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,942
I just don't get all of
it, okay, witch hazel.

714
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:00,775
- Hey!

715
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:06,675
Let's use him.

716
00:56:08,015 --> 00:56:09,556
- Him?

717
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:11,008
- [Mary] He's all we got.

718
00:56:11,008 --> 00:56:14,591
- She's right, what do we have to lose?

719
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,894
- What are you guys talking about?

720
00:56:16,894 --> 00:56:19,227
- Nothing, just stand still.

721
00:56:24,038 --> 00:56:26,461
Bubble, boil, melt, and mince,

722
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:28,878
turn this geek into a prince.

723
00:56:31,502 --> 00:56:32,976
- What!

724
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,175
How'd you do that?

725
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:35,592
- Well, that's lame.

726
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,626
- Give it to me.

727
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,459
You have to wish like you mean it.

728
00:56:43,741 --> 00:56:45,171
(laughing)

729
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:47,308
- [Fannie] Oh my god.

730
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:50,362
- Could somebody please
tell me what's going on?

731
00:56:50,362 --> 00:56:54,529
- Geez, Flo, ween yourself
off the '80s MTV all ready.

732
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:05,875
- I'm going home now.

733
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,360
- No, you're not going anywhere.

734
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,097
- Maybe we should just let him kiss her?

735
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,851
- Me, kiss Dawn Hurley?

736
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,018
(exciting fast music)

737
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:30,748
- Hey!

738
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:31,581
No tongue.

739
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:36,900
(fast rhythmic music)

740
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:57,989
Come on all ready!

741
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,451
- Guys, we have a problem.

742
00:58:22,562 --> 00:58:26,099
I was here the whole time, no one went up.

743
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,719
- Maybe she woke up, went home.

744
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,016
- When?

745
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,623
- Now we'll never save her.

746
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,873
(laughing)

747
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:39,439
- [Mercedes] That's
right, Flo, give it up!

748
00:58:39,439 --> 00:58:41,158
- What'd you do with her?

749
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:43,925
- Oh, don't worry, I
made sure she's someplace

750
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:45,954
that you'll never find her.

751
00:58:45,954 --> 00:58:47,814
In fact, it's a lot like Pilgrimtown

752
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:50,314
only a little bit more rustic.

753
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:55,042
(evil laughing)

754
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:57,625
(loud booming)

755
00:59:02,184 --> 00:59:04,079
- All right, now will
someone please tell me

756
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,829
what's going on here?

757
00:59:07,747 --> 00:59:11,123
- Mercedes is an evil
witch who's trying to take

758
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:12,710
over the school so Dawn and
all of us were trying to stop

759
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,270
her, but Mercedes put
Dawn into an eternal sleep

760
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,211
that can only be broken
with a kiss of a brave

761
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:18,063
and gallant fellow who we
have to find by the time

762
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:21,469
the dance starts tonight
or she'll never wake up.

763
00:59:21,469 --> 00:59:23,802
- Oh, that's what I thought.

764
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,401
And am I that brave and gallant fellow?

765
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,388
- I don't think so.

766
00:59:28,388 --> 00:59:29,400
- Why not?

767
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,431
Just because I'm skinny
doesn't mean that I can't

768
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,047
be brave and gallant too.

769
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:34,537
- Yes it does.

770
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:37,944
- It doesn't matter, we don't
even know where Dawn is.

771
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:39,927
- Mary's right, I mean,
how can we save her

772
00:59:39,927 --> 00:59:42,094
if we can't even find her?

773
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,922
- [Michael] Another
world, parallel universes.

774
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:46,379
- What are you babbling?

775
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:48,260
- Parallel universes.

776
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,400
Mercedes said she hid Dawn
in another world, right?

777
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,147
One that was like ours but
a little bit more rustic,

778
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:53,980
older.

779
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:56,194
She must've created a portal
to a parallel universe

780
00:59:56,194 --> 00:59:58,614
and hidden Dawn there.

781
00:59:58,614 --> 01:00:00,509
- Yes, I understand.

782
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,157
- No, no, hang on.

783
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:03,888
In English, Einstein.

784
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:06,388
- Okay, all right, just a sec.

785
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:14,196
Okay.

786
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:16,165
You see these lines,
longitude and latitude,

787
01:00:16,165 --> 01:00:18,560
all in parallel to each other?

788
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,439
Well, they're not really,
you can't touch them.

789
01:00:20,439 --> 01:00:22,825
They only exist in space and time.

790
01:00:22,825 --> 01:00:25,927
Suddenly the (mumbles)
between alternate universes,

791
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:27,878
universes that coexist
in the same timeframe,

792
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,468
even share many of the same elements,

793
01:00:29,468 --> 01:00:30,968
yet never overlap.

794
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,289
They all live peacefully,
moving forward in time,

795
01:00:34,289 --> 01:00:37,178
oblivious to the parallel
universes beside them.

796
01:00:37,178 --> 01:00:39,788
Somewhere in Pilgrimtown
there must be a porthole!

797
01:00:39,788 --> 01:00:41,959
A gateway to these other worlds!

798
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:43,628
- And who believes this?

799
01:00:43,628 --> 01:00:44,736
- [Michael] Well, my whole Dungeons and

800
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:45,929
Dragons group, for one.

801
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:46,931
- Please.

802
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:49,271
- [Flo] No, it's true, I
read about it in physics.

803
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,619
- It's kind of like traveling
to another dimension, Frannie.

804
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,222
- Theoretically.

805
01:00:53,222 --> 01:00:55,333
- And you guys buy this?

806
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:58,174
- You're telling me you don't
believe Michael's theory,

807
01:00:58,174 --> 01:00:59,608
yet you accept the fact
that we just magically

808
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:01,691
turned him into a prince?

809
01:01:03,723 --> 01:01:06,390
- Again, she makes a good point.

810
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:12,138
All right, well, what do we do first?

811
01:01:12,138 --> 01:01:13,903
- We have to find the porthole
that Mercedes created.

812
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,213
She probably hit it somewhere she's sure

813
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,665
nobody's gonna look.

814
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:20,748
(exciting low music)

815
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:28,212
(horn beeping)

816
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:30,948
- [Mercedes] Hurry up,
we're gonna be late!

817
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:34,281
(deep intriguing music)

818
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:51,739
- Do you realize we're doing
a breaking and entering?

819
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:52,885
- So, don't get caught.

820
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:56,052
(deep rhythmic music)

821
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:14,314
(loud clanking)

822
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,369
- What exactly are we looking for?

823
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,202
- Just (mumbles).

824
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,377
Anything unusual.

825
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,833
- Hey, guys, check it out.

826
01:02:44,748 --> 01:02:45,581
Yum.

827
01:02:46,923 --> 01:02:49,377
- Okay, let's go find her bedroom.

828
01:02:49,377 --> 01:02:52,544
(deep rhythmic music)

829
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:03,006
(eerie high pitched music)

830
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,220
- [Woman] Welcome home, Mercedes.

831
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,538
Ready to rock the universe,

832
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:11,705
no one is (mumbles) than you, Mercedes.

833
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,717
- [Michael] Oh, come on
guys, how cool is that?

834
01:03:15,717 --> 01:03:17,717
- [Fannie] Keep looking.

835
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:26,375
- Ah, guys, I can't get the mask off!

836
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,375
Oh, just kidding, sorry.

837
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,967
- Look at this, mean old Mercedes
sleeps with a teddy bear.

838
01:03:37,253 --> 01:03:39,920
(deep growling)

839
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:42,809
- Great, now the whole
neighborhood will know

840
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:44,036
that we're here.

841
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:47,269
(deep growling)

842
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:49,269
- We're looking in the wrong place, guys.

843
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:54,148
I mean, where does Mercedes
really spend all her time?

844
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:55,735
- Cheerleading.

845
01:03:55,735 --> 01:03:57,473
- Of course.

846
01:03:57,473 --> 01:03:59,870
(deep growling)

847
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,370
- Oh, shut up!

848
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,576
(whimpering)

849
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:05,493
Tough love.

850
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,417
- Let's go!

851
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:20,146
Whoa, I've never been in the
girl's locker room before.

852
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:21,683
- Hone your hormones,
Michael, we've got work to do.

853
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:25,850
- Okay, let's spread out
and find Mercedes locker.

854
01:04:39,068 --> 01:04:41,018
(laughing)

855
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:43,185
- Found it, subtle really.

856
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,249
- Hear anything?

857
01:04:51,249 --> 01:04:53,916
- Can't tell, just a little hum.

858
01:04:56,467 --> 01:04:57,384
Just a sec.

859
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,982
Stand back.

860
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:12,294
- [Fannie] What are you doing?

861
01:05:12,294 --> 01:05:14,877
(loud banging)

862
01:05:16,596 --> 01:05:19,846
(loud whooshing)
- Wow.

863
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,507
- I gotta hand it to you, Michael,

864
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:30,592
when you're right,
you're definitely right.

865
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:32,098
What do we do now?

866
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:33,599
- [Michael] Jump in, I guess.

867
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,516
(dark scary music)

868
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:49,246
- Oh, he just worships me.

869
01:06:08,952 --> 01:06:12,285
(peaceful guitar music)

870
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:16,918
(people talking lightly)

871
01:06:39,355 --> 01:06:42,105
(fun fast music)

872
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:53,087
- Wow.

873
01:06:56,289 --> 01:06:57,454
(mumbles)

874
01:06:57,454 --> 01:06:58,843
- Something tells me she's not here.

875
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:02,075
This place isn't quite rustic enough.

876
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:02,908
- Michael!

877
01:07:03,796 --> 01:07:04,629
Come on!

878
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:08,885
(dark scary music)

879
01:07:49,998 --> 01:07:52,415
(applauding)

880
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,998
(screaming)
(dark deep music)

881
01:08:17,998 --> 01:08:20,122
- Is everybody okay?

882
01:08:20,122 --> 01:08:21,111
- Yeah.

883
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:22,194
- I think so.

884
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,736
- Where are we?

885
01:08:28,736 --> 01:08:29,986
- I don't know.

886
01:08:30,972 --> 01:08:32,295
- Look at this.

887
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:33,613
- Get down!

888
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:36,696
(intense fast music)

889
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:41,991
- Hey, that's the guy from my...

890
01:08:41,991 --> 01:08:43,480
- We should follow him!

891
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,480
(strong slow music)

892
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,993
- I'm tired, I don't see why
we can't just rest a bit.

893
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:01,076
- Because it's all ready 7:00,
we only have two hours left!

894
01:09:01,076 --> 01:09:02,565
- We don't even know if
we're in the right universe.

895
01:09:02,565 --> 01:09:05,691
- No, she's here, I can feel it.

896
01:09:05,691 --> 01:09:07,735
I don't know how but I've
never been more certain.

897
01:09:07,735 --> 01:09:11,133
(soft enchanting music)

898
01:09:11,133 --> 01:09:11,966
Sweet.

899
01:09:12,837 --> 01:09:16,237
- That's the same castle (mumbles).

900
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:17,608
This is definitely it!

901
01:09:17,608 --> 01:09:18,941
- Yes, let's go!

902
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:23,072
(triumphant music)

903
01:09:28,162 --> 01:09:29,412
- Wow, awesome.

904
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:05,224
- You brainiacs are a bit
smarter than I thought.

905
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,972
- Someone called us brainiacs.

906
01:10:07,972 --> 01:10:11,060
Watch your tongue with me, dweeb!

907
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,129
(laughing)

908
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:14,659
Is this the best you could do, girls?

909
01:10:14,659 --> 01:10:16,326
This is your prince?

910
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,657
Oh, how truly tragic for you.

911
01:10:19,657 --> 01:10:21,220
But hey, I hate to disappoint you all but

912
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,564
I'm just not a real big
fan of happy endings!

913
01:10:24,564 --> 01:10:26,981
So, thanks for this, Frannie.

914
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:36,805
Now the devil stone and
all of its powers are mine!

915
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:41,861
(evil laughing)

916
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:45,692
(scary dark music)

917
01:10:54,277 --> 01:10:56,470
(screaming)

918
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:59,137
(loud rumbling)

919
01:11:01,051 --> 01:11:02,543
(fast intense music)

920
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:03,460
- Now what?

921
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,065
- We've gotta find our knight.

922
01:11:06,065 --> 01:11:08,214
Don't they go together,
knights and dragons?

923
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:11,027
(deep rumbling)

924
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:12,359
- We don't have any time.

925
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:13,359
- We can handle this, ladies,

926
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:15,859
we just have to use our heads.

927
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:18,088
- This coming from a guy who faints

928
01:11:18,088 --> 01:11:19,725
at the sight of dead frogs!

929
01:11:19,725 --> 01:11:24,161
You do realize the dragon (mumbles).

930
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:26,908
- All Mercedes needs is a little cocktail.

931
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,915
(mumbles)

932
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:30,248
Here's the plan.

933
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:35,417
(eerie high pitched music)

934
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,973
The giant (mumbles) ready.

935
01:12:06,973 --> 01:12:07,806
- Ready!

936
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,650
- What can I say?

937
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:16,102
I always cut shop.

938
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:18,935
(deep dark music)

939
01:12:24,368 --> 01:12:27,490
You know, she actually
looks better this way.

940
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,407
Especially personality.

941
01:12:33,263 --> 01:12:34,930
- Come on, let's go.

942
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:38,978
(fast rhythmic music)

943
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:50,108
(screaming)

944
01:12:50,108 --> 01:12:52,773
(mumbles) last night, Mercedes.

945
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:54,940
(mumbles)

946
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:59,906
- (mumbles) a big world, isn't it?

947
01:12:59,906 --> 01:13:03,073
(deep dramatic music)

948
01:13:22,491 --> 01:13:23,886
Over here, zit face!

949
01:13:23,886 --> 01:13:27,746
You know, this is the best
your skin has looked all year!

950
01:13:27,746 --> 01:13:29,647
(screaming)

951
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:31,456
- Over here, you put on
a few pounds, Mercedes!

952
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:33,173
Or should I say tons!

953
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:35,423
(growling)

954
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:06,604
He's toast.

955
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:09,829
- And she doesn't look
the least bit tired.

956
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:12,496
- Come on, Michael, where is he?

957
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:15,426
(loud pounding)

958
01:14:15,426 --> 01:14:16,804
(screaming)

959
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:18,971
- Not so fast, trampoline!

960
01:14:20,984 --> 01:14:23,901
(mumbles) come on.

961
01:14:29,412 --> 01:14:31,771
- Come on, Michael!

962
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:33,212
- Come on, Michael!

963
01:14:33,212 --> 01:14:34,462
Do it, come on!

964
01:14:37,123 --> 01:14:39,373
(growling)

965
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:48,463
- Turn around!

966
01:14:57,714 --> 01:14:59,964
- Can you guys get me here?

967
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:05,297
- [Mary] Can I get some help, please?

968
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:06,476
- Pretty awesome, Michael.

969
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:07,309
- Thanks.

970
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:18,914
- Quick, tie her up.

971
01:15:21,012 --> 01:15:24,679
You won't be needing
this anymore, Mercedes.

972
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:34,310
- Okay, let's go, there's not much time.

973
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:42,060
(soft enchanting music)

974
01:15:46,686 --> 01:15:47,858
- [Mary] She looks beautiful.

975
01:15:47,858 --> 01:15:48,775
- I'll say.

976
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:55,947
- Hey, stud, here's a big
moment, don't blow it.

977
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:01,650
- Please, I don't do well under pressure.

978
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:04,817
(soft peaceful music)

979
01:16:44,451 --> 01:16:45,936
(laughing)

980
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,629
- What a dream I was having.

981
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:52,046
There was a witch, and a necklace, and...

982
01:16:55,632 --> 01:16:56,465
But...

983
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:01,978
Where am I?

984
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:04,282
- We're not in Kansas
anymore, that's for sure.

985
01:17:04,282 --> 01:17:06,782
- Dreams aren't overlooked on.

986
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,176
- I don't see why we just
don't leave her here.

987
01:17:21,176 --> 01:17:23,392
It's not like she's gonna be missed.

988
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:26,468
- We are going back,
Flo, same way we came in.

989
01:17:26,468 --> 01:17:29,629
- And how exactly did we come in?

990
01:17:29,629 --> 01:17:32,191
- You remember Space Mountain, right?

991
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:33,108
Same thing.

992
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,061
- Oh!

993
01:17:39,061 --> 01:17:42,293
- Listen to me, it's very important.

994
01:17:42,293 --> 01:17:47,059
The amulet you carry must be
destroyed, smashed into pieces.

995
01:17:47,059 --> 01:17:50,230
It's the only way to
destroy the evil spirits.

996
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:53,482
- She's really freaking me
out here, can we just go?

997
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:54,615
- Hey!

998
01:17:54,615 --> 01:17:57,365
(light neighing)

999
01:18:01,312 --> 01:18:03,229
- It must be destroyed!

1000
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:07,516
Must be destroyed!

1001
01:18:16,382 --> 01:18:17,215
- Oh, oh.

1002
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,983
- Hey, hey guys.

1003
01:18:32,081 --> 01:18:34,218
Come on, untie me, huh?

1004
01:18:34,218 --> 01:18:36,722
I mean, what's a little
joke among friends, right?

1005
01:18:36,722 --> 01:18:38,266
- Friends?

1006
01:18:38,266 --> 01:18:41,266
- Yeah, you know, you guys are cool.

1007
01:18:44,341 --> 01:18:45,853
You're like the coolest
kids in school now.

1008
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:48,429
All right, so, come on, what do you say?

1009
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:52,197
- Sorry, Mercedes, you're not our type.

1010
01:18:52,197 --> 01:18:53,030
- What?

1011
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:58,628
You losers better untie me, now!

1012
01:19:00,509 --> 01:19:04,351
Don't you realize there is
two years left of school.

1013
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:07,051
I will make those the most
miserable years of your life!

1014
01:19:07,051 --> 01:19:10,184
(screaming)

1015
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:11,182
Get back here!

1016
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:12,568
Come back here!

1017
01:19:12,568 --> 01:19:14,068
- Dawn, the stone!

1018
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:21,294
(loud banging)

1019
01:19:21,294 --> 01:19:23,115
- You have something of mine, girl.

1020
01:19:23,115 --> 01:19:24,282
Give it to me!

1021
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:35,228
I swear, it's always the kids!

1022
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,086
To think, 100 years I have
to deal with little brats

1023
01:19:37,086 --> 01:19:40,169
trying to (mumbles).

1024
01:19:42,938 --> 01:19:44,914
Don't make me take it from you, dear,

1025
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:47,135
because I will take it!

1026
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:49,003
- You'll never get this from me.

1027
01:19:49,003 --> 01:19:49,920
- So be it.

1028
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,856
(screaming)

1029
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:01,131
(deep dramatic music)

1030
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:10,202
- Go Dawn.

1031
01:20:13,431 --> 01:20:16,431
- It's working, don't give up, Dawn.

1032
01:20:23,053 --> 01:20:26,470
(mumbles) come on, Dawn.

1033
01:20:40,756 --> 01:20:44,756
- Oh, those little brats,
where did they get to?

1034
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:48,399
(crazy laughing)

1035
01:20:59,676 --> 01:21:01,627
(laughing)

1036
01:21:01,627 --> 01:21:02,627
- You did it!

1037
01:21:02,627 --> 01:21:03,627
- No, we did it!

1038
01:21:03,627 --> 01:21:04,979
- Everyone have time for the dance?

1039
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:05,812
- Let's go.

1040
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:09,645
- Wait, there's something
we have to do first.

1041
01:21:12,807 --> 01:21:15,640
(slow soft music)

1042
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,875
Let's make a circle.

1043
01:21:51,978 --> 01:21:54,978
(loud wind gushing)

1044
01:22:09,076 --> 01:22:11,826
(light giggling)

1045
01:22:13,593 --> 01:22:16,722
Thanks, guys, for waking me.

1046
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:18,340
- You sure are a heavy sleeper.

1047
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:21,922
- Yeah, next time try
staying in this dimension.

1048
01:22:21,922 --> 01:22:24,043
- Come on, guys, let's go dance.

1049
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,856
We can make it if we hurry.

1050
01:22:26,856 --> 01:22:29,230
- Dawn, couldn't you just--

1051
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,776
- No, I like it the old fashioned way.

1052
01:22:31,776 --> 01:22:33,300
I'm hanging up my broom.

1053
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,299
Now, let's go.

1054
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:36,892
- I fought a dragon today,
I'm not running anywhere.

1055
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:37,725
Wait up.

1056
01:22:39,546 --> 01:22:42,629
(fast dancing music)

1057
01:23:06,692 --> 01:23:09,775
(slow sensual music)

1058
01:23:54,689 --> 01:23:58,277
- You didn't think I'd
stand you up, did you?

1059
01:23:58,277 --> 01:24:00,262
- I didn't think you said yes.

1060
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:02,490
- I'm saying yes now.

1061
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,323
Dance?

1062
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:05,344
- Sure.

1063
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:10,001
(slow sensual music)

1064
01:24:31,219 --> 01:24:33,388
- Thanks for asking me.

1065
01:24:33,388 --> 01:24:35,555
(mumbles)

1066
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:42,403
You're a real prince, you know that?

1067
01:24:42,403 --> 01:24:45,515
- I don't know I'm really
classified as a prince.

1068
01:24:45,515 --> 01:24:47,440
(mumbles)

1069
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,214
- Well, it counts in my book.

1070
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:53,381
Who needs Leonardo Decaprio (mumbles).

1071
01:24:54,615 --> 01:24:56,698
- That dream, it was you?

1072
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:03,851
(slow relaxing music)

1073
01:25:20,735 --> 01:25:24,568
Hey, what (mumbles) Mercedes?

1074
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:34,709
(loud banging)

1075
01:25:42,394 --> 01:25:45,227
(dark slow music)

1076
01:26:01,205 --> 01:26:03,084
- Nice dress.

1077
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:05,293
- Who dressed you this
morning, Calvin Klein?

1078
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:07,543
(laughing)

1079
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:16,927
- Hey.

1080
01:26:33,746 --> 01:26:36,845
Where are the cool people,
you know, the cheerleaders?

1081
01:26:36,845 --> 01:26:38,877
- Cheerleaders, you mean
chess club, don't you?

1082
01:26:38,877 --> 01:26:41,992
(simple rhythmic music)
