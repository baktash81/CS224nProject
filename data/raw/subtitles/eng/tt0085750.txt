1
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,913
Come on, slow poke!
Come on!

2
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,615
Don't lean forward!
Don't lean forward!

3
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,347
Come on, Overman.
Give us a break, will you?

4
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,722
Look at the clown
in the jockey shorts!

5
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,428
Kelly, come on.
Pay attention.

6
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,559
Hey, girls!

7
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,775
Do it like this!

8
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,326
Damn it, Kelly!
Do the job!

9
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,029
Next time we're goin' all
the way into the lagoon.

10
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,992
The lagoon is my favorite!

11
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,789
Damn boat.
I flooded the...

12
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,750
Damn boat!

13
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,256
Come on, Richie.
I got a date tonight!

14
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,341
Come on, baby.

15
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,140
Okay, guys, here we go.

16
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
Oh! That's right. Good.

17
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,956
You've been chosen as
teammates for your neatness,

18
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,255
courtesy toward others and above
all, your Southern grace.

19
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,503
We enforce our dress code here,

20
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,051
so keep your hair
and nails trimmed.

21
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,629
And, please,
don't alter your costumes.

22
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,716
Once you've been fitted with
your Sea World guide apparel,

23
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,468
the shorts are short enough.

24
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,897
Show any cheek and you'll be
back shovelin' French fries-

25
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:12,279
Now, let's continue with our welcome
speech again. All together now.

26
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,356
Welcome to Sea World,

27
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,363
the world's largest
marine life park.

28
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:23,161
Above and below the surface of
our unique Undersea Kingdom...

29
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,959
The park officially
opens on Saturday.

30
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,629
All this week has been, and
continues to be, preview week,

31
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,584
during which family and friends
attend Sea World as our guests.

32
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,670
This is the Undersea Kingdom,

33
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,849
four years under construction, at
a cost of more than $34 million.

34
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,394
Four pressurized viewing tunnels
radiate out into the lagoon.

35
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,814
There's the Sunken Spanish
Galleon, Jonah's Marine Fun House,

36
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,770
the Deepwater Coral Forest, all
connected to the hub, Central Control.

37
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,030
And a deluxe restaurant
and cocktail lounge,

38
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,073
all 40 feet below the surface.

39
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,781
The whole complex is built
in our manmade lagoon,

40
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,613
which is connected to the open
ocean by a deepwater channel.

41
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,407
The new additions to Sea World
are the brainchild

42
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,834
of entrepreneur Calvin Bouchard.

43
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,132
Hi, guys!

44
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,051
Now you can close the gate.

45
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,655
Jesus!

46
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,118
Overman, I thought you said
those tracks were secure.

47
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,790
Hey guys, I welded
the damn thing myself.

48
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,080
Something's hung the gate up.

49
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,003
Better get Mike Brody out here.
Boy, is he gonna be pissed.

50
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,835
<i>Whom!</i>

51
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,259
Here's the lagoon.
Set up for the turn.

52
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,637
I call your attention
to the Sea World skiers,

53
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,259
who are about to
enter the lagoon

54
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,717
in a preview of the
opening day ceremonies.

55
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,180
Here come my pride and joy.

56
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,059
Are we gonna get
a chance to talk to Mr. Bouchard?

57
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,312
- Beautiful. Just beautiful!
- Hi!

58
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,447
We would, however, like to
avoid references to his colorful past.

59
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,701
Did the Undersea Kingdom
really cost $30 million?

60
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,203
Aren't those kids great?

61
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,786
Mr. Bouchard, is there anything
speciai goin' on openin' day?

62
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,497
Well, this afternoon,
at the main gate,

63
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,127
we'll be pleased to announce

64
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,801
the welcomin' of
Mr. Philip FitzRoyce.

65
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,795
Oh, really? Is that true?

66
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,599
No lie, boys and girls. He gonna be here.
Now, we got drinks at the bar.

67
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,017
They free. Come on,
follow me.

68
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,284
Overman, what's it look like?

69
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,309
It's off the track.

70
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,394
How'd that happen?

71
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,646
I can't tell, but she is jammed.

72
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,699
Just wouldn't close, Mike.

73
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,159
Now what are we gonna do?

74
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,326
Oh, boy.

75
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,546
Somethin' knocked the
son-of-a-bitch right off the track.

76
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,073
Well, look. Just secure
the damn gate, all right?

77
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,697
Think you can handle that?

78
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,243
On overtime, maybe.

79
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,253
Straight time maybe?
You got enough overtime.

80
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,418
Your party.
You buy the beer, Brody.

81
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,716
Well, look, you're in charge.

82
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,836
See you guys later. I got
more important things to do-

83
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,383
No overtime.

84
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,385
Okay. See you, Mike.

85
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,802
No overtime!

86
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,807
No overtime!

87
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,874
Hi, Mike.

88
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,757
Oh. Ah. Hey, Dan.
Hey.

89
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,841
Havin' gate problems?

90
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,642
The dolphins tried
to open them again.

91
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,719
Where's the boss?

92
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,849
She's up with Shamu.

93
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,145
Thanks.

94
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,478
Come on, Cindy.

95
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,150
Come on, Sandy. Come on.

96
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
Hey, Liz.

97
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,986
Hey. Come on.

98
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,735
It's the boss hard hat.
Where's your boots?

99
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,162
I only wear 'em to bed
and in the shower.

100
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,490
Where's Kay?
She's down that way.

101
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,343
<i>Yea-haw.!</i>

102
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,255
Ride 'em, cowgirl.

103
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,391
Hi, Mike!
Hey!

104
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,902
I'll be with you
in a minute, darlin'.

105
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,018
All right.

106
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,642
Use your spurs.

107
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,016
Hey, Liz!

108
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,442
Good boy. That was nice!

109
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,201
Hey.
Hey!

110
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,037
Liz, he did that great.
I don't wanna do it again.

111
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,497
Do me a favor.

112
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,501
Put Cindy and Sandy in the lagoon for
a run, okay? They're getting fat.

113
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,668
Okay.

114
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>How you dam"?
Great.</i>

115
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,177
Hey, you. Come here.

116
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,724
Come here, kiddo.
That's the feeding place.

117
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,975
Is this whale
house-broken yet?

118
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,476
Nope.

119
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,808
Then he can't come to dinner.

120
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,016
You takin' me to dinner?

121
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,023
Yeah, soon <i>as</i> we
pick up my brother.

122
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,729
When's Sean coming?

123
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,207
He's on a park shuttle. We're
gonna meet him at the main gate.

124
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,323
Hey, Kathy.

125
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,656
Cindy and Sandy don't wanna go.

126
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,381
What, am I gonna lose you to
a couple of neurotic fish?

127
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,783
Mammals.
Mammals. Mammals.

128
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,834
Something seems
to be bugging 'em.

129
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,411
Well, listen.
It's their play time.

130
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,418
If they don't want it, they'll be
beggin' us tomorrow. Put 'em up.

131
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,544
You got it.

132
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,915
I'm begging you tonight.

133
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,835
You don't have to beg.

134
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,170
So take me to dinner!

135
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,096
All right. Let's try sushi.

136
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,765
Mike!
I'll change.

137
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,018
Come here.
Who's a good boy?

138
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,688
Are you a good boy?
Yes, you're a good boy.

139
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,515
And you get a fish.

140
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,191
Ladies and
gentlemen, here he is now.

141
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,778
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Philip
FitzRoyce, with a capital

142
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,954
is here to film us, meet our
resident day scientific staff.

143
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,422
Hey, what's this?
Oh, no.

144
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,583
Philip the Great.

145
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,552
I am, of course, able to combine
business with pleasure,

146
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,428
which, they tell me, is the
secret to a long and happy life.

147
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,224
What, FitzRoyce?

148
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,643
Mmm.

149
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,349
Sure is.

150
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,270
And now, ladies and gentlemen, any further
questions, in the bar, if you please.

151
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,829
For the first one
who buys one, right?

152
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,188
Look at Calvin. Best of buddies.
Ah, best of friends.

153
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,401
A regular Barnum and Bailey.

154
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,155
I'm sure they'll
be very happy together.

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,782
Perfect.
Mmm-hmm.

156
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,989
Into the Undersea
Kingdom they go.

157
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,408
Hey, Mikey!

158
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,252
<i>Hey. new Hey'
om!</i>

159
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,829
How you doin'?
All right!

160
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,081
My brother, the cowboy.

161
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,791
Hey! Hug me, huh?

162
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,421
Oh, Okay.
Hey.

163
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,056
You put on weight, you need a
shave and you're too tall.

164
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,509
Well, two out of three
I can fix.

165
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,391
Get that gear and let's go.
Come on.

166
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,351
So, nice boots.

167
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,932
Thanks! Aw, gee.

168
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,608
I can't even believe I did that.

169
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,027
How'd you do on your finals?

170
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,276
Great. A gentleman's an
incomplete, but I aced Phys. Ed.

171
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,355
A real Einstein.

172
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,025
Glad you're here, buddy.

173
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,997
There you go, Charlene.

174
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,881
Shelby showed up yet?

175
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,674
Haven't seen him.

176
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,382
What are they doing?

177
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,088
Kelly's really
gettin' this one down.

178
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,641
See that big guy over there? He
gets knocked on his <i>ass</i> every night.

179
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,644
All right, Charlene.
All right!

180
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,444
Here, let me help you out.
Work with me, work with me.

181
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,611
Let's go.

182
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,064
There we go.
Wait. One more.

183
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,446
Hey, Mike.
All right. Yeah?

184
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,493
Is Shelby workin' overtime?

185
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,492
Not on my say-so. He was supposed to
knock off with the rest of the guys.

186
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,244
Have you met my kid brother?

187
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,623
If he's messin' around with that little
bitch down at the souvenir stand,

188
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,044
it's gonna be his ass.

189
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,292
You tell him.

190
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,590
Charlene, I'm not his mother.

191
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,757
You're his boss.

192
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,676
Yeah, ask Woodbury, okay?

193
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,009
Come on, Kelly.
You can do it!

194
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,227
Hey, they're
playing stand-off.

195
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,303
Uh-Oh.

196
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,108
My brother considers himself to be the
stand-off champion of New England.

197
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,059
And the western states.

198
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,732
Go get 'em.

199
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,113
Hey, I wasn't ready!

200
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,413
I tell you,
it's a game of balance.

201
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,782
I told you he'd fall on his ass.

202
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,918
Hey, who's this guy?

203
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,125
This is for beers.
You buyin'?

204
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,384
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

205
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,107
My fly's open.

206
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,196
No fair!

207
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,572
<i>Whom!</i>

208
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,403
Well, it's, uh,

209
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,286
not only a game of balance,
it's a game of deception.

210
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,710
Come on, I'll buy you two
for the one you owe me.

211
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,588
Okay.
All right.

212
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,415
All right.

213
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,671
See you later, Kelly.

214
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,254
Hey, I want you. Come on,
right now! Let's go.

215
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,260
Kathryn, Mike.

216
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,512
Hi.
Hi.

217
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,592
You know each other?

218
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,473
I see my brother nailed you, eh?

219
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,222
Your brother? Yeah,
believe it or not.

220
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,950
If he wouldn't have pulled that old
crotch trick, he never would have won-

221
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,100
That's his best move.

222
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,811
Runs in the family.

223
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,646
Well, it worked.

224
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,730
What are we drinkin'?

225
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,941
Champagne of
the working classes.

226
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,409
Beer. And you
owe me a couple.

227
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,862
<i>That's fight.
Comm' up.</i>

228
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,414
Two beers. So, you work
at the park, huh'?

229
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,116
Mmm-hmm.
I'm a water skier.

230
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh.

231
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,579
Your brother's cute.

232
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:22,463
Yeah. Him and Kathryn have, uh, been
together for a year and a half.

233
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,711
How about you?

234
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,672
Desperately unattached.

235
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,058
Lonely, confused.

236
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,564
Generous and loving to a fault.
It's all in my eyes.

237
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,893
- Come On.
- MAN 23 Okay.

238
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,478
We'll cop a lot of
good stuff tonight.

239
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,063
I've got the tanks.

240
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,276
Shh!

241
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,073
Is the van okay here?

242
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,650
Yes, it's okay.

243
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,203
We're off Sea World property.
Nobody uses this road.

244
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,034
Shh!

245
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,286
Yeah.

246
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,213
All right.

247
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,253
Yeah.

248
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,427
Climb over the fence, and
take it easy with the raft.

249
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,384
Damn it!

250
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,096
You asshole.

251
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,473
Now we gotta drag it all
the way down to the water!

252
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,346
Ready to go?

253
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,603
Okay. Who's payin'?

254
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,446
Ah.

255
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,207
Watch out. Snakes.

256
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,459
Oh, come on.
Don't bullshit me.

257
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,006
Chicken, huh?

258
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,845
All right, steady.

259
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,892
Steady.
Got it.

260
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,849
Okay. Here we go.

261
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,726
Come on, paddle!

262
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,901
I am.

263
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,734
Let's go out to the center.

264
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,241
I sure hope this is worth it.

265
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,288
Hey, Kelly, is this your car?

266
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,415
Sure is.

267
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,922
Hey. Get off of there!

268
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,839
You wanna take a walk? Yeah.

269
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,137
Hey, what about baby brother?

270
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,555
Aww!
Aww!

271
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,925
Little baby brother.

272
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,262
Kelly, can you give him a ride
home, or shall I call his mommy?

273
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,768
Nah, if he'll come quietly.

274
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,645
No way. I scream and shout.

275
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,144
Oh, God, it stinks out here.
Let's get away!

276
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,524
See ya.

277
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,355
Hey, let's go swimming.

278
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,860
No, I hate the ocean.

279
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,944
Aww! Hey, I've got
a better idea.

280
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,278
Like lagoons?

281
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,658
Lagoons?

282
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,827
Lagoons.

283
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,506
Oh. How come Sean
doesn't visit more?

284
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,552
He hates the water.
What?

285
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,976
Yeah. Remember that shark attack I told
you about when we were kids in Amity?

286
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,014
Well, that's why he goes
to school in Colorado.

287
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,066
If our parents didn't live on an island,
I don't think he'd ever get wet.

288
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,485
My dad, he's the same way.

289
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,944
God, I love this place.

290
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,527
I hated it when
we first came here.

291
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,992
What's the matter?

292
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,584
Did you get a telephone call?

293
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,838
Venezuela?

294
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,218
Guess I'm gonna have to
start learning Spanish.

295
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,263
Ooh, baby.
Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,596
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.

297
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,386
Oh, shit.

298
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,015
Reality.

299
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,018
How long?

300
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,153
Just a short year and a half.

301
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,740
I'd love you to come, you know.

302
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,370
Yeah.

303
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,369
But what about the six
months I've got left here

304
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,922
and the job opening up
at the Scripps Institute?

305
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,297
What about that? Huh?

306
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,050
Simple. Just give up
your life and follow me.

307
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,352
Oh, I'm happy
for you. lam.

308
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,724
I know you are.

309
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,687
What are we gonna do?

310
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,233
A-ha.
Mm-hmm.

311
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,606
Come on.

312
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,101
Oh, I don't go in the water.

313
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,436
You don't swim?

314
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,397
Not even with friends?

315
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:41,570
Oh, uh, lswim.
I just, uh, <i>I... I...</i>

316
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,539
It's something that
happened when I was a kid.

317
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,037
I just, I don't go in the water.

318
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,794
I bet I can overcome
your childhood fears.

319
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,299
I bet you can.

320
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,310
Come on.

321
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,602
My boots!

322
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,188
Kick 'em off, cowboy.

323
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,909
Kelly!

324
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,659
Come on in, Sean.
It's fun.

325
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,826
Come on.

326
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,416
Here?

327
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,997
Yeah, okay.

328
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,878
Somewhere down there
is the best coral.

329
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,211
A guy in Miami will give us
$200 for the good stuff.

330
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,886
Put it in the basket.
I'll pull it up.

331
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,197
Come on, hurry, Randy.

332
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,176
I love this park at night.
It's so deserted.

333
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,632
Yeah. So quiet.

334
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,184
Wait a second.
Isn't that Kelly's car?

335
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,887
Stop, stop, stop.
Shh! Wait a second.

336
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,897
Stop.

337
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,730
Shh.

338
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,850
I don't believe it.

339
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,268
She got him in the water.

340
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,597
Never underestimate
the power, huh?

341
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:34,584
<i>Attention. You, in the water. You are
trespassing on Sea World property.</i>

342
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,538
<i>Come out of the water with your
hands raised high above your head.</i>

343
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,499
I'm okay.
My brother works here.

344
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,301
Uh, I'm Kelly Ann Bukowski,
from the ski team.

345
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,637
<i>You turkeys have any ID?</i>

346
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,466
Wait a minute.

347
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,893
Mike? Kay?
Brother?

348
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,179
<i>Mr. Bullhorn sees all,
knows all!</i>

349
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,060
<i>Dead is what you are!</i>

350
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,392
<i>You keep your hands
to yourself, young</i> m...

351
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,855
Here, take this.

352
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,280
Yell for mother!

353
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,496
Finish up down there, damn it!

354
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,414
Come on, Randy.
We gotta get out of here!

355
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,584
Now what?

356
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,168
Ow!

357
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,679
Mike!

358
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,233
You cheater!

359
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,291
That's what
you are! Dead!

360
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,673
Some guys can sleep in
in the morning.

361
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,968
Some of us have to be at work early.
Good morning.

362
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,968
Some of us don't have to baby-sit a
park full of slugs and fishes either.

363
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,392
Yes, we just live like slugs and fishes.
Good morning, Maggie.

364
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,641
The dog does not eat on the counter.

365
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,399
I put your wet clothes
in the dryer, sweetie.

366
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,977
Thanks.
Mmm. What are we eating?

367
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,905
Mmm. Thank you.

368
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,238
Hey, is this my beeper
or your beeper?

369
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,677
I don't know.
I'll use this beeper.

370
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,578
Use that beeper.

371
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,655
Talk to you later.

372
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,365
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper.

373
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,450
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper back.

374
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,500
Bye.
See you later.

375
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,420
Aye.

376
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
Coffee?

377
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,264
Just throw it in my eyes,
it'll work faster.

378
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,233
Yeah, well that's what happens
when you stay up all night

379
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,351
workin' out your
childhood phobias.

380
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,520
That's right. Make fun
of your baby brother.

381
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,020
But I was this close to doing
it in the water last night,

382
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,816
and that's a first.

383
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,936
This close, huh?
Shut up!

384
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,733
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
know it was therapy-

385
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,906
Just admit it.
You messed me up.

386
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,783
I admit it.
I messed you up.

387
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,500
Is everything all right
between you and Kathryn?

388
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,793
Hello?

389
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,913
Yes, sir.

390
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,961
Calvin, I had my crew
on that yesterday.

391
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,555
Well, I know. I don't want
that to happen either.

392
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,091
Tomorrow.

393
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,388
Okay, Okay. Calvin,
I'll be right there.

394
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,723
The boss, right?

395
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,687
I gotta go to work.

396
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,818
Yeah, can't do better than that!
Really.

397
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,486
Yeah. Yeah!

398
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,992
Who's a good girl?
That's my baby.

399
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,661
Kay?

400
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,914
How are Cindy and Sandy?

401
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,663
Well, Cindy's okay,
but Sandy's still nervous.

402
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,335
Don't quit, Danny.
He can go higher.

403
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,849
That's it!

404
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,062
Okay, girls.
There are my girls.

405
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,732
Thank you. Come on.
Ready and go!

406
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,689
That's it.

407
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,982
What is this? You ready?
I said go!

408
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,406
If those are the best behaviors,
I'd hate to see the worst.

409
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,115
May I help you?

410
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,284
Are you looking for somebody?

411
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,837
No, I don't think you can. I'm
looking for someone in authority.

412
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,633
Well, I'm Dr. Morgan,
the senior biologist.

413
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,796
Oh.

414
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,549
Really?

415
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,388
Charming. Philip FitzRoyce.

416
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,219
I know you.
I know your work.

417
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,477
We were at that Law of the Sea
Conference together last summer.

418
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,526
Oh yes, that's right. Helsinki.
Save the Whales.

419
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,943
They made a hero out of me.

420
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,272
Yeah, you know what
I never understood?

421
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,073
Why did you ram
that Japanese whaler?

422
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,495
Because he got in
my way, ruined my best shot.

423
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,577
Yeah. I was impressed.

424
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:31,248
Good. Then perhaps we can have a
drink and some dinner tonight?

425
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,465
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. FitzRoyce, but,
that's a behavior I just don't do-

426
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,386
Nice spins, Danny. I'll meet
you at the holding tank.

427
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,313
HEY. aqua girl!

428
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,640
Hi, Mike!

429
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,433
Five.

430
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,747
He don't sleep in,
he don't live in.

431
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,163
Tell Shelby Overman for me
he can take a flyin' leap

432
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,291
at a rollin' doughnut on a
gravel driveway, you hear?

433
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,124
Hold it just a second. Didn't
he come home last night?

434
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,296
He didn't show up here either.
No.

435
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,593
I figure he's home hung over.

436
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,888
I tell you, the man's trash, and I
don't want him around my place!

437
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,136
He's gone.
You take his stuff.

438
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,468
Charlene, what's goin' on, huh?

439
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,302
Shelby Overman's AWOL again.

440
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,309
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

441
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,698
What, is this all his stuff?

442
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,975
Yeah. Doesn't figure.

443
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,695
He left his passport and his...
And his credit cards.

444
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,740
Driver's license, pawn tickets.

445
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,239
I don't think he could have
been planning to go too far.

446
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,837
You don't think
something happened to him?

447
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,422
I mean, wouldn't the
police have called...

448
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,451
No. No, look. He is curled
up, drunk someplace.

449
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,003
And when I find him,
he's in deep trouble.

450
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,264
Don't you worry. We'll let you
know as soon as we hear anything.

451
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,288
Wanna help me out?

452
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,833
Yeah. Take care, Charlene.

453
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,435
Help me look in the lagoon?

454
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,585
You bet.

455
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,048
Hey, I'm mad at that old boy,
but I don't mean him any harm.

456
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,010
You hear me?
I don't mean him any harm!

457
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,601
Down a little more.

458
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,360
Turn it.

459
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,574
Batteries are
fully charged, Mike.

460
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,651
Thank you, Danny.

461
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,077
Thanks, Danny.

462
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,747
Control room, submersible
is now entering the lagoon.

463
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,793
Roger. I can monitor
it from here.

464
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:34,995
<i>Thank you.</i>

465
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,878
<i>Testing, one,
two, three-Can you read me, Kay?</i>

466
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,335
<i>I read you.
Communication's fine.</i>

467
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,884
<i>For Charlene's sake,
I sure hope he's all right.</i>

468
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,686
<i>There's Cindy or Sandy?</i>

469
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,642
<i>I don't know how
to tell them apart.</i>

470
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,899
<i>KAY". Cindy's a lot larger.</i>

471
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,539
<i>Control, this is Venture One.</i>

472
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,875
<i>We're at 25 feet, headed
for the Spanish Galleon.</i>

473
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,089
I can see you now.
Hi, Mike.

474
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,732
<i>Overman broke divers' rules
last night, out there.</i>

475
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,408
<i>Went down to shackle
the sea gate alone.</i>

476
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,954
<i>If anything happened to him, the ocean
current would have washed him up here,</i>

477
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,077
<i>toward the center of the lagoon.</i>

478
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,040
<i>What about the filtration pipes?</i>

479
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,286
<i>No, it's too strong</i> a
<i>current moving the other way.</i>

480
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,957
See, <i>the flow's all
into the lagoon.</i>

481
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,010
<i>There's a million gallons of
fresh salt water every hour.</i>

482
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,053
<i>You think he could have gotten
trapped in the Spanish Galleon?</i>

483
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,479
<i>He could have gotten
caught in the superstructure.</i>

484
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,478
<i>Would have kept him
from floating topside.</i>

485
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,977
<i>Mike! Oh, God.
For a second I thought...</i>

486
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,697
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know it.
We call him Oscar.</i>

487
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,331
<i>You stay here, Kay. I'll go into the
galleon and take a closer look.</i>

488
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,041
<i>Uh-uh, Mike.
I'm goin' with you.</i>

489
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,598
<i>Goddamn dolphins! What
the hell are they doing?</i>

490
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,847
<i>I don't know. They've been
acting strange for the last two days.</i>

491
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,811
<i>Look at 'em.</i>

492
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,486
<i>Control, we're leaving the sub.</i>

493
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,238
<i>We'll be out of radio contact.</i>

494
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,615
Read you,
Dr. Morgan.

495
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,867
<i>Grab your ABS bottles,
Kay. Let's go.</i>

496
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,619
<i>KAY". Okay, sweetie.</i>

497
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,090
- Go!
- Go!

498
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,283
Mike! Quick! Mike!

499
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,094
The gate! Get the gate!
Shark!

500
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,012
God! Vvhat' s happening?

501
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,477
Close, damn it! Close!

502
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,567
Shit!

503
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,439
Oh, God! Are you okay?
What the hell was that?

504
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,657
Yeah! What is that?
You okay?

505
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,535
My guv'nor's
the 16th Earl of Haddenfield.

506
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,031
Shake hands with the first
Calvin of Sea World.

507
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,249
<i>Enchante. Enchante. He
Know French too, huh'?</i>

508
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,544
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Mr. Bouchard...

509
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,462
Wait a minute.
We're havin' dinner here.

510
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,380
This better be important.
It is, sir.

511
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,380
Mike and Dr. Morgan
were pursued by a renegade shark

512
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,460
that got into our lagoon.

513
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,096
It is important, gentlemen.
Better come with me.

514
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,975
Believe me, Calvin,
it was a great white.

515
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,895
It was about ten feet long, it was
exhibiting a typical feeding pattern.

516
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,059
On us, Calvin!

517
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,703
The damn thing tried to feed on us.
Exacfly.

518
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,149
Now look.
Where is it?

519
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,481
Right here.

520
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,944
Huh?

521
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,906
You know, Cal, this
could be a stroke of luck.

522
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,118
If we kill this beastie
on camera,

523
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,496
I can guarantee you
media coverage.

524
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,001
Lure him into a staging area,

525
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,258
and at the precise moment,
slit his belly wide open.

526
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,423
Can you do that?

527
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,760
You try and stop him, mate.

528
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,186
That's how we earn our bread.

529
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,775
Well, Jack is oversimplifying
matters, as is usual.

530
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,400
But, yeah, I can do that.

531
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,231
- No!
- No?

532
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,108
What do you mean, no?

533
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,869
Well, I don't know if it's
occurred to any of you all,

534
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,074
but there isn't a great white
alive in captivity anywhere.

535
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,410
Now, we're unique here,
Calvin, you know that.

536
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,246
If any facility can
maintain a white, it's us.

537
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,175
If we could dart him, tranquilize him,
we could get him in a holding tank...

538
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,925
Hold it! This is crazy,
this is nuts.

539
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,140
White sharks are killers.
I know 'em.

540
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,760
My father, my brother, myself.

541
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,354
They're murderers. No, Kay.

542
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,059
Calvin, they die magnificently.

543
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,904
That would really be a spectacular event.
No doubt about that, huh?

544
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,118
What are we doing, Calvin,
planning a network special?

545
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,535
Don't you realize that we could
be the first people on the planet

546
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,620
to have a great white alive.

547
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,173
Not if my guv'nor
gets it first, miss.

548
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,469
Okay. Say he kills it.
Well, that's it.

549
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,175
It's one shot, over, gone.

550
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,552
But a live great white. Now,
you think about that, Calvin!

551
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:33,102
Nightly bulletins on the
progress of the killer shark.

552
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,860
Pictures of us nursing it
back to health

553
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,357
and lowering it
into a holding tank.

554
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,154
Now, that's world news!

555
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,690
Think of the lines at the gate.

556
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,451
Then you miss
the sport of the kill.

557
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,995
Now, wait up, Jack.
Wait up.

558
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,370
<i>Killing is guaranteed press.</i>

559
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,952
<i>But this other is much,
much more interesting.</i>

560
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,132
Okay,
this is MS-222.

561
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,975
This is quinaldine, but I had
to guesstimate the dosage.

562
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,226
Kathy?

563
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,479
Right. Thanks, Danny.

564
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,983
All right, we're ready
in Control. You all set?

565
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,984
<i>We're ready down here.</i>

566
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,536
Well, with those
TV monitors rolling,

567
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,673
you're gonna have more coverage
than a space launch around here.

568
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,995
Good. Just the way I like it.
Right.

569
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,122
The color of your wet suit's
one hell of a choice.

570
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,544
The shark's gonna love you.

571
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,916
Exactly.

572
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,543
It helps me
get the close-ups.

573
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,874
You're the showman.

574
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,047
Honey, you think this
suit's gonna protect you?

575
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,562
Are you kidding?
Have you felt the...

576
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,430
It won't bite through,
but it will yield to pressure.

577
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,929
So she might just get
a little squeeze.

578
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,185
Oh, that's great news. Look,
why do you have to do this?

579
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,894
Why don't you let Her Majesty's
number one son take care of it, huh?

580
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,229
Because it's my job, remember?

581
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,363
Yeah, but I just don't
want it to be you.

582
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:10,242
Look, you build all the stuff, I swim
around in it. That was the deal. Right?

583
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,411
Hmm?

584
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,707
I love you, too.

585
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,967
If we get into any trouble, all
we have to do is pull the pin.

586
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,300
- What are those?
- Mills bombs.

587
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,723
What?
Mills bombs, sonny.

588
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,928
Grenades. A chap in Her Majesty's
ordnance makes them up for rne.

589
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,977
<i>Baby claymores-
Good horizontal dispersion.</i>

590
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,855
<i>Some concussion. A bit rough on the
eardrums, but they do the trick.</i>

591
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,403
Well, not in my water.
Take 'em off.

592
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,314
You tend to your knitting, my
dear, and I shall tend to mine.

593
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,866
Hold it.
Hold on a second there.

594
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,990
There's not gonna be
any explosives underwater.

595
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,492
There's acrylic down there,
it's a very fragile environment.

596
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,993
There's no bombs.

597
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,116
<i>Look, Brody, I do inderstand.
This is insurance...</i>

598
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,877
<i>No, I don't think you
understood me here, FitzRoyce!</i>

599
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,981
<i>I spent two years building this
park, and I'm not gonna see</i>

600
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,542
<i>some visiting fireman with
a homemade bomb blow it up</i>

601
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,065
<i>just because he wants
to kill a fish!</i>

602
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,760
Calvin, are you
listening to all this?

603
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,433
No grenades.

604
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,273
For Christ's sake, guv'nor.
Remember Australia?

605
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,395
Oh, don't worry, Jack.

606
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,773
After all, it's only
a little fish.

607
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,483
Son of a...

608
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,190
The pin has to be pulled.

609
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,947
Right. Get rid
of this stuff.

610
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,779
Everybody aboard here?
Let's get going.

611
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,533
Shove off.

612
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,639
<i>I need one clean belly shot.</i>

613
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,643
<i>If I miss on the first pass,
I'm gonna have to reload</i>

614
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,723
<i>and just hope I get him
with the second dart.</i>

615
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,064
This is a good place to start.

616
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,069
Hit the lights.

617
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,954
Shall we dance?

618
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,581
Yeah, why not? I'm beginning to feel
like King Richard going to the Crusades.

619
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,087
Ready, Jack?
Get the gear.

620
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,222
<i>Brown bread, guvnor.</i>

621
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,976
You all right?

622
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,428
Good luck.

623
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,566
You know you only get one shot.

624
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,743
Yeah, I know.
I know.

625
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,990
What about Kathryn?

626
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,585
It'll stick in the shark. Hit
her, and it'll go right through.

627
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,542
Just buoy him up,
slow him down, right?

628
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,505
Dorsal fin, middle of the back.

629
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,013
Seen anything yet?

630
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,057
Yeah, we'll get him
on the monitors.

631
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,144
Quick! Mike,
he's making a run!

632
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,066
Quick, shoot him!

633
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,242
He's getting away!

634
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,202
Damn it!

635
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,621
Get out of the way, Kay!

636
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,539
Now!

637
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,444
Come on.

638
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,689
Right. There you go.

639
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,150
You did it, baby.
You did it.

640
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,484
Here's the ladder.
Hold on.

641
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,865
Come on.
Give me your fins.

642
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,992
Give me your fins.
Let's go!

643
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,449
Up you go.

644
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,911
You all right?

645
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,337
Close one back there.

646
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,576
Let's get this stuff off her.

647
00:47:58,626 --> 00:47:59,627
Kay, that was great!

648
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,963
What am I, a bloody porter?

649
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,593
How about a hand
with this hardware?

650
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,049
No, first things first, Jacko.

651
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,930
Mustn't ignore the ladies.

652
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,932
And don't ignore
the bleedin' help.

653
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,251
Looked pretty hairy down there.

654
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,557
You all right, Kay? For
a second, I was so worried.

655
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,018
You sure know how
to scare the hell out of me.

656
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,523
Be sure he's wrapped, okay? Keep him wet.
Let's get him in a tank.

657
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,868
<i>Film all right?
TV picture looked cloudy.</i>

658
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,908
Calvin. Kathryn's fine,
Philip is fine, Jack is fine.

659
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,288
<i>Dan and Liz are fine.
I am okay too.</i>

660
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,166
But, is the film okay?

661
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,668
It's absolutely
first-rate, Cal.

662
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,545
I think you'll be very happy.

663
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,546
Is everyone okay?

664
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,222
It did look pretty
dangerous down there.

665
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,427
Yeah, well, it looked pretty dangerous
from down here too, Calvin.

666
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,519
We may have to work him
all night, keep him moving.

667
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,644
Down, Danny. Down, down.
That's it.

668
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,831
We have to be sure the oxygen
keeps running through his gills.

669
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,823
We don't wanna lose him.

670
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,955
Close the door! Whoever you
are, this is off limits.

671
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:17,338
Liz, uh, get the hose running. I
wanna try aerating him, okay?

672
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,883
Even to me,
the fearless harpoonist?

673
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,802
Nah, you're okay.

674
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,673
Come on in, sailor.
Are you new in town?

675
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,764
Yeah. Came by to get me
a woman and a tattoo.

676
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,141
Wanna see the tattoo?

677
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,729
Well, I'd rather see the woman,
get a look at the competition.

678
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:42,230
Sorry, there isn't any other woman,
there isn't any tattoo either.

679
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,569
I'm lonely.

680
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,826
<i>I'm sorry, damn'.</i>

681
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,577
Damn mammal.

682
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,577
This one's a fish.

683
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,832
A simple, beautiful fish.

684
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,462
Okay.

685
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,596
Mike! Mike! What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

686
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,428
Liz, take a hike.
Okay.

687
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,235
If this is the only way
we can be together,

688
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,762
this is the only way
we can be together.

689
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,600
Welcome aboard, sailor. Get that
hose and hold onto it, okay?

690
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,684
Yeah. Okay.
Open the mouth.

691
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,028
Say hi to your new friend.

692
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,483
You know, this is the first time
you've ever done my work with me.

693
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,442
Yeah, well, it's a real thrill.

694
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,203
Maybe tomorrow you
can come work with me

695
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,576
and have some real excitement
help me pour foundations.

696
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,252
Get away! Get clear!
Get clear!

697
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,878
Whoa!

698
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,551
Didn't he give you any signs?

699
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,550
No! One minute
he was dead out,

700
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,302
the next minute
he was wide awake!

701
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,183
No food.
No medication.

702
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:57,476
It's the only live one in captivity, guys.
Let's keep him that way.

703
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:01,105
Huh? Don't do anything
that's gonna traumatize him.

704
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,044
<i>Ahoy, mateys. Welcome to
the opening of the Undersea Kingdom.</i>

705
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:27,673
<i>The magical mysteries of Jonah
and the Whale, the Coral Forest</i>

706
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,553
<i>and the Sunken Spanish Galleon.</i>

707
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,020
Gotcha, guv'nor!

708
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,402
It's a whale with a
brain larger than most folks,

709
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,828
able to earn beaucoup bucks
in a single bound.

710
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,701
Kay and I went down in the sub,

711
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,373
and we searched
over all this area

712
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,702
before the sharks hit us.

713
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,913
Yeah, but Mike, what if Overman went
down on the other side of the sea gate?

714
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,751
The tide might have
pulled him out,

715
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,351
but we should have had a body show
up somewhere along the coast.

716
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,795
Brody, did you check
the filtration pipe?

717
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,052
No, Calvin. The current's too
strong goin' the other way.

718
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,807
We got a million gallons of sea water
flowing into the lagoon every hour.

719
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,639
The man's irresponsible.
When he turns up, fire him.

720
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,474
Hold it, Calvin.
Hold it.

721
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,523
He's a good man. He just messes
up every once in a while.

722
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,355
I'm gonna hold
you responsible. Hmm?

723
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,948
<i>And now, she gets to ski
by herself because Patty's the best.</i>

724
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,997
How's it going, Leonard? I just
got today's first print-outs.

725
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,501
Today, our advance sales are three
times ahead of our other parks.

726
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,298
Not unexpected, Leonard.
Where's the great white now?

727
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,918
In the tank room. I want to put
him on display at pool six.

728
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,675
I wanna instruct everyone
to put all that information

729
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,677
on all the welcomes,
rest stops and wrap-ups.

730
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:58,680
But I thought we were to wait
on Dr. Morgan's word for that.

731
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,730
Look. I run the park, I sell the
tickets and I make the decisions.

732
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:04,182
Move the fish!

733
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,773
I wanna be able to stand in
line to see it before three.

734
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:13,153
Three and down,
and up, and turn.

735
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,748
<i>And now,
the Sea World water ski team</i>

736
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,459
<i>in a dazzling display of
coordination and brilliance.</i>

737
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,177
<i>The Silver Bullets!</i>

738
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,139
All right!
Lookin' good!

739
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,509
<i>There they go!</i>

740
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,273
<i>Yeah! The helicopters!</i>

741
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,707
Hi, Sean.
You were real hot.

742
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,044
You were real hot.

743
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,918
I want some time for us alone-You
got a few minutes between shows?

744
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,749
You bet.
Great, Kelly.

745
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,926
Listen.
Ready for some fun?

746
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,469
Fantastic!
Let's ride the bumper boats.

747
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,172
Bumper boats?

748
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,684
Come on, it's fun.

749
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,309
This is the entrance
to the Undersea Kingdom,

750
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,810
an incredible complex
of underwater tunnels

751
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,234
that show you first-hand
the miracles of the deep.

752
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,858
There's no extra charge
for this unique attraction.

753
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,486
Our underwater tunnels are
not only fun, but informative.

754
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,988
Oh, look at that.

755
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:43,080
<i>Consumed alive in history,

I sure am gonna miss these guys.

763
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,694
How 'bout it, Casper?

764
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,826
You wanna take the money and run
to Venezuela with old Mikey?

765

<i>Quieres un pescado?

766
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,297
I think they're gonna
miss you, too.

767
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:38,841
Now you and I are gonna have to have
a serious conversation sometime...

768
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,013
About what's really goin' on.

769
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,465
You and me.

770
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:46,807

What's a girl to do, huh?

776
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,743
Thank you.

Calvin ordered him moved.

786
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:31,518

did he go ahead on his own?

What is this thing?
Are you sure?

811
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,835
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

812
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,174
Oh! Oh, God. Can this
hold two people?

813
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,085
Oh. Push. Push.

814
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,464

Oh, my God!
Look at that!

823
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,623
Look, Kay, I don't think
you want to see this.

824
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,571
Mike, everybody is assuming
that this was a shark attack.

825
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,652
No, I wanna make sure.
Okay. All right.

826
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,781
Did you guys pull him out?

827
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,110
That's Shelby Overman.

828
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,204
Kay, I told...
Miss...

829
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,626
Mike. Ray.

830
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:27,045

I've seen it before.

01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,765
Oh, Mike.

01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,397
Oh, my God!

834
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,108
Let's go find Calvin.
Come on! Come on!

835
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,285
I'm getting a lot of contradictory
readings from the filtration pumps.

836
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,828
Such as?

837
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,497
High pump rate, low outflow

838
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,918
and a pressure build-up
on the inboard tunnel valve.

839
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,997
That's number two.
Could be an obstruction.

840
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,331
Well, that's not my department.

841
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,339
See if you can locate Brody
or Calvin, will you?

842
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,672
Very posh.

843
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,803
Yes, it's quite a display.

844
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,513
Tell me. How do you contain the
sharks in this part of the lagoon?

845
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,224
It's that old shark screen,
that bubble screen.

846
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,856
You know,
sharks don't like that.

847
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,946
It's what they call, uh, marine
segregation.

848
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,153
Dr. Bouchard. Telephone.

849
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,735
Ah, excuse me, gentlemen.
Get comfortable now.

850
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,822
Here you go, sir.

851
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,958
Bouchard here.

852
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,374
What about the pumps?

853
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,966
Ah, nah, nah, nah.
Don't wait for Brody.

854
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:55,217
Just, uh, shut down number two pump
and switch over to number one-

855
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,797
Simple as that.

856
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,344
Because it costs too much to replace
and they burn out, that's why!

857
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:05,522
And tell Brody to get down here to the
Neptune Room on the double, y'hear?

858
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,401
Thank you.
You're welcome.

859
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,745
Well, gentlemen.

860
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,155
Chin-chin.

861
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,246
Oh, cheers.
Cheers.

862
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,957
There they are.

863
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,343
Calvin, I've got bad news. Keep
your voices down, sit down.

864
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,299
Sit down!

865
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,466
Was it the shark?

866
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,347
It was a shark.

867
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,936
It was a shark

868
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,853
with a bite radius
about a yard across.

869
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:57,699
Don't be silly. That would indicate
a shark of some 35 feet in length.

870
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,693
You said it exactly.

871
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,702
Our shark still has all its teeth.
Yeah.

872
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,332
That means it was a baby.

873
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,214
Our shark couldn't
have killed Overman.

874
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,879
Its mother did.

875
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,046
You talkin' about
some damn shark's mother?

876
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,107
Calvin, don't you hear
what she's sayin' here?

877
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,553
I'm listening!

878
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,301
Now, if there is such an animal,

879
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,011
she gave birth way out to sea,

880
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,405
and the baby swam
through the sea gate

881
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,646
that you left open, Brody!

882
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:34,070
No! Overman was killed
inside the park.

883
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:37,068
The baby was caught
inside the park.

884
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,572
Its mother is inside the park.

885
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,041
She's right there!

886
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,053
How did that thing get in there?

887
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,435
The animals are in the lagoon!
Ski show!

888
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,691
Control, this is Bouchard.

889
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,019
Now you listen to me carefully!

890
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,162
I want you to clear the tunnel,

891
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,455
I want you
to let the people out,

892
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,447
I want you to close
the gate and seal the park!

893
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,616
Seal the park!
I'll be down in a minute.

894
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,613
Hey! Hey! Watch it!

895
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,994
- Who is that guy'?
- Watch out!

896
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:44,506
Hey, bring it over here! Hey!

897
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:54,520
All right. I've had enough fun.
Let's go in now.

898
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,397
Come on. You're enjoying this.

899
01:04:56,476 --> 01:05:00,231
No. Look, don't you have to
be at work or something?

900
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,958
Tammy's on the pyramid. I don't have
to be back till the second half.

901
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,404
Oh.
Come on.

902
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,245
Gotcha, lovers.

903
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,948
Shit!
God.

904
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,581
Get out! Get out!
Hey, what the?

905
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,628
Hey, what are ya doin'?

906
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:18,794
Brody!

907
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,423
Get out of the water.
Get out!

908
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,130
Get out of the water, please.
Please, come in from the water.

909
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,424
Out of the water! Come on!
Get out of the water!

910
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,685
Out of the water!

911
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,183
Get out!

912
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,399
Get outta the way!

913
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,237
Shit!

914
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,455
This is Sea World Control.

915
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,794
Uh-huh.

916
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,715
Yes. I got him right here.

917
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,014
<i>All right, boys.
Come on in and take a bow.</i>

918
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,342
<i>I</i> apologize to have you...
No! Get up here!

919
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,727
Get outta the water!
Get outta the water!

920
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,228
Boys. Boys!

921
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,519
Bring the boat in!
Get outta the water!

922
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:23,230
You're gonna get both
of us fired out here!

923
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,657
Get out! Everybody out!

924
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,700
Gimme the mike!

925
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:28,919
Hey, Brody! Come back here!

926
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,117
<i>Get outta the water!
Bring it in.</i>

927
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,326
<i>Bring it in!
Bring the boat in!</i>

928
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,001
<i>Get out of the water right now!</i>

929
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:38,995
Ready, up! One. Two.

930
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,133
<i>Bring that boat in!
Get outta the water right now!</i>

931
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,962
Hey, get me down!
Just get me down!

932
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,181
Get me down!
What are you saying?

933
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,384
There's something back there!
A shark!

934
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:55,019
Bring your boat in!

935
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,111
There's a shark!

936
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,626
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

937
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,420
<i>Get outta the water!</i>

938
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,084
Oh, my God!

939
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,801
Get outta the water!

940
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,222
Get out!

941
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,686
We're coming!
We're coming!

942
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,725
It's gonna eat us!

943
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,189
They'll die!

944
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,900
Gimme your hand. Come on!
Pull me out!

945
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,287
Hang on!

946
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,835
Needs a choke
or something. Pull it.

947
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,013
Hold my hand.

948
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,392
Kelly!
Shark!

949
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,195
Kelly!

950
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,992
Kelly!

951
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,378
What the hell is that?
Shit! Hang on!

952
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,732
What happened? She's drowning!
She's drowning!

953
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:09,021
Swim! Swim, kid, swim!

954
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,999
Call an ambulance.

955
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,169
Quickly. Come on.
Get out of the way!

956
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,041
Give us some room there, please.

957
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,121
Get a paramedic!

958
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:29,920
Look out, Mommy!

959
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,136
Kelly!

960
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,890
Did you call an ambulance?
Yeah, the paramedics.

961
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,017
Twist that tourniquet
tight and hold it there.

962
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,518
Goddamn shark!

963
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:46,725
I'm here.
You're gonna be okay.

964
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,118
There's still some
injured in the water.

965
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:49,328
They're bringin' in the wounded.

966
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,150
The ambulance is on the way.

967
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,740
Shall I leave the gate open?
Cindy and Sandy are out there.

968
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,284
Shit.

969
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,952
No. They're gonna have to
take care of themselves, Liz.

970
01:10:01,823 --> 01:10:05,043
We can't take our chance
on that big bitch gettin' in.

971
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,792
Hey, you all right?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

972
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,458
Uh, I'm gonna go with Kelly.

973
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,793
I think you should.

974
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,677
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

975
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,730
Hello out there.
This is Calvin Bouchard.

976
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,521
May I please
have your kind attention.

977
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,444
Due to technical difficulties,

978
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:34,819
it has become necessary for us
to temporarily close

979
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,615
<i>the Undersea Kingdom now.</i>

980
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:41,329
<i>For those of you all still in the
underwater portion of this park,</i>

981
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,449
please follow your guides,

982
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:48,628
and they will point out the most
convenient and accessible exits.

983
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,666
Where the hell is the nearest
accessible exit? We're underwater!

984
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,716
Is this off?
Uh-huh.

985
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,312
Gimme some lights down there!
Got them right here.

986
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,464
Can't see shit down there!

987
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,891
Get me some medical
attention here, quick!

988
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,510
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

989
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,937
<i>you all heard the announcement,
so please follow me</i>

990
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:09,107
<i>in an orderly fashion,
and remember walk, do not run.</i>

991
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,022
Daddy, Daddy!
Look at the fish!

992
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,902
Look!
Holy shit!

993
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,014
Tunnel failure, number six.

994
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,515
It's Jonah and the Whale.
That's it.

995
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,972
Tube integrity has been
compromised.

996
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,477
We've got leakage
and pressure loss.

997
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,020
We have to seal the section

998
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,605
or we'll lose the whole complex.

999
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,904
Watertight doors. Hit it.
On automatic.

1000
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,075
They're all on go status.
Activated. Now!

1001
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,545
I need my wallet!

1002
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:46,078
Quiet! Quiet! Please!

1003
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,576
I need your attention,
please. Quiet!

1004
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:52,502
Now the water is not going any
higher, so calm down, okay?

1005
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,421
It's stopped. It's
stopped, so calm down.

1006
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,093
<i>The oxygen that we
have in here is all we have,</i>

1007
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:05,423
<i>so let's not panic, but let's try
to take shallow breaths, okay?</i>

1008
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,815
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah!

1009
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,244
This is our last cut. I think our
tunnel patch is ready to go.

1010
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,038
Good. Rig the winch
on that work boat up there.

1011
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,330
You got it.

1012
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,252
How much longer, sweetie?
I don't know.

1013
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,454
No?

1014
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:40,208
We're gonna have to nudge these
tunnel sections together.

1015
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,295
Then we're gonna slap on a patch and
we're gonna weld the whole thing.

1016
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,629
Then we evacuate?

1017
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,010
No, then we gotta put pressure
back into the tunnels,

1018
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,263
then the watertight doors will
open up, then people go home.

1019
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,097
Hey, watch how you're cutting that thing!
It's critical!

1020
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,059
Relax. Relax. You're doing
everything you can.

1021
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,443
Come on. Come over here.

1022
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,358
Listen.
I've been thinking.

1023
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:09,241
Maybe Venezuela can use
some trained whales, huh?

1024
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,866
What? Are you serious?
Yeah.

1025
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,167
I think this one's on me.

1026
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,495
But next year...
I'll follow you anywhere.

1027
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,205
Yeah!
I love you!

1028
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:27,338
Ah, Mr. Glass.

1029
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,177
Is Mr. Bouchard
going to be here?

1030
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,681
Please, please.
I have a statement to make.

1031
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,605
Was there an explosion?
What about the fire?

1032
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,056
How many people are missing?

1033
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:39,107
Late this afternoon, <i>as</i> a
result of a minor disturbance,

1034
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,857
there was a pressure failure in
one of the underwater tunnels

1035
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,064
that are a major attraction
here at the park.

1036
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,233
We estimate that 30 to 40 people

1037
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,282
were in the process
of being evacuated

1038
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,411
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit.

1039
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,126
We're working right now
to release them

1040
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,919
under the safest
possible circumstances.

1041
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,500
In addition, seven visitors
were injured in our beach area.

1042
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,477
That's all for now.
Give me a break, boys.

1043
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,187
What is this we've heard
about a large shark?

1044
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,636
I'll let you know as I know more.
A very large shark...

1045
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,342
That's all. There is no more.

1046
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,553
When will they get this fixed?

1047
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,354
I'm sure they're working on it.

1048
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,025
Stay together to keep warm.
I know you're cold.

1049
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:26,861
Stay together, take shallow breaths and
concentrate on your breathing, okay?

1050
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,628
Well, any sign of mother?

1051
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,670
Okay, then.

1052
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,474
Where did the animal
hide the first time?

1053
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,184
Uh...

1054
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,563
Filtration pipe.

1055
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,812
Opposite side of the lagoon.

1056
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,521
Brody, is there an access
hatch, a backwash gate?

1057
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,739
Heavy grillwork.

1058
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,318
Keeps the pumps clear when
we back-flush that system.

1059
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,701
Why? What do you want to do?
Get that thing back in?

1060
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,157
He's a bright lad.

1061
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:23,421
Yes. Jack and I are going to
lure him back into the pipe,

1062
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:27,592
close the gates and then
dispose of him at our leisure.

1063
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,339
Meanwhile, you can weld
your tunnel patch

1064
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,716
and then Calvin can
evacuate the civilians.

1065
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,053
What if she doesn't
want to go back in?

1066
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,137
Oh, I think we can pretty much
guarantee she'll want to go back in.

1067
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,018
Don't you, Jack?
Sure.

1068
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,187
Just how are you
going to guarantee that?

1069
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,695
Live bait.

1070
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,491
We're ready to move
out over the tunnel now.

1071
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,737
Let's go.

1072
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,879
I'll be in the Control Room.

1073
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,048
I'll go with you.

1074
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,378
Give me that.
Let me stow it over here.

1075
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,714
No, I got it.

1076
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,639
Yeah, we're on top of it.

1077
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,060
Okay. Thanks.

1078
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,729
Now, where's that damn fish?

1079
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,068
There. I've got him.

1080
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,946
Sorry, it's just the dolphins.

1081
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,749
Babies, stay out of it, please.

1082
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,627
And I've rigged a lifeline.

1083
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,545
Just let the pumps push you out and use
the rope to pull yourself back in.

1084
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,042
Right.

1085
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,721
And why don't
I do all the filming?

1086
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,559
I want both cameras. We need the coverage.
Come on, Jack!

1087
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,807
This isn't a picnic.

1088
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,731
This film is a bloody
retirement annuity.

1089
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,693
I'd feel better if you
did just the one thing.

1090
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,604
What's the matter?

1091
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,276
Getting cold feet?

1092
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,582
Okay, Bob. Hold it
about right there.

1093
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,753
We're right over the tunnel.
Okay, we're all set down here.

1094
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:30,123
<i>Tell FitzRoyce
we 're in position.</i>

1095
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,712
FitzRoyce, you can go now.

1096
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,995
They're testing the lifeline
to see if it's secure.

1097
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,854
They're spreadin' some chum.
You know, fish oil and blood.

1098
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,151
Then Jack's gonna make
some metallic sounds

1099
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,730
to attract her right down
into that filtration pipe.

1100
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:35,446
Start the pumps.

1101
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,864
You got it.

1102
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,498
- It's in!
- He's got it!

1103
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:12,872
All right. It's locked.

1104
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,706
It's safe, Brody.
Go for it.

1105
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:18,670
Okay, let's go.

1106
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,098
<i>This is Control.
Is that tunnel patch in place?</i>

1107
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:50,716
Easy.

1108
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,062
Let me help you
with that, Dr. Morgan.

1109
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,405
Got it!

1110
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,069
Now weld the
son-of-a-bitch...

1111
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,035
Kathryn, what are you doin'?

1112
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,616
I'm going down there.

1113
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:20,329
You crazy?

1114
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,710
He needs eyes in the back
of his head, Calvin.

1115
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,592
Thanks, Fred.
All right.

1116
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,091
Watch the tanks.

1117
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:33,926
Okay.

1118
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,435
Here are your fins.
Thanks.

1119
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,733
Be careful down there now.

1120
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,862
You all right?

1121
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,948
Where's Mr. FitzRoyce?

1122
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,279
I have no idea.

1123
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,252
What's goin' on?

1124
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,663
Guv'nor!

1125
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:46,585
Guv'nor!

1126
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:48,462
Guv'nor!

1127
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,962
There's no other way out?

1128
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:54,006
You don't understand.
This is it!

1129
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,306
Have you looked?

1130
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,517
He didn't come up.

1131
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,889
Guv'nor, you bloody bastard.
Answer me!

1132
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:11,232
We'll suffocate the bitch.
Shut down the pumps.

1133
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:12,782
Are you sure?

1134
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:15,410
Why don't we blow it up?
Listen, nephew.

1135
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:19,999
That's a $2.5 million turbine that's not
going up in smoke because of some damn fish!

1136
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,955
Now shut the pumps down!

1137
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,173
What's happened?

1138
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,754
They've shut the pumps off.

1139
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,886
That's all she needs.
The gates can't hold much longer.

1140
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:42,062
Philip, pull the pin!
Pull the pin, Philip.

1141
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,931
Look at that!

1142
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,190
Jesus!

1143
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,491
Oh, my God!

1144
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,653
We gotta warn 'em.
We gotta tell 'em!

1145
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,362
Get 'em up!

1146
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,744
It's coming back.
Get 'em up quick!

1147
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,416
Come on! Hurry up!
Come on!

1148
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:27,622
Get 'em up!

1149
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,467
Come on, Mike.
Get out of there!

1150
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,603
- Come on, Mike!
- Get 'em <i>up!</i>

1151
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,012
Come on!

1152
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:37,046
Pull the door!

1153
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,369
How the hell did it get loose?

1154
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,502
Open the hatch!

1155
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,835
Come on up,
Mike. I gotcha.

1156
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,391
Are you all right?

1157
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:33,988
Do we have pressure
in those tunnels yet?

1158
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:37,016
Affirmative. Then open up the bulkheads,
get those people out of there.

1159
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,190
Done.

1160
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,690
Feel the air!
Can you feel the air?

1161
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,863
The water's going down.
The water's going down!

1162
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,073
Try to be calm.
Don't rush to the door.

1163
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,368
We're saved!

1164
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,291
Oh! We did it!

1165
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,505
The others, Mike.
What about the others?

1166
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:31,750
Calvin made it. Lisa.

1167
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:35,887
Mike. Mike! The dolphins!

1168
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,882
Cindy!

1169
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,184
- Cindy!
- Sandy!

1170
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,102
Come on, girls! Cindy!
Cindy!

1171
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:47,557
Oh, good girl. Sandy!

1172
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:53,571
Sandy, come on, baby.
Sandy, where are you?

1173
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:55,782
MIKEI Sandy!

1174
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,947
I hope she made it.

1175
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:03,039
Cindy, stay.
Sandy.

1176
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,457
Sandy!

1177
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,379
All right!

1178
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,556
All right!
