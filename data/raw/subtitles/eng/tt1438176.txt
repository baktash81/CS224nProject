00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,457


3
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,156


4
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,261
Welcome to Fright Night.

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,015
Onstage at the Hard Rock Hotel 
and Casino in Las Vegas.

6
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,600
Welcome back.

7
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,812
In the northern Las Vegas suburb 
of Hillcrest Bluffs today,

8
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,440
a woman leaving a grocey store says
a man came up to her

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
and tried to bite hen

10
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,159
He was scared 0ff 
by the security guard.

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,870
If you've seen or witnessed anything 
similar...

12
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,969


13
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,645


14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,092


15
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,853


16
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,238


17
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,115


18
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,502


19
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,793
Really? Really? 
I'm going to take you apart.

20
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,417
You watch me. 
Watch me take you apart.

21
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,127
You're done. You're done.

22
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,928
Nothing doing, huh?

23
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,593
This thing has got no ambition. 
It's got no huevos.

24
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,853
Doris, do you want some help 
with the trash?

25
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,514
Oh, I got it. Thanks.

26
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,019
All right. Good to see you, Char-Char. 
You're getting big.

27
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,622
Hey, kid. Don't leer at the neighbors.

28
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,875
She's the one that 
put the word on her butt.

29
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,997
I'm just reading it.

30
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,131
Is he ever going to 
move that dumpster?

31
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,130
Oh, Mom, come on. 
You got to get over it.

32
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,673
Attitude.

33
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,051
You've been stressed or something.

34
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,180
Amy?

35
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,016
Amy is good. 
Hasn't dumped me yet, so...

36
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,146
Getting what you want can be stressful.

37
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,571
Especially when you're not used 
to getting it. More to lose.

38
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,408
You reading those books again? 
The Power of Whatever-the-He?

39
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,911
Because they're definitely not working.

40
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,989
And neither is this bike.

41
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,662
Still tripping out over some guy's box.

42
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,414
It's an eyesore.

43
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,415
I'm trying to get people to move in, 
not join the legions leaving town.

44
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,503
-I like that word. "Legions." 
-Hello.

45
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,043
Can I get some help here?

46
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,129
-When the Perrys lived there... 
-When the Perrys lived there,

47
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,181
they were the greatest neighbors ever, 
but they moved.

48
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,134
I thought you were happy 
their house finally sold.

49
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,230
He's not digging a pool, so where did 
all this concrete come from?

50
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,682
That's a very good question.

51
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,893
Maybe you should spy on him 
some more and find out.

52
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,485
He's 13 feet from our house. 
That's not spying.

53
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,113
It's merely observing.

54
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,914
-Hi, Mrs. Brewster. 
-Hey, honey. Hi, girls.

55
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,456
-Hi. 
-Hi.

56
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,873
-Oh, hey, Ed called again. 
-Yeah?

57
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,087
I'm tired of 
making excuses for you, Charley.

58
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,759
If you don't want to talk to him, 
just tell him.

59
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,175
Kind of defeats the purpose.

60
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,093


61
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,141
-Still can't get the bike started? 
-No faith.

62
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,684
So you don't need a ride?

63
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,974
Amy!

64
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,188
Amy! Oh, my God.

65
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,402
Hey!

66
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,321
-Charley'? 
-Yeah.

67
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,735
-Guess what? 
-What?

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,330
-Guess what? We are on time. 
-Oh, good.

69
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,578
-You stress too much. 
-No, I don't.

70
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,202
Yeah, you do. 
You do your worried thing.

71
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,705
-What's my "worried thing"? 
-Your worried thing.

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,958
I don't have a worried thing. 
I never make that face.

73
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,171
All the time.

74
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,889
-Ladies. 
-Dudes. Looking good.

75
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,176
Seriously? A mochaccino?

76
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,562
You can't ride with the girls any more. 
I mean,

77
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,224
you lot them brush your hair, 
My Pretty Pony?

78
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,649
Chuck's secure.

79
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,190
Nice, man. Nice kicks.

80
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,190
-Puce. 
-Fuck, yeah.

81
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,108
I have track after school. 
I'll see you later.

82
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,322
Hey, Amy, Amy.

83
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,741
About the prom. I was going to ask you. 
I just kind of figured it was a go.

84
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,662
You, me, ill-fitting tuxedo. 
The whole thing, you know?

85
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,002
No. Nobody goes to the dance 
in senior year.

86
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,130
Okay. Yeah, I knew that.

87
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,090
-It's so not cool. 
-I know.

88
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,755
-Okay, bye. 
-Bye.

89
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,766


90
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,190
Did you find 
a freaking genie lamp, man?

91
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:59,022
Make a sacrifice to the hot-ass gods? 
How do you get that?

92
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,573
-Just game, man. 

93
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,700
Rock-solid game.

94
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,866
-He doesn't even have a car. 
-Seriously.

95
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,699
-GRANADA: Ben Wegener? 
-Here.

96
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,283
Nick Straley?

97
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,207
Nick?

98
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,665
-Courtney Frank? 
-Here.

99
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,007
Adam Johnson?

100
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,131
Adam?

101
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,880
-Steve Danton? 
-Here.

102
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,923
-Matt Hofstetler? 
-Yo.

103
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,552
-EIIen Mclntosh? 
-Here, Ms Granada.

104
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,687
Samuel Silverman?

105
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,982
Holy crap, man. How did you get that?

106
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,309
She's hard up, man.

107
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,065
Dude, I think Ed's going to talk to us.

108
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,404
Hey, can I get a minute?

109
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,733
Just the two of you? That's sweet!

110
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,778
Now he can school you 
in the ways of geek-douchery.

111
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,655
Nice. Don't you have 
some sluts to go fuck'?

112
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,286
Actually, yeah, I do.

113
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,079
It's important, Brewster.

114
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,465
What's up, Ed?

115
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,259
You know Adam's missing, right?

116
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,802
What do you mean, Adam's missing?

117
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,177
I keep trying him. 
No texts, no phone calls, nothing.

118
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,183
I don't know if you were 
paying attention at roll call,

119
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,726
but he's not the only one that's gone.

120
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,892
Kids aren't coming to school. 
That happens all the time.

121
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,147
What do you want me to do about it?

122
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,348
Just meet me at his house after school.

123
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,192
We'll check around 
and see if he's okay.

124
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,895
I can't. I'm sorry. I'm busy.

125
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,443
I don't think you understand 
what I'm telling you. Adam's gone.

126
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,862
Do we really have to do this here?

127
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,701
Wow. Am I supposed to not even speak 
to you any more?

128
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,321
-Be quiet. Don't spaz out. 
-"Don't spaz out."

129
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,825
You don't want me to spaz out? 
Oh, my God! It's so horrible!

130
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,416
Crossing the streams! Will high school 
as we know it cease to exist?

131
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,260
Okay. You want me to go tall your pals 
how well we really know each other?

132
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,467
The LEGO contests, 
the Farscape conventions,

133
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,094
-the costumes? 
-Please stop.

134
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,183
Or how about that one time 
you took my Stretch Armstrong,

135
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,511
so you could tie it around your balls 
and jerk off for an hour?

136
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,972
-Stop. 
-Then be my backup.

137
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,152
Okay, fine. Adam's after school.

138
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,978
Don't be late.

139
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,155
I'd really like Stretch back, by the way.

140
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,493
AMY: You know what I want for dinner?

141
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,958
You realize you're eating 
right now, right?

142
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,715
You just forced me to get you 
a smoothie so big

143
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,383
that they named a planet after it.

144
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,005
It's true. I'm insatiable.

145
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,764
You are.

146
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,938
What was that for?

147
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,273
Nothing.

148
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,814
JANE: I'm so sorry to take up your time. 
I really appreciate your help.

149
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,192
Is my mom flirting?

150
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,079
Hey, Charley, I'm at Adam's house,

151
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,328
and it's really weird, 
because you're not here.

152
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,327
Remember those videos of us 
back in the day?

153
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,378
Adam, you, and I dressed in tights?

154
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,129
You don't want your new pals 
seeing you in that, do you? All right.

155
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,170


156
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,382
JANE: So, not a pool? 
What's the work you're doing?

157
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,885
JERRY: Foundation problems. 
I had to rip up half the basement.

158
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,099
Oh, these houses were 
practically built overnight.

159
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,227
It never surprises me 
when they come apart.

160
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,483
This is the third time 
this thing has broken.

161
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,776
JERRY: Done. Just needed a new stem.

162
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,857
Jerry, this is my son, Charley, and his...

163
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,742
I don't know. Do we say "girlfriend"?

164
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,156
Hi, I'm Amy.

165
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,779
Hey, Jerry.

166
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,076
Nice to meet you.

167
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,791
So, Jerry is our 
new neighbor at the Perry place.

168
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,957
-And he's handy. 
-No kidding.

169
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,789
I'm sorry about the mess, Charley.

170
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,925
I was just saying to your mom 
I'll have the dumpster gone tomorrow.

171
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,215
It doesn't bother me. My mom was...

172
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,430
Jerry docs night construction 
on the Strip.

173
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,177
CHARLEY: Oh.

174
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,303
You play ball.

175
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,102
I'm always looking for a pickup game.

176
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,056
Yeah, no, I do. Definitely.

177
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,066
-I do. 
-It's more of a collector thing, the shoes.

178
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,187
He's obsessed. 
They sleep on sidewalks to get them.

179
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,983
-I play, though. 
-It takes a real man to wear

180
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,242
puce.

181
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,324
I like them.

182
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,827
So, I'd invite you guys inside, 
but it's a mess.

183
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,000
-I've been meaning to. 
-Be neighborly.

184
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,715
A drink. Something.

185
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,634


186
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,880


187
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,553
Soon, okay?

188
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,980
Yeah, you bet. 
And thank you so much for the help.

189
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,224
It's the least I could do.

190
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,686
My God. Why did you blow him off?

191
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,489
A guy that good-looking still single? 
Bad bet. He is a player.

192
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,654
Nice, Mom, breaking it down.

193
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,991
I've had enough man troubles. 
I am not getting suckered again.

194
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,289


195
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,242
CHARLEY: Oh, wow.

196
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,332
I got to go.

197
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,960
-What? 
-I'll call you later. Okay?

198
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,336
-Now? 
-Dinner's on.

199
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,251
-That's tine. I'll eat after. 
-Charley!

200
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,671
-Are you okay? 
-Okay, see you, guys

201
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,194
Dude, where the hell have you been?

202
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,326
-You said after school. 
-I meant right after. This is dusk.

203
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,320
-Do you know what that means? 
-No, I have no idea.

204
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,119
-Let me consult my pocket dictionary. 
-Nice.

205
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,336
Hello? Anybody home?

206
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,211
Nope.

207
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,587


208
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,230
CHARLEY: This is nuts.

209
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,529
ED: I really hate to be the one 
to tell you this, but

210
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,113
that guy, your neighbor,

211
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,399
he's a vampire, man.

212
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,740
-My neighbor? Next door? 
-Yeah.

213
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,121
Jerry. I just met him.

214
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,748
Okay. Jerry.

215
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,543
That is a terrible vampire name. Jerry?

216
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,209
I didn't name him, man. 
I'm just reporting the facts.

217
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,714
Dude.

218
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,560
Hello'?

219
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,021
Adam?

220
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,318


221
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,487


222
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,737
Yo. It's Ed.

223
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,699


224
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,166
-Jesus. 
-I feel stupid. It's a cardboard cut-out.

225
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,327
Nice.

226
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,298
-They're not here, dude. 
-It's not just them, okay? Listen to me.

227
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,130
I saw this thing on channel 13 
where there was this lady

228
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,720
who escaped an attacker 
that tried to bite her.

229
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,422
Why are you walking like that?

230
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,682
All right. Listen.

231
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,980
Adam and I graphed out all the attacks, 
all the disappearances.

232
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,026
-Whole families, gone. 
-That happens all the time.

233
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,987
Nobody lives in Vegas, 
they just pass through.

234
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,606
You live in Vegas.

235
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:43,201
That's you right there in the center, 
next to his house and Perry's old place.

236
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,779
His windows 
are completely blacked out.

237
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,534
Lots of people 
have blacked-out windows.

238
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,578
They work on the Strip at night, 
sleep during the day.

239
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,793
Which is why it's the perfect plan. It fits!

240
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,086
What? That Jerry's a Dracula?

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,127
No. Dracula is one specific vampire. 
I'm telling you...

242
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:01,298
Dude, I know what you're telling me. 
I'm making fun of you. I'm mocking you.

243
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,797
-Awesome. 
-You read way too much Twilight.

244
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,258
That's fiction. This is real.

245
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,516
He's a real monster,

246
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,391
and he's not brooding, 
or lovesick, or noble.

247
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,806
He's the fucking shark from Jaws.

248
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,609
He kills, he feeds, and he doesn't stop 
until everybody around him is dead.

249
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,650
And I seriously am so angry 
you think I read Twilight.

250
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,118


251
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,164
Ed? Ed?

252
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,037
You haven't asked him in yet, 
have you?

253
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,501
Because obviously he can": get in

254
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,123
without an invitation. 
I know you know that.

255
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,542
-You're on drugs, dude. 
-No, well... Yeah.

256
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,290
But I thought you'd take 
my word on this, man.

257
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,465
I have hard evidence at home.

258
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,130
Okay.

259
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,549
All right. Listen. 
We have to stake him in his nest, okay?

260
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,847
Me and you. But not now. It's too dark.

261
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,182
We should go during the day.

262
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,638
That's what I read 
on Peter Vincent's website.

263
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,689
-The magician? 
-Yeah.

264
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,518
The magician in the bandana 
and the leather pants and...

265
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,810
-Yes. 
-...tattoos and...

266
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,112
Yes. He's the master of dark forces.

267
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,575
He studies vampire methodology. 
What else do you need?

268
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,489
-Wow. 
-Wow.

269
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,742
Can we just pretend for one minute 
that you're not a complete douchebag?

270
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,493
Evil, this was fun when we were eight.

271
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,913
-Try 16. 
-Whatever, man!

272
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,544
Point is I grew up. 
If you don't want to, that's fine,

273
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,418
but don't get an attitude because 
I'd rather have a life than make shit up.

274
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,214
I get it. You're so cool, Brewster.

275
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,432
Go ahead and join 
your Clark High early peakers,

276
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,551
-and that includes your girlfriend. 
-Shut up.

277
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,266
She's undeniably doable, 
yes, I will give you that,

278
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,230
but we used to make fun 
of her and her friends.

279
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,266
-She's a skank. We used to make fun... 
-Shut up!

280
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,780
Adam's gone and you act 
like you don't give a shit!

281
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,700
What the fuck happened to you?

282
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,532
We were inseparable.

283
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,290
You know when my life 
started to get better?

284
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,375
When I stopped being friends with you.

285
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,887


286
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,439
What a fucking asshole.

287
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,693


288
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,360
Goddamn.

289
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,578
-Why are you on my street, bro? 
-Sorry. I'm really sorry about that.

290
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,826
You tracked your nerd juice 
all the way down it.

291
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,243
Really? Looks like I tracked 
some nerd juice on your face there.

292
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,296
Oh, yeah? Do I still got some? 
Still there?

293
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,668
Okay.

294
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,088
Just hit me. Really, 
I don't have time for this.

295
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,376
Seriously?

296
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,879
Jesus, I just gave you 
a fucking invitation to hit me.

297
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,556
You just gave me an invitation...

298
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,596
MARK: Oh!

299
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,179
You better run, boy! 
I'm coming! You better run!

300
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,534


301
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,453
Unbelievable.

302
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,930
Shit!

303
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,684
You back the fuck up! I'm armed! 
I know how to use this thing!

304
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,646
Hello! Please! 
Please, somebody let me in!

305
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,019
Someone's after me right now! 
Please!

306
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,651
Help me! God damn it!

307
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,992
Forget it, Jerry. No invitation. 
You can't get in.

308
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,836
Oh, shit.

309
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,918
Abandoned. I thought 
you did your homework.

310
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,670
You've been watching me.

311
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,761
I've been watching you. 
It seems fair.

312
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,863

Shit, shit.

315
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,564
That looked like it hurt.

316
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,936


317
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,907
You bit off more than you can chew.

318
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,077
It's too late. I told people what you are. 
You've been made!

319
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,743
And you think anyone's 
actually going to believe you.

320
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,420
Don't play that crap, 
don't play that mind shit with me.

321
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,793
I'm serious. Try me!

322
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,837
Okay.

323
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,050
You say you're glad you're different.

324
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,057
-Get back! 
-How can you be in a place like this?

325
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,016
These people, even your best friend,

326
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,359
-you're nothing to him how. 
-No.

327
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,487
You were born for this.

328
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,694
And you know it.

329
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,819
It's a gift.

330
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,478
Good on his word.

331
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,733
Kid Comeback!

332
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,520
Gladiator Man!

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,522
Squid Man!

334
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,154
ED: Come at me if you dare! 
CHARLEY: I dare!

335
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,156
ED: What can you do now, Squid Man?

336
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,625


337
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,622
-Hey, you. 
-Is Charley up yet?

338
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,842
You try. My voice seems to be 
on some frequency he can": hear.

339
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,510
Charley!

340
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,762
The world is Kid Comeback's!

341
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,594


342
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,641


343
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,640
ED: No, you're already dead. 
No, you're already dead.

344
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,807
Coming!

345
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,182
-GRANADA: Eden Miller'? 
-Here.

346
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,230
Ed Lee?

347
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,820
Edward Lee?

348
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,529
-Zach Taylor? 
-Here.

349
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,993
-Beth Tapper? 
-Here.

350
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,952


351
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,413
Charley!

352
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,250
-Hey, Mrs. Lee. 
-What a nice surprise. Come in.

353
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,176
Rick, Charley's here.

354
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,048
-This looks great. 
-Thank you.

355
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,550
-Look at you, so handsome! 
-No. You look great.

356
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,894
Ed said you really sprouted up. 
Look at you. How's it going?

357
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,972
Ed's going to be so sorry 
he missed you.

358
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,683
-Oh, he's not here? 
-No, he leaves early.

359
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,525
Do you mind if I run upstairs and". 
There's just a book that we need.

360
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,610
Of course. Make yourself at home.

361
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,697
-Right up there. 
-Nope, I remember.

362
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,727


363
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,971
Oh, man.

364
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,450
ANNOUNCER; Peter Vincent. 
Welcome to Fright...

365
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,204
ED: Oh, Adam. Here he comes. 
You see? You see what I'm saying?

366
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,666
ADAM: He's a guy with a wheelbarrow. 
The horror

367
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,589
ED: Don 't be a dick. 
You know what I'm trying to prove.

368
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,472
There. That's his truck.

369
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,889
Fuck! Fuck me! Oh, he didn't look.

370
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,023
That's him right there, Adam. 
He does not show up on the video.

371
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,235
He is so nailed. So nailed.

372
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,679
Guy. 
-Hey.

373
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,219
Guy.

374
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,143
-You could really do me a solid. 
-What's that?

375
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,311
I got a girl on her way over for a beer, 
and I'm all out of beer.

376
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,023
It's... Sucks.

377
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,907
Set me up. I'll pay you back two times. 
A sixer for your mom and one for you.

378
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,151
-What do you say? 
-Yeah.

379
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,281
Yeah, let me do that.

380
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,249
Right now. I'll go right now 
and check what we got in the fridge.

381
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,575
Okay.

382
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,996
-Cool. Just give me a second. 
-Cool.

383
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,884
Let me just see what she's got.

384
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,469
Mom's kind of a...

385
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,261
Kind of a

386
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,892
light domestic

387
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,811
kind of a mother.

388
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,478
Nice kitchen.

389
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,107
Good cabinet work.

390
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,363
Thanks.

391
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,159
You cool with Budweiser?

392
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,250
Yeah, that works. Yeah.

393
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,590
-Oh, shit. 
-Can I help you with that?

394
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,383
No! No, no.

395
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,513
I got it.

396
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,015
I just... Yeah, I got it.

397
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,951
Sorry it's not a sixer.

398
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,016
This girl tonight, she's a handful.

399
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,974
You know?

400
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,190
Women who look a certain way, they...

401
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,272


402
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,819
They need to be managed.

403
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,113
It's true.

404
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,368
Your dad ducked out on you?

405
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,712
Your mom, she didn't exactly say, but

406
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,669
there's a kind of neglect.

407
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,681
Gives off a scent.

408
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,351
You don't mind my saying, 
you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid.

409
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,016
The two of you,

410
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,772
alone.

411
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:53,153
And your girl, Amy, she's ripe.

412
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:58,362
I bet there's a line of guys 
dying to pluck that. Your mom, too.

413
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,411
You don't see it. Maybe you do, 
but she's putting it out.

414
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,252
It's on you to look out for them.

415
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,336
You up for that, guy?

416
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,053
-I think I can manage. 
-Good.

417
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,679
Because there are a lot of 
bad people out there, Charley.

418
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,696
Everyone's got to look 
after his own business.

419
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,281
Thanks for the beers.

420
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,622


421
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,177
Hey.

422
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,054
Where have you been?

423
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,848
You told me to meet you here 
an hour ago.

424
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,599
Hello?

425
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,180
Hey, are you all right?

426
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,188
Are you all right? Everything good?

427
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,397
Yep.

428
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,029
-Why shouldn't it be? 
-No, it should.

429
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,111
Did you ever read this?

430
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,201
-No. 
-It's really good.

431
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,663
It's kind of sexy, actually, in like,

432
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,409
frustrated, unconsummated sort of way.

433
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,748
Like us, you mean.

434
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,663
Mmm-hmm. Kind of makes it hotter.

435
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,680
-Am I boring you? 
-No, I'm just tired. Sorry.

436
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,182
Okay. That's all right. 
We can fix that.

437
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,059
Do you want to 
get under the covers?

438
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,072
Right now? Really?

439
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,536
Yeah, why not? 
We could just give it a go, and...

440
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,581
Please believe me, there is nothing 
I would rather be doing right now

441
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,451
than getting under the covers with you.

442
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,581
Okay.

443
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,214
Charley, don't be nervous.

444
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,798
It's okay.

445
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,177
I'm not nervous, I'm cool. 
I'm good.

446
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,059


447
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,394
Did you hear that?

448
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,483
DORIS: Sorry I'm late.

449
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,484
Doris. Oh, shit.

450
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,327
Shit.

451
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,537
What? He's hot, 
your neighbor's a stripper.

452
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,910
They were bound to find each other.

453
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,411
Go-go dancer.

454
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,788
No. You take away two tiny pieces 
of cloth, she is a stripper.

455
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,168
Rude.

456
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,418
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, he saw us!

457
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:02,046
Whoa! Maybe. 
It's not a big deal.

458
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,767
It's a huge deal, okay? Very big deal. 
He looked at us and he was pissed!

459
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,271
Okay, Charley, if you're not into this, 
can you just tell me?

460
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,689
Because you don't have to 
do me any favors.

461
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,769
Amy, I'm not doing you any favors. 
Of course I'm into this. Of course.

462
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,354
I don't trust that guy.

463
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,695
You're so stupid, Charley.

464
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,152
-I'm going. 
-Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

465
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,413
No, I'm going. I'm going to leave you to 
look out the window at the neighbors

466
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,124
and have fun 
with your neighborhood watch thing!

467
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,579


468
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,215


469
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,396
Oh, shit.

470
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,067
OPERATOR: 911...

471
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,864


472
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,985
A woman screaming?

473
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,904
You bet she screamed.

474
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,034


475
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,908
"You bet I made her scream." Jeez.

476
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,416
-Keep it down a bit. 
-Sure, absolutely.

477
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,914
Unbelievable.

478
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,302
Come on. Come on.

479
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:18,811
There it is.

480
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,649
Doris?

481
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:28,968
Doris?

482
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,050
Doris?

483
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,085
Doris?

484
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,440


485
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,796
Shit.

486
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,475


487
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,113
Fuck!

488
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,822
Doris?

489
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,829
Doris.

490
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,039
It's Charley.

491
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,712
Charley? Charley!

492
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,716
Oh, God! Get me out of here!

493
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,379
I am. I am.  

494
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,554
Hurry!

495
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,347


496
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:31,856
Shit! Shit!

497
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,609
Oh, no, he's coming back! 
He's coming back! No!

498
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,299
DORIS: No, please.

499
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,804
Please don't. Please.

500
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,647
No, please don't. Please don't.

501
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,658


502
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,711


503
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,143


504
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,863
Fuck!

505
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,247
Oh, God!

506
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,669
Good. I got you. I got you.

507
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,094
That's the first thing you wear for Joe 
when you get your new boobies.

508
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,340
I want to get breast implants, but 
my husband, he's more of an ass guy,

509
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,426
and he's very happy with my boobies, 
with my minus-As.

510
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,224


511
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,286


512
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,076


513
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,550


514
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,343


515
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,104


516
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,843
Thank you.

517
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,888
You'll be all right. 
You'll be all right.

518
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,302


519
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,983


520
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,327


521
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,780
Hey, you're going to be late.

522
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,209
The hours you keep. 
It's like living with a vampire.

523
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,214
Mom...

524
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,546
That guy Jerry, next door.

525
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,380
Under no circumstances 
is he invited into our house,

526
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,884
all right? He's dangerous.

527
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,095
-I think I can handle myself. 
-Mom, please, I'm serious.

528
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,935
Don't acknowledge him. 
Don't talk to him,

529
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,804
and at night, please stay inside.

530
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,810
Why? Because he's dangerous?

531
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,817
I can't answer a million questions 
right now. Will you just trust me?

532
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:09,072
Charley, stop! I'm your mom, 
not some ridiculous woman.

533
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,485
I'm sorry, I can't do this right now. 
I can't answer a million things right now.

534
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,820
I don't understand. Charley!

535
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,085
Hey.

536
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,761
Hey.

537
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,349
You weren't in class. 
What are you working on?

538
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,848
Porn.

539
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,053


540
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,311
Good. I thought 
it was something creepy.

541
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,155
You okay?

542
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,443
-I should probably... 
-Get back to your porn?

543
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,364
-Yeah. 
-Yeah, okay.

544
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,345


545
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,491


546
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,512
Get back, demons!

547
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:09,980


548
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,231
No!

549
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,909
Stop, stop, stop. 
Stop! Cut it!

550
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,072


551
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,287
Come on! What the fuck, people?

552
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,576
Fire. She's supposed to be on fire, 
not dribbling fucking smoke.

553
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,952
She keeps moving the squib.

554
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,416
Hey, I do not.

555
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:33,587
But Mr. Fireman here almost nearly 
burned off my extensions last time.

556
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:38,380
Bugger this. Look! 
Get me some professionals, all right?

557
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:41,883
CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent?

558
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,139
Mr. Vincent? 
Hi, I'm from the Vegas Sun.

559
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,595
We had an appointment today.

560
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,814
I don't think so. 
Speak to my guy.

561
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,399
No, we did. I'm doing that article,

562
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,976
"Vampires: Separating Myth 
From Fact."

563
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,402
Do you want a quote?

564
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,489
That's a shit idea for an article.

565
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:58,570
Look, please...

566
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,901


567
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,739
Please, I need your expertise 
and you're the man on this stuff, so...

568
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,406
I fucked her.

569
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:07,742
Filthy!

570
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,333
So, is this, what,

571
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,914
your first assignment or something?

572
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,923
Yeah.

573
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,297


574
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,255
I'm going to pop your cherry.

575
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,301
Ginger! Bring him upstairs. 
You got 10 minutes.

576
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,360
Wow! This is all his stuff?

577
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:37,822
He started collecting tarots and Ouijas. 
Gateway stuff.

578
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,447
Now scholars, 
they call him for answers.

579
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,619
Those books, the forgotten texts,

580
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,955
the Agrippa. He's read them all.

581
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,954
No, don't touch anything. 
He's PMS-y today.

582
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,535
Sensitive little girl.

583
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,457
Over there, that's haunted antiques. 
Cursed stuff!

584
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:01,380
And that's Pete's honorary degree 
from LVSU.

585
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,219
But he got it off the Internet.

586
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,850
Fuck!

587
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,558
The one and only.

588
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,314
-Midori me. 
-Midori yourself, douchebag.

589
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,574
-Fuck you! 
-Asswipe.

590
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,240
Come on in. Come on

591
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,836
It looks like pee, but I'm hooked.

592
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,719
-Do you want some? 
-I'm good, thank you.

593
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,219
No? Too much for you? 
Do you want a Shirley Temple?

594
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,344
Uh...

595
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,180
Sit down.

596
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,184
So,

597
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,440
I'm the expert for your vampire thing?

598
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,697
They're all the rage.

599
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,448
Leather, it doesn't breathe.

600
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,793
Fucking rashes are fucking killing me.

601
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,422


602
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,004
Shoot.

603
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,428
Right. Well...

604
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,843
Look, I know your show...

605
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,385
I know your show is an illusion.

606
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,807
Meaning bullshit?

607
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:40,361
-Yeah, fair enough. 
-But say I wanted to kill a vampire.

608
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,188


609
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:45,866
-Yeah, sorry. Go on. 
-How would I go about doing that?

610
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,741
You want to know how to kill a vampire? 
Seriously?

611
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,829
Yeah, kill a vampire.

612
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,324
Well, let's think.

613
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,371
You got fire, beheading.

614
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,883
You can make him 
a big garlicky omelet.

615
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,928
Or go traditional. 
Stake through the heart. Bam!

616
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,679
Cool. So that stuff really works?

617
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,854
Well, maybe not the omelet.

618
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,273
How the fuck should I know?

619
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,614
I don't know. You have all this stuff,

620
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,778
and you

621
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,699
are "Peter Vincent: Vampire..."

622
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,206
-I don't know. I'm not sure. 
-I read books.

623
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:39,295
You think I'm hanging out with Dracula? 
And the Easter bunny? Fuck off.

624
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,587


625
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm sorry, but I have 
a personal interest in this.

626
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,462
I think one of them got my friend.

627
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,548
What? "One of them," 
meaning a vampire?

628
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,472
Yeah. Jerry. He lives next door to me.

629
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,846
Jerry? Jerry the vampire?

630
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,479
Do you think I don't know 
how this sounds?

631
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:05,272
Two days ago I would have laughed 
in my face, but it's really happening.

632
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,816
I am so far down the rabbit hole.

633
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,912
I was in his house, or his lair, 
or whatever, and I got these pictures.

634
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,285
-If you just look at them. 
-Okay. Get out.

635
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,750
-No, please. 
-You're a nut job. Ginger!

636
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,252
I'm not! I know what I saw.

637
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,292
No, you don't. Illusion, remember?

638
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,419
People see 
what they want to see. This is...

639
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,296
You don't collect this stuff. 
You don't have all this stuff

640
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,844
if you don't believe, and I promise you, 
I can take you to him.

641
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,717
I can show you 
what you've been waiting for...

642
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,466
What, in Clark County, 
Nevada? Ginger!

643
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,264
That's a hotbed of supernatural activity.

644
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,765
It is, though. It's genius.

645
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,315
It's a transient population. People 
work all night, they sleep all day!

646
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,733
Get this loser out of my sight, please.

647
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,523
-Stop! 
-Whoa!

648
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,863
He got my friend already! 
I am not crazy.

649
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:52,076
I'm not. I don't want to know this shit.

650
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,869
Please, just look at these pictures.

651
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,369
Get the fuck out of my house!

652
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,827
Time to go, doll. Come on.

653
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,809
MARK: Dude, is that Charley? 
What the fuck is he doing?

654
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,191
BEN: It's paranoia.

655
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:32,070
Once I thought I was being chased 
by carrots with machetes.

656
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,824
-I know! 
-Whatever, man.

657
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:37,913
You guys are both ruining my high.

658
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,865


659
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:42,828
Oh, shit! All right, 
ditch the weed. I'm cool.

660
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,961
-Hey, guy. 
-Yeah?

661
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,466


662
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,966
-Fuck... 
-Oh, fuck.

663
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,537
Hey.

664
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,163
-Hey. 
-Hey.

665
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,216
The whole house looks like that show. 
Dark Shadows.

666
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:34,550
Yeah. It's a gag for Amy.

667
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,513
Long story.

668
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,216


669
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,517
Don't, Mom, don't! 
Don't open it!

670
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,148
How did you get in here?

671
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,859
-It was unlocked. 
-Oh, my God.

672
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:51,320
Mom, please, I told you to lock the door!

673
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,442
Okay!

674
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,283
You are flipping out. 
You're acting all weird.

675
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,160
You're blowing everything off.

676
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:00,954
Is that a stake?

677
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,584
No. Maybe.

678
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,378
Look.

679
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:13,543
Even if you are losing it, 
you do not get to blow me off.

680
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,345
You don't go from something 
to nothing overnight.

681
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,350
You're not nothing to me, Charley, 
so whatever is happening,

682
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:26,064
I would like you to talk to me, 
to tell me what is going on.

683
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,900
Oh, man. Amy, look...

684
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,898


685
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,275
I need you to just 
forget about me, okay?

686
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,283
I'm not going to let you get hurt. 
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,401
What? How? 
How am I going to get hurt?

688
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,329


689
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,455
-Stay there. 
-JANE: I got it.

690
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,125
No! Don't answer it. 
Please don't answer it.

691
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,043
This is ridiculous, Charley.

692
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,833
Jane, it's Jerry from next door.

693
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,380
Don't answer the door.

694
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,511
This is my house. 
I will answer the door if I want to.

695
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,676
But, Mom!

696
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,473
Jane, I need to talk to you.

697
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,518
Just hold on!

698
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,222
Now. Your son is harassing me.

699
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,270
-Charley, what is going on? 
-CHARLEY: Listen to me.

700
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,018
Whatever he says, 
he's going to try to slip...

701
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,815
JERRY: Jane, he broke into my house.

702
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,108
Is that true?

703
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:19,029
JERRY: I'd rather not take this to the 
authorities, but I will. I have no choice.

704
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,243
He's sick! He's deluded.

705
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,159
Please.

706
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,207
Go get the authorities!

707
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,065
-Shit! 
-JANE: What?

708
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,530
Wow. What is he doing?

709
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,080
I don't know, but whatever it is, 
it's not good.

710
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,539
We're all right 
as long as we stay inside

711
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,045
because obviously 
he can't get in without an invitation.

712
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,881
-Like a vampire. 
-Yeah, really, like a vampire.

713
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,262
This is the joke for Amy, right?

714
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,218
I can": believe 
you got Jerry to go along with it.

715
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,391
Take this.

716
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,851
Okay.

717
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,266
Vampire protection.

718
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,938
I don't think this is funny.

719
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,568
Shit.

720
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,113
Hey.

721
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,412
What the fuck is he doing to my yard?

722
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,515
What's that?

723
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:11,811


724
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,073


725
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,119
I don't need an invitation 
if there's no house.

726
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,587
Come on. Come on!

727
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,128
JANE: Get in! I'll drive.

728
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:48,132
Jesus Christ, Charley, 
what the hell is going on?

729
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:52,061
Mom, just go! 
Just gun it! Just go!

730
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,812


731
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,573
-Is everybody okay? 
-Are you all right?

732
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,741
JANE: Nobody's hurt?

733
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,912
Who the fuck is this guy?

734
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,006
Mom, I told you, 
he's a fucking vampire!

735
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,721
-Enough with the vampires! 
-Really!

736
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,475
Let's just calm down. 
I'm going to call the police.

737
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,274
-I don't have any service. 
-I do. No.

738
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,520
I hate the fucking desert! 
Now I have a psycho next door.

739
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:48,609
Oh, shit. Charley, is this him? 
Who is this?

740
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,246
Oh, man. Damn it.

741
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,077
-AMY: Oh, my God. 
-No.

742
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,955
-Oh, my God. 
-Oh, no.

743
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,670
AMY: God! What the fuck!

744
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,585
JANE: What is he doing?

745
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,916
AMY: Charley, 
he's coming around the side.

746
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,717
CHARLEY: Keep going. Keep going.

747
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,757
JANE: Jesus Christ.

748
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,554
AMY: Shit. Look out!

749
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,759
What does he want?

750
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,692
JANE: Oh, no. What do I do? 
CHARLEY: Hit him.

751
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,319
-What? 
-Hit him.

752
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,989
-Mom, just hit him! 
-Charley, no!

753
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,279
Just fucking hit him!

754
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,200
-Don't stop. 
-AMY: Holy shit!

755
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:40,419
CHARLEY: Just drive. Don't stop! 
AMY: Oh, my God,

756
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,756
-Do you see him? 
-No.

757
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,770
-Did I kill him? 
-Hopefully.

758
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,766


759
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,475


760
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,284
Mom.

761
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,784
Oh, God.

762
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,375


763
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,125
No! That's his fucked-up vampire hand. 
Now do you believe me?

764
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,419
Shit!

765
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,213
Keep driving, Mom!

766
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,222


767
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,673
Oh, my God!

768
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,433
Charley, fucking kick him!

769
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,302
Shit!

770
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,056
Get away from me!

771
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,155
-Where is he? 
-I don't know.

772
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,118


773
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,118
JANE: Where is he? Where did he go? 
CHARLEY: Stay in the car.

774
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,420
What the hell 
do you think you're doing?

775
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,668
No! Stay in the car!

776
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,963
You stop in the middle of the road, 
you got a taillight out.

777
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,728


778
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,449


779
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,458
No, Charley!

780
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,339
CHARLEY: Hey!

781
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,091
Charley!

782
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,569
Hey.

783
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,486
Please go. It'll be all right. 
Go. Take her and go!

784
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,488
Amy, take her and go!

785
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,827
Catch you later.

786
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,583
I repel you with the power 
of Christ the Lord.

787
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,460
Do you? Really?

788
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,546
That's a mighty big cross 
you got there, Charley.

789
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,970
The question is, 
do you have faith?

790
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,763
Get back!

791
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,431
Not the cross. 
Not the cross, Charley.

792
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,648
Come here.

793
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:02,037
You ever get a stake 
in the chest, Charley?

794
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,908
I have. It hurts.

795
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,993
But they missed the heart.

796
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,545
It's right here, Charley.

797
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,381
Easy measurement.

798
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,876
You shouldn't have been so nosy.

799
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,304


800
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,181


801
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,102
-Mom! 
-Mrs. Brewster!

802
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,649
Her head.

803
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,776
-You got her? 
-Yeah.

804
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,627
-Charley... 
-Hang on!

805
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,003


806
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:34,463
Good show tonight, 
right, babycakes?

807
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,461
You were late again 
on "The Devil's Torture Chamber."

808
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,459
I have something for you. Look.

809
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,722
You were early again 
in the bedroom.

810
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:45,970
Fuck you!

811
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,935
I will fuck myself. 
Someone's got to do it.

812
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,851
AMY: We won't be up all night.

813
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,846
Honestly, it's really not a party.

814
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,650
Sit tight. We might have 
a few more questions for you.

815
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,318
-Okay. 
-Mom?

816
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,521
I love you. Bye.

817
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:49,367
They only asked a couple of questions. 
We should be okay.

818
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,453
I don't know. I think maybe you 
should've said something to the police.

819
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,041
Like what? "This vampire moved in, 
borrowed a six-pack of Bud,

820
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,544
"ate a stripper and blew up our house 
because we wouldn't invite him inside."

821
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,045
Last time I called the cops, 
they nearly all went to Chili's together.

822
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:08,882
Okay.

823
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,854
This is my fault.

824
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,566
You didn't make any of it happen.

825
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,528
Ed came to me, 
and I turned my back on him.

826
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,407
How were you supposed 
to believe him?

827
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,567
I mean, he begged me.

828
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,990
I mean, he really...

829
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,993
And he was my best friend.

830
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:38,079
I know, but, Charley, 
people, they change.

831
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,584
Yeah, and I just changed into a dick.

832
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,257
I figured my dweeb past

833
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,052
wasn't really going to be 
very popular with the ladies, so I...

834
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,714
Oh. Are you trying to say 
this is my fault?

835
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:57,104
I just really wanted you to like me, 
that's all.

836
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,606
Charley,

837
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,940
I knew you were a dweeb.

838
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:08,363
Do you think I wanted 
some dude like Mark? Or Ben?

839
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,533
No.

840
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,621
I like you. Because you're different.

841
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,540
It didn't hurt 
that your skin cleared up.

842
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,080
Thanks.

843
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,959


844
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,762
-Hello? 
-I can help you.

845
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:31,806
My place in one hour.

846
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,260
We're going to see the Peter Vincent?

847
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:39,265
It's underwhelming, believe me, 
but he's what we've got.

848
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,149
Mom's very religious.

849
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,317
I'll tell you what I know, 
but that's it.

850
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:53,244
Right?

851
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:58,746
Don't expect me to join 
your little Scooby gang. Sit down.

852
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,998
Whatever you got, I'll take it.

853
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,625
That insignia you showed me.

854
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,179
It's a species that originated 
in the Mediterranean.

855
01:08:12,172 --> 01:08:15,016
They nest in the earth. 
And they kill slowly.

856
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,349
They keep their victims alive for days.

857
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,306
Snackers.

858
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,985
And they turn everyone? 
They change them into...

859
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,273
Yeah, I got it.

860
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,322
They're tribal by nature. 
He could be trying to tum them all.

861
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,449
Replenish his ranks.

862
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,947
How do we kill these guys? 
This tribe.

863
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,280
You two? You don't.

864
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,959
It's a strong breed. 
You're going to need an army.

865
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,790


866
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,881
Hang on. Sorry. Sorry

867
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,378
-Hello! 
-MAN: Mn Vincent?

868
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,805
-Yes! 
-You have a delivery.

869
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,348
All right. Send him up.

870
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:57,471
Ginger, we've got a delivery!

871
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,226


872
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,392
I'm watching my programme! 
You get it!

873
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,691
You're TiVo-ing it, you lazy cow! 
Come on!

874
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,239
Shit. Douchebag.

875
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,825
Hi, doll.

876
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:19,164
eBay. I order things late at night 
when I've had a few cocktails...

877
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,207
So, yeah, some nice stuff.

878
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,201
Wait a minute. 
You get deliveries this late?

879
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,418
Yeah.

880
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,378
No. I don't know.

881
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,878
Oh, shit. No. You said 
that guy could come in. That's a...

882
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,675
An invitation, airhead.

883
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,091
Hey, Mr. Vincent, package for you.

884
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,100
Fuck!

885
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,103
-One second, guys. Business call.

886
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,268
Hello. Oh, yeah.

887
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,270
No, I'm looking at them right now. 
Yeah, come on up.

888
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,438
He's actually quite modern.

889
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,362
Jerry dispensed 
with all that "master" stuff.

890
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,036
Ed, if you have a problem, 
just keep it with me, okay?

891
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:02,116
Oh, do I got a problem. 
You let him get to me.

892
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,788
You let him turn me into this.

893
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,085
Stay away, demon.

894
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,049
Is that itsy-bitsy little sticky for me?

895
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,968
It's a crucifixion nail. 
It's lethal to you.

896
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,051
Yeah. That's old school. Nice!

897
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,966
You're going to have to get 
pretty close to use that thing, though.

898
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,264


899
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,640


900
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:27,975
Oh, no, you don't.

901
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,233
Come on! Let's go!

902
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:33,817


903
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,817
Holy shit!

904
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,778
You took my arm!

905
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,290
Are you enjoying your panic room, 
master of darkness?

906
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,826
God, you are such a pussy. I love it!

907
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:47,835
Come on!

908
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,165
AMY: Oh, my God.

909
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,256
-Oh, my God. 
-Amy, listen to me.

910
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,757
There's more than one way out, 
and there's a million things to fight with.

911
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,591
We're going to be okay. All right?

912
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,847
-Yeah. 
-Trust me. Come on.

913
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,181
Come on!

914
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,693
Damn it.

915
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,690
ED: Give it up, Chuck.

916
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,111
If you hadn't turned out 
to be such a dick,

917
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,279
I might have tricked you out.

918
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,661
We could have rocked 
this evil shit together!

919
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:28,869
Sign in, please.

920
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:33,332
Sign In, all right'? 
Hey! I'm talking to you.

921
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:36,210
I need you to sign in. 
No exceptions...

922
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,817
ED: I expected more of a fight 
from you, Brewster.

923
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,983
Girl's made you lazy in the head.

924
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,823
Pussy will do that.

925
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,695
I can hear you breathing.

926
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,491
It's really fucking cool.

927
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,044
I can feel you.

928
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:14,877
I can taste you.

929
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,841
You're so...

930
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:22,679
Fuck!

931
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,386
Come on!

932
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,179
Not so fast, Chuck.

933
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,106
We got some catching up to do, 
my friend.

934
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,947
Amy, go. Amy, please go!

935
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,908


936
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:50,242
It's just you and me now, buddy. 
Mano a mano.

937
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,118
Let's do this.

938
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,087
Nice weapon there, Squid Boy.

939
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,504
Ed...

940
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,377
Not going to do you much good, though,

941
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,260
because I'm a goddamn 
killing machine.

942
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,602


943
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,816
Come on. It's like 
you're not even trying.

944
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,117


945
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,675
I'm so glad you're here.

946
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,245
Werewolves.

947
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,828
Vampires.

948
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,914


949
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:36,681


950
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:39,772


951
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,862
Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.

952
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,194
It's hard to cut.

953
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,990
Is this weird for you?

954
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,041
Because I'm feeling 
really homo right about now.

955
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,211
Fuck!

956
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,220
Bimbo's got some juice.

957
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,443
Jerry's here.

958
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,112
Do it, Charley.

959
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,791
Charley, do it now!

960
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,426
It's okay, Charley. It's okay.

961
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,353
Come on. I found the stairs. 
We have to go. Come on.

962
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,147
Come on.

963
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,382
Shit.

964
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,183


965
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,348
Come on.

966
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,898
Wait. He can't kill us, not in here.

967
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:49,488
Really? Look around. Do you think 
any of these people are going to notice?

968
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,320
-Oh, shit. 
-Oh, God.

969
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,719
It's tequila mad T-shirts!

970
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,520
-Amy! 
-Charley!

971
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,940
-Amy! 
-Charley!

972
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,104
Amy!

973
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:37,950
Amy!

974
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,908
Charley!

975
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:44,623
Amy!

976
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,089
Now that is what I'm talking about!

977
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,421
Can you help me? Please?

978
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,178
Charle:y's going to come. 
He's gonna find me.

979
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,554
I'm counting on it.

980
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:04,063
You'll see. You just need a taste.

981
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:10,520
It could be like a dream.

982
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:22,619
CHARLEY: Amy!

983
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:25,581
-How did you get in here? 
-Listen, man! Listen to me!

984
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,250
He's dangerous. You have to help me. 
That guy's going to kill her.

985
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,082
Yeah, she looks to be liking it, then.

986
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,297
No, man. Listen, 
you don't understand!

987
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:44,808
Attagirl.

988
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,485
-ID, then you can... 
-I don't have ID! There's no time!

989
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,984
Amy! Amy!

990
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:09,087
Amy! No! No!

991
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,253
No! Amy!

992
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,775


993
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,853
Shit! How did you get in here'?

994
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,486
Security is a little lax since everybody 
got their throat torn out.

995
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,442
You, too? Has he turned you?

996
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,369
Check your monitor, man.

997
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,880
I don't know if Amy's alive 
or dead or turned, but he got her.

998
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:57,468
I'm going to end him, 
or he's going to end me.

999
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,887
That's how it's going to be, 
and you're gonna come with me.

1000
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,311
Don't you understand this yet? 
There will be no fighting.

1001
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,639
There will only be surviving.

1002
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,233
-Maybe. 
-Really?

1003
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,817
You think if you live and we all die,

1004
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,566
you'll be able to 
get us out of your head?

1005
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:19,653
No, I know I won't. 
I never could after the first time.

1006
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,743
So I told myself I made it up.

1007
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,245
I was a kid. Figured it was easier 
to believe in monsters.

1008
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,869
Made what up?

1009
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,421
The vampire that killed my parents,

1010
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,714
but not me.

1011
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,173
You think I collected all this stuff 
because it was bitching?

1012
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,852
Come with me. We'll go in at dawn. 
He's got to rest some time.

1013
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:53,607
The only reason I survived the last time 
is because I had the sense to hide.

1014
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,604
If you want to be a dead hero, 
good for you. I'm out.

1015
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:58,942


1016
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,779
You think I'm a coward. 
I'm not. I'm a realist.

1017
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,578
So you just bail on people.

1018
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,121
Hey, I get it. 
My dad was like that.

1019
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,628
But I don't want to live till tomorrow 
if you're the kind of man I'm going to be.

1020
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,469
Hang on. Wait.

1021
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,720
Blessed by Saint Michael.

1022
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:33,644
You kill your vampire with this, it's 
supposed to change his victims back.

1023
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,149
Maybe you can still save your girlfriend.

1024
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,482
If it's for real.

1025
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:45,993
You got a plan?

1026
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,571
There's no guarantee he'll be sleeping.

1027
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,827
To stake him, you got to get close.

1028
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,661
Torch him.

1029
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,415
A vampire on fire 
is not thinking clearly.

1030
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,804
If he's on tire, how do I get 
close enough to stake him?

1031
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,970
Fuck.

1032
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,054
I'm going to kill a vampire.

1033
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,060
Good for you.

1034
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,447
Amy! Amy!

1035
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:55,289
-Amy! Amy! 
-AMY: Charley!

1036
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,950
-You all right? 
-Hey. Yeah.

1037
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:00,119
-Hang on. I'm going to get you out. 
-Hurry.

1038
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,377


1039
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,591
Shit. Shit.

1040
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,887
Amy! Amy?

1041
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,767
-Fuck! 
-Sorry.

1042
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,393
I guess I don't want to be 
a man like me, either.

1043
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:26,653
Let's kill something.

1044
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,783
Floor trap. I use them all the time.

1045
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,820
What do you think is down there?

1046
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,950
There's only one way to find out.

1047
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:38,495
You're going down?

1048
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:42,336
See that? Like a great date. 
You get me drunk, I'll try anything.

1049
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,527
Peter. Peter.

1050
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,330
Oh, shit. 
I may not be drunk enough for this.

1051
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,220
After you.

1052
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,297
AMY: Help!

1053
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:19,387
You know this is a trap, right?

1054
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,643
I'm counting on it.

1055
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:50,755
Fuck!

1056
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,849
She's all yours.

1057
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,484
Look at you, all grown up.

1058
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,527
Welcome to Fright Night,

1059
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:19,284
for real!

1060
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,376
Oh, fuck.

1061
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,043
You've got your mother's eyes.

1062
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,379
And your father's aim.

1063
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,303
Better.

1064
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:44,222
Fuck!

1065
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:48,268
Amy!

1066
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,746
Ow!

1067
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,043
Really?

1068
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,544
A pebble? That's it?

1069
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,224


1070
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,468
Oh, shit.

1071
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,493
Fuck!

1072
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,621
You know you should have 
saved me, Charley.

1073
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:57,295
There's still time. All right?

1074
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,304
He's inside me now.

1075
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,992
Fucking eBay!

1076
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,457
I'll be the best you ever had.

1077
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,502
The only you ever had.

1078
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:44,301
Charley, we could be together forever.

1079
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,812


1080
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,486
Shit!

1081
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,634
-You missed. 
-I know.

1082
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,180


1083
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:38,350


1084
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,531


1085
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,331
-How you holding up? 
-Oh, fucking great.

1086
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:01,669
-Mark? 
-You're dead now, asshole.

1087
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,301


1088
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:08,839
JERRY: 
What were you thinking, Charley?

1089
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:13,890
That you were just going to walk in here 
with your little crossbow

1090
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:17,015
and put to bed 400 years of survival?

1091
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,725
No, Charley. Not likely.

1092
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:21,564


1093
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,190
You smell that?

1094
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,193
It's your fear.

1095
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:30,990
It's intoxicating.

1096
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:35,996
It's a very specific scent, Charley.

1097
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,583


1098
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:50,760
Amy's scent,

1099
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:54,851
now that was exquisite.

1100
01:31:56,053 --> 01:31:59,523
It's all gone now, Charley.

1101
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,436
She's something, isn't she?

1102
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:08,695
I have to thank you 
for bringing her to me.

1103
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:12,990
Well, she makes me feel young again.

1104
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,160
I'm smoking.

1105
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,491
Yeah, you're turning.

1106
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:21,708
You can't stay there forever, Charley.

1107
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:25,674
The sun's got to go down, 
but we can wait.

1108
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:38,970
That's rough.

1109
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,081
Got a light?

1110
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:16,925
That's your plan?

1111
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:20,770
Actually, it's your plan.

1112
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,232
Fuck.

1113
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,045


1114
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,001
Fuck you!

1115
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,335


1116
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:37,923
Charley! In the heart!

1117
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:43,720


1118
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:48,479


1119
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,355


1120
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:32,067
Charley? Charley, come on.

1121
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:34,028
Come on, Charley!

1122
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,568
Charley, come on. 
Come on, come on.

1123
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,033
Wake up. Wake up.

1124
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:40,952
Come on, you little prick.

1125
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:43,534
Charley!

1126
01:35:57,419 --> 01:35:58,466
Hey.

1127
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,260
Hey.

1128
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:04,513
You okay?

1129
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:07,478
Yeah.

1130
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:10,265
Are you?

1131
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:15,528
Yeah, I'm all right.

1132
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:20,529
PETER: You little shit.

1133
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,160
Next time you're going to use my plan, 
give me a heads-up first.

1134
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,287


1135
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:31,165


1136
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:35,799
That was a fucked-up night.

1137
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:39,427


1138
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:58,479
Are you sure?

1139
01:37:00,357 --> 01:37:01,404
Yeah.

1140
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,863


1141
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:08,698


1142
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:09,998
One second.

1143
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,453
Hello?

1144
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:16,165
It's me. Just checking in. 
What are you up to?

1145
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:21,966
Nothing, nothing.

1146
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:23,930
-What are you doing? 
-Just did a little shopping

1147
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:25,924
-for the new house. 
-Shopping? Nice.

1148
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:29,553
Something actually just came up, 
and I have to go.

1149
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:30,933
You okay?

1150
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:32,852
Yeah, I'm good. Are you all right?

1151
01:37:32,972 --> 01:37:34,974
Yeah, monster free.

1152
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,728
Good. Monster free is good. 
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1153
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:38,902
Okay, bye.

1154
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,028
If you're naked, 
I'm absolutely going to look.

1155
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,072
Dude! Dude!

1156
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:49,414
I know. Sorry. I left my phone.

1157
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:52,208
I'm not looking. I promise. See?

1158
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:55,955
I can't see a thing. All right. 
That's it. I'm out of here.

1159
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,464
It's all yours. 
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1160
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,292
That doesn't narrow it down.

1161
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:03,421
There's, like, mini golf and sushi. 
Carry on!

1162
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,806
Will you promise me, 
now we'll finally be alone?

1163
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:11,811
I promise.

1164
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:14,898
-Promise? 
-I promise, promise, promise.

1165
01:38:15,000 --> 01:45:14,898
