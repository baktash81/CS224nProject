1
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,610
<i>The smell of burning flesh.</i>

2
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,830
<i>Screams of agony</i>

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,230
<i>mixed with the whistle</i>
<i>of falling bombs.</i>

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,390
<i>"Take them", he said.</i>

5
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,710
<i>"Take them..."</i>

6
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,270
<i>And he thrust me the bag,</i>
Herr Beuler.

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,550
"..for the new order."

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,390
He knew he'd be killed.

9
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,070
Still he thought only of the new order,

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,960
only about the dream.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,110
A dream for which I have lived.

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,390
A dream... that you have destroyed.

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,960
Herr Brandt...

14
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,270
We thought we could protect you
better by using the Sicilian.

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,230
Sicilian? He is an American gangster.

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,230
Sam Diagusta.

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,670
A common criminal, a mob boss.

18
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,510
You give him the jewels to sell
and he steals the money.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,320
You say to me, "How I was to know?"
You should know!

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,960
Herr Brandt...

21
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,990
we have made a terrible mistake.
But steps are being taken.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,720
To make matters worse...

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,310
you come to me saying
you've killed him.

24
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,070
How does this help? Huh, huh?

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,020
Before he died,
he told us where he put the money.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,430
In a safety deposit box
in San Francisco.

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,870
Now it's simply a matter
of getting the money out of the box.

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,710
- How is this to be done?
- Very easily, Herr Brandt.

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,910
We have Diagusta's wife.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,230
We'll hold her
until the banks open in the morning,

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,110
we'll take her there,

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,460
and have her open the box.

33
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,990
In two days, I will be in Los Angeles.

34
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,150
You will hand this money to me,
Herr Beuler...

35
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,350
or you will pay for your failure...

36
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
with your life.

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,310
Herr Doctor, I accept the challenge.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,760
Nothing...

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,150
Nobody will stand in our way.

40
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
Nobody.

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,800
We'll just drill the box.
We have the tools.

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,310
I really wish that Mr Railsworth was in.

43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,510
I've never done
anything like this before.

44
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,990
- It's a normal procedure, Mr...
- Ross.

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,190
Ross. Agent Claud Armbruster,
Treasury Department.

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,320
Well, I guess we're gonna drill
Mr Diagusta's safe deposit box.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,440
We do have a court order to freeze
Mr Diagusta's estate. Fellas, would you?

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,710
<i>San Francisco National Bank.</i>

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,990
I do wish that Mr Railsworth were here.

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,390
I've never done this sort of thing
on my own authority.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,670
Excuse me, please.

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,830
Mrs Diagusta's here to open
her husband's safe deposit box.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,830
OK, sign the slip, please.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Just a minute.

55
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,430
Oh, my...!

56
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,630
Must be over a million dollars!

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,070
Uh-huh, just what I thought, real money.

58
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,230
- Perfect plates too, look at that.
- Alright, pack it up.

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,790
I don't think
we'd let this leave the bank

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,440
until Mr Railsworth comes.

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,630
He'd be in by ten thirty.

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,350
Love to, Mr Ross,
but I'm sure you've heard

63
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,950
that the Federal Government
waits on no man

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,270
and today, it'll include Mr Railsworth.

65
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,310
Your receipt. Are you ready?

66
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,830
I've got a meeting
with the director later.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,030
- So move it.
- Mr Ross...

68
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,950
Ah, Mrs Diagusta!

69
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,030
She wants to look
at her husband's safety deposit box.

70
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,390
Oh, but the box is...

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,630
Oh, that gentleman there
is from the Federal Government.

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,830
They drilled your box!

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,910
Ah, damn it!

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,830
Let's go! Get that tin off!
This ain't funny.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,910
You said ten grand.
There's got to be a mill here.

76
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,550
Stand on it!
Beuler says we gotta get them!

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,140
<i>"Savage says,</i>
<i>'Watch out for blondes with cute names.'</i>

78
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,110
<i>'They look innocent and beautiful,</i>
<i>but they can kill you.'</i>

79
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,950
<i>This one was named Tink.</i>

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,710
<i>She stood on the threshold</i>
<i>of my apartment,</i>

81
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,550
<i>her dress tighter</i>
<i>than two sailors on liberty.</i>

82
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,990
<i>The Russian-made Tokarev 3.5 automatic</i>
<i>swaying slightly in her ivory hand.</i>

83
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,790
<i>She screamed at me and fired.</i>

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,350
<i>I took the lead high in my shoulder</i>
<i>and felt that trapdoor open.</i>

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,670
<i>I was down the rabbit hole again.</i>

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,990
<i>Down in the darkness</i>
<i>where Father Time wears a frocked coat</i>

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,670
<i>and holds your life</i>
<i>like a conductor's watch,</i>

88
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,710
<i>the seconds ticking down to zero.</i>

89
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,990
<i>I'd been here before,</i>
<i>death's waiting room.</i>

90
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,270
<i>The outer office to eternity.</i>

91
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,270
<i>Savage says, 'The ones with the cute</i>
<i>names are hiding something.'</i>

92
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,430
<i>Tink was hiding a killer instinct.</i>

93
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,150
<i>'Yeah, watch out for blondes</i>
<i>with cute names,' but I hadn't,</i>

94
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,590
<i>now the old man in the frocked coat</i>
<i>was writing in his book.</i>

95
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,310
<i>Under 'foolish', under 'dead',</i>
<i>he was writing my name.</i>

96
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,630
<i>Mark Savage, Private Eye."</i>

97
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Yeah?

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,640
Oh, yeah... sorry, Mr LaCrosse.
OK. OK, be right down.

99
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,110
"Under 'foolish', under 'dead',
he was writing my name..."

100
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,030
Lionel Whitney,

101
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,710
Private Eye.

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,830
Lionel, I'm in the elevator.
Hurry up. We're late.

103
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,070
- Meet us down the lot!
- There he is.

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,350
Hi. I guess we'll be needing a cab.

105
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,790
- Get us a cab, Lionel!
- That's what I'm doing, sir.

106
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,990
Well, guess this is getaway day.

107
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,950
Sure have enjoyed your hotel.

108
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,550
Come on, for crying out loud.
Where the hell's Bunny?

109
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,230
I got a cab. Isn't Bunny down?

110
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,430
I thought everybody was in the lobby.

111
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,150
- Just one cab?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,670
What are you going to do
with the luggage?

113
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,150
We'll get another one, sir.

114
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,820
Honestly, Herman.
Rush, rush, rush...

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,830
We will miss the plane.
He booked us on the 11 o'clock.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,430
With the rehearsal dinner,

117
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,670
it's better an early flight.
We could get back and unpack.

118
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,990
Three first-class and a tourist?

119
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,390
I'll take the tourist, sir,
I don't mind.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,710
- You don't mind, kid, huh?
- No, no.

121
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,150
But where's the luggage?
That luggage...

122
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,190
- Hi, stranger. Did you miss me?
- Yes.

123
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,990
Excited about tonight?

124
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,310
I'm gonna pretend
it's for real tonight,

125
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,040
then maybe afterwards,
I'll let you know...

126
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,590
Alright, come on.
What are you laughing at?

127
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,640
I hate San Francisco.
The people are so rude.

128
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,350
Give me that little blue bag.
It's my cosmetic case. I need it.

129
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,190
- Did Daddy tell you the surprise?
- Surprise, what surprise?

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Uh, this cab smells awful.
What makes taxis smell so bad?

131
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,670
Drunks throw up in them.

132
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,350
See that? I'll be glad to get home.

133
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,190
Come on, let's go.
Get in the front seat, Lionel.

134
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,190
Well, I guess we're off to the airport.

135
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,150
Daddy, tell Lionel the surprise.

136
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,950
Yeah, alright, I was going to save it
for this evening, but alright.

137
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,110
Since you are marrying my Bunny,
I don't have to tell you,

138
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,790
I don't need a son-in-law
sitting at a floor desk

139
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,430
taking security orders on the phone,
like some kind of dress clerk.

140
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,470
I have pulled rank with my department
manager and I'm having you moved.

141
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,470
- Can you get this car to stop bumping?
- Moved, sir?

142
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,950
Yes, I had a talk with Page,
one of our top institutional men.

143
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,630
I told him you had
the firepower for the job.

144
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,310
From now on, you'll be handling
all the top institutional boys.

145
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Isn't that fantastic?

146
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,950
You'll have your own office.

147
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,790
You'll be dealing
with important stockbrokers.

148
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,550
I don't want you to think
I'm not appreciative,

149
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,670
I've been giving the whole
securities business much thought.

150
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,750
With the recession, people
getting out of the stock market,

151
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,150
I think we're looking at a new decade
in stocks, about which...

152
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,510
If I might speak candidly,
I'm not that optimistic.

153
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Bull!

154
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,070
When the going gets rough,
the dress clerks jump out,

155
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,030
the tigers jump in and take the profits.

156
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,030
It's been that way,
it will continue like this.

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,110
You have to find out,
are you a dress clerk or a tiger?

158
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,350
I was thinking that maybe,

159
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,070
before we have
too many financial responsibilities...

160
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,150
Maybe is the time to,
as the saying goes, "Change horses."

161
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,070
And well, I've been giving much thought
to commercial real estate.

162
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,470
A lot of thought.

163
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,430
Are you playing with me here, Lionel?

164
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,270
No, sir.

165
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,030
I've gone out on a limb for you.

166
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,350
You start Monday.
Don't you mess it up.

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, no.

168
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
Does this driver have to hit
every bump?

169
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,390

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,310
We've the condensed New Testament,

182

I'll take the King James version.

- Yes.

Do you know the name
of the airport manager?

186

- Joseph Rupert.
- Rupert?

187

And head of security?

188
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,590
Lieutenant Klinehurst.

- Thanks.

I'm Father Flack. I've got
a meeting with Lieutenant Klinehurst.

196
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,820
Mr Rupert told me that the man would
meet me and I don't find him nowhere.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,590
He's head of security,
he could be anywhere.

198
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,430
- Maybe I could help you, Father.
- Quite possible.

199
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,550
I travel
with a large sum of money,

200

the proceeds of our May Carnival,
the Church's Greater Aid Society.

201

Oh, the Lord blessed us.

202
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,390
When I was about to board a plane
with...

203
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,940
I was wondering...

204
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,950
Is there some place you can take me
where I can be safe?

205
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,680
I hate to be of any trouble,
it's quite a tidy sum.

206
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,870
- Of course. This way.
- Oh, praise the Lord. Thank you.

Damn, he's slick. Come on!

208
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
Lionel, take my case.

209
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,430
Get me a "Forbes" to read.
I've got to call the office.

210
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,710
I'm trying to be nice

211
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,870

Nice? I mean...

214
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,670
Daddy almost kills himself
just so you can get a big break.

215
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,220
Institutional sales!

216
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,950
I don't like him making decisions
about my career without asking.

217
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,390
I don't want
the Institutional Department.

218
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,750
I'm bored with the stock market.

219
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,350
Lionel, Lionel,

220
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,110
I'm only gonna tell you this once.

221
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,230
This is my life too.

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,960
We are gonna have our house
in University Park,

223
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,790
we're gonna take trips,
we're gonna have a wonderful life!

224
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,870
I don't want to live in University Park!

225
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,750
I told you that, and your father.

226
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,560
You're angry because
he paid for the down payment,

227
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,390
you think he's going to act like he
owns the house because he paid for it.

228
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,390
Exactly! That's what I think.

229
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,110
He's gonna come and tell me
to cut the lawn and to paint the door...

230
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,670
Damn it, Bun,
that's not the way I wanna live!

231
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,710
I am going to pretend
that we never had this conversation.

232
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,190
I am going to erase it
from my mind, Lionel.

233
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,630
I'm going to pretend
it was five minutes ago

234
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,950
and we never said any of this.

235
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,310
Wait here, Father.
I'll try to find Lieutenant Klinehurst.

236
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,470
My angina...

237
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,420
I took a glycerine tablet. The guy
told me I could lay down in here.

238
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,480
There's a sofa
in the locker room through that door.

Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling,
Clance, you see...

259
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,190
I had no time in the schedule, man,
so I decided, well,

260
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,630
since somebody killed Sam Diagusta,

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,230
I'd drop by his bank and make a small
withdrawal on your behalf.

262
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,950
Those guys are mob!

263
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,910
They'll kill you.

264
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
Look, Clance, I got your money, man.

265
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,510

Let's take this up.

294

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,710
<i>the one with bloodstains.</i>

335
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,790
<i>Old men and dead hookers</i>
<i>lounged there with me.</i>

336
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,510
<i>The voices of my mates came through</i>
<i>a wire and spilled out at me</i>

337
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,030
<i>through a broken speaker</i>
<i>screeching my obituary.</i>

338
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,070
<i>Mark Savage, Hollywood tough guy,</i>

339
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,270
<i>iced by a dippy dame</i>
<i>with a ten-pound Russian cannon.</i>

340
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,030
<i>I should have known she was a no-go</i>
<i>the day her mother came to my office</i>

341
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,790
<i>spilling cigarette ashes and wheezing</i>
<i>at me through yellow teeth.</i>

342
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,590
<i>'Find my daughter', she said.</i>

343
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,400
<i>I found her, she punched</i>
<i>my ticket with cold lead</i>

344
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,230
<i>and sent me to this place.</i>

345
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,710
<i>Savage says if you want to know</i>
<i>about a girl, look at her mother,</i>

346
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,390
<i>'cause that's what she'll be</i>
<i>in 20 years.</i>

347
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,550
<i>Her mother was a killer.</i>
<i>And under all that beauty, so was she.</i>

348
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,500
<i>I had ignored that advice</i>
<i>and so I got what I deserved."</i>

349
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,640
Oh, boy.

350
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,240
Is this seat taken?

351
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,630
No, no, no, go ahead.

352
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,830
I was in B-23,
next to this yucky stockbroker.

353
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,350
He kept trying to get me
to invest in his sex life.

354
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,870
- Martha Gribb. I'm a singer.
- Lionel Whitney.

355
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,440
I'm a... stockbroker.

356
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,590
Wingtips, conservative tie, Aqua Velva,
the whole depressing package.

357
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,670
- What kind of a singer?
- What kind of a stock...? You first.

358
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,790
Well, I'm in institutional sales.
It's really a great field.

359
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,910
You get to go to lunch
with important executives and...

360
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,870
well, go to New York and...

361
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,150
Well, it's just really, um...

362
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,800
Institutional could be the word
I'm looking for.

363
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,950
Were you in San Francisco on business?

364
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,110
No, with my fiancée and her family
to buy our wedding silver

365
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,550
and Bunny's trousseau.

366
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Bunny is my fiancée.

367
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,630
Mr LaCrosse had some business,
he's Bunny's father,

368
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,990
also my boss
at Gray, Johnson & Smith in LA.

369
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,470
What we did was, well, he and I went
to the San Francisco office.

370
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,440
It was...

371
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,550
well, a terrific holiday
and we had lots of fun.

372
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,030
Listen, maybe you can help me.

373
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
I'm trying to decide on a new name,
a stage name.

374
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,670
And my agent made these up. He doesn't
think Martha Gribb is a winner.

375
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,950
- Sissy Sherman... Amber Lane.
- I don't like that one.

376
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,110
Gigi Wilson... Mimi St. Cloud.

377
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,750
- Well, I don't know.
- Lousy, huh?

378
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,030
I've this theory...

379
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,390
Beware of girls with cute names,
they're hiding something.

380
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,270
So you marry a girl named Bunny?

381
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,990
- Oh, I'm sorry, I was only kidding.
- No, it's OK.

382
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,880
She was a cheerleader,
that's what everybody calls.

383
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,430
- I'm sure she's darling.
- She is, she is.

384
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,950
- We have a lot in common.
- Like what?

385
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
Well, what we do is... we spend time...

386
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,270
We like to read.

387
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,550
She's got a terrific sense of humour,

388
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,670
she collects antique chess sets...

389
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,870
Oh, you play chess?

390
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
No.

391
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,640
No, I don't.

392
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,870
I watch sometimes
when Bunny and her father play.

393
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,950
You play Clue?

394
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,030
I haven't played in years,
but it was a terrific game.

395
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,310
I've got one in my bag.
Do you wanna play?

396
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,390
- Yeah, let's.
- Oh, terrific!

397
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,710
Lionel, it's gonna be OK.

398
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,920
I mean, when people get married,
they tend to have second thoughts,

399
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,470
and evaluate where they're going.

400
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,390
The thing you have to do is listen
to yourself, listen to what you want.

401
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,870
You know what I want?
You know what I'd like to do?

402
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,160
I'd like to maybe buy a boat
and go sailing.

403
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,710
Just me and Bunny up the coast
to Vancouver.

404
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,150
Give us a chance
to know one another better.

405
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,800
Get to know one another?

406
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,750
It was very quick with us,
only three months...

407
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,070
sexual attraction,

408
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,830
I don't really get along
with her father.

409
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,270
I think he was about to can me
when we announced our engagement,

410
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,000
subconsciously,
maybe I was trying to save my job

411
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,310
and Bunny was trying to get back
at her folks for something.

412
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,710
Well, we sort of got caught up in it.

413
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,310
It was fun and parties and,
did I tell you she is very pretty?

414
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,360
No, you didn't.

415
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,240
You be Colonel Mustard.
He's an adventurer like you.

416
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,190
I'll be Miss Scarlet.
She's sexy and has a past.

417
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,270
Do you think daughters turn out
to be like their mothers?

418
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,710
Do they end up looking
like their mothers 20 years later?

419
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,910
I don't know.

420
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,950
I guess it's possible.

421
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,390
I suppose you'll have to roll the dice
and find out.

422
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,350
I'm getting patched through now.
Your aunt's OK.

423
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,270
I'm trying to get through to Don Rico.
Donato!

424
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,350
Donato! Yeah, I'm with Tommy. Hold on.

425
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,220
Get me this thing fast.

426
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,230
Your aunt Celeste is OK.

427
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,990
They picked her up
outside the funeral home

428
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,090
and dumped her out at the bank.

429
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,030
<i>She was really bummed out</i>
<i>over your uncle Sam being killed,</i>

430
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,630
<i>and she's kinda in shock or something.</i>

431
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,630
<i>I had Dr Goldberg look her over.</i>

432
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,110
Who? What? Where? Why? Gimme those.

433
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,990
We think your uncle Sam was selling
some jewels for a Nazi named Beuler.

434
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,030
We've got no first name or nothing.

435
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,190
Your uncle tried to stiff them
and these Nazis killed him.

436
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
<i>Where?</i>

437
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,070
We ain't sure yet.

438
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,950
We picked up one of his guys,

439
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,790
but the guy didn't stand up too well
under pressure.

440
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,030
Mike and me chopped a couple of fingers.

441
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,150
He went out before we could brace him.

442
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,590
I need a town, Donny.

443
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,830
Until I get a town, I'm sitting here
on the ground with my finger up my nose!

444
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,710
Maybe LA. The guy was yelling
something, sounded like LA,

445
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,310
when he fuzzed out on us.

446
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,390
Get what he knows,
then help him find the river.

447
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,950
One other thing, your aunt
Celeste says these guys, Nazis,

448
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,390
were chasing a shine outside the bank.

449
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,910
Nobody knows who he is.

450
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,870
But Celeste says he had a valise.

451
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Oh, terrific.

452
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,030
I love this more and more
every minute. LA.

453
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,590
So let me see,
I'm in the library with you at last...

454
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,280
I suggest that Professor Plum killed
Mr Green in the library with a rope.

455
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,520
Nope. My turn.

456
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,950
I think Mrs White killed Professor Plum
in the kitchen with a lead pipe.

457
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,470
Uh-oh, I think that's it.
I don't have those.

458
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,950
Oh! I would have had that if I could
have gotten to the kitchen.

459
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

460
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Yeah.

461
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,030
So what kind of songs do you sing?

462
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh, all kinds!

463
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,750
Pop, forties, some show tunes,

464
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,070
a little cross-over country-western...

465
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,350
I'd love to hear you.

466
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,350
I've got 2 weeks solid
at the Town Club.

467
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,790
It's a little nightclub off Sunset.

468
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,510
My agent says Betty Page started out
there about a million years ago.

469
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,270
It's my first real booking.

470
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,710
I've been at the Music Conservatory
in New York for 3 years,

471
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,660
but it's time for me to sort of bust
loose and take the shot.

472
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,230
- It must be exciting.
- Oh, is it ever!

473
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,670
I mean, when I'm up there, you know,
with the mic in my hands,

474
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,320
singing a number...

475
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,750
Entertaining is like being on top
of the highest mountain.

476
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,310
And If they love you, they applaud.

477
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,830
If they stand up and applaud, my heart
races and you can't get enough air...

478
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,310
and you feel warm all over.

479
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,550
And if they don't?

480
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,150
That's horrible, it's just horrible.

481
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,910
The way I look at it,
you'll never get the highs

482
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,670
if you don't risk the lows.

483
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,710
Yeah, I guess you're right.

484
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,510
I hope you'll come and see me.
I'll write it down for you.

485
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,320
I wish I could.

486
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Well, who knows?

487
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,910
Trouble is, with the rehearsal dinner,

488
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,030
all our friends coming in,
family and everything...

489
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,160
Oh, yeah.

490
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,590
Well, anyway...

491
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,950
Yeah, anyway.

492
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,910
<i>LAX to CGA 365 heavy. This is</i>
<i>LA radar control. You're on the scope.</i>

493
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,350
<i>Welcome to smogsville.</i>

494
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,630
Roger LA. 250 knots.

495
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,150
Except for a few little minor goodies,

496
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,390
it was a smooth, well-handled flight.

497
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,550
I'm late for a check hop to San Diego,
always too tight.

498
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,270
If you can put this thing down,

499
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,670
arrange for a car
to meet me at the jet pad,

500
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,710
take me over to CGA flight control,
I'll sign you off

501
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,110
and we'll skip Palmdale this year.

502
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,910
This is CGA 365 heavy to LA Tower

503
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,390
requesting a ground unit
meet us at the dock.

504
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,830
Special transport
to CGA flight operations.

505
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,590
We've got a check pilot
with a tight one.

506
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,030
<i>Continental Airlines flight 365 now</i>
<i>arriving from San Francisco at gate 19.</i>

507
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,510
This guy is not getting past us.

508
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,070
Anybody screws up on this,
he's in deep, deep trouble.

509
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,950
He's not getting past us.

510
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,910
<i>Continental Global Airlines...</i>

511
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,830
It's gotta be him, he's got the bag!

512
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,830
How did he work that?

513
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,320
Move it!

514
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,430
Take 5 guys.
Cover every exit from the field.

515
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,190
I'll take the rest and check
the terminal. Let's go!

516
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,550
I guess they're already there.

517
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,520
I guess.

518
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,830
Have a terrific life, Lionel.

519
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,480
You too.

520
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,190
Can you believe airline food?

521
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,310
You could retread a tyre
with that omelette.

522
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,200
Did you miss me?

523
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Yes.

524
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,040
<i>Will Mr Lionel Whitney please</i>
<i>come to the white courtesy telephone?</i>

525
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,160
Go on, get it. Come on!

526
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,160
I'll be right back.

527
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,350
This is Lionel Whitney.

528
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,560
Mr Whitney, yes, this is Sam Mayfield,
your limousine driver.

529
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,980
- Limousine?
<i>- Yes!</i>

530
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,710
Mr Gustafson and all the folks down at
Gray & Johnson sent me to pick you up.

531
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,150
Gusty did that? No kidding? A limousine.

532
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,910
Yes, he says to me,
"Mr Whitney is getting married,

533
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,270
you go down there
and take him wherever it is

534
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,270
that he wants to go."

535
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,470
What a terrific thing.

536
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,430
I have Mr Johnson's
personal limousine parked at the kerb.

537
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm down at the baggage claim
on the phone here now.

538
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,150
<i>If you tell me what it's you got on,</i>

539
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,750
<i>I'll be able to find you</i>
<i>around the luggage area.</i>

540
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,910
Yes, great. Good idea. Um...

541
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,990
I'm real tall, dark hair. I'm wearing
a grey 3 piece suit and maroon tie.

542
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,110
That's fine, sir.
Mr Whitney, welcome home, sir.

543
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,670
Thank you, Sam. Thank you.

544
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,270
- What the hell was that all about?
- Limo.

545
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,150
The guys from Gray & Johnson sent a limo
to pick us up. Isn't that great?

546
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,350
Why not? Let's go!

547
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,080
I hope they were smart enough
to make it a stretch.

548
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,390
We'll never get all the luggage
in one car.

549
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,790
Scottie Maitland, kerb attendant.

550
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,270
You're parked in a 5 minute zone.
You have to move your limousine.

551
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,030
I've just got here.
Come on, don't hand me this.

552
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,110
I do this for a living.
The gig is hard enough as it is.

553
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,950
Take the car and move it around.

554
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,670
Come on. Be a buddy, will you? It will
take me twenty minutes in this traffic.

555
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,150
My people will be out in a minute, OK?
Be a pal, right? Please, do it.

556
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,640
Hey, look, come on.

557
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,350
My supervisor catches me taking money
for this, I'm out of my kishkabob.

558
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,910
I tell you what, come here.

559
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,350
You go inside and see
if you can find your guy, understand?

560
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,030
- But you make it fast.
- Alright. Thank you.

561
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,110
- Yes, go on now.
- I'll be right back.

562
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,760
Would you go on?

563
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,880
<i>The white zone is for loading</i>
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

564
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,520
<i>No parking, please.</i>

565
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,150
<i>The white zone is for loading</i>

566
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
<i>No parking, please.</i>

567
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,990
- Mr Whitney!
- Sam?

568
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,430
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Yeah, we've got a lot of bags.

569
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,950
Let's get to it, shall we?
Come on, let's go.

570
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,270
Yes, sir, right away. I guess you folks
must have had a mighty nice trip.

571
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,510
Driver!

572
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,070
- Put my cosmetic case in the back seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

573
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,670
Will you let the boy get
the bags? That's what he is paid for.

574
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,710
- I'll get those. Sam will get them.
- I'm doing it, sir.

575
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,440
Y'all must be might happy
about the wedding.

576
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,110
My wife, Mary Ellen, she says,
"Sam, you sure do love weddings."

577
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,550
And I guess I do.

578
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,550
All them fine cakes,
and crunchy cookies...

579
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,940
I'll get that, sir.

580
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,550
Folks throwing rice...

581
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,590
Would you, please?
We're running late!

582
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,430
I told you to put that little blue bag
on the back seat, driver.

583
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,990
Blue bag, blue bag!
Blue bag in the back seat.

584
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,190
- Easy as pie.
- I'll get that, sir.

585
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,920
Why don't you get in the coach,
make yourself comfortable?

586
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,700
Alright?
And I'll take care of all of it.

587
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,550
Just... go on.

588
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,150
<i>White zone is for loading and unloading</i>
<i>of passengers only. No parking, please.</i>

589
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Hey!

590
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,750
Should be on our way now,
Get those doors closing fast.

591
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,750
- What the hell are you doing, driver?
- Slow him down, Herm.

592
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
The throttle got stuck.

593
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,630
We don't know what's causing it.
I've been meaning to fix it.

594
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,160
I guess you folks must be glad
to be back in the City of Angels.

595
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,470
We've been having some great weather.

596
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,070
What are you talking about?
I read we hit a third-stage smog alert.

597
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,470
I don't pay that no mind, sir.

598
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,190
You see, my wife's sister,
she's the barometer in the family.

599
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
She has emphysema.

600
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,110
I figure like this,
if the old girl's breathing,

601
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,670
then, well, the weather is not that bad.

602
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,550
Now, if she goes wheezing,
then we had ourselves some smog.

603
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,470
Driver, would you mind?
I could use a little silence.

604
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,670
You won't hear another word out of Sam.

605
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,910
Sit back, relax, 'cause I want you
to surely enjoy this ride.

606
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,300
I'm not much of a talker.

607
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,550
My wife always says,

608
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,710
"You're probably one of the most
quietest men I know."

609
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,510
I'm always watching television
with the kids, but I want you to relax.

610
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,710
I want to get you home safe and quietly.

611
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,150
I want you to kick up your heels back
there. I've got some sodas.

612
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,030
Lionel, be on time. The rehearsal dinner
is at nine o'clock sharp.

613
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,590
- That means wear a tie.
- Of course, and I'm always on time.

614
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,190
Our friends from Michigan are
coming in, try to remember names.

615
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,870
It makes a better impression.

616
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,030
We have to get to the Shermans'
for lunch at two o'clock!

617
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,840
Driver, bring my three-suiter up here.

618
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,990
Yes, sir! Coming right up!

619
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,910
Can somebody get that telephone?

620
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,790
Now, make sure Fred orders
the boutonnières on Friday.

621
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,030
Be sure the ushers pick up
their tuxedos by ten tomorrow.

622
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,840
In 20 minutes. It's 2:00.
Will you get the lead out?

623
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,750
Herman, will you stop yelling at me?

624
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,640
You gonna miss me?

625
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,830
Yes, Bunny, of course.
Why do you keep asking me that?

626
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,990
Because I'll miss you, silly.

627
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,510
I'll see you tonight.

628
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,590
Would you please shake a leg?
We've got to meet the Shermans at 2:00.

629
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,550
Will you stop rushing me?
The Shermans can just wait.

630
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,510
Who's wedding is it anyway?
Where is my blue bag?

631
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,870
Mighty nice folks them LaCrosses.

632
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,870
- Oh, yeah, real nice.
- Yeah.

633
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,390
That Mrs LaCrosse really knows
how to snap a whip, doesn't she?

634
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,950
- Can I ask a hypothetical question?
- What do you mean?

635
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,150
- A not-for-real question.
- Go ahead!

636
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,510
Do you think girls turn out to be
like their mothers 20 years later?

637
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,910
I'm glad you asked me that question.

638
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,430
In the Mayfield family,
we've got ourselves mostly girls.

639
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,080
Except for me and my brother,

640
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,070
counting all the cousins,
there must be about 15 girls.

641
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
I've been watching them girls
grow on up like weeds

642
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,430
and I tell you,
each and every one of them

643
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,790
is a spitting image of their mother.

644
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,550
Now, what I say is, you wanna know
about the daughter? Watch the mama.

645
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,000
Savage says that too.

646
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,700
With a thing like that,
there are no sure rules.

647
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,230
No, I guess you've gotta...

648
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,160
depend on the odds.

649
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,510
Yes, I suppose you do.

650
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,910
- Where to?
- 2365 Elm Circle Drive.

651
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Yes, sir.

652
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,990
Take a right on Flower,
it's a block and a half up.

653
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,390
Take a left on Flower,
it's two blocks up.

654
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,670
That's it there. Park it
in front of the Datsun.

655
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,870
Yes, sir.

656
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,680
That's it! Stick with them.

657
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,510
What are you doing?

658
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,270
No, no. Back there.

659
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,910
What are you doing?

660
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,680
What are you doing?

661
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,270
What are you doing?

662
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,350
Hey, give me the keys!

663
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
What?

664
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,950
Oh, no! Look at what I did.

665
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,150
Hey. Um... 50 dollars for your lunch
pail and your hard hat, eh?

666
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,590
- What?
- Yes or no, man?

667
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,240
- Yes.
- Thank you.

668
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,480
There!

669
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,350
Come on. He's long gone.
Let's get out of here.

670
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,670
What is this?

671
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,830
Sardines and peanut butter.

672
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,350
Nobody puts sardines on peanut butter.

673
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,030
You do if you like it.

674
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,680
Then you eat it.

675
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Sam.

676
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,080
Sam.

677
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,200
Hey, hey, come back here!

678
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,910
- Whitney! How's the man?
- Hey, you made it.

679
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,480
How did you get inside?

680
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,590
9 out of 10 guys hide
their front door keys in porch pots.

681
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,870
I'm surprised at you.

682
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,520
Hey, listen...

683
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,670
- Gosh it's great to see you!
- So, what's up?

684
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,350
Was that you spinning those donuts
out there on the street before?

685
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,470
You won't believe
what just happened.

686
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,830
The guys from the office sent a limo
to pick me up at the airport.

687
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,670
The driver was bringing me back.

688
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,480
Then, about six guys in a sedan
are chasing this guy.

689
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,360
He blows out of here in the limo
and takes off running.

690
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,550
I used my karate on one of them
to escape.

691
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,830
You're kidding.

692
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,560
Do you think I'm kidding?
I never used my karate before.

693
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,510
Mr Oklahoma says you're not supposed
to use it in anger, it's a sport.

694
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,550
I feel so guilty about that.

695
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,190
Boy, I tell you one thing, it sure
works.

696
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,950
I almost kicked that guy
into next year.

697
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,360
I'm gonna get my bag,
have a drink, take a shower.

698
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,110
What am I gonna do with this car?

699
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,030
Take a look at the registration.
Get the name of the owner.

700
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,360
OK.

701
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,550
Excelsior Limousine Company. Bell
Gardens.

702
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,200
Where's my suitcase?

703
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,630
There's supposed to be
one of Ruth LaCrosse's bags

704
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,590
that she's always braying about.

705
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,750
That driver must have
unloaded my bag at their house.

706
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,150
I'll have to switch them
at the rehearsal.

707
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,390
This week is turning into a nightmare.

708
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,070
Wait till you and Bunny
get to your wedding night.

709
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,750
I mean, take it from me, she's dynamite!

710
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,430
What I mean... what I mean is
she's probably dynamite.

711
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,150
I mean, it's just a guess.

712
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,830
It's like you know first-hand.

713
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,870
Hey, bunky! Give me a break.
I went out with her first. Remember?

714
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,270
- But you said you hadn't done...
- I said we never made it and we didn't.

715
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,910
But I was talking spiritual stuff.

716
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,270
You know, transcendental meditation,
oneness of soul...

717
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,270
Come on, let's not make a big thing
out of nothing, OK?

718
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,430
I'm gonna call this limo company.

719
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,030
Hey, look, buddy. Can I borrow the
Datsun?

720
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,660
I've got to check on
tuxedos and boutonnieres.

721
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,990
I've gotta pick up my folks
at the airport.

722
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,750
I'll probably miss the dinner,
they don't get in till nine but I...

723
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,390
Oh, great! You're a pal, buddy.

724
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,080
Eh, listen.

725
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,640
About Bunny...

726
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,150
She never really liked me. I mean,
not really, not after the first time.

727
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,270
Hey...

728
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,840
I'll see you, bunky, eh?

729
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,480
No sweat, right?

730
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,750
No sweat?

731
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,230
"Excelsior Limo. 5556787."

732
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,420
- I reported the car stolen.
- It happens always.

733
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,750
Guy boosts the car
when he's high on drugs,

734
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,950
decides to return it when he comes down.

735
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,670
The guys at the office sent it.

736
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,630
We checked with Mr Gustafson,
said they didn't send it.

737
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,750
When we get the latents off
the steering wheel and mirror,

738
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,790
we'll get a set that matches yours.

739
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,270
I drove the car home
after the driver took off.

740
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,630
Please, I'm supposed to get married
on Saturday.

741
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,990
Ronald Rouche.
Rouche-Rittelman Attorneys.

742
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,910
Here to see Mr Lionel Whitney.

743
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,110
Who are you? I didn't call an attorney.
They said my attorney...

744
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,430
It's you. You're the one who got me
here! You stole that car!

745
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,510
This man stole the car,
he stole the car! Arrest him!

746
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,950
- Hold it, hold it!

747
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,790
Ron Rouche.
I'm with the Public Defender's office.

748
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,830
I think he's gonna be OK, um...

749
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,480
But we may want him isolated.

750
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,470
- Maybe do a psychiatric...
- A what?

751
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,150
I'll try and keep him quiet,
just give me a bit more time.

752
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,030
OK. But if you can't...

753
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,070
I'm gonna have to haul him out of here.

754
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,750
We need some background information
for our office. Mr Whitney, please.

755
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Sit.

756
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,400
You're no attorney.

757
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,790
You're no car thief either but we're
both in here just the same. Lighten up.

758
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,110
It's just a petty car thief, man.

759
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,550
- They're not gonna tube you for that.
- Tube me?

760
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,670
Yeah. I mean, especially
since it's your first offence.

761
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,390
You draw a little probation, watch
your step, keep your nose clean.

762
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,950
Most they can do is take away
your voting rights.

763
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,150
- Who can pick a candidate?
- I will not get busted for this.

764
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,590
This man stole that car,
no doubt about it.

765
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,190
- It's a frame!
- Hey! Knock it off.

766
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
This guy will throw you
into the head ward.

767
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,040
Look...

768
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,160
Lionel, I came here to tell you I'm
sorry.

769
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,830
I was moving fast, man.

770
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,590
I was improvising...

771
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,190
And you, you just got in the middle,
that's all.

772
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,430
And I've come down here to help you out,
OK?

773
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,990
Who in the hell are you?

774
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,830
- Alright.
- Alright?

775
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,190
- I'll tell you.
- OK.

776
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,000
- You have a right to know, sir.
- Uh-huh.

777
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,480
I'm putting my life on the line
by telling you this.

778
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,670
I'm Agent Hume Stoval, ATF.

779
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,560
I've been working
on a big international smuggle.

780
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,910
Brown Mexican snow.

781
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,510
That's unprocessed heroin.
It's been coming on donkeys.

782
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,030
Donkeys or mules
is what we call a carrier.

783
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,470
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Who's head of it?

784
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,630
- Morrie Feldman.
- Wrong. It's Abe Whitfield.

785
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,590
I'm a law enforcement buff!
You're a trickster.

786
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,350
You're about to take a fall for GTA.
You must cooperate.

787
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,750
I won't! First you are Stepin Fetchit.

788
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,990
Then you're Sidney Poitier,
now you are Ephram Zimbalist.

789
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,390
Why don't you get out of here?

790
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,790
- Very well.
- Very well.

791
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,520
I'll call your father-in-law.

792
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,670
He'll kill me!
Why you do this to me?

793
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,320
Sit down!

794
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,430
Lionel, you gotta stay frosty, man.

795
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,030
He wants to throw you
into the hamster cage.

796
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,360
Li... Lionel.

797
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,080
Lionel.

798
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,070
Five hundred dollars will get us off
with the limousine service.

799
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,910
And I know a bail bondsman
that can get you loose.

800
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,110
If you pay them five hundred dollars,
what happens?

801
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,830
They don't press charges
and everything just turns to dust.

802
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,240
- Get me out of here.
- Done!

803
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,670
- Would you slow up?
- Go away, leave me alone.

804
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,950
I got you out of there.

805
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,840
- You got me in there.
- Don't you want to know who I am?

806
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,640
This oughta be great. Let me guess.
You're an astronaut.

807
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,990
You and John Glenn and Mickey Mouse
got a bad re-entry

808
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,950
and landed on that limo?

809
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,470
My name is E.L. Turner.

810
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,110
I'm a bank teller downtown.

811
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,790
My ex-wife stole my daughter. I've
custody of her because she drinks.

812
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,430
She hired these bodyguards

813
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,830
and they're the ones who have been
chasing me to try to beat me up.

814
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,630
All I want is my daughter back.

815
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,870
I think my wife is trying to have me
killed.

816
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,520
I hate this one worst of all.

817
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,350
I left my bag in that car.

818
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,710
- I was wondering if you've seen it.
- That's why you got me out.

819
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,990
You left your bag
in my car and you want it.

820
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,720
What's in? They weren't looking for
Easter eggs.

821
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,830
- My insulin shot.
- You're a diabetic?

822
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,030
Yes, I can't get a prescription here...

823
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,870
Shut up! You want it? Fine.

824
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,430
The quicker I get you out of my life,
the better.

825
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,150
I hate to see you so exercised.

826
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,950
4 out of 5 cardiac conditions

827
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,580
are brought on
by this sort of hyperactivity.

828
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,790
Don't say more!

829
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,900
I don't have your suitcase, not now.
My best man has it in my Datsun.

830
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,720
I can't get to it
till the rehearsal tonight.

831
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,390
- I'll contact you.
- I'll meet you at the church.

832
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,950
- No, I'm not telling you where it is.
- Oh, I know where it is.

833
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,080
You're getting married in Bel-Air,
at Saint Veronica's. A lovely place.

834
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,990
- How did you knew?
- I know everything about you.

835
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,670
I know your blood type,
the kind of books you read,

836
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,390
about your magnifying glass.

837
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,390
You went through my luggage.
By the way, where is my bag?

838
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,510
I left it at Baby Ruth's
and Horrible Herman's by mistake.

839
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,310
Making cracks about my in-laws.

840
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,590
If you marry into that family,
you deserve to go to Camarillo.

841
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,630
I don't care what Mr Okahamu says.

842
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,990
If I see you again,
I will kick your head off.

843
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,110
I've tried saying I've just been playing

844
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,350
My feelings won't give me away

845
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,110
But you fill my heart every minute

846
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,080
Of every day

847
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,350
So I come back to you

848
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,350
Even though I never want to

849
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,230
It's the thing I always do

850
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,310
I just come running back to you

851
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,430
Though it's not very easy

852
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,990
I have to admit that it's true

853
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,520
I'm always coming back to you

854
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
Ooh.

855
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,150
Here she is!
Martha Gribb from East Turkeyneck.

856
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,310
Let's bring her back. How about
another nice round of applause?

857
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,550
Dynamite!

858
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Oh...

859
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,390
OK. You boozers, calm down.
Next show starts in 40 minutes.

860
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,990
Some clown in the back
wants to buy you a drink.

861
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,880
You came!

862
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,830
- I thought tonight was your rehearsal.
- It is.

863
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,390
- Aren't you supposed to be there?
- 10 minutes ago. You were great.

864
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,590
I mean, you're really, really great.

865
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,510
Isn't this place awful?
Look at the outfit they had me wear.

866
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,910
- I like it.
- They have a stripper.

867
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,700
She didn't go on,
she said she got some bad shrimp,

868
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,910
but I think she's just chicken.

869
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,910
You went on, you were giving it
your all, you were trying.

870
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,830
If they aren't smart enough to realise
you're great then it's their loss.

871
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,670
- This place is a bummer.
- No, it's not, it's great!

872
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,990
You're great! You're wonderful!

873
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,590
So, how's Colonel Mustard?

874
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,590
- Talk to Professor Plum lately?
- He's dead, remember?

875
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,390
Mrs White beat him to death with a pipe.

876
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,800
Yes? What do you want?

877
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,030
This is a private conversation.
Leave this table, please.

878
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,710
- Lionel Whitney.
- How do you know my name?

879
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,720
This came off my suitcase.

880
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,390
I've got my hand in my pocket

881
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,230
and there's a 38 pointing
at your belly button.

882
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,630
Now, you and the chirp, here,

883
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,790
just get up slowly
and we'll leave this place real quiet.

884
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,710
Please, leave me alone.
I don't know what's going on.

885
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,790
I know you think I do, but I don't.

886
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,310
Just do what I say.

887
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,670
But leave her out of it. Don't take her.

888
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,550
If we blow the place, she's gonna scream
her head off to the cops.

889
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,200
Come on.

890
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,120
- Lionel...
- It's been like this all afternoon.

891
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,680
I said let's go.

892
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,910
Don't do this,
I'm supposed to get married on Saturday.

893
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,560
Stifle it, OK?

894
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,550
We found this shut.

895
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,440
The people that lived here
went to Miami, it's empty.

896
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,150
Get the lights on!
Don't set off the alarm.

897
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,100
Can't happen. We shorted it
and took out the batteries.

898
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,150
Come on, come on!

899
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,800
Come on! Move!

900
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Who's the skirt?

901
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,590
The singer at the club
where we picked him up.

902
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,160
I got it, I think I got it!

903
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,870
That's the patio! Shut it off!

904
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,870
So, you're Whitney.

905
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,900
Yes. Look, there's been a mistake.
I haven't...

906
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,750
If I don't get the straight poop from
you I will take you in the kitchen

907
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,670
and cut off three of your fingers.

908
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,230
- You what?
- Don't "What?" me, honey boy.

909
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,670
I'd like to get that straight.

910
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
OK?

911
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,240
Straight, right?

912
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,150
I like this guy, Chip.

913
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,150
He gets the picture fast.
I like you, Lionel.

914
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,990
I'd offer you a chair, honey,
but we ain't got one.

915
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,350
- Do you mind standing?
- Please let us go.

916
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,590
We didn't do anything.
I don't even know what is all about.

917
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
- Oh.

918
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,870
I like that, Lionel.

919
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,400
You don't tell the skirt nothing.
That's good, real good.

920
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,830
How you coming with the power, Philip?
I hate working in the dark!

921
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,870
I don't know, I think...

922
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,230
That's the driveway! Kill it!

923
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
OK.

924
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,360
Let's start at the top.

925
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,790
You work for this guy... Turner, right?

926
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,870
- Who?
- Turner, E.L. Turner.

927
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,230
Con man. They call him Tenspeed.
You're one of his operatives?

928
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,120
I'm a stockbroker
and getting married on Saturday.

929
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,600
People are chasing me...

930
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,270
See? Already,
I'm getting tired of you, Lionel.

931
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,550
I'm beginning to think about kitchens
and butcher knives...

932
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,080
if you get my drift.

933
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,390
Is E.L. Turner a black guy,
good-looking,

934
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,070
about medium height and muscular,
about 35 or 36?

935
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,670
- That's the guy.
- OK.

936
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,350
What this man has done to me
would fill a book.

937
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,710
I was returning from San Francisco,
he claimed to be a driver

938
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,550
and he picked us up, me and my fiancée
and her family, at the airport.

939
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,030
He drove us home and some guys
started chasing us.

940
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,430
Then I was arrested for stealing
the limo and this Turner,

941
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,670
if that's his name,

942
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,670
got the charges dropped
and he left his valise in the limo...

943
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,350
Hold it. OK. Valise.

944
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,590
Didn't what's-his-face say something
about a valise?

945
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,550
- Hemmet. Yeah.
- Get it!

946
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,200
Go get it!

947
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,390
- OK.
- Well, that's all.

948
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,230
The valise is in my Datsun

949
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,670
'cause I thought
it was Ruth LaCrosse's bag

950
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,910
and I won't be able to get it back to
Turner

951
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,150
until the wedding rehearsal tonight
at 10 o'clock and that's all I know.

952
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,550
Do you know this guy?

953
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,870
Well, let's hear it.

954
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,350
He's one of the ones
who was chasing Turner.

955
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,300
Well, what he is in fact, Lionel,
he's a Nazi.

956
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,030
You know me, I'm a patient guy.

957
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,310
But when these guys go on
and pop my uncle Sam,

958
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,110
shoot him in the head...

959
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,590
I'm losing my patience!

960
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,030
- Sam Diagusta was your uncle?
- Yeah.

961
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,350
You got anything more for me, chicky,
eh, eh?

962
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,870
- Please...
- Eh?

963
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,260
I told you everything.

964
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,270
I think you should lose
a couple of fingers, eh?

965
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,710
Get him out of here.

966
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,750
This guy, Hemmet, says my uncle was
fencing some diamonds for some Nazi

967
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,150
named Beuler.

968
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,990
He says my uncle Sam sold the diamonds,
kept the whole bundle...

969
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,990
told Beuler to go whistle for it.

970
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,030
So Beuler and his Nazi friends...

971
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,020
He put one in my uncle Sam's forehead.

972
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,550
In his forehead.

973
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,960
This makes me mad.

974
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,110
They pick up my aunt Celeste...

975
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,350
and they scare her silly.

976
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,640
She tells them the money
from the diamonds

977
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,190
is in uncle Sam's safety deposit box.

978
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:06,720
So, they drag poor aunt Celeste
down there to open the box.

979
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,900
That's where I'm missing a piece.

980
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,630
How the money gets from the box to this
guy, Tenspeed Turner, is a mystery.

981
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,430
But he ends up with it
and they're chasing him.

982
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,990
The money is fine, I mean, I like money.

983
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,030
But for this money, I do not lust.

984
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,190
But for killing my uncle Sam,

985
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,670
this is something for which
I will demand payment!

986
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,710
I don't know how to help you,
I'm just a stockbroker.

987
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,470
Don't believe him, Mr T.

988
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,510
When I picked them up, he and the skirt

989
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,910
were talking about greasing
some guy named Plum.

990
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,230
- They hit him with a pipe.
- No.

991
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,190
That's a game,
we were talking about a game of Clue.

992
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,430
Give me the number. You got it?

993
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,600
Come on. You call this number there.

994
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,510
You ask for that Nazi goofball, Beuler,

995
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,910
and you tell Beuler
you've got his money.

996
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,350
And you tell them show up
at the church at 10 tonight.

997
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,430
No. At the rehearsal?
That's my wedding rehearsal, don't...

998
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,710
- Hey! Do you think I care about
your wedding rehearsal?

999
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,440
I ain't fooling around here. Do it!

1000
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,740
I don't believe you.
Where do people like you come from?

1001
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
Me?

1002
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,910
Oh, I come from the Bronx.
I make my home in Manhattan.

1003
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,230
Fifth Avenue.

1004
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,510
- Beuler here.
<i>- This is Lionel Whitney.</i>

1005
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,230
<i>I've got the money. It's in a valise.</i>

1006
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,310
If you come to Saint Veronica's church
tonight, I'll give it to you.

1007
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,960
I want to talk to Hemmet.

1008
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,270
Where the hell was Lionel?

1009
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,030
We have a dinner and the groom
doesn't even show up!

1010
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,110
He'd better be inside or I don't know
how in the name of God

1011
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,070
we could have the rehearsal.

1012
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,720
The best man didn't show up.

1013
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,070
Fred is picking up his folks
at the airport.

1014
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,030
This is a private wedding rehearsal.

1015
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,190
Walt Rogers, but everybody calls me
Skipper. I'm the assistant organ master.

1016
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,470
If you need anything, ask old Skipper.

1017
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,830
The organ's been acting up
on the E stops,

1018
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,790
but I think it's gonna be alright.

1019
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,670
You folks, have a nice rehearsal here.
Remember, Skipper, OK?

1020
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,510
- Hi!
- Hi, honey! How are you doing?

1021
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,160
Father O'Brien?

1022
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,990
Father O'Brien?

1023
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,870
Where the hell is Father O'Brien?

1024
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,550
- He left the hotel ahead of us.
- He should be here.

1025
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,310
- We need the priest.
- Or the groom or the best man.

1026
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,830
It's a disaster
and it can't get any worse.

1027
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,230
- Yeah.
- Hello, my darlings! How is everyone?

1028
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,110
Mo, go around the side. Tiny, sit on the
girl.

1029
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,740
Do you see that Datsun
in the parking lot?

1030
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,790
No, but I see it
in front of the church.

1031
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,190
Ugh! Traffic was a dog!

1032
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,430
How are you doing, bunky?
Got the old butterflies yet?

1033
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,430
- Who are you?
- Friends of the bride.

1034
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,710
Do you still have that bag,
the black one?

1035
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,360
Yeah. Do you want it?

1036
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,400
Listen, why don't you go on inside
and tell everybody

1037
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,310
that Lionel will be in soon?

1038
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,960
Go ahead.

1039
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,270
OK, Whitney, walk in there
with this bag and see what happens.

1040
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,150
Those Nazis oughta make a move for it.
Just let them have the bag.

1041
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,710
We'll take it from there, OK? Go.

1042
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
Go!

1043
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,150
Lionel! Where have you been?

1044
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,750
If that priest will show up,
we can get started.

1045
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,000
Where were you? You've been
keeping us waiting for half an hour.

1046
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,190
Hello!

1047
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:51,720
Hello.

1048
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
- Who the hell are you?
- Father Dwight Morris.

1049
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,550
- Where's Father O'Brien?
- He won't be able to make it.

1050
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,110
- Why not?
- He was in a car accident.

1051
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,430
He banged his head,
they took him to the hospital.

1052
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,430
He asked if I'd sub for him.

1053
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,870
- He says not to worry, he'll be fine.
- Let's get on with it.

1054
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,150
Everyone gather around up by the altar.

1055
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,230
The bridesmaids on the right,
the groomsmen on the left.

1056
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,150
Who are the parents of the bride?

1057
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,910
- We are.
- Over here, please.

1058
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,390
Help! Get me out of here!

1059
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,560
Help!

1060
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,240
Hey, who are you, man?

1061
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,910
I'm Father O'Brien, he took my robes.

1062
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
Hey!

1063
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,390
I'll take that, son.

1064
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,470
We can't have you...

1065
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,310
go through this carrying a suitcase.

1066
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,200
- Give it here, please.
- What's going on up there?

1067
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,990
Stay right where you are.

1068
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,280
Let's go. Rehearsal's over.

1069
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,630
Martha, keep your hands out!

1070
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,350
The minister's been shot!

1071
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,480
Get out!

1072
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,630
Get out!

1073
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,790
Hey, look, I think we better
just control ourselves, man.

1074
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,350
Myself? I'll control myself. Get out!
I said get out!

1075
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,190
- You don't know what you're doing.
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

1076
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,150
Before you come any closer,
I'm instructed to inform you

1077
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,830
that my hands and my feet are considered
lethal weapons.

1078
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,070
And if you proceed from this point on,
it's at your own risk.

1079
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,880
I have a third-degree black belt.

1080
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,270
Me too.

1081
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,110
Come on...

1082
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,190
OK, alright?

1083
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,430
King's ex, OK? Uncle?

1084
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,390
Hey, come on.

1085
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,390
Hey, man! Uncle, OK?

1086
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,390
What's wrong with you, man?

1087
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,310
In 10 hours, you've just ruined my live,
you know?

1088
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,940
- Lionel, calm down.
- Calm down?

1089
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,150
You've put me between
the American Nazi party and the mob,

1090
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,430
and you say calm down?

1091
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,670
I'm gonna kill you! Whoever you are,
I'm gonna catch you and kill you!

1092
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,110
Reason can never prevail
in an atmosphere of violence.

1093
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,670
Don't you just love this guy?

1094
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,150
You're being very juvenile
about all this.

1095
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,070
Maybe it's time!

1096
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,430
I'm tired of being a doormat
for everybody.

1097
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,870
I'm gonna start doing the stomping,
and you're gonna be my first customer.

1098
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,510
Ah, two wrongs never make a right.
What happened to the Golden Rule?

1099
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,990
You know, things like,
"Live and let live." "Do unto others."

1100
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,790
"Don't strike out in anger."

1101
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,830
We're all going to get murdered,
don't you that?

1102
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,400
Lionel?

1103
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,510
It's the minister, Lionel.

1104
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,560
He's dead.

1105
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,910
That's no minister, he's a Nazi.

1106
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,510
I don't believe this.

1107
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,240
I don't believe this.
How can this be happening?

1108
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,880
Don't cry.

1109
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,160
Don't cry.

1110
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,150
I've never met anyone like you before.

1111
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,520
Never.

1112
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Is he dead?

1113
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,310
Forget it. I told you to get out of
here.

1114
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,670
Hey, man. You're mad at me,
I can get behind that.

1115
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,030
I mean, things have been a little
strange,

1116
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,790
but look, do you believe
in situational time warps, Lionel?

1117
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:50,080
That's where space and time come
together in little eddies of disaster

1118
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,630
sometimes sweeping innocent lives
into areas of total darkness.

1119
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,520
Gibberish! That's the kind of stuff
that gets me mad!

1120
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,710
Alright, come on, man,
stay frosty, OK?

1121
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,790
Atta boy.

1122
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,750
- I wanna see who this guy is.
- Good idea.

1123
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,550
See what's in his pockets.

1124
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,550
- Did you find anything?
- Yes.

1125
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,670
Gimme the cards.

1126
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,150
"Arrival Friday, E. Brandt.
Aero Paraguayous. Gate 38, 7am."

1127
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,960
E. Brandt, I don't know who that is.

1128
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,630
- Look for a secret compartment.
- Come on.

1129
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,550
Nazi's are cornballs,
and go for that sort of thing.

1130
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,550
Look for a secret compartment area.

1131
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,790
- Don't be angry.
- I'm not angry with you.

1132
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,950
- Voilà.
- Voilà.

1133
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,070
Oh, man, you're not gonna believe this.

1134
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,150
Seems like this guy
was Hitler's personal doctor.

1135
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,550
He took Hitler's getaway money
when everything was caving in.

1136
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,150
Over a million in diamonds.

1137
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,710
We've got Hitler's doctor,
can we ask for more?

1138
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,070
Just seems to sort of round out
the whole caper.

1139
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,150
Would you stop acting like
I put all this together?

1140
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,430
I wasn't even born
when this gig started.

1141
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,550
I'm really sorry I've got you messed up
in this, man.

1142
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,710
You're not gonna believe this,
but I'm really not a bad guy.

1143
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,190
You should never do your own
commercials, reeks of insincerity,

1144
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,910
I still don't know who you are.

1145
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,110
My real name is E.L. Turner.

1146
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,280
You see, E.L. Stands for Early Leroy.

1147
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,150
You see, I was born in a taxi
so my mother called me Early.

1148
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,750
Lionel, that's no excuse,

1149
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,550
but you try going through life
with a joke name and it distorts you.

1150
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,150
So what are we gonna do now?

1151
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,040
I don't know, Lionel,
I guess it's up to you.

1152
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,790
But what are we gonna do?
We can't just do nothing.

1153
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,510
We aren't gonna do nothing.

1154
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,590
All my life, whenever I've come
to a stop sign, I've stopped.

1155
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,750
This once, I'm gonna keep going.

1156
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,390
If this Nazi war criminal
is planning to come into the country,

1157
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,550
then one way or another,
I'm going to stop him.

1158
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,390
<i>The white zone is for loading</i>
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

1159
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,150
<i>No parking, please.</i>

1160
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,830
- What's going on?
- Do I know?

1161
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,190
You stay inside the car,
watch the money. We'll check this out.

1162
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,510
You stay inside, watch the money.
We'll check this out.

1163
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,670
Alright, let's go.

1164
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,240
OK, OK.

1165
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,150
<i>Flight 26 to Phoenix,</i>
<i>Denver and Fort Worth...</i>

1166
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,310
When's the Paraguayan team coming in?

1167
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,910
I think that's them now.

1168
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,800
<i>Passengers who have not checked in,</i>

1169
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,440
<i>please do so immediately.</i>

1170
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,160
I know what he's doing.

1171
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,750
Nazis have lots of political juice
in Paraguay.

1172
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,910
Erhardt Brandt,
he's going in with athletes.

1173
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,670
Athletes hand your passports
to a team coach

1174
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,870
- and he puts them through in 2 minutes.
- Says who?

1175
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,920
I was on the Pomona College Pistol Team.
We went to Mexico, it was like that.

1176
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,590
- Pistol team? You?
- Pistol team. Yes.

1177
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,670
You know, when I first met you,

1178
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,950
I had you figured
for another brown shoe.

1179
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,030
A person in a 3 piece suit,
brown shoes,

1180
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,790
Dow Jones square tie person...

1181
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,150
- You are insulting me?
- You're a marksman.

1182
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,110
Bang-bang, shoot them up.
I got you covered.

1183
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,790
- Not people, targets.
- Can we use the karate?

1184
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,470
Mr Okahamu says karate
should never be used in anger.

1185
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,110
Mr Okahamu is grossly misinformed.

1186
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,800
Strategy meeting.

1187
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,070
They are killers,
we must call the cops.

1188
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,240
- Can't.
- Why not?

1189
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,470
There's always a plausibility factor

1190
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,190
but this has no plausibility.

1191
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,310
- What are you talking about?
- A hypothetical situation.

1192
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,480
A what?

1193
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,790
You go to this cop
and say to this flatfoot:

1194
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,750
"Excuse me, but Hitler's doctor
is coming to town

1195
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,590
and a neo-Nazi party is here
at now to meet him.

1196
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,830
Now, Sam Diagusta's nephew
and about 50 of his thugs are here

1197
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,550
and they're gonna fight it out

1198
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,990
over some diamonds that the Nazi party
is fencing through the underworld."

1199
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,870
- What do you get?
- The truth.

1200
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,910
No, you've got
a low plausibility factor.

1201
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,430
Two options for him.

1202
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,750
He can risk being laughed off
the force,

1203
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,270
or he can wrap you up in newspaper,
ship you off to the lollipop factory,

1204
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,670
where you can watch television,
play cards with a bunch of nuts.

1205
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,320
It's the money, isn't it?

1206
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,550
If I tell the cops, you lose the money.

1207
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,710
You are a 3 piece suit,
do you know that?

1208
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,750
And you're gonna end in some morgue
with a tag on your toe

1209
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,750
'cause you haven't got a clue
about what you're doing.

1210
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,510
When I try, I can be very plausible.

1211
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,070
Brown shoe.

1212
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,750
- Officer.
- What is it?

1213
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,960
That man over there with a medical bag
is Brandt, Hitler's doctor.

1214
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,550
- Hitler is dead.
- No, in Germany, 30 years ago.

1215
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,870
He's a war criminal,

1216
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,790
I know it sounds nuts,
but he's trying to get in illegally.

1217
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,760
There are members of the Nazi party
here now,

1218
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,790
along with underworld figures, who...

1219
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,520
Forget it.

1220
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,140
Never mind, forget everything I said.

1221
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,390
Let's go.

1222
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,310
Make a move and I'll shiv you.

1223
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,950
I'm getting married on Saturday.

1224
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,510
Shut up! Take him to the bus.

1225
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:03,910
<i>Flight 26 to Phoenix, Denver and Fort</i>
<i>Worth, now loading at gate 11.</i>

1226
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,150
<i>All passengers who have not</i>
<i>checked in at the ticket counter,</i>

1227
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,800
<i>please do so immediately.</i>

1228
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:16,230
<i>The white zone is for loading</i>
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

1229
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,880
<i>No parking, please.</i>

1230
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,830
Well, well, the bridegroom.

1231
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,550
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but you're in deep trouble.

1232
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,990
I know about Hitler's doctor
and I've told others.

1233
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,750
And you can kill me if you want to,
but others will stop you.

1234
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,720
I want that money.

1235
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,440
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

1236
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,670
We have our ways
of finding out these things.

1237
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,310
I'm being held prisoner here!
Can I have some help?

1238
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,510
They're not what they seem to be!

1239
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,430
- That's Hitler's doctor!
- We can do something.

1240
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,710
Can you see him? What...

1241
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,360
Let's sit him back.

1242
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,080
I have no more time. Where's the money?

1243
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,440
I gave it to the police.

1244
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,950
If you don't tell us where it is
by the time this bus stops, you're dead.

1245
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,870
I have nothing more to lose.

1246
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,990
<i>The white zone is for loading</i>
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

1247
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,350
<i>No parking, please.</i>

1248
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,710
They have him! He is in the bus.

1249
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,790
I know. I saw.

1250
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,870
I told him to forget it,
he wouldn't listen. Now, look at him.

1251
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,190
- We should call the police.
- We can't do that. They'll kill him.

1252
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,350
You take this and you get in the car,
follow that bus.

1253
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,830
When you see the tail lights
start blinking,

1254
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,670
throw the money out the window.

1255
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:05,870
- What?
- Don't ask.

1256
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,760
You don't know what I've been through
for this money.

1257
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,550
- What are you gonna do?
- Drive the bus.

1258
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,830
You've got a flat!

1259
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,160
Huh?

1260
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,630
I said you've got a flat
on the left back tyre.

1261
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,070
Come on, I'll show you!

1262
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,880
- Come on!
- Just a minute, folks.

1263
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,080
You see?

1264
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,750
- Nothing wrong with that.
- You rolled over a nail, I saw you.

1265
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,150
Give me your hat, I'll hold it for you.

1266
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,310
This better not be no joke, mister.

1267
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:26,150
<i>In five minutes, we'll begin the open</i>
<i>ceremonies for the Pan American Games.</i>

1268
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,670
- Lionel, Lionel.
- E.L.!

1269
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,320
I hate to leave things half done,
don't you?

1270
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,960
Let's go!

1271
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,230
I'm crazy.

1272
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,750
But I'm not that crazy. Let's go!

1273
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,000
Now, you can tell them.

1274
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,640
Go on, Whit.

1275
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,550
This man was Hitler's doctor. He escaped
with a million in diamonds.

1276
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,910
The neo-Nazi party made a deal with
Sam Diagusta to fence them,

1277
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,300
but Sam didn't pay off.

1278
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,630
Are you listening?

1279
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,110
These Nazis made a deal with the Mafia
to fence diamonds in this country and...

1280
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,920
What are you doing?
This is the truth. E.L., Help me!

1281
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,670
What are they doing? E.L...

1282
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,470
Morris Ashton, track security.
What's going on? Can I help you, folks?

1283
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,150
I think we should move to separation.

1284
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,720
Two trials instead of one.

1285
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,550
No, if I get tried along with E.L.

1286
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,950
the judge will have to be more
lenient with the sentence, right?

1287
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,470
That's suicide. Would you tell him?

1288
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,200
He's right.

1289
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,550
You said
that since we gave back the money

1290
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,470
and since we did end up catching
a German war criminal

1291
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,790
and 10 mobsters and neo-Nazis,
that the judge might go easy.

1292
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,230
I'll see what I can do.
You got a job, Turner?

1293
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,070
Half a dozen, but none of which
I'm licensed or commissioned to do.

1294
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,720
But he's very good at them.

1295
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,440
Show them, Tenspeed.

1296
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,790
The move to separate
is neo-rhem pertinae.

1297
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,350
I realise you have
a difficult precedent here.

1298
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,300
If you cite Massachusetts v. Morris
Wilcox, you maybe convince the judge.

1299
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,750
- I know that case.
- Yes?

1300
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,710
- Jail house lawyer?
- No, sir, two years at Yale Law.

1301
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,230
I was expelled
for rigging a student election

1302
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,430
and skipping to Tijuana with the funds.

1303
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,080
You should have been with me.

1304
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,110
- Is he on the level?
- Almost never.

1305
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,150
- Guard. You wanted me to bring you this.
- Yes, thank you.

1306
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,990
- Is that all you want?
- Yes.

1307
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,990
I'd have an easier time,
if you had a legitimate job.

1308
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,470
The judge might find it
difficult to OR you

1309
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,550
if he thinks you're just gonna hit the
bricks and start up your con games.

1310
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,390
Tell the judge he's gonna be an employee
of the Lionel Whitney Agency.

1311
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,270
OK, I'll see what I can do.

1312
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,070
What kind of agency
is the Lionel Whitney Agency?

1313
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,270
I've given this a lot of thought...

1314
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Yeah?

1315
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,550
I'm gonna take out a licence,
become private detective.

1316
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,590
- Private eyes? Yeah?
- Yeah.

1317
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,310
Why don't we make it a talent agency?

1318
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,830
There's a lot of scams run on talent.
We can make a lot of money too.

1319
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,630
You're through with con games.

1320
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,110
If you work in my agency,
everything is straight up.

1321
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,830
- I don't know, private eyes?
- Yes, private eyes, you and I.

1322
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,830
That might not be bad. There's some
great scams we can run as private eyes.

1323
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,950
No, no scams. We're straight up.

1324
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,950
That's the way Mark Savage does it,
the way we'll do it. You with me?

1325
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,160
Yeah, I'm with you. Yeah, we'll be...
a laugh a minute, you know?

1326
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,720
Tenspeed and Brown Shoe.

1327
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,910
- E.L., wanna hear something great?
- Look, don't read me that book.

1328
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,830
It's kind of me and Martha,
I love this stuff.

1329
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,070
But look, you've got to be cool,
alright?

1330
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:36,630
I understand, but these guys don't...

1331
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,750
"Savage says
that all's well that ends well.

1332
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,710
But this one had ended
with Charlene back in New York,

1333
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,950
and me with a lump in my throat.

1334
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,150
Oh, yeah, I was gonna make it,
I was gonna be OK.

1335
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,550
All the rest of my days,
I'd carry her with me

1336
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,750
like a 20 pound weight on my heart.

1337
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,670
I would smell that perfume wafting up
out of my dreams

1338
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,430
to sting my cheek with tears.

1339
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,470
Yeah, I was gonna be OK.

1340
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,150
She was gone,
but I was still Mark Savage,

1341
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,160
private eye."

1342
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,150
- It's great, huh?
- It's magnificent.
