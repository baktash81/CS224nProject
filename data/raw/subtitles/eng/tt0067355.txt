1
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,027
Close the valve!

2
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,619
Before the fire comes!

3
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,547
There she is!

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,463
She has the seeds!
Get her!

5
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,912
Don't just stand there!
Go get her!

6
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,168
<i>Mary and The Witch's Flower</i>

7
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,778
I'm so bored!

8
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,782
Mary, have you finished unpacking?

9
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,960
I'm working on it!

10
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,961
Oh, no...

11
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,131
I've only made things worse...

12
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,901
Hello, I'm Mary Smith.
I just transferred here.

13
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,989
I hate my hair.

14
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,248
Lunch is ready!
Come on down!

15
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,491
Coming!

16
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,172
I wonder if she's all unpacked.

17
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,007
Oh, I doubt it.

18
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,095
The boxes were still
stacked high this morning.

19
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,351
Good morning, Great-Aunt Charlotte.

20
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,682
Good morning.

21
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,105
Miss Banks, please let me help.

22
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,351
It's all right.

23
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,859
Thank you, the tea was delicious.

24
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,033
I can take that.

25
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,205
Oh, my.

26
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,540
I... I'm sorry.

27
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,249
Like I said, it's quite all right.

28
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:04,964
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,131
Oh, Great-Aunt Charlotte.

30
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,800
Thank you.

31
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,522
Isn't there anything
I can help with?

32
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,068
Maybe that embroidery...

33
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,737
is too difficult for me.

34
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,904
You must be bored being with old folks.

35
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,153
Well, I didn't mean that...

36
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,833
There's no TV, no video games here.

37
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,577
But we do have a TV.

38
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,416
It's broken, though.

39
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,340
Oh my, it really is broken.

40
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,589
We'll get it fixed soon.

41
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,007
That'll be nice.

42
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,596
Say, your dad and mum
called last night.

43
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,514
Really? They're coming soon?

44
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,269
Their work isn't finished,
so it'll be a while longer.

45
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,195
Oh...

46
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,357
Good thing you came here early.

47
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,700
İf you'd come with them,
you would've been late for school.

48
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,790
There's still a week left.

49
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,704
Wu fly by.

50
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,961
Once summer is over,
the village will be teeming with kids.

51
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,716
I'll probably die of boredom first.

52
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,808
Perfect weather for a picnic today.

53
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,385
Thank you.

54
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,231
I'm sure the funeral
will be over by evening.

55
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,144
Okay.

56
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,405
It's Zebedee.

57
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,821
I'm going to the garden.

58
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,282
Don't get in the way of his work.

59
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,154
I know.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,832
Confucius, come along.

61
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,835
I guess you wouldn't.

62
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,087
Off I go.

63
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,585
Have fun.

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,217
She sure is a spirited little miss.

65
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,884
She leaps at everything she sees.

66
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,017
That's what I love about her.

67
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,352
Zebedee!

68
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,193
Huh, where did he go?

69
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,443
Zebedee.

70
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,863
What is it?

71
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,039
You startled me.
I didn't notice you there at all.

72
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,620
A gardener is part of the landscape.

73
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,791
Wow.

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,506
Let me help with that.

75
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,017
Thank you!

76
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,060
Be careful with them.

77
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,023
I will.

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,320
Um, uh... I'm sorry.

79
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,247
I should've known.

80
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,665
Children and dogs aren't
cut out for gardening.

81
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,424
A broomstick?

82
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,091
All right!

83
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:47,187
See, I knew I could do it.

84
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,687
But this is a bit big...

85
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,031
and hard to use...

86
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,215
So you're a person.

87
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,468
Thought you were a monkey.

88
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,229
A little red-haired monkey
covered in leaves.

89
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,730
Hey, that's no way to talk to a lady!

90
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,856
Oh, I almost forgot.

91
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,574
Hey!

92
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,409
Hello, Miss Banks!

93
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,996
Why Peter, good to see you.

94
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,827
Peter...

95
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,958
Mother asked me to deliver these.

96
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,499
Ah, thank you.

97
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,004
No vacation for you?

98
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,753
No, I've got work.

99
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,508
Is your mother well?

100
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,966
Yes, she'll come to the mayor's
funeral after work.

101
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,340
Then I'll see her later.

102
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,181
Zebedee, will you bring
the car around?

103
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,112
Right here, right here.

104
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,032
Later!

105
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,725
Want some?

106
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,403
Good? I'm glad.

107
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,660
It must be awful being a black cat,
everyone calling you bad luck.

108
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,666
I can relate, though.

109
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,339
I've got this frizzy red hair

110
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,551
and no friends to eat lunch with.

111
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,556
I end up failing at everything.

112
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,432
I doubt anything good will
ever happen in my life...

113
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,603
Hey!

114
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,027
Wait, I'm not finished talking!

115
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,445
It's grey now?

116
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,803
Now it's black again?

117
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,816
I've never been in the woods before.

118
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,112
Wait, I'll get lost without you.

119
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,707
Hey, I said wait for me.

120
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,184
It's all dried up?

121
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,490
There's two of you!
I see, you're a couple!

122
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,627
What's wrong?

123
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,723
How pretty.

124
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,484
I'm only taking one.

125
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,745
I wonder what it's called.

126
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,999
I'll ask Zebedee later.

127
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,586
Pretty, isn't it?

128
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,337
I found it in the woods.
The cats took me there.

129
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,171
A black cat and a grey cat.
I wonder where they're from.

130
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,012
The black one is Tib,
the grey one is Gib.

131
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,352
They're both Peter's.

132
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,097
Peter...

133
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,099
Oh, that boy's?

134
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,196
Not that cats ever belong to anyone.

135
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,735
We only assume they do.

136
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,279
But to think you found this
on your first trip to the woods...

137
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,998
She's called “Fly-by-Night...

138
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,700
"Fly-by-Night"?

139
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,998
A rare flower, she is.
I've never seen a real one before.

140
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:49,294
She only grows in these woods
and only blooms once in seven years.

141
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,385
They say even witches once
sought after her.

142
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,549
Witches?

143
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,801
That's right, the Witch's Flower.

144
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,390
The Witch's Flower...

145
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,266
What could that be?

146
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,527
Tib!

147
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,533
What's the matter?

148
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,369
Did something happen?

149
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,212
Have a fight with Gib?

150
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,207
Tib?

151
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,680
There, there.
There's nothing to fear.

152
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,303
We'll go look for Gib tomorrow.

153
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:40,910
Tib?

154
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,084
Where is he?

155
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,167
Maybe he went after Gib by himself.

156
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,081
Mary.

157
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,092
Good morning.

158
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:59,008
Morning. I have a little favor
to ask, if you don't mind.

159
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,515
A favor? Yes, of course!

160
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,101
Would you deliver this?

161
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,478
Sure.

162
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,978
I wrote down the name and address.

163
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,323
Okay, I'm leaving now!

164
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:20,704
Oh, and there's an awful mist today,
so don't go into the woods!

165
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,287
I know!

166
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,866
Take care.

167
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,793
“51 Village of Redmanor.
To Peter. ”

168
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,883
Peter?

169
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,302
Of all people, it had to be him.

170
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,278
Hey there, red-haired monkey.

171
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,321
My name happens to be Mary Smith.

172
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,824
So, you're called Mary.

173
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,582
Huh? What's this?

174
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,076
It's from Great-Aunt Charlotte.

175
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,331
Raspberry jam!

176
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,671
I love the raspberries from Redmanor!

177
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,006
Brilliant!

178
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,763
I better go thank her.

179
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,349
Ahem.

180
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,511
See you, I have to go look for Tib.

181
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,679
Tib?

182
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,772
Oh, so Tib went to your place?

183
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,607
He disappeared, though.

184
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,608
Is Gib there, too?
She's been missing since last night.

185
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,446
Gib, too?

186
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,037
Maybe they went back to
that place in the woods...

187
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,793
Stay away from the woods.

188
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,959
With all this mist, it's dangerous.

189
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,215
Don't follow me.

190
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm looking for Gib, too.
And of course Tib...

191
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,224
Don't do it! We can't go
into the woods on misty days!

192
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,228
Oh, so you're afraid?

193
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,555
Coward.

194
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,977
Hey, I said wait!
Red-haired monkey!

195
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,484
Be quiet!

196
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,114
I didn't choose to have
frizzy red hair!

197
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,402
I wish...

198
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,621
I could change!

199
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,620
Mary...

200
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,249
Leave me alone.

201
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,420
But you shouldn't...

202
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,590
Don't you dare follow me!

203
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,926
Fine, I won't!

204
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,514
I'll never, ever, ever, ever forgive him!

205
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,447
Look at that mist.

206
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,442
Tib!

207
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,200
I knew you were here.

208
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,832
Tib, that flower...

209
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,305
Ow...

210
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,972
This isn't where we were yesterday...

211
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,064
Tib!

212
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,408
What's the matter?
Why'd you bring me here?

213
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,535
A broomstick?

214
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,252
What's a broomstick doing here?

215
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,761
It looks awfully old.

216
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,266
There's something written on it,
but I can't read it.

217
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:03,482
Look, Tib. It's the perfect size.
Now I can help Zebedee.

218
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,958
Tib, what are you up to?

219
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,431
What's going on?

220
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,314
The flower juice...

221
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,771
Wait, wait...

222
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,623
Huh? What is...?

223
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,967
I'm floating!

224
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,662
No, no, no, no, no!

225
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,021
What is... happening?

226
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,361
We're going to crash!

227
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,782
I'm sure this is just a dream...

228
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,089
What a large building.

229
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,899
Stop! Stop! Stop!

230
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,823
Ow...

231
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,155
What just happened?

232
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,291
Why so many broomsticks?

233
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:53,333
Well well, you've made quite a mess.

234
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,386
I'll have to clean it up later.

235
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,508
But it looks like you'll be
needing a few lessons.

236
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,428
Poor broom deserves a better dismount.

237
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,266
There, there, there...

238
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,687
That's a good boy.

239
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,686
Hey, that tickles.

240
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,530
Here's your spot.

241
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,025
Get yourself some good rest.

242
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,862
Good boy.

243
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,457
Have you no love for your broom?

244
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,834
And brooms always go here!
That's a very strict rule.

245
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,549
I don't understand.
Where exactly am I?

246
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,169
Me? Flanagan's the name.

247
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:43,220
I used to teach broom riding,
and now I'm the stable master.

248
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,719
No, what I meant to ask was...

249
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,688
I know, I know.
You must be a new pupil, eh?

250
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,184
New pupil?
What do you mean?

251
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,697
"What do you mean," you ask,
with that fine cat as your familiar!

252
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,568
A familiar?

253
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,241
No, his name is Tib, and...

254
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,704
Ho! That's the first bell! Hurry!

255
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,087
They're strict about tardiness!

256
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,206
Hey, wait for me!

257
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,883
What a terrible dream.

258
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,928
And he called Tib a familiar!

259
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,264
Not a familiar?

260
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,394
Black as he is,
and with eyes like emeralds?

261
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:39,781
Next you'll be telling me
you're not a witch, won't you?

262
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,898
A witch?

263
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:45,661
Come now, hurry! You can't be late
for classes on your first day!

264
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,373
Like I said, I'm not a new pupil...

265
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,462
And here we are.

266
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,123
I'm out of breath...

267
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,675
Tib!

268
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,469
Familiars must be leashed on campus.
That's the rule.

269
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,812
Campus?

270
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,101
Yes, of Endor College.

271
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,104
Endor College...

272
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,610
This is the main gate.

273
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,654
Many a fine witch has
passed through this gate.

274
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:32,784
It's a prestigious school
dating back to the days of dragons.

275
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,831
Oh, yes.
I need to read you something.

276
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,925
Endor College Rule Number One.
Remember this, or you will pay dearly.

277
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,634
Pay dearly?

278
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,433
Ready? Ahem!

279
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:54,430
“Trespassers will be transformed."
Now, repeat.

280
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,688
“Trespassers will be transformed. ”

281
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,358
Those who enter wrongfully

282
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,700
will be transformed into
some other form.

283
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,044
New pupils get a tour from
the Headmistress herself.

284
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,458
Wait!

285
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,461
So long, until later!

286
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,463
He abandoned me.

287
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,516
Am I supposed to enter?

288
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,586
How strange...

289
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,063
This must be a mistake.
They'll let us out.

290
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,289
It's okay, I'm not scared...

291
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:04,102
Welcome to Endor College!
You must be a new pupil.

292
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,108
No, actually, I...

293
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,158
Look at this black cat familiar,
and this hair!

294
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,156
No, I'm...

295
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,368
You aren't, of course, a trespasser?

296
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,170
I'm a new pupil, Madam.

297
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,171
Excellent, excellent!

298
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,784
I am the Headmistress,
Madam Mumblechook. Your name?

299
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,544
What? Oh, Mary Smith, Madam.

300
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,710
Welcome to Endor College, Mary Smith.

301
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,683
This is the single finest
college of magic,

302
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,428
open only to the chosen ones.

303
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,889
College of magic...

304
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,398
Come, now. Let me
show you around the campus.

305
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,706
Sunlight is collected to
illuminate the campus day and night.

306
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,872
It's beautiful.

307
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,757
You like what you see?

308
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,095
It's Madam Mumblechook.

309
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,759
Look, Tib!

310
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,223
Hello, Madam.

311
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,933
Good day to you.

312
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,391
You have elevators, too.

313
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,476
They run on electricity.

314
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,726
Electricity is a form of magic, you know.

315
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,111
What? What's happening?

316
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:22,581
Let's tour the classrooms first.

317
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,592
This is the First Year classroom.

318
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,092
They're taking broom-riding lessons.

319
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:47,648
It takes over a year to gain
true mastery over a broom.

320
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,483
I see.

321
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,478
But you won't be needing it.

322
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,778
I noticed you were quite adept
with the broom.

323
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,155
You need to see our
more specialized fields.

324
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,405
Specialized?

325
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,493
Magic aeronautics,
magic history, magic chemistry...

326
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,417
We offer various majors in magic.

327
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,499
But we are perhaps best known

328
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:18,425
for transformation magic,
considered the most difficult.

329
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,138
Transformation?

330
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,432
Wow.

331
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,555
But it's an awful lot of studying.

332
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,816
Don't you have sports
or field trips?

333
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,357
We have our recreations, of course.

334
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:42,154
Indeed, this is a place for cultivating
excellence in both body and spirit.

335
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,498
We have ample facilities
for physical training.

336
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,327
This is amazing.

337
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,214
This is the dining hall.

338
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:59,382
We allow our students to eat
whenever and as much as they please.

339
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,673
They're using magic to cook!
Looks delicious!

340
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:09,188
It seems you have a remarkable talent,
Miss Mary Smith.

341
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,398
Truly phenomenal.

342
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,517
A talent? For what?

343
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:17,230
What else? For magic, of course!

344
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,365
The insignia on your hand is proof.

345
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,069
Oh, this...

346
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,615
I can already see it.

347
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,706
You're a once-in-a-century prodigy!

348
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,912
Mastering the broom already,

349
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:35,085
and taming such a perfect familiar
as a black cat with emerald eyes!

350
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:38,880
I'm not used to getting
compliments like this.

351
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,424
Oh no, it is indeed remarkable!

352
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,598
This flaming red hair of yours!

353
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:54,108
Red-haired witches have always
been the most superior.

354
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:58,730
No other hair color is
more coveted by witches.

355
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,575
Only prodigies possess this hair.

356
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,494
This is our laboratory.

357
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,590
In Second Year, you'll also
conduct chemical experiments.

358
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,964
Chemical experiments? Not magic?

359
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,757
It's Doctor Dee's class.

360
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:27,508
The renowned wizard,
the pride of our college!

361
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,259
You haven't heard of him?

362
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,979
Oh... of course!
The Doctor, right?

363
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,267
I'll introduce you to him.

364
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,153
Doctor! Doctor Dee!

365
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,318
Yes, Madam Mumblechook?

366
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,660
I was just about to analyze
the results of the earlier tests.

367
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,740
What warrants this interruption?

368
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,752
Magic experiments must be analyzed
with precise calculations,

369
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:00,170
on top of which we must
devise meticulous plans.

370
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,962
Allow me to introduce you to
Mary Smith, a new pupil.

371
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,808
A splendid talent with great potential.
And do look at her red hair!

372
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,644
Red is indeed a marvelous color.

373
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,810
Red is the most mature form
of a Philosopher's Stone...

374
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,023
though I wonder if it was
first black, then white.

375
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,147
In any case, nice to meet you, Miss Mary.

376
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,490
Nice to meet you, too.

377
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,325
Doctor Dee has long studied
the fusion of chemistry and magic.

378
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,823
A question for the able one.

379
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,370
If we call virtual reality worlds
from the Interbaila language “turtle”

380
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:42,875
and the approximate value of magic
in the ancient Eltel language “crane",

381
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:47,005
which of the two do you think
is the more effective approach

382
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,553
in terms of the Alphalabozome
nucleic acid anti-Entatium reaction?

383
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,222
- Uh...
- The turtle or crane?

384
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,520
Turtle... I think...

385
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,686
Turtle, you say? Impossible!

386
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,571
No, you may indeed be right!

387
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,909
You've carved a new path!
Madam, this child is splendid!

388
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,699
You're well versed in chemistry, too!

389
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,039
Well, I'm not so bad at science.

390
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,366
Very well!

391
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:20,371
I shall show you
our most advanced class!

392
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,879
Great!

393
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,759
This is our most advanced class.

394
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,771
But...

395
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,442
There's no one here.

396
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,439
I see the class is going well.

397
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,958
Wow...

398
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,292
They're practicing invisibility.

399
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,301
Let's see you try it.

400
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,927
You, Grizel!

401
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,634
Let her borrow yours.

402
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,224
But there's no way!

403
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,093
I've never done this...

404
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,890
Here!

405
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,601
Sorry, Tib.

406
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,692
Now look into the ball and concentrate.

407
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,442
The flower insignias!

408
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:38,325
Now dissolve your cells down
to the level of unconsciousness!

409
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,870
Then use magical fusion
to cloak yourself!

410
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,464
Fine, whatever happens will happen.

411
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,554
Disappear, disappear, disappear,
disappear, disappear...

412
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,691
She's doing it!

413
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,310
Superb!

414
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,695
What's happening? Wait...

415
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,666
Could it be?

416
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:31,176
She's already surpassed invisibility!

417
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,848
What? What's happening?

418
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,011
Tib!

419
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,394
Tib!

420
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,994
Excellent!

421
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,160
Most sublime, Mary Smith!

422
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,714
Where did you acquire such skill?
That was a very advanced spell.

423
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,708
How unexpected!

424
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,929
You may be a prodigy the likes
of which we've never seen!

425
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,889
What? Oh, no no...

426
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,097
That is the power of
a red-haired witch!

427
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,553
- No wonder.
- A red-haired witch!

428
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,601
She's amazing!

429
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:31,646
I suppose that was only about
40 percent of my power.

430
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,073
Unbelievable!

431
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,569
We're hoping to reach
even loftier heights here.

432
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:43,996
And we're truly honored to welcome
a gifted witch such as yourself!

433
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,460
I'm looking forward to it.

434
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:53,884
A round of applause for the enrollment
of this rare prodigy. Mary Smith!

435
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,425
Don't worry!
I think I'd make a fine witch!

436
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,065
My heart's still racing.

437
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,395
Come to my office so I can
give you an enrollment form.

438
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,067
Yes, with pleasure.

439
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,752
Well now, I must tend to my
experiments in transformation magic.

440
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,297
Transformation magic?

441
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,967
That's the strongroom.

442
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:41,257
It's where we keep the subjects
of our transformation experiments.

443
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,097
Oh...

444
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,817
A young specimen. This one
will make a great teaching aid.

445
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,614
These are wonderful experiments

446
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,906
that turn powerless animals
into magical beings.

447
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,279
Transformation experiments?

448
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,169
Tib!

449
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,724
What's the matter, Tib?

450
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,179
Hold on to your familiar.

451
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,643
I'm sorry.

452
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,314
What was that?

453
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,531
The progress of science and magic
is built on countless failures.

454
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,785
Failures?

455
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,327
Precisely! Failures are valuable!

456
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,996
Well, farewell for now, Miss Smith!

457
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,879
I shall see you again after

458
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,383
the sun sets and the moon rises
and the moon sets and the sun rises.

459
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,181
Now let's get going, Miss Mary.

460
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,520
Before it gets dark.

461
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,223
Yes, Madam.

462
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:25,702
Enrollment form, enrollment form...

463
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,206
I'm sorry, go ahead and
wait for me upstairs.

464
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,744
Oh, sure.

465
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,129
You sure did surprise me.

466
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,382
You truly are a remarkable talent.

467
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:48,263
Upstairs you'll find magical items
dating back to ancient times.

468
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,437
Hopefully we'll have a talent
like you using them soon.

469
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,895
Amazing.

470
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,694
That's odd.

471
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,695
The enrollment form for
honor students should be here.

472
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,582
It's that flower!

473
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,815
<i>Master Spells.</i>

474
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,321
<i>Spell to eliminate darkness.
Spell to make something rotten.</i>

475
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,993
<i>Spell to ease stomach pains.
Spell to deflect an enemy's attack.</i>

476
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,328
A book of magic spells.

477
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,289
Starting tomorrow,

478
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,998
we should have you serve as
our student representative.

479
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,502
Huh?

480
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,167
Why is...

481
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,131
You're more than qualified.

482
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:10,007
You're the perfect person
to represent us.

483
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:15,138
And perhaps I can ask you to
head up the Festival Committee.

484
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,855
Um...

485
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,524
And also lead the study tours.

486
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,903
I'm sure you'll soon represent us
at the academic conferences, too.

487
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,654
After all, you've already mastered
such advanced magic...

488
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,869
Wait, Madam... That's not true.

489
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,204
Not true?

490
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,708
You see, it's not that
I'm talented or anything.

491
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:40,499
Being able to fly on the broom,
or becoming invisible...

492
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,169
It's all thanks to a mysterious flower.

493
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,925
Flower?

494
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:54,930
A flower, you said?

495
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,844
Well, um...

496
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,063
A mysterious flower, you said?

497
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,522
Uh...

498
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,187
Do you have it with you now?

499
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,194
You're hiding something
behind your back.

500
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,904
No...

501
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,362
What is it?

502
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,360
It's nothing.

503
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,572
Show it to me!

504
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,371
What might this be?

505
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,093
I don't recognize this language.

506
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,725
<i>"51 Village of Redmanor. To Peter. ”</i>

507
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,266
The flower belongs to him.

508
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,724
I don't really understand it myself.

509
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:43,892
I see.

510
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,446
That boy has great talents.
Far more than I do...

511
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,153
May I hold onto this?

512
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,405
Oh... Sure.

513
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,288
I'll give you the enrollment form now.

514
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,584
Fill it out and bring it tomorrow.

515
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,123
Yes, Madam.

516
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,800
You don't need to see me off.
I'll just be on my way.

517
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,306
Thank you for today.

518
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,769
Next time let's debate the
discontinuity of Filio functions, Mary.

519
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,262
There he is.

520
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,934
My broomstick!

521
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,941
Look, your master's come back.

522
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,496
But I don't know the way home.

523
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,284
Don't worry, the broom knows.

524
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,660
That's a relief!

525
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,338
Let's try again.
Maybe gentler this time.

526
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,343
Tib, let's go home.

527
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,633
Tib!

528
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,182
What's the matter?

529
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,428
Maybe there's something
keeping him here.

530
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,808
Cats have an affinity
for magic, after all.

531
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:15,696
Tib, let's go, please.
I want to get home.

532
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,542
Good, now hold on tight.

533
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:29,421
Right.

534
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,887
That broomstick...

535
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,175
Remember, love your broom.

536
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,098
To home!

537
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,563
I said gentler this time!

538
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,024
What a splendid witch
we have joining us.

539
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,697
She brings great promise.

540
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,575
She knows where the flowers are.

541
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,581
Yes, indeed.

542
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,543
Wait, what? The stolen flowers?

543
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,581
Yes.

544
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:12,420
And you let her leave?
With those flowers, we...

545
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,049
No need to worry.

546
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,594
She left us something useful.

547
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,601
She might as well be
a leashed cat now.

548
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,275
What should I do?
I stole the book.

549
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,244
Tib, are you okay?

550
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,790
What are you upset about?
The book?

551
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,626
I couldn't help it.

552
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,128
I was really scared, you know.

553
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,458
I thought I was going
to be eaten alive.

554
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,965
Anyone would've...

555
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,622
Little broomstick?

556
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,669
I guess the magic faded.

557
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,298
But I'm not dreaming anymore, am I?

558
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,682
Tib!

559
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,189
He's gone.

560
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,688
Such a moody cat.

561
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,531
Ow...

562
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,002
Ow...

563
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,209
My bum...

564
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,208
Mary?

565
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,888
Thank goodness.

566
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,799
Great-Aunt Charlotte!

567
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,563
I knew it, I'm not dreaming anymore.

568
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,571
Mary, we were worried, you know.

569
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,413
Oh my, slow down a little, dear.

570
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,078
But I'm really hungry.

571
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,672
It must've been a wonderful day.

572
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,920
Yes, yes it was...

573
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:04,429
Yes, it was unbelievably exciting!

574
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:08,341
But do try to come home
a little earlier.

575
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:13,931
Let's go easy on her.
These things happen sometimes. Right?

576
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,895
But home is still the best!

577
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,569
Home, you said?

578
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,114
This is yummy.

579
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,758
“Fill out the form
and bring it tomorrow. ”

580
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,222
Not that I'll ever go back.

581
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,307
“You truly are a remarkable talent. ”

582
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,939
“You may well be a prodigy,
Mary Smith. ”

583
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,647
“We should have you serve as
our student representative."

584
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,986
Yes, coming.

585
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,199
Why, Zebedee. What is it?

586
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,500
Do you know where Peter is?

587
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,956
Peter?

588
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,504
What's happened to Peter?

589
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,837
It seems... he's gone missing.

590
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:24,967
He's gone missing?

591
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,133
His bicycle was found at
the edge of the woods.

592
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,678
My! In that mist?
Into the woods?

593
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,851
Oh my goodness...

594
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,514
Don't worry, I'm sure he'll
come home in no time.

595
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,600
We'll go look for him.

596
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,693
Do take care.

597
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,820
Give our regards to his mother.

598
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,188
I will. Good night.

599
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,538
He must've gone into the woods.

600
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,460
Tib!

601
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,733
What is this?

602
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,660
Mary Smith, the impostor witch.

603
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,291
How dare you taint
our noble establishment!

604
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:42,795
You haven't a single drop
of witch blood in you.

605
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,924
Seems the mist has brought
this boy to us.

606
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:49,752
Peter!

607
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,925
It was easy to find him...
all thanks to your help.

608
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,551
Want to save him?

609
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,555
Then bring me the Witch's Flower!

610
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:05,564
Bring me the flower,
and I shall let the boy go.

611
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,693
But if you don't...
Remember the rule?

612
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,776
“Trespassers will be transformed. ”

613
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,241
So long, be well!

614
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,800
It's my fault.

615
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,471
I know, we have to go.

616
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,041
Wait!

617
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,479
Mary?

618
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:13,025
Ow. I need you to fly quietly.
Or we'll be found.

619
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,902
Tib!

620
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,409
To Endor College.

621
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,010
Mary, are you here?

622
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,443
This is...

623
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,343
Mary...

624
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,654
Thanks.

625
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,450
Wait for me here.

626
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,138
Let's go, Tib.

627
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,185
Hey, wait for me.

628
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:25,365
Welcome back to Endor College,
Mary Smith.

629
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:33,415
I didn't think we would
see you again so soon.

630
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:38,420
Indeed, your return was faster than
Gelmen's magical reaction.

631
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,714
Let Peter go.

632
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,181
You brought it!

633
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,887
That flower is too dangerous
for you to keep. Hand it over.

634
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,399
Where's Peter? Let him go!

635
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,070
Give it back!

636
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,873
Well done.

637
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,713
How beautiful!

638
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:29,433
Hey, let me go! Stop it!

639
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,103
Take her to the strongroom.

640
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,731
She's a valuable specimen,
so handle her with care.

641
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:42,571
This isn't what we agreed to!
Liars! Cowards!

642
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,285
Ow...

643
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,604
What do we do, Tib?

644
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,814
Tib?

645
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,657
What?

646
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,469
What... are these...?

647
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,858
Are you the
transformation experiments?

648
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:11,323
You must be the “failures"
that Doctor Dee mentioned.

649
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,653
How awful.

650
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,372
Tib!

651
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,370
Tib, but that's...

652
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,885
Gib... is that you?

653
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,554
I see, Tib. You wanted me
to rescue your girlfriend.

654
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,361
I'm sorry, Gib.
I don't know what to do...

655
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,864
You, witch! Get me out of here!

656
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,529
Peter!

657
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,409
Mary? What are you doing here?

658
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,750
Mary?

659
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,216
Are you okay?

660
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,887
I'm sorry, Peter.

661
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,599
This is it! Without a doubt.

662
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:25,935
We can now resume the final phase
of our experiment...

663
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,399
now that we have this flower!

664
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,236
Tadpoles become frogs,
cocoons become butterflies.

665
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,069
At last, we can give our students

666
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:39,915
the enormous power to wield
any magic whatsoever!

667
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,618
With that power
we can change the world!

668
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,912
It's been a long time coming.

669
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,789
We must succeed this time,

670
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,584
lest we repeat that tragedy.

671
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:56,049
With a younger subject now,
we can't go wrong.

672
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:00,557
The more innocent the child,
the easier to transform.

673
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,930
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

674
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:08,152
Precisely. They absorb the
magic more directly.

675
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,313
I'll begin preparations at once!

676
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:17,619
I'm sorry...

677
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,325
Don't worry.

678
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:25,002
I wish they would've transformed
me instead, into an adult.

679
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:29,298
Then I'd be able to help Mother.

680
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,342
Especially if I could use magic.

681
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:36,638
You're not the only one
who wants to change.

682
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:38,723
Peter...

683
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,730
There's got to be a way out of here!

684
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,484
I need to get home no matter what!

685
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,487
Let's go home...

686
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:58,527
together!

687
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,873
Peter!

688
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,167
Ouch...

689
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,369
Are you okay?

690
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,381
Let's go home together.

691
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,509
Tib and Gib, too.
All of us together.

692
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,547
Good.

693
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,222
Say, how did you get here?

694
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,639
Me? I rode a broomstick.

695
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,771
A broomstick?
Mary, you can use magic?

696
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,563
Yes, well, only for one night.

697
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,494
That's right, I'm...

698
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,243
actually a witch tonight.

699
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:55,585
Hurry, we need to rush
those kids to the lab!

700
01:06:57,764 --> 01:07:01,598
You never know
what kids are up to.

701
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:07,263
“Spell to unfasten locks."
No, not that.

702
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,605
You can read this?

703
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,728
“Spell to destroy doors. ”

704
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,817
No, we need to undo their spells.

705
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,313
Spells? So you perform magic
by chanting spells?

706
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,242
I don't think it's chanting
as much as using magical powers...

707
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,738
Magical powers?
Where do you find powers like that?

708
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,238
Found it!

709
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,745
“Spell to undo all magic. ”

710
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,459
This would open the door and undo...

711
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,794
the transformations!

712
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:42,426
Mary!

713
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,052
What is going on?

714
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,903
Gib!

715
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:16,498
Mary!

716
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,009
Tib! Gib!

717
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,005
What is this?
What just happened?

718
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,174
The spells on the animals were undone.

719
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,515
The door should be open, too.
Let's go!

720
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,513
Oh, okay!

721
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,023
What's that?

722
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,212
It's dangerous here.
Let's go another way.

723
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:07,887
Impossible!
I put a spell on that door!

724
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:12,558
It was an advanced magical lock!

725
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,071
What could that be?

726
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,704
How did this happen?

727
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:49,471
It's gone!
She took the “Master Spells”!

728
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,768
Look, the door is open!
Mary!

729
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:03,947
I'm over here.

730
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,585
Where are we?

731
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,927
Peter!

732
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,885
They're all leaving from there.

733
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,135
Let's go!

734
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,292
There they are!

735
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,503
What are they doing?

736
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,333
Madam, those kids did all this?

737
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,504
She used the “Master Spells...

738
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,177
This is a disaster!

739
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,353
We have no choice but to jump.

740
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,356
Let's go!

741
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,364
Wait!

742
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,858
Newcomer!

743
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:34,828
Little broomstick!

744
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:38,075
You can't just leave
your broom anywhere!

745
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,708
Park them where they belong, I said!

746
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,709
Mister Flanagan!

747
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:48,385
Kids these days don't
look after their brooms!

748
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:52,006
Say, what's with all this
commotion today?

749
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,431
Thank you very much!

750
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,015
Flanagan!

751
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,105
He'll never change.

752
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,185
Hop on.

753
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:07,187
Just do it!

754
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,688
Oh, okay.

755
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,032
We're floating!

756
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,164
Hold on tight!

757
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,042
Stop right there!

758
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,760
Peter!

759
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,886
Mary, you go without me.

760
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:41,767
Go!

761
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,441
Peter!

762
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,117
That's a good face.

763
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,121
A pure-eyed child is
the perfect subject.

764
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:03,626
Indeed, he's a good boy.

765
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,296
Stop it, you...

766
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:17,181
I must go retrieve
the “Master Spells...

767
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,099
Who knows what she'll try
to do with that book!

768
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,647
Go back! I said go back!

769
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:31,650
Why won't you do as I say?

770
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,170
Where are you taking me?

771
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,174
That island?

772
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,796
Little broomstick?

773
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,152
Ow...
Hey, what is going on?

774
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,322
Little broomstick?

775
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,380
Whose home is this?

776
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,226
Welcome home, Miss!

777
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,564
Miss?

778
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,747
I see, it's your home.

779
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,373
Oh, because I told you to go back...

780
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,927
It's been a long time, Miss.
Pleasure to have you back.

781
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:22,932
Truth be told, I didn't think
you would ever come back.

782
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,931
Now please, come inside.

783
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,556
Hello...

784
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,946
I hope it's okay to come in.

785
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,465
What a lovely room.

786
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,635
Photos?

787
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,300
Madam and Doctor Dee?

788
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,647
Tib!

789
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,817
Don't, this isn't our home.

790
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,604
This is...

791
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,109
what Gib was transformed into!

792
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,986
These are lab notes.

793
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,534
How dare they!

794
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,668
What... is this...?

795
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:42,837
<i>Mary...</i>

796
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,174
I'm sorry, I was just...

797
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,973
Oh, it's just a mirror.

798
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:01,652
The mirror is...

799
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,030
Mary!

800
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,541
Great-Aunt Charlotte!
But why?

801
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,877
That's my old home.

802
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,880
The broomstick must've
taken you there.

803
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,509
Your home? And the broomstick?
I don't understand.

804
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,878
Do you have the “Fly-by-Night"?

805
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,674
Uh, no.
Madam and Doctor Dee took it.

806
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,935
I see... As I feared.

807
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,683
What exactly is going on?

808
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,397
Mary, listen.

809
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:38,727
What they are trying to do
is very dangerous.

810
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,740
Wow.

811
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,285
It was a long time ago.

812
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:55,706
I stole the flower seeds
from Madam and Doctor Dee.

813
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,919
Stole them?

814
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,254
Back then, everyone loved
Madam and Doctor Dee.

815
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,766
They were kindhearted teachers
and gifted scientists.

816
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,432
But...

817
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:19,392
when I found that flower, I made
the mistake of giving it to them.

818
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,441
After that, they were never the same.

819
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:36,744
They grew obsessed with studying
the magical seeds of that flower.

820
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,584
That flower has unimaginable power.

821
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,922
Madam wanted to use that power

822
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,589
to give the students
great magical ability.

823
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,395
But the experiment failed.

824
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,140
They couldn't control it.

825
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,655
All I could do was take the
remaining seeds and escape.

826
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:10,485
I couldn't let them
repeat that mistake.

827
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,416
Some powers in this world
just can't be harnessed.

828
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:17,659
And yet,

829
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:22,672
those two still believe
they can make it work.

830
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:26,797
So if they get their hands
on that flower again...

831
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,514
...they'll try it on Peter!

832
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,847
Mary, put your hand on the mirror.

833
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:42,684
Like this?

834
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,688
I'm not a witch anymore.
Maybe you can...

835
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,031
A “Fly-by-Night”!

836
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,208
That's the last one.

837
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,704
Your magic is fading... almost gone.

838
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,706
Use it to come home now.

839
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,880
Or you won't be able to
return home ever again!

840
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,053
Mary!

841
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:30,573
No, I can't just go home by myself.

842
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:33,906
I promised,
“We'll go home together. ”

843
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,905
I need to go to Peter.

844
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,289
Peter!

845
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,077
I need to use this flower's magic
to save him!

846
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:45,583
Mary!

847
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:49,208
Madam!

848
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,470
Mary, I'm sorry.
There's nothing more I can do.

849
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,466
But I believe in you.
I'll be waiting.

850
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:01,095
Don't worry, I'm definitely
coming home to Redmanor.

851
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:02,771
Mary!

852
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,651
Mary...

853
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,117
Of all places, she came here!

854
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,207
Oh no you won't!

855
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,163
Ready?

856
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,456
Little broomstick!

857
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:33,127
Are you okay?

858
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,313
Give my book back, Mary Smith!

859
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:58,661
Little broomstick, hang in there!
Take me to Peter!

860
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,157
She still possesses such power!

861
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:05,576
Get back here!

862
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,209
That's where Peter must be.

863
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:16,004
At last, it truly begins.

864
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,228
Give me back my book!

865
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,104
My bag!

866
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,400
And the flower!

867
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:42,905
Give it back!

868
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:47,376
Don't be silly. Both the book and
the flower belong to me.

869
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,725
You'll have to use up
your power to get away.

870
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:15,067
But to think she had
another flower up her sleeve!

871
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,073
Frightening child...

872
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,458
Please, hang on just a little longer!

873
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,619
Hey! Shoo, shoo!

874
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:33,417
Little broomstick!

875
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,603
Ow...

876
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,785
The insignia's gone.

877
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,622
Tib!

878
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,291
Little broomstick!

879
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,628
Oh, no...

880
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,172
Please, say something!

881
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:21,508
Little broomstick...

882
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:27,347
What am I supposed to do?

883
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:32,348
Little broomstick...

884
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,856
Little broomstick!

885
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:53,998
You're right.

886
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,540
I made a promise.

887
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,885
Let's go home together.

888
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:13,514
To Redmanor, all of us.

889
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,788
You're the one who escaped with us!

890
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,956
Everyone!

891
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,511
Can I make it up there?

892
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,552
Thanks, I'll go from here.

893
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,227
Little broomstick...

894
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,522
It's thanks to you
I made it this far.

895
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,695
I'll be right there, Peter!

896
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,669
What do we do?

897
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,880
Gib!

898
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,723
So you're safe! Where's Peter?

899
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,191
You want me to go inside?

900
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,883
Put that in the Velta socket.

901
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,604
The “Fly-by-Night”!

902
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,067
At last!

903
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,605
We commence the final stage!

904
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:55,077
To think how much time
we invested in this...

905
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:58,239
Now it all comes to fruition!

906
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:05,538
Peter!

907
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:10,634
Now this boy will have the power
to wield any magic.

908
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:15,298
And soon we'll have a marvelous world
in which everyone can use magic!

909
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,801
Indeed, the world will be changed!

910
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,598
Stop it!

911
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:35,988
How beautiful!

912
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,494
Peter!

913
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:41,073
Undo this! Please!

914
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,081
Stop it!

915
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,793
What's happening?

916
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:58,841
Peter...

917
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,597
Calm down, everyone!

918
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:06,315
This is no failure!
This is all within our projected...

919
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:09,476
What is...

920
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,605
It's melting!

921
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:16,483
This can't be happening!
Open the valve!

922
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,531
No!

923
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,709
Not yet! Not yet!

924
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:39,678
My dreams! My hopes!
Doctor Dee, do something!

925
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,556
Mary...

926
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,600
Peter!

927
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:51,022
It's only the second phase!
We can control it!

928
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,584
This is just like last time.

929
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:20,555
Then we must undo the spells!

930
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:21,635
What?

931
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:27,896
“To undo all magic...”

932
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:29,811
The “Master Spells”!

933
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:34,403
Don't! All our research
will be for nought!

934
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,147
Where is it?

935
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,452
Madam!

936
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:50,619
Madam!

937
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:52,708
How could this happen?

938
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,298
Her magic's been drained.

939
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,304
I did everything perfectly!

940
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,840
How could this happen?

941
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,009
There it is!

942
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,474
Break!

943
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,828
Peter, I'm going to rescue you!

944
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,756
Ma... ry...

945
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:23,344
Peter!

946
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,590
Run... away...

947
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:27,682
Peter!

948
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:29,176
Get away!

949
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,809
You can't defeat him without magic!

950
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:36,400
He's a monster who can use any magic!

951
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,524
Who can use any magic?

952
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:41,404
I know!

953
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:46,784
Peter, can you hear me?

954
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,071
Give me your hand!

955
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,576
You should be able to
use the book now!

956
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,872
Let's go home, together!

957
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:11,218
Undo...

958
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:12,928
all magic!

959
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:27,659
Madam!

960
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:31,120
We don't need magic!

961
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:33,178
Mary!

962
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:34,888
Peter!

963
01:35:35,438 --> 01:35:37,679
And Gib! You're safe!

964
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,015
Tib!

965
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,352
Look, here's your bag.

966
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:47,773
But I haven't found
your broomstick and coat.

967
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:51,827
Thank you, Peter.

968
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,700
Now how do we get home?

969
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,199
How many times must I tell you!

970
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:01,458
You can't just leave
your broom anywhere!

971
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:02,329
Mister Flanagan!

972
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:03,751
It's you!

973
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:06,170
Come on, your master's here.

974
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,673
Little broomstick!

975
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,345
What happened?

976
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,506
You're fixed!

977
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:18,683
Unbelievable. Show your broom
a little more respect!

978
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,555
Thank you!

979
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:25,852
WOW!

980
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,027
I wonder...

981
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,409
if they'll be okay.

982
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:40,580
You mean Madam and Doctor Dee?
They'll be fine.

983
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:44,792
They can use magic, after all.
They'll find a way.

984
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:52,091
That's true, they're tough.

985
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,464
Hey, there's something in your hair.

986
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,683
A “Fly-by-Night”!

987
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:06,935
But I don't need it anymore.

988
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,451
What was that?

989
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,788
Hold on tight.
It's my last time using magic!

990
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:22,918
Hey, hey! Stop!
