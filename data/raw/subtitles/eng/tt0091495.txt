1
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,138
Today, the art of killing.

2
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:22,009
If you've fought the bull well,
you must kill it well.

3
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,456
If not, it's a tragedy for both.

4
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,621
The matador doesn't live up to his name

5
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,929
and the bull's bravery is betrayed.

6
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:38,995
<i>The matador first examines the bull
from a distance to decide what to do</i>

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,266
<i>and to see which horn the bull favours.</i>

8
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,637
<i>A good kill comes after good passes
with a cape,</i>

9
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:51,739
when the bull stops charging
and asks for death.

10
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,216
He shows us his death.

11
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,450
<i>The sword must stab him behind the head</i>

12
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,287
<i>in the cross between his shoulders.</i>

13
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,430
We call this point "the needle's eye".

14
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,326
<i>It can't be crooked, it must go straight</i>

15
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,665
to the heart and lungs.

16
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,538
There are three ways to enter into the kill.

17
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,167
<i>The first is "receiving".</i>

18
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:27,978
To kill, the sword must be an extension
of the arm, which is bent 90 degrees.

19
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,312
The hand should be at heart level.

20
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,051
<i>We must stab him at the cross
or fall prey to the devil.</i>

21
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:44,797
<i>We move the cape towards his face
and goad him towards us.</i>

22
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,435
<i>Always watching his snout,</i>

23
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,570
<i>we sink the sword into the cross.</i>

24
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,867
But that's not enough.

25
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,347
<i>To kill a bull like he deserves,
he must be killed</i>

26
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,751
not just with the sword, but with the heart.

27
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,685
- And you?
- I'm not wearing clothes.

28
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,315
Very good today.

29
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,216
We want a chance.

30
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,777
- We want to fight bulls.
- So do I.

31
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,653
It's not my fault you're lame.

32
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,022
- We'll talk later.
- <i>Maestro</i>.

33
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,290
We're throwing a really wild party tonight.

34
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,164
- Will you come?
- Not tonight.

35
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,166
You're such a drag!

36
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,066
They're wild tonight.

37
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,195
You have to help me pick up girls.

38
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:39,801
- You can't do it alone?
- I've never done it.

39
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,904
- You've never been with a girl?
- Never.

40
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,475
Treat a woman like a bull.

41
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,645
Let her know who's boss.

42
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,049
- Give me that.
- Don't...

43
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,355
That's my lunch!

44
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,090
It's an amanita.

45
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,497
- What's wrong?
- It's very poisonous.

46
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,535
- How do you know?
- Look.

47
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,062
The colour of the cap and the stalk.

48
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,509
Throw them away, they're dangerous.

49
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,941
You got dizzy when I talked about women.

50
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,711
You're still pale.

51
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,445
No, clouds give me vertigo, you know?

52
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,552
Can I have some water for a pill?

53
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,787
Sure, of course.

54
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,229
Pills don't take away fear.

55
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,757
I'm not afraid of death. Not of mine.

56
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,263
Fear is normal, it gives you courage.

57
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,936
- Did you feel afraid?
- Yes, it's part of the game.

58
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,837
Don't fear fear.

59
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,344
Your girlfriend?

60
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,682
Ava Gardner. You don't see movies?

61
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,485
No, my family's very religious.

62
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,393
I've spent my life praying and exercising.

63
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,553
I recognise her.

64
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,791
Really?

65
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,561
She's my neighbour.

66
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,801
You like her?

67
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,565
She's very pretty.

68
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,406
But those models are so stuck-up.

69
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,505
Eva's different.

70
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,339
- You know her?
- She is my girlfriend.

71
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,214
What a coincidence.

72
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,315
- How about a game of pool?
- Okay.

73
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,932
You do well with women, don't you?

74
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,967
Being an ex-matador excites them.

75
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,136
Why do you want to be a matador?
You're not like the others.

76
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,770
Well, I don't know.

77
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,114
I guess I like danger.

78
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,049
And if I have to die,

79
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,784
dying in the bullring is much more exciting.

80
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,956
Isn't it?

81
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,627
You're too young to think about that.

82
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,596
What does that matter?

83
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,796
You should think of killing,

84
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,062
not of dying.

85
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,373
Your turn.

86
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,710
I don't know how to play.

87
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,952
I promised my mum I'd go home and study.

88
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,654
Angel.

89
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,622
- I'm just curious.
- Yes?

90
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,318
Do you like guys?

91
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,654
No.

92
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,557
Why did you ask?

93
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:53,395
Most kids your age have been with a girl.

94
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,340
My age! My age!
Why does everyone treat me like an idiot?

95
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,810
- Sorry I asked.
- I'll show you I'm no fag!

96
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,848
- You don't have to show me anything.
- I will!

97
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,512
Angel.

98
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,446
Angel!

99
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,017
What are you doing?

100
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,483
I told you not to lock yourself in!

101
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,186
Hi.

102
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,098
Where are you going?

103
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
To get some air.

104
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,063
Open your window.

105
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,169
I'll be right back.

106
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,835
Dinner's in an hour. Don't be late.

107
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,325
<i>Treat a woman like a bull.</i>

108
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
<i>Let her know who's boss.</i>

109
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,684
What are you doing? Let go of me!

110
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,759
You Pig!

111
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,791
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,956
Son of a bitch!

113
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,911
Come on, take your shower!

114
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,282
Hurry LIP-

115
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,319
Right.

116
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,422
Stop looking in the mirror.

117
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,586
I go through too many pantyhose.

118
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,564
Lord, bless the noodle soup,
the filet of sole and...

119
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,235
- And?
- Custard.

120
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,044
And the custard
we receive through Christ our Lord.

121
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,747
You're a disaster.

122
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,048
Falling down! Did anyone see you?

123
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,993
I don't know.

124
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,855
By the way.

125
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,402
When will you see the priest?

126
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,230
I don't know.

127
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,766
That was a condition for living here again.

128
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,674
Remember?

129
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,006
Why the wait?

130
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,042
Two months without going to church!

131
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,431
This isn't a hotel. There are rules here.

132
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,327
I won't pay for a life of luxury
and dissipation.

133
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,798
If you can't be pious,
I don't want to see you.

134
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,502
No.

135
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,202
I don't mind being alone

136
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,278
because I'm not alone.

137
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,282
What? Do I bore you?

138
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,021
No, I was just thinking.

139
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,288
About what?

140
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,919
Nothing. About...

141
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,418
The storm.

142
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,827
The storm.

143
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,024
You make my life a storm.

144
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,834
You might be crazy like your father.

145
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,701
May he rest in peace.

146
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,909
I think I'm crazy, too.

147
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,641
You do?

148
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,452
I need a psychiatrist.

149
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,977
You don't need a psychiatrist,

150
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,456
you need a father confessor.

151
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,052
You'll go tomorrow. Now eat.

152
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,254
Eat.

153
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,334
<i>Allow us to feel, Lord our God,
upon receiving you,</i>

154
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,070
<i>relief for our body and soul.</i>

155
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,303
<i>Through Christ our Lord.</i>

156
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,273
The Lord is with you.

157
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,778
- And also with you.
- And also with you.

158
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,041
The blessing of almighty God,

159
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,583
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

160
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,051
-be with you all.
- Amen.

161
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,246
Amen.

162
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,886
Go in peace.

163
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,890
Thanks be to God.

164
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,486
Right.

165
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,834
Tell him you want to confess.

166
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,201
He'll like that.

167
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,444
I'll wait at home.

168
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,213
Come on.

169
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,549
Go to the sacristy.

170
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,053
I want to see you go.

171
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,516
Yes.

172
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,191
Hello, Father.

173
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,002
Well! You've finally come back.

174
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,643
We've missed you.

175
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,407
I want to confess.

176
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:29,011
Good, son, it's about time.
Wait for me outside.

177
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,072
POLICE STATION

178
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,419
- Hello.
- What do you need?

179
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,019
- I want to see a detective.
- What for?

180
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,483
To turn myself in for raping a girl.

181
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,359
Some women are lucky.

182
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,831
Right there, the one with the photo.

183
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,166
Thank you.

184
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,019
Come in.

185
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,528
- Good morning.
- What do you want?

186
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,491
To report a rape.

187
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,662
- You were raped?
- No, I was the rapist.

188
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,098
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

189
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,677
Come in and tell me what you did.

190
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,740
Coming!

191
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,150
It smells good. Wet paint.

192
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,251
What?

193
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,691
- Police.
- Police.

194
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,024
- So what?
- Eva Soler lives here?

195
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,620
Of course. Why?

196
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,957
She was raped last night.

197
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,534
My daughter? Impossible.

198
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,970
She would have told me. See you later.

199
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,836
One moment.

200
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,310
Someone's here.

201
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,641
What is it, Mum?

202
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,047
- Nothing. Go to your room.
- Nothing? She's hurt.

203
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,675
Come over here.

204
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,153
I slipped on the mud.

205
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,523
Remember the storm? It was huge.

206
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,756
If he goes free, he may rape you again.

207
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,121
First, he didn't rape me.

208
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,192
- See?
- And if he touches me again,

209
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,135
- I'll castrate him.
- She means it.

210
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,230
Come with us to the station.

211
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:07,801
How can we come with you
with the house like it is?

212
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,871
I'm painting
and I have no one to help me with it.

213
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,974
Don't make this difficult.

214
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,544
I have an audition.

215
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,021
We have an audition.
And the house is a mess.

216
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,217
That's enough, ma'am. Be quiet.

217
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,093
Don't shout at me or I'll smack you.

218
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,594
It won't take long.

219
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,900
If you don't mind, we'll need to get ready.

220
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,305
We can't go to the station dressed like this.

221
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,675
First they rape you,
then you have to talk about it!

222
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,282
Make yourselves at home.

223
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,187
Close the door, let's keep this private.

224
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,090
- Have a seat.
- We're in a hurry.

225
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,226
Let's start, please.

226
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,364
Very well.

227
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,300
Are you Eva Sol er?

228
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,600
- Yes, I am.
- I'm her mother.

229
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,608
- You know Angel Jiménez?
- Yes.

230
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,374
We're neighbours.

231
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,609
You're very bad, Angel.
Look at her before her audition!

232
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,481
Ma'am, please don't interrupt.

233
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,984
Did Angel rape you?

234
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,090
No. He tried to.

235
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,752
He says he did.

236
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,823
No. He came between my legs.

237
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,625
I understand.

238
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,101
Tell me exactly what happened.

239
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,735
Ma'am.

240
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,908
- You can wait outside.
- Who, me?

241
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,744
This is disagreeable for a mother.

242
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,578
Well, it's not fun, but I'm no child
and we have no secrets.

243
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,987
It's not the first time.

244
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,617
We've had three attempted rapes.

245
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,855
- Or four?
- Three.

246
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,555
Tell me about it.

247
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,926
I left home,
and I imagine Angel followed me...

248
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,235
- What time?
-8:00.

249
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,173
Are you sure? Think about it, it's important.

250
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,875
Yes. I had a date.

251
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,510
Fine. Go on.

252
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,854
He took me to an alley.

253
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,984
He had a knife.

254
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,120
You know the rest.

255
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,957
- While he was trying...
- He ejaculated.

256
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,426
He ejaculated.

257
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,024
Anything else?

258
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,469
At the end he apologised, then he fainted.

259
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,178
That cut...

260
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,080
He did that?

261
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,474
No, I slipped in the mud.

262
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,944
Can we go now?

263
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,190
One moment. Do you want to prosecute?

264
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,924
No. What for?

265
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,796
You have to!

266
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,497
Quiet! You've gone too far.

267
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,627
Think about your mother.

268
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,227
She's so pious.

269
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,804
I'm sorry, ma'am, really I am.

270
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,242
Well, control yourself a bit.

271
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,943
If we weren't in the station,
I'd tell you a few things.

272
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,073
Goodbye.

273
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,412
Goodbye.

274
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,857
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF A JEWELER

275
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,843
It's strange. He looks so happy.

276
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,784
What's wrong?

277
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,983
Never seen a corpse?

278
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,317
I've seen a lot.

279
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,658
Why are you trembling?

280
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,498
- Did you know him?
- Yes.

281
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,164
Really?

282
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,463
Where from?

283
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,179
I killed him.

284
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,474
What?

285
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:43,953
In his house.

286
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,323
He was very excited.

287
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,089
He just wanted to have me.

288
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,991
He undressed immediately,

289
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:04,337
and when he tried to penetrate me,

290
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,076
I killed him.

291
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,009
What about him?

292
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,520
Did you know him, too?

293
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,021
Yes.

294
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,856
More or less the same thing.

295
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,805
Tell me about yourself. What do you do?

296
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,609
My mum makes me study agronomics.

297
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,844
But I want to be a bullfighter.

298
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,978
- You like bullfights?
- Yes.

299
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,725
I go to Diego Montes' classes.

300
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,354
She thinks I go to a gym.

301
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,867
Diego Monte.

302
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,883
Angel.

303
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,250
I'll show you some photos.

304
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,692
Study them carefully, please.

305
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,721
Take your time.

306
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,465
Do you know them?

307
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,910
Yes, from the bullfighting classes.

308
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,076
I killed them, too.

309
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,492
You!

310
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,965
You know me?

311
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,729
No, I don't think so.

312
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,833
My name is María Cardenal. I'm your lawyer.

313
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,400
Why are you defending me?

314
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,781
I think you're innocent.

315
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,149
You're wrong.

316
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,686
I'm guiltier than you can imagine.

317
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,744
Ask my mother.

318
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:39,126
I will. There's only proof
you tried to rape Eva Sol er.

319
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,794
That's not serious? She's my <i>maestro</i>'s girl.

320
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,737
By the way.

321
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,004
Call him and tell him I'm sorry.

322
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,110
It won't happen again.

323
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,609
He's Diego Monte, the bullfighter, right?

324
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,377
Yes. Do you know him?

325
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,458
I've seen him bullfight.

326
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,286
Was he as good as they say?

327
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,954
He was the best.

328
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,592
Back to the matter at hand.

329
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,669
I'll make the decisions from now on.

330
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,102
You understand?

331
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,145
Fine. I'll do whatever you tell me.

332
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,036
That's my boy.

333
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,511
Don't accuse yourself of more murders.

334
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,943
Four is enough.

335
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,459
You're right.

336
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,444
Close your eyes. Play dead.

337
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,430
<i>Fourty Spaniards are listed as missing.</i>

338
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,434
<i>Police have arrested the man</i>

339
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,143
<i>who raped Eva Soler, Angel Jiménez.</i>

340
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,373
Bastards! They announced it!

341
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,747
<i>...and Ana Vela,
whose bodies have not been found,</i>

342
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,218
<i>and the murders of</i>

343
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,154
<i>Raúl Ordóñes and Pedro Soto.</i>

344
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,556
<i>Attorney María Cardenal will defend him.</i>

345
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:32,291
<i>Naturally, certain feminists have complained
because a woman</i>

346
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,428
<i>is defending this monster.</i>

347
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,131
<i>"The Spanish Constitution
guarantees all citizens a defense",</i>

348
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,441
<i>Ms. Cardenal dared to declare,</i>

349
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:47,210
<i>showing truly repugnant cynicism.</i>

350
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,345
Jesus.

351
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,489
- Will you take me home?
- Yes.

352
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,957
- Amazing.
- I don't believe it.

353
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,255
Why not?

354
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,660
If he were a killer, he wouldn't have fainted,

355
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,698
he'd have killed me.

356
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,196
Poor girl. It must have been horrible.

357
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,629
- Let's forget it.
- The police will remind me.

358
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,704
- Did they call you?
- Not yet, but they will.

359
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,811
Can I have some blood sausage?

360
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,573
Sure.

361
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,757
I feel sorry for Angel.

362
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:35,354
Don't be naive.
He threatened you with a knife.

363
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,333
- Are you jealous?
- Angel is crazy.

364
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,131
So am I, about you.

365
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,101
Let's go.

366
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,421
Eva.

367
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,446
Is Mrs. Jiménez in?

368
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,981
Well... Wait, I'll go and see.

369
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:47,068
Ma'am, the woman we saw on TV
wants to see you.

370
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,900
I can't receive her.

371
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,000
She's already received.

372
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,565
Tell her I'm busy.

373
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,475
I have enough problems as it is.

374
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,711
All right.

375
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,146
Madam isn't in.

376
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,482
What do you mean? I heard her.

377
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,989
She can't receive you, she has a visitor.

378
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,423
I'll wait, then.

379
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,065
All right, then. What do you want?

380
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,538
I'm María Cardenal.

381
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,635
So?

382
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,315
I'm defending your son.

383
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,715
He must accept God's punishment.

384
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,944
God isn't the one who's trying him.

385
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,513
Are you an atheist, by chance?

386
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,259
Are we going to talk here or sit down?

387
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,360
All right, come in.

388
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,031
I have nothing to say.

389
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,059
And I won't pay you.

390
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,402
I want to talk about Angel, not money.

391
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,477
- Your son...
- He's not my son.

392
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,048
A raping, murdering monster
can't be my son.

393
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,613
God can't expect that.

394
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,653
Forget God for a moment.

395
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,987
I need information.

396
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,583
I did everything I could to save him.

397
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,360
He wasn't like others,

398
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,527
he had terrible visions as a child.

399
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,194
Evil was already inside him.

400
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,095
I tried to teach him to fear himself,
but to no avail.

401
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,436
Ma'am, do you understand
your son's situation?

402
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,012
Do you understand mine?

403
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,009
You're not in jail.

404
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,578
Pain and shame can also be a prison.

405
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,221
How can a mother not defend her child?

406
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:52,252
There are some people
that you can't defend.

407
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,122
Right, I'd never defend someone like you.

408
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,434
Father.

409
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:32,684
DUEL IN THE SUN

410
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,999
<i>I can't see you. Can you see me?</i>

411
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,714
<i>Damned traitor!</i>

412
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,765
<i>I want to see her.</i>

413
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,397
<i>No...</i>

414
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,338
<i>No...</i>

415
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,141
<i>You always said you could be flexible,</i>

416
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,916
<i>I didn't believe you.</i>

417
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,451
<i>- I love you.
- Don't cry, Pear!</i>

418
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,554
<i>Don't cry anymore.</i>

419
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,623
<i>I had to do it. I had to.</i>

420
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,361
<i>Let me... Let me hold you.</i>

421
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,867
<i>- Let me...
- Yes, hold me.</i>

422
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,737
<i>Hold me.</i>

423
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,766
<i>Come to me.</i>

424
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:38,387
<i>If you need an apartment,
our classified ads offer a selection...</i>

425
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,095
Why are you following me?

426
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,935
This is the men’s. Did you see the sign?

427
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,132
Don't trust appearances.

428
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,316
I'll buy you a drink somewhere nicer.

429
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,458
I'm not thirsty,

430
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,868
but I want to talk, too.

431
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,112
It's all yours?

432
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,213
I bought it from the city.

433
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,394
It's very tranquil. And sinister.

434
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,727
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much.

435
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,534
It must have been expensive.

436
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:10,306
Money doesn't matter to me.
I made a lot then.

437
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,777
But it wasn't easy.

438
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,446
I don't do things because they're easy.

439
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,637
You like bulls?

440
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,016
- I prefer bullfighters.
- I'm glad.

441
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,122
- I really like a good bullfight.
- Me, too.

442
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,962
- Give it to me.
- No.

443
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,659
Some blood sausages?

444
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,173
Something more personal.

445
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,504
If these will do...

446
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,573
They'll have to do.

447
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,323
- You use videos?
- I tape their bullfights.

448
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:37,660
Angel. I was with him today at the prison.

449
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,359
I saw you on TV.

450
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,703
Why defend him? He says he's guilty.

451
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,933
He didn't act consciously.

452
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,709
And when he raped my girlfriend?

453
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,243
He tried to imitate his <i>maestro</i>.

454
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,550
That kid is dangerous.

455
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,156
Maybe, but he's so lonely.

456
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,852
I'm lonely, too.

457
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,994
You're dangerous, too.

458
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,702
You wanted to kill me.

459
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,198
I have a right to defend myself.

460
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,478
Give me back the pin.

461
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,284
No, I think I deserve to have it.

462
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,522
You can't hesitate at the moment of the kill.

463
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,860
Bullfighting's golden rule.

464
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:40,653
Well, if this is a wedding dress, then...

465
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:45,057
Cover up the scar. They'll think I beat her.

466
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,789
No. Disfigure this side of her face.

467
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,457
No one disfigures my child!

468
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,296
- She'll be lovely.
- Mum!

469
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,563
Is this a fashion show

470
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,697
or examples of anti-cosmetic surgery?

471
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,798
It's a massacre, ma'am.

472
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,275
- Francisco Montesinos?
- Yes.

473
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,107
- Great!
- How vulgar!

474
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,205
- I heard you.
- I know.

475
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,773
I'd like to interview you.

476
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,614
- Tomorrow.
- I'll be brief.

477
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,280
- You're not ready!
- Very brief.

478
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,881
Go ahead.

479
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:20,759
First of all, why is the show's title
"Divided Spain"? Why?

480
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,957
This country's divided.

481
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,829
Algeria, get dressed!

482
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:29,098
- Divided in how many parts?
- Two, basically.

483
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,297
What are they?

484
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,670
The envious and the intolerant.

485
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,835
Elvira, get ready!

486
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,401
- Which side do you belong to?
- Both.

487
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,703
- Interesting.
- And you?

488
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,681
I've told you not to shoot up
in the dressing rooms!

489
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,482
We're almost finished, man.

490
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,984
If you have to do it, go to the bathrooms.

491
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,359
Why these models...

492
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,758
- Well...
- It's not real.

493
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:04,636
Don't worry, it looks great on you.
Go out like that.

494
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,403
- Like that?
- Sure, she's a pro.

495
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,239
- It's hot.
- Let's see.

496
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,940
Okay, Juan, you stay in the back,

497
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:16,507
lying down,
and make sure we can see the cape.

498
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,153
Why does he get killed? Who kills him?

499
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,883
The girl in red.

500
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,481
- Why?
- He beats her.

501
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,756
She doesn't love him and she's cranky.

502
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,696
And that's why she's so bloody?

503
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,892
- That's right.
- Interesting.

504
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,302
So you don't believe in marriage?

505
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,364
Marriage is necessary,
otherwise there wouldn't be

506
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,740
wedding dresses.

507
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,937
That's beautiful.

508
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,071
I have to go, I'm busy.

509
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,606
- Francis, the gun.
- Hide it wherever you can.

510
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,710
At the end, they kill you.

511
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,624
Mum, go look for Diego.

512
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,422
Yes, I can't stand all this genius.

513
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,951
- Hi.
- Hi. How are they doing?

514
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,615
It's a madhouse.

515
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,861
I'd never be a model, whatever they say.

516
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,459
- Sunflower seeds?
- No, thanks.

517
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,893
What?

518
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,537
The girl with the braid.

519
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:48,270
I have a braid, too. But not so showy.

520
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,670
- It looks good.
- Thank you.

521
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,521
You know who it is?

522
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,920
Angel's lawyer.

523
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,657
I didn't know lawyers liked fashion.

524
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,861
She's a bit slutty.

525
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,096
But she is pretty, I admit that.

526
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,599
Excuse me, Pilar.

527
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,372
I don't like this at all!

528
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,381
<i>olé!</i>

529
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,698
I saw a suicide from here once.

530
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,100
I felt strange,

531
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,678
empty and outside my body.

532
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,845
I come here often.

533
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:49,213
You and I are similar.
We're both obsessed with death.

534
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,953
Everyone is.

535
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,264
Not the way you are.

536
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:09,875
- What if I hadn't grabbed your hand?
- And if I hadn't defended myself?

537
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,329
Diego,

538
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,228
are you coming?

539
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,568
Not now.

540
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,182
The goring again? You're so morbid.

541
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,058
- We have to talk.
- Some other day.

542
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,721
- It has to be now.
- What is it?

543
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,789
I got a job in Japan for two months.

544
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,364
- My mum's happy, but I'm not.
- It's good for your career.

545
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,532
Fuck my career.
I don't want to leave you alone.

546
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,272
You'd be better off.

547
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,744
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

548
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,609
It's that woman.

549
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,053
It can't be.

550
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,416
You left the show together.

551
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,221
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.

552
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,290
- Don't play games with me.
- Don't you.

553
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:40,532
- Go, I want to be alone.
- Fine, I'm going.

554
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:56,976
Eva!

555
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,080
Hello.

556
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,250
He's had a few bad days,

557
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,956
but he's a good person.

558
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:08,658
I wouldn't leave him if he asked me to.

559
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,857
Good.

560
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,012
María!

561
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,229
Who is it?

562
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,238
- Diego. I need to see you.
- No.

563
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,967
- Why not?
- <i>Because.</i>

564
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,001
Don't call me. I don't want to see you.

565
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,239
<i>María!</i>

566
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,391
You work here, too?

567
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,553
Yes, twice a week.

568
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,920
- Is María in?
- I think so.

569
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,827
Give this to her when I leave.

570
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,891
- What is it?
- A surprise.

571
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,202
I'll take care of it.

572
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,341
- Where's her office?
- In the back.

573
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,502
But here's her secretary.

574
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,475
- Yes?
- I have an appointment.

575
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,880
- What's your name?
- Diego Monte.

576
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,486
She didn't say anything.

577
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,051
She can be reserved.

578
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:45,353
Wait here, but I doubt she can see you.

579
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,695
This cocky gentleman wants to see you.

580
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,265
I said wait there!

581
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,205
- Just close the door, please.
- Okay.

582
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,212
- I didn't want to see you.
- We must talk.

583
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,408
- Is it that urgent?
- Yes.

584
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,749
Not here, I'm working.

585
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,183
What do you want?

586
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:19,852
You.

587
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,057
Can I have my pin?

588
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:25,866
You only care about your damn pin!

589
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,595
Is this blackmail?

590
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,594
Let's be frank.

591
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:33,133
- Why are you afraid?
- You know why.

592
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,572
Please go.

593
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,411
We're condemned to each other.

594
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,576
Not even we can avoid it.

595
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:49,447
Go. If you don't go, I'll shoot myself.

596
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,062
Yes.

597
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,438
This is from Diego.

598
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,532
He gave it to me before coming in.

599
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,509
- You didn't tell him about...
- No. Leave me alone.

600
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,451
Diego.

601
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,554
Diego.

602
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,351
- These are amanitas, right?
- They're very poisonous.

603
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,481
Look at the cap, you see?

604
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,322
It holds the poison.

605
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,596
- Can I take one?
- Yes, but careful.

606
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,758
- Don't eat it.
- Don't worry.

607
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,437
Detective del Valle. ls the <i>maestro</i> in?

608
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,766
He's in the ring with the kids.

609
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,343
- Shall I get him?
- No.

610
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,105
Does he live here?

611
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,113
Upstairs.

612
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,273
He gives theory lessons downstairs.

613
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,051
Let's go take a look.

614
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,648
How long have you worked for him?

615
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:33,359
Since he started bullfighting.
After the goring, I came here to help.

616
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:38,191
I live in the house next to the garden.

617
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,869
- With your family?
- Do you live with your family?

618
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,704
They're in Toledo, I go there on weekends.

619
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,144
And this sausage?

620
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,705
"Angel Jiménez".

621
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,849
"Angel Jiménez".

622
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,148
Two policemen are here, watching.

623
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,281
- Where?
- Behind the leaves.

624
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:19,129
One's a detective. They snooped around.

625
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,738
Hello.

626
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,939
Good afternoon.

627
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:39,845
I'm Detective led Vale.
I'm on your classmate's case.

628
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,120
I'm Diego Monte.

629
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,589
Yes, I know.

630
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,025
- Will you be long?
- No, we finish at 7:00.

631
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,427
Remember the class of the 27th?

632
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,165
Angel's last day at the school.

633
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,432
I remember.

634
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,408
The <i>maestro</i> was showing us how to kill.

635
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,935
Did he go straight home after class?

636
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,815
Did he talk to any of you?

637
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,786
We talked. He said he had to study.

638
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,559
Now, this.

639
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,295
Look at it.

640
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,289
Does it belong to anyone?

641
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,792
Look carefully.

642
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,569
It's nice. You've never seen it?

643
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,771
You haven't seen Anabel and Esther...

644
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,781
- Dominguez.
-...since they disappeared?

645
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:43,147
- They're dead.
- How do you know?

646
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,117
The newspapers say so.

647
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,154
Maybe. There's no proof.

648
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,682
You must know Angel Jiménez’s situation.

649
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:56,490
I'd like you to tell me about him,
anything you like.

650
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:00,957
No?

651
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,734
Well, if you suddenly get back your memory,

652
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,734
I'll be at the Tetanuán station, okay?

653
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,339
Okay?

654
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,110
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

655
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,583
Good, you can continue.

656
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,310
You look good.

657
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,389
<i>Maestro</i>,

658
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,927
can I talk to you?

659
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,368
- Wait in the car.
- Okay.

660
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:45,409
- Is that from the goring?
- Yes. And yours?

661
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,946
Mine is psychological.

662
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,785
Do you think Angel is homosexual?

663
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:57,118
- What?
- You knew him well, right?

664
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,527
No, I didn't. I just gave him classes.

665
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:04,629
But he was upstairs that last night.

666
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,298
For some water. What are you getting at?

667
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:10,860
Nothing. You gave him classes and water.

668
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,863
For a pill. We talked five minutes.

669
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,000
- What about?
- Women.

670
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,144
That night he tried to rape Eva.

671
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,911
What about that?

672
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,849
He's a son of a bitch.

673
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,155
I don't know.

674
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:33,289
It's hard to classify him.
He's out of the ordinary.

675
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,427
That's true.

676
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:39,629
The other day he said he really admired you.

677
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,933
- Really?
- Yes.

678
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,666
I don't understand.

679
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:54,038
Remember when
your two girl students disappeared?

680
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,210
One three months ago, the other four.

681
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:02,085
Do you remember if it was on a weekend?

682
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,290
We don't have class on weekends.

683
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,496
All right.

684
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:22,275
- Where did you get the Manitoba?
- The bullfighting school.

685
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,140
<i>Citrina</i> or <i>phaloides</i>?

686
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,441
<i>Citrina</i>, can't you tell?

687
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,482
How are you doing with Angel Jiménez?

688
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,714
The kid has a guilt complex.

689
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:37,057
No wonder, with that mother.

690
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,059
Could he be a killer?

691
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,153
You only care if he did it or not,

692
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,395
not about his motives.

693
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,764
Motives? Why is this mushroom poisonous?

694
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,428
It's its nature. Just like our nature.

695
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,641
Evil's inside it.

696
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:57,007
- And good.
- But good is boring.

697
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,012
People aren't mushrooms.

698
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,571
No, people are more complicated.

699
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:06,518
I can't believe you can't feel anything
for Angel.

700
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,585
- I feel great curiosity.
- Only that?

701
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:15,086
In all my cases,
I wish some people were guilty

702
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:17,461
and others innocent.

703
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:23,467
As far as Angel goes,
I'd like him to be innocent.

704
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,602
See? You're not as bad as you seem.

705
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,904
- Let's sleep together tonight.
- I said no.

706
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:34,505
We don't have to fuck, just hold me.

707
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,776
Julia!

708
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,377
He can't hear out of one ear,

709
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,878
that gives him vertigo.

710
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,613
- An operation?
- There's no need.

711
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,516
The other one's fine.

712
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:57,548
Don't bother him today, he'll be dizzy.
Let him rest.

713
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:03,886
Doctor, could vertigo make someone
so hypersensitive that...

714
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:08,766
Doctor, people don't kill
because they're a bit deaf.

715
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,362
Often mental problems have physical roots.

716
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,387
We have to talk about the pin.

717
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,953
- All right?
- Okay.

718
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,800
- Is it really yours?
- Yes.

719
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,903
Why would you want that nice pin?

720
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:48,598
To kill with.

721
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:53,807
- Where did you buy it?
- That doesn't matter.

722
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:57,876
It does. I need to know in order to help you.

723
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,879
Can't they leave me alone?

724
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,359
I'd like to live in the desert.

725
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:11,524
Alone.

726
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,596
With no one around.

727
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,695
I can't sleep.

728
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,539
I hear the knives go in and out,

729
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,242
the pins pierce the neck,

730
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,442
the shots echo in my head.

731
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,353
I can't take it any more, I can't take it.

732
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,088
So much killing in this town!

733
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,192
I don't care about crimes in Madrid.

734
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,361
Only yours.

735
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,267
Angel is in no condition to be questioned.

736
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,971
He knows more than he's saying.

737
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:03,249
- He's with his lawyer.
- "In no condition", eh?

738
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,082
Ana was beautiful.

739
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,925
I trained with her all day

740
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,427
and I got very excited.

741
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,424
After the class,

742
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,797
she waited for me on the platform,

743
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,365
naked.

744
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,542
And there,

745
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,873
I strangled her,

746
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,945
while I had her.

747
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,758
And Esther Dominguez?

748
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,422
I killed her in the tub.

749
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,698
Where are the bodies?

750
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,265
I buried them in the garden.

751
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:03,073
- By yourself?
- Yes.

752
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,077
Let's go look, then.

753
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,843
- You were listening.
- Yes.

754
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:18,014
I'll deny it in court.

755
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,324
- I have a witness.
- I didn't hear anything.

756
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,125
Women!

757
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,402
You're all ridiculous and sentimental!

758
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,961
At least I have feelings!

759
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:34,303
And you seem to have too many.

760
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,741
- Too many what?
- Feelings.

761
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,909
Come on, Angel.

762
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,313
Show the detective the bodies.

763
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,882
Maybe he'll calm down.

764
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,580
Angel can't leave, he has vertigo.

765
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,624
He needs a shot first.

766
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,057
Go on, what are you waiting for?

767
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,191
Get in, scumbag!

768
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,184
Where did you bury them?

769
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,834
Hurry up!

770
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:24,049
Look, a <i>russula</i>.

771
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,347
- A <i>russula</i>.
- A <i>cyanoxantha</i>. I see.

772
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,171
Come and help him dig.

773
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,175
Start with the picks.

774
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:55,238
Get back, son.

775
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,441
Here they are.

776
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:33,714
Right.

777
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,652
Get the body bags.

778
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,495
- Now what can we do?
- I don't know.

779
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,757
It's a challenging case.

780
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,268
<i>Maestro</i>,

781
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,896
I want to apologise for what I did to Eva.

782
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,840
Compared to this, it's nothing.

783
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,369
Yes.

784
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,978
- No hard feelings?
- No.

785
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,380
Trust me.

786
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,349
- Am I in danger?
- Yes.

787
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,321
- Let's go.
- But trust me.

788
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:46,382
- Take Angel to the car.
- Let's go, Angel.

789
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,925
Why must you trust him?

790
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,125
- He still thinks I'm his <i>maestro</i>.
- Aren't you?

791
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,325
I didn't teach him to dig.

792
01:14:56,391 --> 01:15:00,703
How could he bury two bodies here
without your knowledge?

793
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,700
He'd need four hours. I'm not always here.

794
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:06,302
- That's a bad argument.
- So is yours.

795
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,413
- Get better evidence against me.
- I will.

796
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,679
I'll get better arguments.

797
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,619
We'll see.

798
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,697
I suspected it, but I wasn't sure until today.

799
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:36,170
I want to show you something.

800
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,563
I've never brought anyone here before.

801
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,997
It's wonderful.

802
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:09,668
I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes.

803
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,780
Careful, there's a step.

804
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,753
I can't see.

805
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,915
Wait.

806
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,263
You can open your eyes.

807
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:45,973
My sum

808
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,512
How did you get it?

809
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,120
From your sword handler.

810
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,580
And what about all this?

811
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,593
Your maid stole it and sold it to me.

812
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:06,463
Why didn't I ever see you?

813
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,431
How long have you collected my things?

814
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,334
Since I first saw you kill.

815
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,306
Diego...

816
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,608
I've looked for you in all the men I've loved.

817
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,284
I tried to imitate you
while I was killing them.

818
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,581
Why didn't you contact me?

819
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,990
I didn't know you were still a matador.

820
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:44,326
I tried to avoid it, but I couldn't.

821
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,770
Giving up killing

822
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,003
was like giving up living.

823
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,174
Men think killing is a crime.

824
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,483
We women don't see it that way.

825
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,747
Every criminal has a feminine side.

826
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:06,258
And every killer, a masculine one.

827
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,989
I've waited so long for this,

828
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,453
I feel like I'm dreaming.

829
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:16,233
But since I met you I haven't slept.

830
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,734
I can't sleep either.

831
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,007
That means I don't live.

832
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:25,845
I feel I won't sleep if you exist.

833
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,738
I won't live if you live.

834
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:42,892
Your son can't be guilty of
at least one of the murders.

835
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,161
He was at his class.

836
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,259
You confirm he came home afterwards.

837
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:52,972
Yes, but what about the other three?

838
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,166
There's evidence.

839
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:59,402
The more there is,
the less guilty I think he is.

840
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,006
Interesting method you have.

841
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,846
- Angel's hiding things.
- That's news.

842
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,680
Talk to him, he won't lie to you.

843
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:14,457
He's been lying to me for the last 22 years.

844
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,328
Just like his father,

845
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:18,824
may he rest in peace.

846
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,128
Then talk to his psychiatrist.

847
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:23,859
Let's go to the hospital.

848
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,361
I want to be present.

849
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,678
Come on, bed three is clean.

850
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,621
Jesus, he's fainted.

851
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,188
Slap him a couple of times.

852
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,190
Angel.

853
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,965
- Idiot!
- What happened?

854
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,664
- We came in and he fainted.
- He's weak.

855
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,268
- Get some smelling salts.
- Yes.

856
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,675
He hardly eats.

857
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,302
No, it's seeing that other patient.

858
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,882
He can't stand blood.

859
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,509
He can't stand the sight of blood?

860
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,384
No. He's not like me.

861
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,190
He's a coward, like his father.

862
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,324
He'd never flagellate himself.

863
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,027
One drop of blood, he'd faint.

864
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,062
Do you see what you're saying?

865
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,138
Of course. I'm his mother.

866
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:37,070
- And you think he's a killer?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

867
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:40,470
How could he be if he can't stand blood?

868
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:43,806
I don't know.

869
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,978
The devil has many tricks.

870
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,151
Remember that.

871
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,590
Poor Angel.

872
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:12,304
- The smelling salts.
- He doesn't need them.

873
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,339
<i>With the eclipse,</i>

874
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,578
<i>the sky will go dark</i>

875
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:20,381
<i>and the stars will become visible.</i>

876
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:23,217
<i>Birds will fly to their nests</i>

877
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:28,284
<i>and animals return to their lairs,
thinking night has come.</i>

878
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:32,225
<i>They won't suspect the sun will shine again
in a few minutes,</i>

879
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,598
<i>upsetting these irrational beings,</i>

880
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,728
<i>slaves to their instincts.</i>

881
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,964
What a universe!

882
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:46,944
<i>Because of the eclipse, our country
will be visited by many scientists...</i>

883
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,913
Want to go to a movie?

884
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,780
- Not getting up today?
- No.

885
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,345
- Because of the eclipse?
- What?

886
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,357
It was just on TV.

887
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,527
You're a bit out of it.

888
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:06,264
Is it because of Diego? Forget him.

889
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,526
You could catch something better,

890
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,699
a lawyer, senator, or dentist.

891
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,836
It would be easier.

892
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,840
Get one for yourself.

893
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,478
Don't make my mistake.

894
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,883
At your age, I was pretty, too.

895
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,284
Mum, I love him.

896
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,187
I loved your dad. What good was that?

897
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,856
- Hello?
- <i>Eva, it's Diego.</i>

898
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,322
I was thinking about you.

899
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:44,535
<i>I left your things with Mariano.
Come and get them.</i>

900
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:48,399
- We have to talk.
- <i>It wouldn't do any good.</i>

901
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:55,211
- I'm having an awful time.
- <i>It would be worse if we stayed together.</i>

902
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,878
- But...
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

903
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:00,647
Diego?

904
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:06,551
You have to try harder, honey.

905
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:09,390
Leave me alone! Go!

906
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:18,895
Eva, dear, you've been in there
for half an hour.

907
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,801
Open up, I'm getting worried.

908
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,844
I made gazpacho for you.

909
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:35,115
- You look so pale. Are you all right?
- It's my makeup.

910
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,088
- You look dead.
- Good.

911
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,148
Help me with this.

912
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:42,217
Here. Don't step on it.

913
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:46,361
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

914
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:50,234
Then you wonder why they rape you.

915
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,467
- You're going to him?
- None of your business.

916
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:57,471
Good-bye.

917
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:01,311
What you put me through!

918
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,076
- Hi.
- Hello, Eva.

919
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,883
Diego's not here. He left a bag for you.

920
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:10,946
I came for it.

921
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,087
I was just leaving.

922
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:16,826
On the early bus, because of the eclipse.

923
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,499
No, no, wait.

924
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:31,978
Let me in.
I have to talk to him and it's cold out.

925
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,409
How can you go out half-naked?

926
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,306
Let me go in.

927
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:40,419
He'll be angry with me.

928
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,320
- He told me not to.
- Mariano, please.

929
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:51,895
Go in, and what will be, will be.
You two work it out.

930
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:30,133
DEAR DIEGO:

931
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:37,735
I CAME

932
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:50,646
DEAR DIEGO:
I LOVE YOU

933
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,686
EVA

934
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,796
- Where's the poster?
- Behind the board.

935
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:35,867
Don't worry.
Mariano didn't see you kill or bury them.

936
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:40,098
No, the girls disappeared on a weekend

937
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:44,132
and the police know Mariano was in Toledo.

938
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:48,306
Always worried. They have nothing on you.

939
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,274
- How did Angel know?
- I don't know.

940
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,413
But he won't talk.

941
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,752
I know police tactics.

942
01:26:56,177 --> 01:27:00,489
They're waiting for you to get nervous
and make a mistake.

943
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,654
So what are we waiting for? Why prolong it?

944
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:09,626
Since I met you,
I'm on the edge of a huge orgasm.

945
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,135
I like prolonging it.

946
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:19,211
They know now
Angel couldn't have killed the men.

947
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:23,214
They won't suspect me,
no one saw me with them.

948
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,041
Only with you.

949
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,451
You're my only danger.

950
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,183
It would be absurd for the police
to catch us now.

951
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:35,790
That's not our plan.

952
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,865
I want you to give Angel a cape.

953
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:44,200
I'm too excited to think.

954
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:49,270
- I need a week to get things ready.
- Not a minute more.

955
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,977
Do you want it as much as I do?

956
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,314
More. I've waited longer for it than you have.

957
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,717
You'll need a bag.

958
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:17,430
- What's wrong?
- I'm impatient.

959
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:22,334
- Any message for Angel?
- Yes.

960
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,303
Tell him thanks.

961
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,746
Only a desperate man would say that.

962
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:30,572
I'm desperate.

963
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:36,255
Call me at the office.

964
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,652
We'll prepare things tonight.

965
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,067
Eva, come out!

966
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,173
I warned you.

967
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,850
Why didn't you listen?

968
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,749
I heard it all.

969
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,890
I shouldn't have trusted you.

970
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:20,862
You'll have to now.
Your future depends on me.

971
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,527
And yours on me.

972
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:31,471
You're not afraid?

973
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,338
I'm only afraid that you'll leave me.

974
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:38,549
I never wanted to mix you up in this.

975
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:40,746
Diego.

976
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,720
Just go and forget me.

977
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,688
I don't want to forget you. I can't.

978
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,696
- I love you.
- You'll get over it.

979
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,632
You have your life ahead of you.

980
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,499
I don't want to. It's that woman's fault.

981
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,775
- She drove you crazy.
- I am crazy.

982
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:08,177
- There's no fixing that.
- There is, trust me.

983
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,546
Forget me and what you heard.

984
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:15,179
I will if you stay with me.
We'll bullfight together.

985
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,484
Eva, I don't want to hurt you.

986
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,320
Don't make it more difficult.

987
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:22,658
We can save our love.

988
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:25,498
- You really believe that?
- Yes.

989
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:28,932
I can rebuild it, trust me.

990
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,601
Just give me a chance.

991
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:36,501
Fine, rebuild it.

992
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,370
Let me stay here.

993
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:44,142
No, I'm too nervous today. Come tomorrow.

994
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,207
You'll go to her office.

995
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:49,285
- No.
- Promise me.

996
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:53,950
I promise, but you promise
you'll forget what you heard.

997
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:00,897
Keep your word, I'll keep mine.

998
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,241
Remember our deal.

999
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:18,844
Diego.

1000
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,148
Eva was hiding here and heard it all.

1001
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:25,318
Didn't you break up with that brat?

1002
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:27,723
- Yes, but...
- How did she react?

1003
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:31,822
I promised to go back to her,
but I don't think she believed me.

1004
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:34,230
I knew she'd bring us problems.

1005
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,361
We can't wait any longer.

1006
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:40,837
We have to buy something, right?

1007
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:46,168
I'll see you at the Almirante jewelry store.

1008
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,438
<i>Don't take too long.</i>

1009
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,005
I won't, dear.

1010
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:10,097
I'm leaving.

1011
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,000
He's waiting for you.

1012
01:32:12,059 --> 01:32:13,970
On Monday. I'm sorry.

1013
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,167
Send this to Angel Jiménez.

1014
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,870
- Is anything wrong?
- No. The eclipse.

1015
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,713
- We must talk.
- Come back on Monday.

1016
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:32,715
You're going to him, you bitch.

1017
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:06,547
- I heard it all.
- So what?

1018
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,160
- You're in my hands.
- Really?

1019
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,854
You know you are.

1020
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:15,834
- What do you want?
- Leave him.

1021
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,426
Diego needs me.

1022
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:21,629
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for you to be with him?

1023
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,909
- I'm not afraid.
- You have no idea.

1024
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,174
He was fine before he met you.

1025
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:30,215
Except for the murders.

1026
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:34,447
He had a crisis after the goring,
but he's better. I love him.

1027
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:38,913
You can't give him what he needs.

1028
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:43,226
Diego belongs to another species. Mine.

1029
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:48,631
I'll tell the police. You're lost without me.

1030
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:53,064
No one will believe you
or what's between us.

1031
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:12,418
<i>"When two heavenly bodies meet,</i>

1032
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,892
<i>"their light seems to go out,</i>

1033
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:18,026
<i>"but in their brief convergence,</i>

1034
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:22,089
<i>"they acquire a new luminosity,</i>

1035
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:25,695
<i>"black and ardent".</i>

1036
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:31,275
An eclipse. How beautiful!

1037
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,243
Something horrible
is going to happen today.

1038
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,473
The eclipse is affecting you.

1039
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,741
We must do something.

1040
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:40,445
I have a not very scientific theory.

1041
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:46,549
Every time you have vertigo,
you enter an almost hypnotic state.

1042
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:52,657
I'd like to know what's happening to you.

1043
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,362
We have to stop it.

1044
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,960
We could operate on your ear.

1045
01:34:58,426 --> 01:34:59,837
It's Diego.

1046
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,269
Can you see him?

1047
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,832
He's with María. They're in danger.

1048
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,842
What else?

1049
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:10,412
They've stopped to buy flowers.

1050
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:12,781
The flowers are dangerous?

1051
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,581
I'll buy you a car like that.

1052
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:20,350
- Buy some flowers, handsome.
- Roses.

1053
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:23,689
Grab them, I'm holding the baby.

1054
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,590
Another bunch, you can afford it.

1055
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:35,272
Thanks, big spender.
I'll read your palm, too.

1056
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:50,019
What a pity.

1057
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:55,257
You're his girlfriend. This isn't revenge?

1058
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:59,022
I told you. Why not go and see?

1059
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,066
Don't worry, I will.

1060
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:05,565
- Yes?
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>

1061
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:06,798
Hello.

1062
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:09,400
<i>Angel says Diego's in danger.</i>

1063
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:12,672
You too? What's with you women today?

1064
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,838
<i>He's with María.</i>

1065
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:17,710
- How do you know?
- <i>Angel told me.</i>

1066
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,150
He saw them out the window?

1067
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:23,211
<i>Angel sees more than we do.</i>

1068
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,314
You'll drive me nuts.

1069
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:30,522
Eva's here and she accused
Diego and María of the murders.

1070
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:34,796
<i>So something is happening. Wait for us.</i>

1071
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,962
What's going on?

1072
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:41,529
I wish I knew.

1073
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:44,301
So do something.

1074
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,221
- Here they are.
- We must hurry.

1075
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,691
- Yes.
- Hold on.

1076
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:02,625
- They're getting away.
- Wait.

1077
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:05,687
Eva says they left half an hour ago.

1078
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:08,666
- They'd be out of Madrid.
- Not yet.

1079
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:12,094
- You cut your hair!
- Don't you like it?

1080
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,003
- Angel, can you really see them?
- Yes.

1081
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:19,410
- Where are they now?
- To the left of a tunnel.

1082
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:22,970
- A tunnel?
- Now by a fountain with birds.

1083
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:24,243
Plaza Mariano de Cavia.

1084
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,148
- The road to Valencia.
- Valencia?

1085
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:29,780
Get an arrest warrant
and go to Diego's house.

1086
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:32,347
- And María?
- Check her office and home.

1087
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:37,655
I hate making a fool out of myself,
so you'd better be right.

1088
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:48,503
- Now where?
- Straight towards Valencia.

1089
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:55,980
- You still see the car?
- Yes. They're near a factory.

1090
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,052
The Chinchón distillery.

1091
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,355
Why do you believe him?

1092
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,458
The eclipse has hypnotised you.

1093
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:12,759
Some things are beyond reason.
This is one of them.

1094
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,272
Home at last.

1095
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,715
Help me set this up.

1096
01:38:33,774 --> 01:38:36,118
- Sure.
- So long planning this

1097
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,113
and now we're unprepared.

1098
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:47,760
I've felt this scar in me for so long.

1099
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,633
But I've never kissed it before.

1100
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:12,446
<i>Wait for me in heaven, my love</i>

1101
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:19,427
<i>If you get there first</i>

1102
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:25,060
<i>Wait for me, I'll be there soon</i>

1103
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:31,467
<i>Wherever it is you are</i>

1104
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:38,244
<i>Wait for me in heaven, my love</i>

1105
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:43,517
<i>If you get there first</i>

1106
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:49,886
<i>Wait for me, I'll be there soon</i>

1107
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:56,267
<i>To start all over again</i>

1108
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,031
<i>Our love is so great</i>

1109
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:06,610
<i>So great that it will</i>

1110
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:09,611
<i>Never end</i>

1111
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:16,888
<i>And life is so short that it's not enough</i>

1112
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:22,727
<i>For our romance</i>

1113
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:26,920
<i>That's why I beg you</i>

1114
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:29,729
<i>Please</i>

1115
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:34,296
<i>Wait for me in heaven</i>

1116
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:40,878
<i>There among cotton clouds</i>

1117
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:45,981
<i>We'll build our nest</i>

1118
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,722
I've never been kissed like that.

1119
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:56,157
Till now, I've made love alone.

1120
01:40:57,351 --> 01:41:00,230
I love you more than my own death.

1121
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,827
Do you want to see me dead?

1122
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:08,902
Yes, and for you to see me dead.

1123
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:14,936
You hear them?

1124
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:18,578
Yes, she says,

1125
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,786
"I've never been kissed like that.

1126
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,759
"Till now, I've made love alone.

1127
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:33,221
"I love you more than my own death.

1128
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:35,928
"Do you want to see me dead?"

1129
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:39,066
What does he answer?

1130
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:44,368
"Yes, and for you to see me dead".

1131
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,095
Look at me.

1132
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,664
Look at me, look at me, look at me,
look at how I die.

1133
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:56,042
Look at me, look at me.

1134
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:02,453
The eclipse!

1135
01:43:32,806 --> 01:43:36,344
- I couldn't save him.
- Nobody could have.

1136
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,554
It's better this way.

1137
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:44,560
I've never seen anyone so happy.

1138
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:56,674
END
