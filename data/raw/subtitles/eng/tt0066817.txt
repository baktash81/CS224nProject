00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,511
You there.
Which way to Pepperinge Eye?

2
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,776
Couldn't say, sir.

3
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,322
It said on the wireless to paint out
the signposts in case the Nazis drop in.

4
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,823
I'm not a Nazi. I'm a British officer.

5
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,794
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

6
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,125
Drive on, corporal.

7
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,354
Sorry to give you so many,
but you do have six bedrooms.

Oh, no trouble, my dear.

9

from those terrible bombings in London.

- They've seen fifth columns around here.

asking suspicious questions.

25

Madam, will you tell this man
that I'm Captain Ainsley Greer,

26
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,969
attached to army headquarters
at Tidbury?

27
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,735
And I'm not to be menaced
by that grotesque object.

28
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,368
- Please be calm, captain.
- I'm exceptionally calm,

29
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:07,946
if one considers as we stand dithering
here, our country is in the grip of crisis.

30
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,718
There's the immediate prospect
of invasion, however remote.

31
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:16,188
Our bedashed enemy might choose this
godforsaken part of the country.

32
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:20,022
Captain, we may have been out of things
for the last few hundred years,

33
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,631
but we pride ourselves
on the history of this village.

34
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:26,531
May I remind the captain,
during the eighth and ninth centuries,

35
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,129
the marauding Danes frequently
came ashore in this precise area.

36
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:35,472
Fascinating. Now, may I inquire,
who is in charge here?

37
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:40,705
I am. Postmistress and chairman
of the War Activities Committee.

38
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,247
Oh, you don't also command
the home guard, do you?

39
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,788
I do not.
That is General Sir Brian Teagler,

40
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:51,860

Northumberland Fugleliers.

No matter what they send?

00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:24,650
Who's standing firm in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the old home guard

48
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,159
That's who!

49
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:30,391
The soldiers of the old home guard

50
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,993
For we wrote the story
Of the old brigade

Of yesterday's parades

- Carry on, sergeant.

SERGEANT:
Parade dismissed!

58
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,378
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

59
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,778
here to check military preparations
in the area.

60
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,750
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

63
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,427
Good morning, general.

64
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,059
I received your message, Mrs. Hobday.
I assume that my parcel has arrived.

65
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,399
- It's in the office.
- Ah, lovely.

66
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,638
- Who is that?
- Miss Price, splendid woman.

67
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,440
Her late father served with me
at Vimy Ridge.

68
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,912
What does she burn in this thing?

69
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,983
- It smells a bit like sulfur.
- Ridiculous.

70
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,312
One can't make motor fuel
out of sulfur.

71
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:02,254
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

72
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,824
Thank you.

73
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,622
- Is it what you expected?
- I imagine so.

74
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,595
Professor Browne
sent you a cat last time, did he not?

75
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,324
Yes.

76
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:16,334
- Professor Browne is well?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

77
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,339
Are we to have the pleasure
of meeting him?

78
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,567
I very much doubt it.

79
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,338
I don't know Professor Browne personally.
Was there something else?

As a matter of fact, there is.
Come this way, Miss Price.

- How are you, miss?
- Hello.

88
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,661
The government are trying to evacuate

as many children as possible
into the country.

90
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,704
- Very sensible of them.
- Today they sent us 45.

91
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,871
And I've had to find homes for all of them
at very short notice.

92
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,951
These are the last three.
All right, children, pick up your things.

93
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,457
You're not suggesting that I should take
these children into my house?

94
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:10,718
Exactly.

95
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,829
Oh, I'm sorry.
But that's quite out of the question.

Besides, I have work to do.
Very important work.

101
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:27,640
Miss Price. You do have
that entire house to yourself.

102
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:31,975
And according to the order of the Ministry
of Civil Defence, you have no choice.

I see.

104
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:36,246
Very well, if that is the case,
I shall take them into my house,

more suitable home as soon as possible.

Fine. Come along.

Ah, good morning, Miss Price.
There they are. Oh, Miss Price.

What a charitable thing you are doing,

109
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,233
taking in these poor unfortunates
from the city.

110
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,431
- Hold this very carefully.
- I wonder, Miss Price,

111
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,940
- if I may drop by later this afternoon?
- Why?

112
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,944
Well, we have their spiritual needs
to consider now, do we not?

That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

Ooh!

Upon occasion,
one does feel alarmed for Miss Price.

Alone, unprotected,
living in that desolate lane.

117
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,860
One does admire her so tremendously.

118
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:31,837
One also admires Miss Price's sturdy
house, the four acres of desirable land

119
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:35,102

overlooking the sea, does one not?

has a cozy place to return to

All right, now, let's see.

336
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,708
Does anyone of you
have a bracelet, or a ring,

337
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,716
- or something that you can twist?
- No, Miss Price.

338
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,944
What about you, Paul?

339
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,555
Always carry a few things
around with me.

340
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,851
You never know
when they might come in useful.

341
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,722
Piece of blue glass.

342
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,328
Lovely bit of string.

343
00:27:29,264 --> 00:27:31,732
A horseshoe nail.

344
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:34,530
What's that?

345
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,502
Knob, come from the bed upstairs.

346
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,131
- It twists, don't it?
- Yeah, twisted right off.

347
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:44,074
Yes, I think that will be all right.

348
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:47,340
Carrie, turn the light down
a little bit, will you?

349
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:02,390
Hellebore, henbane, aconite

350
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,461
Glowworm fire, firefly light

351
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,771
- There. Isn't that pretty?
- Is that all we get?

352
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,607
This knob will now work
the famous traveling spell.

353
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:23,878
- And what's the famous traveling spell?
- How does it work?

354
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,953
Well, you take this knob
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

355
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:29,682
Then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left.

356
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,089
Then, in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go,

357
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:35,128
and the bed will take you there.

358
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,754
- Go on.
- Miss Price, will it, really?

359
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,358
Well, I see no reason
to think otherwise.

360
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:43,930
Oh, thank you for the lovely gift.

361
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:48,202
Oh, I'm sorry. But it does belong to Paul.
He's the only one who can work the spell.

362
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:50,641
- Me?
- Yes.

363
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,509
That's right. Mine, weren't it?

364
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:58,451
- That's the way the spell works.
- Nice mess he'll make of things.

365
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,384
Oh, bother. You children run upstairs.

366
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:07,461
But, mind you, don't try anything
with the bedknob till I get back.

367
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,099
[POST RATTLES]

368
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:25,545
Good morning, Miss Price.

369
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,480
I was just admiring the sound
workmanship of your lovely house.

370
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:31,676
MISS PRICE: Yes?
- I was in the village

371
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,789
and as I was taking
my morning constitutional,

372
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:39,189
Mrs. Hobday asked if I might
deliver this letter to you.

373
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:41,295
Oh, and I must say,
I did welcome the opportunity

374
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,990
of having another chat with you.
I always find them so refreshing.

375
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,033
MISS PRICE:
Thank you very much.

376
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,877
EMELIUS: Dear Madam:
It grieves me to inform you

377
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,387
that due to the war, we have been forced
to close down our college of witchcraft.

378
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,355
This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson

379
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:15,691
in which you expressed
so much interest.

380
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,990
CARRIE: We were wondering
what was keeping you.

381
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:24,070
- I've had some very bad news.
- Is there anything we can do?

382
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:26,469
No. No, thank you.

383
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:28,739
Yes.

384
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:32,369
- Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?

385
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,175
Paul, I need the bedknob back.

386
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:38,752
- I must get to London immediately.
- No. I want to go to the jungle.

387
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,752
- Oh, I know, but...
CHARLIE: Wait a mo.

388
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:43,653
- I'll handle this.
- Charlie, be careful.

389
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:47,852
What you're saying, Miss Price,
is you now wish to take the object

390
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:51,022
which you gave to an innocent child
and get him mixed up

391
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:55,295
- in some kind of witch's hanky-panky.
- Well, yes, in a way, but...

392
00:30:55,436 --> 00:31:00,567
Well, a few odd shillings might
fix matters up, as you might say.

393
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:03,575
No, Charles, money has got
nothing to do with it.

394
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,044
And as a matter of fact,
neither have you.

395
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,043
Come with me, Paul.

396
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,547
Now, Paul,

397
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,285
ridiculous as it may seem to have to
explain this to a 6-year-old child,

398
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,791
but I do need your help.

399
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:22,253
Go ahead.

400
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:25,628
I was expecting
a very important spell in the mail

401
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,292
from my teacher,
Professor Emelius Browne,

402
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,768
- and it hasn't come.
- What's that got to do with my knob?

403
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:35,034
I must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

404
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:40,136
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

405
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,612
That is why I need the knob.

406
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:44,451
What is your decision?

407
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,922
Thank you, Paul.

408
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:58,323
I brought this for your hair, Carrie.
It may be windy.

409
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,763
Thank you. Oh, it's ever so nice.

410
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,496
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?

411
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:05,469
- Twice.
- Good.

412
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:07,632
Charles, you better put on
something warmer.

413
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,073
The bed may travel quite fast.

414
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:13,510
I'm not going. I'm staying right here.

415
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:15,411
But why, Charlie?

416
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,951
All that rubbish about a traveling bed,
it won't work.

417
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:23,023
- That's why.
- Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

418
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:26,684
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off, do we?

419
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:30,093
Now, how's a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room

420
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:32,131
with those little windows?

421
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,694
I don't know, Charles.

422
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:37,327
There's a great many things about magic
that I don't know.

423
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,769
We'll just have to find out.

424
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:44,736
Lovely. Just so's you leave me out of it.
I don't fancy making a fool of myself.

425
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,607
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun anymore.

426
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,217
MISS PRICE:
Help me to tidy up the bed, Carrie.

427
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,717
We don't want to go to London
with an unmade bed.

428
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:55,846
- How old is Charles?
CARRIE: Eleven, going on 12.

429
00:32:56,257 --> 00:33:01,285
I see. That's what my father used to call
the age of not believing.

430
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:03,329
What's that supposed to be?

For something true

You're at the age of not believing

00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:20,374
When all the make-believe is through

That's Charlie to a T.

Your childhood heroes

And your dreams are lost upon a shelf

438
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,761
You're at the age of not believing

439
00:33:35,897 --> 00:33:39,924
And worst of all, you doubt yourself

440
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,001
Throw that into the wastebasket.

441
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:46,436
You're a castaway
Where no one hears you

442
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:50,099
On a barren isle in a lonely sea

443
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:51,768
What's that supposed to be, poetry?

444
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,781
Where did all the happy endings go?

00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:59,751
Where can all the good times be?

Everyone on the bed who's going.

447
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:06,059
You must face the age of not believing

448
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:10,062
Doubting everything you ever knew

00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,273

PAUL: Yes, Miss Price.

454
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,576
MISS PRICE:
Now, when I say go,

455
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:32,982
tap the knob three times
and turn it a quarter turn to the left.

456
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:37,418
- Left?
- That's it.

457
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,026
MISS PRICE:
Now, we better hold on tight.

458
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,856

is something I'm not quite sure of.

- All right, Paul. Ready?

460
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,131

Nothing happened.

465
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:12,449
- That's very odd.
- I told you it wouldn't work.

466
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:18,688
Of course, how stupid of me. We didn't
tell the object where we wanted to go.

467
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,563
Now, Paul, repeat after me.

468
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:25,864

- Marvelous, ain't it?

Not yet, I ain't.

- Well, neither do I, in point of fact.

- Oh, Charlie, don't start that again.

00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:25,177
Why do you keep the curtains closed?

670
00:49:25,345 --> 00:49:28,246
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candlelight.

671
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,409
More likely so as a copper don't peek in
and catch you hiding out here.

672
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,146
Now, why don't you young things
have a look round the house?

673
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:37,518
- I wanna have a chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

674
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:40,320
Yes, run along, children.
But mind you, don't touch anything.

675
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,588

to Mr. Browne.

676

Mr. Browne, where is that book?

677
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:49,292
I must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:04,108
PAUL: What is it, a toy shop?
CARRIE: No, it's a nursery.

679
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:08,813
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.

680
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,816
And what is substitutiary locomotion?

681
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,655
Substitutiary locomotion
is the ancient and mystic art

682
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,629
of causing objects to take on
a life force of their own.

683
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:55,291
Why are you so interested in that?

684
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:57,596
Because I know that
it can only help the war effort.

685
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:00,639
- I must see the nature of the spell.
- Precisely, my good woman.

686
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:03,766
But now you must hear my ideas.

- The theater.

[SINGING] I have always had
A bit of a knack for witchcraft

744
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:56,105
Common spells and simple charms
Came naturally

745
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:58,971
So when the war began
I conjured up a plan

746

you were in the market making inquiries.

or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

Yes. In that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

930
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:40,343
Yes. I'd rather cooperate with a cobra.

931
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:46,943
Would you prefer that I ask Swinburne
to take the book from her?

01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:50,417
Here, you. None of that.

always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth."

BOOKMAN:
But where are the words of the spell?

943
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,788
I assumed they'd be in your half
of the manuscript.

944
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:35,229
But I thought they'd be in yours.

It's a pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

But why the animals?

951
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:56,477
Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages

952
01:12:56,622 --> 01:13:00,023
and searched for the spells
that would make them more like humans.

953
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:04,591
The legend is that finally
the animals rebelled at the experiment,

954
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,791
killed Astoroth,
and stole many of his powers.

955
01:13:08,934 --> 01:13:12,836
- Including the star with the spell on it.
BOOKMAN: Possibly.

They found a ship, sailed away,
and were never heard of again.

957

However, there is a final notation
in my half of the book

958
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,578
saying that in the 17th century

959

was taken from the sea

960

and exposure to the sun.

Before he died, he swore
he had seen an island ruled by animals.

- Where?
- There is, I regret to say, no such island.

The Isle of Naboombu does not exist.

- Nothing.

- Not likely.

- I understand.

- The knob, Paul.
- Right.

984
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,174
Of course you do, my dear. Do you realize
we can tell them the complete truth?

985
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:00,437
They will believe nothing.

I shall cause this bed, and all
the occupants upon it, to disappear.

988

Disappear?

989
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:15,950
I should like to see a cheapjack,
tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.

990
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,426

Now, that was naughty.

PAUL: Where to?

992
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,957
To the island of Naboombu.

993
01:15:23,135 --> 01:15:26,195
- I'm very curious about that place.
PAUL: Good.

994
01:15:26,338 --> 01:15:30,104

Enough of this nonsense.

- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

998
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:23,760
Ain't never seen no island

999
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:27,096
I'm afraid we may have fallen
into the lagoon.

1000

02:16:11,513 --> 02:16:15,176
SERGEANT:
Parade, by the right, quick.

1668
02:16:15,317 --> 02:16:18,184
March, left, left.

1669
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:19,981
Left, right, left.

1670
02:16:26,962 --> 02:16:29,021
I suppose that's it.

1671
02:16:29,164 --> 02:16:31,826
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.

1672
02:16:31,967 --> 02:16:34,902
Well, still got this, ain't I?

1673
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:46,508
CHORUS [SINGING]:
Call out the navy, call out the ranks

1674
02:16:46,648 --> 02:16:50,846
Call out the air force, call out the tanks

1675
02:16:50,986 --> 02:16:55,047
From the cliffs of Dover, call up the gulls

1676
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:59,024
And don't forget the loyal territorials

1677
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:01,594
But who's digging in here

1678
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:08,192
Who will defend every inch of England
No matter what they send?

1679
02:17:08,336 --> 02:17:12,363
Who's standing firm
In our own front yard?

1680
02:17:12,507 --> 02:17:16,705
The soldiers of the old home guard
That's who!

1681
02:17:16,845 --> 02:17:22,408
The soldiers of the old home guard

1682
02:17:35,597 --> 02:17:39,055
I don't mind saying
to see it all together at last,

1683
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,031
there isn't much I wouldn't do.

1684
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,031
---the end---
