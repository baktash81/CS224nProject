2
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,199
Help!

3
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,724
Help!

4
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,648
Please, please, there's no time.
I've been abducted.

5
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,650
I've been taken
to some crazy island.

6
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,785
<i>I know where you are.</i>

7
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,353
<i>Stay there. I will send help.</i>

8
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,623
Thank you. Thank you so much.

9
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,994
You have to hurry, you have
to hurry, you have to hurry.

10
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,564
<i>It will all be fine,
Mrs. Maddison.</i>

11
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,932
Wait.

12
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,266
How do you know my name?

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,602
<i>You are one of my guests.</i>

14
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,316
No, no, no! No!

15
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,285
No! No! No, stop!

16
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,857
Let go of me!
Let me go! Let me go!

17
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,293
<i>Please let me go!</i>

18
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,048
The plane.

19
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,107
Mr. Roarke, the plane.

20
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,542
It's here.

21
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,690
Smiles, everyone.

22
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,760
Smiles.

23
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,967
Well...

24
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:56,236
this place doesn't suck.

25
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,543
YO...

26
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,579
- LO!
- Ha-ha-ha!

27
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,781
Oh, my... Unh!

28
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,717
- This is crazy.
- Thanks.

29
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:12,352
- Free flower necklaces.
- Ooh, welcome drinks.

30
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,056
Ha, let's get lei'd!

31
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,425
Here, let me give you a hand.

32
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,028
- I'm okay.
- No, no, come on. I insist.

33
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,597
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

34
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,899
It was so loud in there.
I'm Patrick.

35
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,300
- I'm Gwen. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

36
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,670
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

37
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,840
And congratulations to each
of you on winning the contest.

38
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:35,009
This weekend,
you will be our VIPs.

39
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,911
In return, all we ask

40
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,913
is that you brag
about us online

41
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,748
- when you get home.
- Marketing 101.

42
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm Julia,
the personal assistant

43
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,252
to your host, Mr. Roarke.

44
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,753
Yeah, what's his story?

45
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,221
I couldn't begin to tell you.

46
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,289
I heard Roarke's family
bought this island

47
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,059
from the natives 200 years ago
for six cases of rum.

48
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:55,096
I heard that he was
an angel investor in the '90s

49
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,998
and got bored
with Silicon Valley.

50
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,800
And opened an amusement park?

51
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,102
Trust me, the island
is so much more.

52
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,971
Here, anything and everything
is possible.

53
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,438
Oh, yes. Unh!

54
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,208
You guys high-five a lot?

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,843
- All the time.
- All the time, baby.

56
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,511
- Wow.
- Mr. Roarke is making

57
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,847
final preparations.
He will meet you in the bar

58
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,749
for an evening drink.
In the meantime,

59
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,584
we will take you to your rooms,

60
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,486
so you may change
and freshen up.

61
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,189
No service.

62
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,758
Guess not everything's possible.

63
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,467
Gentlemen, I'll ask
you to wait at the bar.

64
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,737
Your quarters will be
ready shortly.

65
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,906
And the rest of you,
please follow me.

66
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
Your bungalows are this way.

67
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:42,310
- Dude!
- Ha!

68
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,445
This is... Wow, I can't believe
you get to bring me.

69
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,281
Come on. It wouldn't be
a dream vacay

70
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,617
without my baby bro.
Right? Oh!

71
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,665
Oh.

72
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,234
Here you go.

73
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,435
There's no need for money here.

74
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,513
Mm.

75
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,206
Wow. Is this just for me?

76
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,408
Well, it's called
Fantasy Island for a reason.

77
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,710
A place where anything

78
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,947
and everything is
possible, you said.

79
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,583
What you didn't say is how.

80
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,186
Mr. Roarke tailors each fantasy
specifically to the guest.

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,821
Based on
a one-page questionnaire?

82
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,658
I will confess,
I'm relatively new here.

83
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,260
So how Mr. Roarke does
what he does

84
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,563
is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

85
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,767
What I do know...

86
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,471
is that your life is about
to change forever.

87
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,044
I hope you're ready.

88
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,663
- Here you are.
- I will take two of those.

89
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,266
- Thank you.
- Oh, great. I need a drink.

90
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,269
Mm, sorry, I'm double-fisting.

91
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:57,405
Mm, uh, can we talk
to Mr. Roarke, please?

92
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,907
We still don't have our rooms.
Sir? Hello?

93
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,709
Hey, my brother's talking
to you.

94
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,377
- I'm his brother. Hello?
- Wait.

95
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:04,979
You guys are actually brothers?

96
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,148
Oh, you think because
we're different colors

97
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,416
- we can't be brothers?
- Wow.

98
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,619
- Dude, racist much?
- No. I mean...

99
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,254
- What's up?
- What do you mean?

100
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,755
- Come on.
- You don't like Asians?

101
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,091
- Why do you hate Asians?
- That's not what I said.

102
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,895
Verbatim what you said.
You got a racist haircut.

103
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,032
- Look at his face.
- I'm just joking, man. No.

104
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,367
My dad married his mom

105
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,503
when this little dude
was still in Pampers.

106
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,540
- I'm JD. You can call him "T."
- Dude.

107
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,074
- What?
- We talked about this.

108
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,642
- Whatever.
- College nickname.

109
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,311
- "Brax" is fine.
- Patrick. Nice to meet you guys.

110
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,480
You boys can always take
Patrick's bungalow

111
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,583
and he can "bungalow" with me.

112
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm Melanie. I don't think
we had a chance to meet.

113
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,822
- It was pretty noisy.
- I can get pretty noisy.

114
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:51,058
- Damn.
- You are forward, Melanie.

115
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,894
You have no idea, Patrick.

116
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,763
So, what's your fantasy?

117
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,902
Oh, that's a question
for the room.

118
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,505
I'm curious how this all works.

119
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,939
I was wondering that myself.

120
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,640
Virtual reality,
obviously.

121
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,076
Maybe it's like LARP,
live-action role-playing.

122
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,579
It's actually pretty fun.

123
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,646
So I've heard.

124
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,049
From, like, dorks. Heh.

125
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,217
- You saved it.
- Thank you.

126
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,785
I bet he's right. It's gotta be

127
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,487
some sort
of immersive experience.

128
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,123
What if your fantasy involves
a person from your life?

129
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,225
Holograms, like Tupac.

130
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,727
- What if it's somebody who died?
- Tupac.

131
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,963
I saw on Reddit
that the guy pumps the drinks

132
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,632
with tons of hallucinogens.
Crazy.

133
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,736
I promise,

134
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,705
the only thing in those drinks

135
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,007
is the finest imported rum.

136
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,775
Good evening. I am Mr. Roarke,

137
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,944
the ambassador
to your deepest desires.

138
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,047
Let me officially welcome you
to Fantasy Island.

139
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,349
- Hey, hey!
- Yeah!

140
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,483
Thank you, Mr. Roarke.

141
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:50,885
We were all just discussing

142
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,020
- how this works exactly.
- You will know soon.

143
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:54,889
I promise,
you won't be disappointed.

144
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,625
The island has two rules.

145
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,826
There is only one fantasy
per guest.

146
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,530
And two, you must see
your fantasy through

147
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,165
to its natural conclusion,
no matter what.

148
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:06,635
- Why wouldn't we?
- Fantasies rarely play out

149
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,035
as you or I might expect,

150
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,938
but they always play out
exactly as they should.

151
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,673
Not even you know
how they'll go?

152
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:13,841
Only the island knows.

153
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,544
I am but its humble steward.

154
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,479
- So when does this all begin?
- After a good night's rest.

155
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,981
Oh. My brother and I still
don't have our rooms.

156
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,785
I hope the "island" is ready for
a tough but fair Yelp review.

157
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,820
That's because, gentlemen,

158
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,156
your fantasy begins now.

159
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,160
- How far is this place?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:34,962
Not really into bushwhacking.

161
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,532
- Is that why Jenni dumped you?
- Too soon, T. Come on.

162
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,434
Stop with the nickname.
I'm not playing.

163
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,369
We are very close.

164
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,038
You wrote on your questionnaire

165
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,073
your fantasy was
to have it all, no?

166
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,742
- Yeah.
- Well...

167
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,512
it's all yours.

168
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,624
Hey! Oh!

169
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,458
Oh, my God!

170
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,528
Oh, he did a backflip!
He did it!

171
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,769
Oh! Super on-the-nose,
Roarke,

172
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,272
but I still love it.
Ha-ha-ha!

173
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,742
- Champagne, boys?
- Not for me. Asian glow.

174
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,112
Roarke, don't forget what I told
you about my baby brother Brax.

175
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,682
- Told him you're gay.
- How could I?

176
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,952
Oh, you think being gay
means all I want

177
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,889
is shirtless, ripped,
juicy, delicious men?

178
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,891
I got layers, dudes.

179
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,733
Two layers. I got two layers.

180
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,568
Fantasy fucking Island!

181
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,069
If you need me,

182
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,438
just pick up any phone.

183
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,275
- Enjoy your evening.
- Oh, we will.

184
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,559
This is some good weed.

185
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,338
- Good morning.
- Aah! Oh!

186
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,643
Mr. Roarke has called for you.

187
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,549
Ms. Olsen, please, sit.

188
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,316
Thank you, Mr. Roarke.

189
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,919
I've been helping people realize
their fantasies

190
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,988
for longer than I care to say.

191
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,959
Often, they are
painfully unimaginative.

192
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,562
- Lots of sex stuff.
- Yeah.

193
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:23,197
But yours...
Yours is quite abstract.

194
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,034
You wrote, "Happiness and I
aren't exactly compatible.

195
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,870
Now, mistakes and regrets,
we're old friends.

196
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:33,508
So if I had one wish, I guess
it would be to get a do-over."

197
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,710
Is it too late
to change to sex stuff?

198
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,311
No, no, no. I like this.

199
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,682
This is a challenge.
And I accept.

200
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,149
Oh, good.

201
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,984
What do you not like
about your life?

202
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,320
Let us start with your job.
Real estate.

203
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,423
Mostly commercial.
I mean, what's to like?

204
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,392
Relationship?

205
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,295
Single.

206
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:56,930
- Do you want children?
- I'm sorry,

207
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,233
is this a therapy session
or a vacation?

208
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,467
If you're lucky, both.

209
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,742
I always pictured myself with...

210
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:10,377
just one little girl.

211
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:13,147
And with whom did you hope
to have this little girl?

212
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,283
Ms. Olsen...

213
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,220
regret... is a disease.

214
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,690
It has afflicted you
for too long,

215
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:25,894
and I can help you cure it.

216
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:26,960
If you let me.

217
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,932
- His name was Allen.
- Very good.

218
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,636
And why did it not work
with Mr. Allen?

219
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,740
Bad timing. When we met,
I was kind of in a dark place.

220
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:42,544
At our one-year anniversary
dinner, he proposed.

221
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,445
I said no.

222
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,081
You did not believe
Allen loved you

223
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,418
because you do not believe
you deserve love.

224
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,826
If you could
do that moment over,

225
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,293
would you say yes?

226
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:02,496
Yeah.

227
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,202
Behind those doors...

228
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,337
is your fantasy.

229
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:13,875
A chance to change
the moment you regret the most.

230
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,045
Madame.

231
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,132
What is that?

232
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,603
Ms. Olsen, please.

233
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:43,337
The doors.

234
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,655
Maestro's?

235
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,423
Down to the last detail.

236
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,259
- How did you...?
- Yes.

237
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,696
Yes, and this is
where Mr. Allen proposed.

238
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,600
You flew him in?

239
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,269
- You knew?
- Almost thought you stood me up.

240
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,037
Ah.
Reservation under Chambers.

241
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,706
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:21,509
Right this way.

243
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,249
- Allen, I'm so sorry...
- For what?

244
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,587
Well, that they dragged you
into this. I can't...

245
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,856
Oh, God. You didn't
pay to get here, did you?

246
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:39,192
No. My cabbie was just like,
"No charge, man. It's cool."

247
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,261
What...?

248
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,496
Enjoy your meal.

249
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,807
You can drop the act now.

250
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,742
I don't speak to you
for five years,

251
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,879
and you just show up here,
looking...

252
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:00,447
great, by the way.
You haven't aged a day.

253
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,317
I saw you in my bed
this morning.

254
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,252
Is this an intervention?

255
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,656
You role-play with me and
I learn something about myself?

256
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,258
Okay, when and where
did you bump your head today?

257
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,895
Seriously, you okay?

258
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,897
Will you excuse me?

259
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,169
This is not what I wanted.

260
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,872
This is your second chance
to say yes

261
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:27,575
- to his marriage proposal.
- But what is the point?

262
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,043
It doesn't change anything.

263
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,245
You are here because
regret has ruined your life.

264
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,616
Do not make this another moment
you will regret.

265
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,283
But...

266
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,854
...it's not real.

267
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,823
- Is it?
- This is Fantasy Island.

268
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,994
It's as real as you make it.

269
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,831
Guess they're saving
the best for last.

270
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,566
Your fantasy hasn't
started either?

271
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,267
- No. Mind if I join you?
- Please.

272
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,437
This guy's been
giving me nothing.

273
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:00,207
- Would you like a cocktail, sir?
- Oh, no, thanks.

274
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,810
- You nervous?
- A little.

275
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,312
Well, I'd ask you
about your fantasy again,

276
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,616
but you didn't really want to
talk about it last night, so...

277
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,350
This is gonna sound stupid.

278
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,321
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to enlist.

279
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:19,159
But my mom made me promise that
I wouldn't, so I became a cop.

280
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,629
Figured I'd do some good,
see some action.

281
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,698
- But you didn't?
- No. There was an incident.

282
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,899
Got stuck behind a desk.

283
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,534
When this came around,
I figured:

284
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:28,168
"This is my chance
to play soldier,"

285
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,539
even if it's just actors
with blanks and...

286
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:33,440
Never enlisted?

287
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:35,175
What's up with the dog tags?

288
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,978
Uh, for luck.

289
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:40,480
Well, if you're worried
<i>your</i> fantasy sounds stupid,

290
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:43,518
just wait
until you hear mine.

291
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,953
- Revenge on a childhood bully.
- You got bullied?

292
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:49,189
I was a very late bloomer.

293
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,792
Built like a small boy.

294
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:53,628
So when the most popular girl
in school decided

295
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:56,631
to make me her favorite target,
I didn't take it well.

296
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:59,433
I'm not sure how you should take
a bucket of toilet water

297
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,102
on your head
at the eighth-grade dance.

298
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,437
- That's terrible.
- I was having a lot of anxiety,

299
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,573
so my mom forced me
to go see this shrink,

300
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:08,876
aka Dr. Torture.
Sometimes he talked so much,

301
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,446
I wanted to staple his mouth
shut. Anyway, Dr. Torture,

302
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,448
he told me to write letters
to classmates

303
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,283
that I wanted to connect with.

304
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,052
It was, like, an exercise.

305
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:22,222
And one day, Sloane,
my tormentor, stole the letters

306
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,093
and then plastered them
all over the cafeteria.

307
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,664
Yeah, I was branded
"psycho stalker freak" for life.

308
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:32,667
I just want to feel what it's
like to be on the other end.

309
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,503
I mean, obviously,
the fantasy won't be real,

310
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,605
but that's why
we go to horror movies

311
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,708
and ride roller coasters, right?
To feel something?

312
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,910
I'd like to
think that this is...

313
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,046
more exciting
than riding a roller coaster.

314
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,447
Mr. Sullivan, do you mind
giving us some privacy?

315
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,784
I need to give
Ms. Cole instructions.

316
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:55,022
In the meantime, feel free
to do push-ups or crunches.

317
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,958
- Squats, maybe.
- No, it's okay.

318
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,259
He knows about Sloane.
I'm owning it.

319
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,163
Ah! Okay. No exercise.

320
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,966
In the lobby...
there is an elevator.

321
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,438
<i>Inside, push the button
for the floor with no name.</i>

322
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,080
Can I record it with my phone?

323
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,414
- So I can remember it.
- It is your fantasy.

324
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,812
Jeez.

325
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,464
Hello?

326
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,174
<i>Okay, I'm on Fantasy Island.</i>

327
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:22,475
<i>I'm in a super creepy
control room.</i>

328
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,344
<i>I'm about
to get this thing started.</i>

329
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,519
Huh, there's a lot
of red buttons.

330
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:36,524
That one's flashing.
Must be the one.

331
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,694
Here we go.

332
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:44,332
No way.

333
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,301
Sloane?

334
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,842
That is a really good hologram.

335
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,746
Yeah, she looks better
than Tupac.

336
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,719
"Open me."

337
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:13,060
"A variety of buttons for
a variety of revenge. Enjoy."

338
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,129
Okay, Holo-Sloane.

339
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,431
Let's have some fun.

340
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:29,043
Oh, my God.

341
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,779
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

342
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:34,882
Uh...

343
00:23:48,396 --> 00:23:50,798
Toilet water. Yes.

344
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:53,234
Very eighth-grade dance.

345
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,604
Mama likes. Huh...

346
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,875
Wait, that's Sloane.

347
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:03,978
Whoa!

348
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,814
Whoa, that is not her husband.

349
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,484
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

350
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,688
My God, that is
so not her husband.

351
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,289
<i>Good.</i>

352
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,173
Oh, shit.

353
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:39,313
Well, when on Fantasy Island...

354
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:46,354
That is her husband.

355
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,029
<i>Sloane?</i>

356
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,998
<i>Uh, what the hell is this?</i>

357
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:58,666
<i>Oh! Is that Greg?</i>

358
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:03,371
<i>Don't tell me that's where
you've been the last two days.</i>

359
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:06,340
- "The last two days"?
- <i>How could you do this to me?</i>

360
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:10,711
- <i>Will you say something?</i>
- Oh, my God.

361
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,320
Um, Roarke?

362
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:21,722
- Uh, you there? Look, I'm done.
- <i>Let me go!</i>

363
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:23,591
I get it.
My fantasy was revenge,

364
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:26,594
but I didn't think
you would actually kidnap her.

365
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:27,695
Come on.

366
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,097
Hey!

367
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:32,666
Hey!

368
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,483
- Your fatigues, soldier.
- This is it?

369
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:52,920
Just put them on. You will know
when your fantasy has begun.

370
00:25:57,358 --> 00:25:59,593
- <i>Call of Duty</i> time.
- Enjoy.

371
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,402
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Shh!

372
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,572
- Whisper.
- You a part of my fantasy?

373
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,439
This place ain't
what you think it is.

374
00:26:45,574 --> 00:26:48,209
People die here.
If you don't listen to me...

375
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,546
Oh, shit.

376
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,914
- Too many of them.
- Huh? Where you going?

377
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,449
- Do I come with you?
- Don't move.

378
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:57,552
- Hey.
- Don't even think about it.

379
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,787
It's okay. I'm a soldier too.

380
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,656
- What are you doing out here?
- I got separated from my unit.

381
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,160
Didn't know
there was another team.

382
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,062
We're a...

383
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,663
covert operation.

384
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:12,567
Surprised to see you out here.

385
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,603
I hate surprises.

386
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:16,270
And liars.

387
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,973
I'm not... Hey, hey.

388
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:21,308
- No, but this isn't...
- You can tell it to the LT.

389
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:22,877
- Shut up and walk.
- Hey.

390
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,013
Okay. Heh.

391
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:29,717
You guys look good.
Really great.

392
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,118
Shh!

393
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:38,627
Yeah, dude.

394
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,829
- Mm-mm.
- Mm.

395
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:47,268
So did you have fun with your
boy toy, Alejandro, last night?

396
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:54,775
I'm surprised
he can still stand.

397
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,178
I'm surprised he wasn't
turned off by your terrible ink.

398
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:58,879
Can't wait
to get that lasered off.

399
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,347
- Seriously.
- What about you?

400
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:01,815
- Hm?
- Saw you talking

401
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,350
to Malibu Barbie last night.

402
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:04,985
- How'd that go?
- Chastity?

403
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,887
Heh, believe me,
the name functions

404
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,956
purely on an ironic level.

405
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,025
We boned. Twice.

406
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:14,461
- You're finally over Jenni, then?
- Jenni who? Heh!

407
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:15,896
Chastity?

408
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,064
- Oh.
- Come over here.

409
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:20,167
- Hi, boys.
- Hey. What's up?

410
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,836
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

411
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,740
So I heard you two had
a crazy night last night.

412
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,909
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Crazy...

413
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:30,612
- how much he cried.
- What?

414
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:31,680
- Sorry.
- Ha-ha-ha!

415
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,247
Isn't there some guest-fantasy

416
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,015
confidentiality policy
or something?

417
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:36,383
- Let me guess.
- Jenni.

418
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:39,119
- Oh, ha, ha!
- Yeah. It's actually sweet.

419
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:41,121
She's his moon and his stars.

420
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:43,525
You know what, Chas?
You suck at keeping secrets.

421
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,226
She broke up with him
because of me.

422
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,794
For the millionth time,
she didn't.

423
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,697
We spent your anniversary
getting high

424
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:49,863
and playing <i>Mario Kart.</i>

425
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:51,765
Couldn't you just move
back home?

426
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,603
Our lame-ass parents
disowned him when he came out.

427
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,271
- Seven years ago.
- Gay wasn't cool back then.

428
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,906
Oh. Wouldn't you be happy

429
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,242
if you just, I don't know,
got your own places?

430
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,944
- Seriously, with the questions.
- Dude, she's right.

431
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:06,046
You put your whole life
on hold for me.

432
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,283
- Maybe I should move out.
- Who'd sleep on the couch then?

433
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,353
No one. That's the point.

434
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:15,022
Chastity Belt, can you just
give us a little bro time?

435
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,691
- Yeah.
- Thanks so much.

436
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,792
We'll see you in a bit.
Okay.

437
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:24,265
Little bro, buddy, listen,
that weed's got you "para-nuts."

438
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:26,900
Look, my life is not on hold
because of you.

439
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:30,572
It crushes because of you.
Okay? Now, come on.

440
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:34,074
Let's see what other swag
this house has to offer.

441
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,442
Goodbye, models!

442
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,745
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.

443
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:38,345
Heh, heh, that's so cool.

444
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:41,782
There is no excuse for 14 boxes.

445
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,951
It was an intimidating group
of Girl Scouts.

446
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,687
- Fourteen? Ha-ha-ha!
- Fourteen.

447
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,454
I'm telling you,
when we have kids,

448
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,724
I'm gonna be such a pushover.

449
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,628
When we have kids?

450
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,331
I know it's only been a year,

451
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,601
but you make me think
about the future.

452
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,604
Look, it has been amazing
seeing you,

453
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,972
but you don't have to keep up
with this charade.

454
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:08,942
You're pushing me away because
that's what you do, but...

455
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:12,479
Look, I'm asking you
not to this time. Okay?

456
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:21,989
Will you marry me?

457
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:26,393
Yes.

458
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,961
Yes.

459
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,668
Bravo!

460
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,405
Champagne, please!
Champagne. Baby?

461
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,349
But this is just a fantasy.

462
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,518
That I want
for the rest of my life.

463
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,355
Me too.

464
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:02,564
You will not believe what
they have in my exact size.

465
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:05,065
Oh, baby.

466
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,736
No way!

467
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:09,637
- Bling-bling!
- Bling!

468
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:12,172
- Ah, I was late. Do it again.
- Okay.

469
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,675
Bling-bling!

470
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:16,176
Buddy, this place puts
<i>MTV's Cribs</i> to shame.

471
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,379
This is the reboot.

472
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,683
- Dude.
- What?

473
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,552
- Is that a secret room?
- Oh!

474
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:27,522
I bet that's where they keep
all the good shit. Heh.

475
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:30,592
Panic room!

476
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,727
Oh, I feel
just like Jodie Foster

477
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,094
in that Jodie Foster movie.

478
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,767
- Oh! My God!
- This is so dope!

479
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,034
Oh, check it out.
Map of the whole house. Huh.

480
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,771
Do all rich people
have panic rooms?

481
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,406
Yeah, man. Gotta spend
that Bitcoin on something.

482
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,709
Like garages
next to their armories?

483
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:51,912
Oh, yippee-ki-yes, please.

484
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:54,549
- Ha, ha! Yes!
- Oh, my God!

485
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,385
Shall we call it "Alejandro"?

486
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,120
Oh, he's actually a pacifist.

487
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,122
Ohh, you're talking
about his dick.

488
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,592
- Yeah. God.
- Yeah, that tracks.

489
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,361
Oh, my God. Look at
all these cameras, dude.

490
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:10,030
Oh, boy, hope they don't
have cameras in the bathroom.

491
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:12,801
- I did gross stuff in there.
- We got a lot of bodyguards.

492
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,269
Yeah, dude. Ballers gotta
have security, right?

493
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,706
They gotta have grenades too?

494
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,774
I got an idea.

495
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:26,748
- Whoa! Little bro buddy! Hey.
- Huh?

496
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,650
Haven't you ever seen
<i>Band of Brothers?</i>

497
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,484
I let go of this handle,
we go boom.

498
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:33,454
- Make it go boom.
- Let's do it.

499
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:44,766
Keep moving.

500
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,367
Hey, think you could loosen
these up a little bit?

501
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:49,537
My fantasy didn't
really involve bondage.

502
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,706
I don't know what
you're yapping about, but...

503
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,141
- I'll take a look.
- Leave him alone, Himoff.

504
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,376
Let's go. Come on.

505
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,947
All right. So, what are
you guys up to, huh?

506
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,448
- What is this mission?
- U.S. hostages are being held

507
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:04,351
just over the border. We're
slipping in to pull them out.

508
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:05,620
Any more classified intel

509
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,287
you wanna share
with the prisoner?

510
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:10,758
- Come on, sarge, he's American.
- Yeah, maybe.

511
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:13,093
But he's no soldier.

512
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,367
LT!

513
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:25,205
You should talk to this guy.

514
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,140
Claims he's one of us.

515
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:29,711
Where'd you find him?

516
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:32,412
Recon past the south ridge.

517
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,182
Thought we were
the only game in town, huh?

518
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,185
We are.

519
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,756
You got a name?

520
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,390
- What are you doing, Roarke?!
- Hey.

521
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,595
- Keep your voice down.
- Yeah, cut the act. Get Roarke.

522
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:51,231
- This isn't what I asked for.
- Got 10 seconds to ID yourself.

523
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,601
They did a good job, you look
like him. But know what?

524
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,235
He was a lot taller than you.

525
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,739
- Five seconds.
- Yeah, I'll get Roarke myself.

526
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,674
- Enough bullshit.
- Get your hands off me.

527
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,408
Hey, don't touch that.

528
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,814
Why is my name on your dog tags?

529
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,083
- Contact!
- Cover fire!

530
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,419
- To the right!
- Cover fire! Cover fire!

531
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,363
Get down!

532
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:40,882
Um, hello?

533
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,986
Please, I need help.

534
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:51,826
Did you just send someone?

535
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:04,104
Roarke, if you can hear me,
I know what I said.

536
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:06,440
I wanted to humiliate Sloane
and watch her cry,

537
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,108
but this is not what I meant!

538
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:16,651
Stop! Stop! Call it off!

539
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,105
Dr. Torture?

540
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,210
No. No, wait!

541
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,649
Come on, come on.

542
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,889
- Aah!
- No, stop!

543
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,031
Shit. Uh...

544
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,701
Intercom.

545
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:07,935
Uh...

546
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,269
<i>Sorry. Um...</i>

547
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,672
<i>please continue.</i>

548
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:13,007
Uh...

549
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,380
Okay, so I want you
to cut off her ring finger

550
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,050
<i>on her...</i>

551
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,718
<i>On her left hand.</i>

552
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,822
- Unh!
- No! No, her right hand.

553
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,322
<i>Right hand.</i>

554
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:31,526
This is my fantasy. Just do it.

555
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:53,848
Easy.

556
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,771
Meredith?

557
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,874
- Melanie.
- What are you doing here?

558
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,409
Same as you.
I was kidnapped. Come on.

559
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,078
Go, go, go.

560
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,249
- Thank you. You saved my life.
- It's not saved yet.

561
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:36,256
To the best weekend
of our lives!

562
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,258
Screw the glow,
I'll drink to that.

563
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,930
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

564
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,666
Were those gunshots?

565
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,468
Ooh, maybe somebody broke
into the armory.

566
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:49,737
Hey, a laser pointer.

567
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,843
Come on, models.
Come on.

568
00:37:57,145 --> 00:37:58,946
- Oh!
- Don't panic, don't panic.

569
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,948
- Panic room!
- Yes! Go, go!

570
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,184
- What panic room?
- Come on, models!

571
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:05,119
I can't run in these shoes!

572
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,922
- Guys, come on. It's up here!
- Go, go, go!

573
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,991
- Oh, my God.
- Guys, come on!

574
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:12,593
- Come here. It's right here.
- I'm gonna call Roarke.

575
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,902
Are you and your brother
enjoying your fantasy?

576
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:23,004
We loved it
until guys with guns showed up.

577
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,939
Come on, you guys.
Let's go. Seriously.

578
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,108
Ah, yes.
Sounds like Kalashov's men.

579
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,010
- Who the hell is Kalashov?
- <i>A businessman</i>

580
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,646
- <i>who formerly owned the house.</i>
- What kind of business?

581
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,821
<i>I'm afraid the problem
with having it all</i>

582
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:42,023
is usually other people
want to take it.

583
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,958
We don't really
wanna have it all, okay?

584
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,693
We wanna borrow it
for the weekend.

585
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:48,162
Get off the phone.
We gotta get in the panic room.

586
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:49,530
- Come on! What?
- Door!

587
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:52,066
No! Chas, hey!

588
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,135
It's us. Hello?

589
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,238
- Kind of being a Chas-hole.
- Seriously, I'm such a weenie.

590
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,706
I don't even do escape rooms.

591
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,975
As I have told you,
once a fantasy begins,

592
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,744
you must see it through
to its natural conclusion.

593
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,013
Nobody knew
what you meant by that!

594
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,149
Have a good night.

595
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,719
He hung up.

596
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,831
Okay, we... You know what?
We gotta calm down.

597
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:25,299
- Okay.
- Gotta calm down.

598
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:26,499
This is all fake, right?

599
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,805
- Ooh!
- Alejandro's a hell of an actor.

600
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,006
Oh, so, what do we do?

601
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,675
We surrender!

602
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,144
I'm still trying
to process this.

603
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:41,949
You and I were kidnapped
by the same person?

604
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:45,753
- I know. It's crazy, right?
- How did you escape?

605
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:48,022
Headbutt.

606
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:49,790
I... I headbutted the guard.

607
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:52,293
I stole his gun
and just capped him.

608
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:54,128
- Wow.
- Yeah.

609
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:56,631
What happened to the gun?

610
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:57,732
I lost it.

611
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,869
What kind of twisted,
disgusting freak

612
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,038
would wanna ruin my life
and make me watch?

613
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,907
It's obviously someone
we both know.

614
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,309
Someone we went
to high school with.

615
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,144
What about
that psycho stalker girl?

616
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:12,580
You know the one
that wrote letters to everyone?

617
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:14,282
Totally.

618
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,350
That's a really good call.

619
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,451
What was her name again?

620
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:21,589
- Mm, Meredith?
- Oh, my God.

621
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:24,959
- What?
- Did they make you wear that?

622
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,294
I am so sorry.

623
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,562
Look, I don't know
how we both ended up here,

624
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,698
but you got us out
of that hellhole.

625
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:33,367
- No biggie.
- Now I'm gonna get us home.

626
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,936
They brought me here in a boat.

627
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,572
Find the shore,
we find a way out of here.

628
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:02,430
Unless your fantasy is to die,

629
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,699
you better come with me.

630
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,303
We should probably go with him.

631
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,005
Yeah.

632
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,635
What's wrong?

633
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,604
Is something wrong?

634
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:46,907
No, no.

635
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,178
Nothing's wrong.

636
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,351
Everything's perfect.

637
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,395
Hello?

638
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,812
Anybody there?

639
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:38,492
Whoa! Ha, ha!

640
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:41,530
- Dazed and confused.
- Huh?

641
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:43,864
You know, like that movie
came out last year.

642
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:46,200
"That's what I love
about high school girls."

643
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,035
Shut up, Himoff.
No more flashes.

644
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:52,473
Whoa, hey, hey.
No, no, no. I can explain.

645
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,909
Yeah. You better.
Have a little chat, you and me.

646
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,610
Let's go. On your feet.

647
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,379
Walk.

648
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,316
Your tags have my name on them.

649
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,088
Then I find this
in your wallet.

650
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,890
- Hey, hey. Be careful with that.
- Ah-ah-ah.

651
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:13,761
Why do you have
a picture of me and my son?

652
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:16,063
Look, you gotta be
straight with me.

653
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:18,732
- Are you an actor?
- Am I an actor? I'm a soldier.

654
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:21,969
Time for you to be straight
with me. Where did you get this?

655
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,907
- That's me when I was 9.
- Nah, don't.

656
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:30,478
- That's my son.
- And he's got a nickname.

657
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,146
What is it?

658
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,148
Why don't you tell me.

659
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,051
Patch.

660
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,121
Wrong.

661
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:42,490
Ali.

662
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,960
Then I find your ID.

663
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:48,329
Your face with my son's name
and birthday on it.

664
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:50,164
Enough games.
Time for you to tell me

665
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:53,267
what the hell's going on here.

666
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,103
I was born
four months premature.

667
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:58,706
The doctor said
I wouldn't make it, but I did.

668
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,142
You said I wasn't the type
to throw in the towel.

669
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,644
That I was a fighter.

670
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:05,146
Like Muhammad Ali.

671
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:11,452
- Who told you that story?
- You did. Every birthday.

672
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:13,522
You're saying you're my son?

673
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,190
Mm-mm.

674
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:20,127
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

675
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:22,763
Uh, now I'm not so sure.

676
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:24,999
When was the last time
you saw him?

677
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:26,700
Nine months...

678
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:30,137
seven days ago.

679
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:32,339
It was raining.

680
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,543
He refused his mama's umbrella.

681
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:37,512
You know, he wanted
to show me he was tough.

682
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:40,047
That's not why I did it.

683
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:42,816
It's so that you couldn't tell
I was crying.

684
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,658
How is this happening?

685
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:53,194
There's this place,
this island.

686
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,162
It can make
whatever you want come true.

687
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:56,764
I said I wanted to be a soldier.

688
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:58,699
What I really wanted
was to see you again.

689
00:44:58,832 --> 00:45:01,670
Somehow the island knew.

690
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,672
When's the last time
you saw me?

691
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:07,041
Twenty-seven years,
six months, five days.

692
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:11,779
- So I never made it home?
- You died saving your men

693
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,882
on a classified mission
in Venezuela.

694
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,717
Venezuela, you sure?

695
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,086
Yeah, of course. Why?

696
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,089
Because we'll be there tomorrow.

697
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:01,395
- Gather up the crew...
- Mr. Roarke.

698
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:05,165
- Ms. Olsen, good morning.
- It's a really good photoshop.

699
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,468
I don't know
how you got it on my phone

700
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:09,837
but it does look real.

701
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,741
Ah, it is real. You said yes
to Allen, so you're married.

702
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:16,076
- Looks like a lovely ceremony.
- He just proposed last night.

703
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,778
Are you sure?

704
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:24,118
There's something
different about him.

705
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:28,389
- He looks older.
- You've been married five years.

706
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:31,892
I don't understand.

707
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:36,598
Daddy, look what I found.

708
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:38,999
- Oh, my gosh...
- Her name is Lila.

709
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:41,835
She's my...?

710
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,405
Daughter.

711
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:47,007
This is the life
you've always wanted, no?

712
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,611
What do you think, yes?

713
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:53,515
Okay, enough. She's a...
She's a child.

714
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:55,482
And you are her mother.

715
00:46:55,617 --> 00:46:57,519
See for yourself.

716
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:05,492
<i>Baby girl.</i>

717
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:14,068
<i>Sleep tight, honey.</i>

718
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:18,540
- Ah...
- Ah...

719
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,410
How is this possible?

720
00:47:23,545 --> 00:47:25,479
It's the island.

721
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:27,981
The island has,
uh, great powers.

722
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:32,319
I first heard of its legend
many, many years ago.

723
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:36,390
A place where anything
is possible. I was obsessed.

724
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:39,561
I convinced my wife
to help me find it.

725
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:42,831
Our journey was long
and hard, and...

726
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:48,703
She died before we, uh...
Before we arrived.

727
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,872
When I finally discovered
this place,

728
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:55,543
I wished for her to live again.

729
00:47:55,677 --> 00:47:59,179
To return just as I met her.
Forever.

730
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,950
It brought her back to...?

731
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,387
- To life?
- Yes.

732
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:10,924
As long as I stay here and I
orchestrate all the fantasies...

733
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,727
she lives.

734
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:15,597
The island
has granted your wish too.

735
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,868
To have the family
you've always wanted.

736
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,605
- A life you always dreamt of.
- More sand on the side.

737
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:26,440
- That's perfect.
- I suggest you start living it.

738
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,711
Mommy, come play!

739
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,054
Wrap it up, sergeant.

740
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:45,025
Hey, walk with me.

741
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,927
Grab your ruck.

742
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:50,799
Hey, LT, over here.

743
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,736
The hell are you doing, Himoff?

744
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,970
You two look so alike,
you could be related.

745
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,741
- I just thought that...
- Don't do that. Don't think.

746
00:48:59,874 --> 00:49:01,108
Do your job.

747
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:08,583
I don't know
how this is happening,

748
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:10,752
but I believe you,
so we're leaving.

749
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:13,755
It's a straight shot to Panama.
I can get us home from there.

750
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:16,390
Wait. You're calling off
the mission?

751
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:18,526
No. I'm getting us out of here.

752
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,830
Well, you can't do that.
You're a hero.

753
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:23,997
You know what a hero is?

754
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,668
A hero's some guy
who's too stupid to stay alive.

755
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:29,336
No, no, no. This isn't
what's supposed to happen.

756
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,272
So then what's supposed
to happen?

757
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:33,875
I'm supposed to die?

758
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,277
- Let's go.
- Look, if you do this,

759
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:40,515
if you run, I don't know
what will happen to you, to me,

760
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:42,684
but I know those men
back there, your men,

761
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:45,285
they'll die because
you won't be there to save them.

762
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:49,524
- You don't know that.
- I do! It's why I have your tags.

763
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:53,628
There was a grenade. You threw
yourself on it to save your men.

764
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:55,362
You were a hero.

765
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,498
You were my hero.

766
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,267
Look...

767
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,471
you may have grown up
without a father,

768
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:06,674
but I'm going home to my son.

769
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,177
This is a mistake,
and it is one

770
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,145
you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

771
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:15,650
Somebody died and I could've
stopped it, so trust me...

772
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,084
I know.

773
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,989
At least I'll still be alive.

774
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:47,481
You can't be a coward.

775
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:48,816
I won't let you.

776
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,919
What choice do I have?

777
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:54,488
We complete the mission.
We save your men.

778
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:56,691
But you said
that I die in Venezuela.

779
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,091
You did.

780
00:50:59,794 --> 00:51:01,529
But I'm here now.

781
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:08,435
So, what you're saying is,
you're guests?

782
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,103
- Yes.
- Ah.

783
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:13,741
And you've never heard
of Kalashov.

784
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:14,776
- No.
- Yes.

785
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:15,910
Uh, what he said.

786
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:19,581
And we are just actors

787
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:20,915
on Fantasy Island.

788
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:25,085
- Yes. Heh.
- Yeah.

789
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:27,622
- Oh, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, God. Oh!

790
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,625
You okay?

791
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:41,401
Okay. One of you is going
to tell me the truth.

792
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:43,071
Or did you little punks think

793
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:45,940
you could just kill Kalashov
and take over?

794
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:48,743
We have no idea who Kalashov is.

795
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,745
I thought you were talking
about a vodka.

796
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:54,281
- We didn't kill anyone.
- No, but your bodyguards did.

797
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:56,751
But that's okay
because we just killed them.

798
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,653
And before I kill you two,

799
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:03,190
you will tell me what you did
with cash and cocaine.

800
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:05,225
- Cash?
- Cocaine?

801
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,328
- No, we... We did some cocaine.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

802
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,263
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, shit.

803
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:13,300
You keep playing dumb

804
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,937
and I will show you
what good actor I am.

805
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,606
No, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

806
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,109
We talked to Roarke,
and we said we are done.

807
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,310
So this is between you and him.

808
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,379
- Hey. Hey, don't do that!
- Whoa! No! Whoa!

809
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,982
- Hey, I swear, we have no idea...
- Okay.

810
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:30,118
...where the drugs
or cash are, okay?

811
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,819
Are you sure?

812
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:33,721
Because you're about
to lose your hand.

813
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:37,825
We don't know. Please!
If we did, we'd tell you!

814
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:39,560
- This was supposed to be fun.
- Yeah.

815
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:43,598
- A fantasy!
- Maybe this isn't your fantasy.

816
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:47,835
- Maybe it's mine.
- Well, that is so messed up, man.

817
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,004
- Aah! Oh!
- Oh, my God!

818
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:54,542
Okay, okay!
We know where the money is!

819
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,511
Well, tell me.

820
00:52:57,912 --> 00:52:59,179
Tell me!

821
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:01,481
It's... It's downstairs.

822
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:04,351
Near the garage.

823
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:05,485
Yes!

824
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,656
- Okay.
- God!

825
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,390
You stay with Goldilocks.

826
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:11,726
You, come with me.

827
00:53:24,237 --> 00:53:27,407
- This castle's gonna be my house.
- Oh, God.

828
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:30,444
What? Just your house?

829
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:31,779
You're moving out already?

830
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:33,881
Can I come in here
and live with you?

831
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:35,717
- No.
- Why not?

832
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,518
You know why, Mommy.

833
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,957
I need shells for my house.

834
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,728
If it makes you feel better,

835
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:50,031
I'm not allowed
to live there either.

836
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:52,934
This is everything
I've ever wanted.

837
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,939
I wish I felt like
I deserved it.

838
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,176
You do deserve it.

839
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:18,593
I love you both so much.

840
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:41,849
Hey, where you going?

841
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,686
To make things right.

842
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:03,571
Mr. Roarke, can I talk to you?

843
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:10,511
- I want a new fantasy.
- I thought I was very clear.

844
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:13,346
- One fantasy per guest.
- Yes, I understand what you said.

845
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,482
- But I'm...
- No, no, no. Trust me, trust me.

846
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:18,686
People would kill
to have what you have, a family.

847
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,656
Please, enjoy them
while you can.

848
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:24,391
You don't understand.
Mr. Roarke.

849
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,475
Should we trust him?

850
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,313
He's almost as scary-looking
as the last guy.

851
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,181
Why would someone pretend
to save us?

852
00:55:47,315 --> 00:55:49,550
Hey! You.

853
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,285
- Damon.
- Damon.

854
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:52,820
We've been walking all night.

855
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:54,655
Tell us what's up
before we go one more step.

856
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:58,192
We're exposed out here. Roarke's
got eyes and ears everywhere.

857
00:55:58,326 --> 00:55:59,459
Who's Roarke?

858
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:00,695
Ask her.

859
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,233
I have no idea
what he's talking about.

860
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,235
We should keep moving. Come on.

861
00:56:13,808 --> 00:56:16,043
All right, move it or lose it.

862
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:18,212
We can gab down here.

863
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:22,583
Down where? Where are we going?

864
00:56:22,717 --> 00:56:24,886
You want off this island or not?

865
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:28,455
Stay close.

866
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:31,424
You do not wanna get separated.

867
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:37,298
Gross.

868
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,369
This way. Oh, no. Wait.

869
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:44,238
Maybe, uh... Maybe this way.
Uh, no.

870
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:46,807
Maybe... Maybe this...

871
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:47,909
No.

872
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,877
This way, this way.

873
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,185
Come on, blondie.

874
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,458
Are you kidding me with this?

875
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:40,528
Floods during high tide.

876
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:43,764
Ain't the water
you should be afraid of.

877
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,134
- Oh.
- Great.

878
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,009
Let's go. Let's go.

879
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,980
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was what?

880
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:01,749
Sea snakes.
They're attracted to movement.

881
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:03,951
Just don't, you know,
freak out.

882
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:06,954
Wade through dirty water
in a dark cave

883
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:10,558
filled with sea snakes
without freaking out.

884
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,760
Super easy.

885
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,164
What's wrong?

886
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,269
I... I...

887
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:24,972
Nothing. Nothing.
Never mind.

888
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:28,642
It's just up here.

889
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,160
I forgive you.

890
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,066
What am I looking at?

891
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,401
Your deepest desire.

892
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,568
This is why I brought you here,

893
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:57,304
so you can see for yourselves.

894
00:58:57,438 --> 00:59:01,409
Your fantasy would be to get
back together with your husband?

895
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,977
What the hell is this place?

896
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,845
That's what I was hired
to find out.

897
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:07,415
I'm a PI. Client offered me
a big old payday

898
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:09,650
to figure out
what happens here and how.

899
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:11,752
Wants the power of the island
for himself.

900
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:14,155
I booked a stay
three weeks back.

901
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:17,625
Was skeptical at first,
but then my fantasy started.

902
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,094
I saw my daughter,
who I'd lost years ago.

903
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:21,662
It was beautiful.

904
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:24,932
But then it got all twisted,
became a nightmare.

905
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,401
Roarke found my sat phone
and destroyed it

906
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:29,103
before I was able
to call for help.

907
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,605
He knew... everything.

908
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:36,477
This place is evil.
Roarke is evil. Huh?

909
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:39,046
Doesn't care who lives or dies.

910
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,048
But I know how to stop him.

911
00:59:41,182 --> 00:59:43,717
Oh, yeah, I do.

912
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:46,220
Island's power comes
from this here rock thing.

913
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:49,390
Turns the water black,
dripping everywhere.

914
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:52,293
It can do impossible things.

915
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,628
Bring a loved one back to life,

916
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:59,266
turn them into a black-eyed
zombie, like it did my daughter.

917
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,236
I'm not sure how Roarke does it.

918
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:05,706
But he uses the water
to grant fantasies.

919
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,943
I'm gonna use it
to expose him as a monster.

920
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:12,413
Which is why I need you
to smuggle this off the island.

921
01:00:12,547 --> 01:00:14,982
I know a private pilot,
hour away.

922
01:00:15,116 --> 01:00:17,485
Find a phone in the hotel,
call him at this number,

923
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:19,320
get off this island
with the canteen.

924
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,655
- Tell the world about this place.
- What about you?

925
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:23,390
Roarke won't let me
near the hotel.

926
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:26,393
But as far as he's concerned,
you're just a guest.

927
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:28,563
- A guest?
- What?

928
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:32,501
No, I'm not.

929
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:35,302
Yeah. I saw you
get off the plane.

930
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:37,171
You got here on a plane?

931
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:38,272
No.

932
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,007
What?

933
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:42,109
He is crazy.

934
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,145
I saved you, remember?

935
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:57,291
Your fantasy
was to ruin my life?

936
01:00:57,424 --> 01:00:59,628
And who are all those people?

937
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:03,130
Oh, my God.

938
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:05,866
You're the psycho stalker girl.

939
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,136
You did all of this
because of a couple of pranks?

940
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,305
Pranks?

941
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:14,708
You tortured me
every single day for years.

942
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,477
Oh, please.
I teased you a little.

943
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:18,613
I was so traumatized
by what you did,

944
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:20,515
I had to finish high school
from home.

945
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:22,517
Yes, trying to ruin your life
was wrong,

946
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:24,985
but you ruined mine first.
Which way to the hotel?

947
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,854
I'm ready to get off
this island.

948
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,657
I'll show you. Come on.

949
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:42,069
Julia?

950
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,506
Julia, are you okay?

951
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:45,906
I'm fine.

952
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,909
- Have some water.
- I'm fine. No, please, I'm okay.

953
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:58,118
It's beautiful out there.
Please go enjoy your fantasy.

954
01:01:58,252 --> 01:01:59,453
I can't.

955
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:01,556
I want a new one.

956
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:08,896
- You'd have to ask Mr. Roarke.
- I tried. He won't listen.

957
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:11,232
I want to change
the moment that I regret most,

958
01:02:11,365 --> 01:02:12,733
but I chose the wrong one.

959
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:15,069
I didn't think any of this
was gonna be real,

960
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:16,937
and now I have
five years of memories

961
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,173
of a daughter
that I didn't have yesterday.

962
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:21,909
For a new fantasy, you'd be
willing to give it all up?

963
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,078
Your own child?

964
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,882
Six years ago,
there was an accident.

965
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:31,118
A fire in my apartment.

966
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:33,722
It's why I told Mr. Roarke
I was in a dark place.

967
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,590
Someone died,

968
01:02:35,724 --> 01:02:38,859
and it was my fault.

969
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:41,829
If I can stop that
from happening and I don't,

970
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:43,897
I can never live
with myself, Julia.

971
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:46,900
I am begging you.

972
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:49,236
Please, help me.

973
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:58,145
If your fantasy is to change
the moment you regret the most,

974
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,649
you don't want a new fantasy.

975
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:08,055
- I want my fantasy.
- Ms. Olsen, you have to stop.

976
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:10,457
I'm not asking for a new one.

977
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:13,260
I'm asking for
the same fantasy done right.

978
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:15,129
If I'd known
when I got off that plane

979
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,598
that I could change the past,

980
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:18,733
there is no question
what I would have chosen.

981
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,235
I am sorry that you only now
believe in the island,

982
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:23,505
but rules exist for a reason.

983
01:03:23,638 --> 01:03:26,073
Oh, but those aren't
the only rules. Are they?

984
01:03:26,206 --> 01:03:27,808
You have one of your own.

985
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:30,311
As long as you do the island's
bidding, your wife lives.

986
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:31,746
That's what you told me.

987
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:34,281
- I've given you a fantasy.
- You misled me.

988
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:36,651
My fantasy was
to have a do-over,

989
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,653
but that's not the do-over
I wanted.

990
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,560
You're willing
to risk your wife over it?

991
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:51,198
Very well. Are you sure
this is what you want?

992
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,840
It's not what I want.

993
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:01,710
It's what I have to do.

994
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:54,796
Whoa!

995
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,845
Oh, no.

996
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,790
- Nick!
- Help me! I'm trapped!

997
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:26,528
- Come on, JD!
- Wait, Brax, JD?

998
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:28,128
Lady, there's a fire. Come on.

999
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,063
- Go!
- No, wait!

1000
01:05:34,502 --> 01:05:37,572
- Stairway's to the right!
- Nick!

1001
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:39,808
Help! I'm trapped!

1002
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,910
- Don't let me die, please!
- Ow!

1003
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,078
- I can't breathe!
- Nick. Nick!

1004
01:05:45,212 --> 01:05:47,314
I'm gonna go get help, okay?
Just hang on!

1005
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:49,651
Please don't go!
Please don't leave!

1006
01:05:49,784 --> 01:05:53,253
- Officer? There's someone inside.
- Back up. Let's go!

1007
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:55,255
I need you to help
break his door down.

1008
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:56,290
Please calm down.

1009
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:59,293
- Help is on the way.
- Patrick?

1010
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,596
Sorry, do I know you?

1011
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:05,466
The fire is in my unit. It's my
upstairs neighbor, he's trapped.

1012
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,168
You need to come inside!
Help me kick his door in.

1013
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,672
The, uh... We should wait
for the fire department.

1014
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:12,807
- They'll be here any moment.
- They'll be too late!

1015
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:13,842
We have to save him!

1016
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:16,511
You have to help me save him!

1017
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:23,651
We should really wait
for the fire department. It...

1018
01:06:26,888 --> 01:06:28,455
I'm going back in.

1019
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,692
You'll get hurt!

1020
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:32,961
Don't be a hero!

1021
01:06:42,804 --> 01:06:45,507
Please help me! Please!

1022
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,842
I'm coming, Nick!

1023
01:06:47,976 --> 01:06:50,645
Trying to find something
to break your door down with.

1024
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,920
I'm trapped in here.

1025
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:01,556
I can't breathe.

1026
01:07:14,002 --> 01:07:15,904
It's just right over here.

1027
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:28,917
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1028
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:31,385
Your brother now is dead.

1029
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:34,187
You also are dead.

1030
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:37,525
There's nobody who can save
you two little shits.

1031
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:40,929
- Alejandro can.
- Who?

1032
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:43,765
- Who the...?
- Aah!

1033
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:46,601
Oh, boy.

1034
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:49,571
This ain't your fantasy,
asshole.

1035
01:07:51,673 --> 01:07:53,240
Did you hear that?

1036
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:55,577
It sounded like gunfire.

1037
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,712
Wasn't asking you.

1038
01:07:57,845 --> 01:08:00,247
Sounded like gunfire.

1039
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,283
You know, you can
just say sorry.

1040
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:06,988
- Yeah, that would be a start.
- He was talking to you.

1041
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,624
I was talking to you both.

1042
01:08:09,757 --> 01:08:14,294
You, sounds like you were a real
Ms. Teen Asshole 2009 back then.

1043
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:17,765
Time to make amends for your
past and ask for forgiveness.

1044
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,132
And you.

1045
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:20,902
Grow up.

1046
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:22,804
Stop giving
this teenage version of her

1047
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,872
all this dang power
over your life.

1048
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:26,941
Revenge ain't gonna fix you.

1049
01:08:27,075 --> 01:08:28,943
Only you can fix you.

1050
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:31,946
God, you two remind me
of my daughter.

1051
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,748
Never did right by her.

1052
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:36,784
I'm gonna get you both off this
island, one way or the other.

1053
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,453
Let's go.

1054
01:08:44,092 --> 01:08:46,460
Go, go!

1055
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,697
Stop!

1056
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:51,298
Stop!

1057
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:53,501
- Please, no!
- Get out of here!

1058
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:55,435
No, no!

1059
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,427
- No!
- No!

1060
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:28,435
He saved us.

1061
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:31,139
So we could get off this island.

1062
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:34,042
Hold on.
I gotta get his map.

1063
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:38,780
Come on. Come on.

1064
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:50,223
All right, I want you
to hang back and watch our 6.

1065
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,225
- No, I'm coming with you.
- No.

1066
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,863
If things went sideways,
it's because we got ambushed.

1067
01:09:55,997 --> 01:09:57,732
Make sure that doesn't happen.

1068
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,039
It's gonna take
more than a shotgun

1069
01:10:05,173 --> 01:10:08,341
to save you
and your idiot brother!

1070
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:13,047
Something like this?

1071
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:14,782
I wouldn't do that.

1072
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:17,719
I let go of this handle,
we go boom.

1073
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:20,588
Put the pin back in.

1074
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:22,156
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

1075
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,559
Guns on the ground. Now.

1076
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:31,065
My friend upstairs definitely
going to kill your brother.

1077
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,267
- Then he'll kill you for sure.
- Not if he doesn't know it's me.

1078
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:42,110
You two go first,
with me right behind you.

1079
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:43,611
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Go.

1080
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:45,213
Okay, okay, okay.

1081
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:46,881
Okay.

1082
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:49,382
Tough guy. Come on.

1083
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:09,137
Oh, shit.

1084
01:11:16,544 --> 01:11:17,477
Grenade.

1085
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:19,312
This will not end good for you

1086
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:20,915
if you don't let us go now.

1087
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:22,817
It will once I get
my brother back.

1088
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,919
Hand over the grenade.

1089
01:11:25,052 --> 01:11:26,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

1090
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:29,223
- Do it. Now!
- Okay.

1091
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:32,693
Okay.

1092
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:34,896
- Patrick?
- How do you know my name?

1093
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:38,733
Dude, chill, chill.
It's me. Brax.

1094
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,602
What are you doing here?

1095
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,336
- In Venezuela?
- In Vene... What?

1096
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,073
- Why are you in our fantasy?
- You're in mine.

1097
01:11:57,852 --> 01:11:59,187
Shh...

1098
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:09,697
Brax? Hey.

1099
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:11,732
- I'm a good guy.
- We're here to help.

1100
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:13,366
How many people
are in the house?

1101
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:15,036
We got a devil, a pig
and a clown.

1102
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:16,403
And my brother, he's Asian.

1103
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,306
There are models
in the panic room.

1104
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:19,874
Could we go home now?

1105
01:12:24,278 --> 01:12:26,379
Chastity, real disappointed.

1106
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:27,882
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

1107
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,717
Come on.
Move, move, move, move.

1108
01:12:45,933 --> 01:12:48,336
- Oof!
- No, no, no, let go!

1109
01:12:55,676 --> 01:12:57,612
- Let go, little man. Let go!
- Give it to me.

1110
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,881
Give me grenade!

1111
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,217
Oh, I mean it, let it go.

1112
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:06,386
Come on, come on.
Move it, move it.

1113
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,728
Grenade!

1114
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,570
Oh, God, that was close.

1115
01:13:24,872 --> 01:13:26,307
Follow me.

1116
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:32,113
- Oh...
- Dude, you did it!

1117
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:33,581
- Ha, ha!
- We did it!

1118
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:35,783
- Oh, buddy! Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

1119
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:38,619
- I'm so happy you're alive!
- Thanks.

1120
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:40,288
If he'd have thrown
that grenade...

1121
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,090
You would've sacrificed
yourself.

1122
01:13:43,224 --> 01:13:44,725
That's why you're my hero.

1123
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:49,462
You did something
I could never do.

1124
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:51,699
I wouldn't
sell yourself short, Ali.

1125
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:53,935
I can't believe the models
locked us out.

1126
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:55,903
I cannot believe
I ever let Jenni go.

1127
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:59,573
When I get home, I'm gonna tell
her, she's my moon and my stars.

1128
01:14:01,142 --> 01:14:02,610
JD?

1129
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:03,644
JD?

1130
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:07,480
- JD!
- Cover rear!

1131
01:14:08,816 --> 01:14:09,750
JD!

1132
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,525
JD?

1133
01:14:19,827 --> 01:14:22,363
- We have to go. Now!
- Why is this happening?

1134
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:46,921
We can't kill these things!
Get out of here!

1135
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:57,298
Come on!

1136
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:02,536
No!

1137
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:25,192
The hotel's close. We just need
to get there and find a phone.

1138
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:27,762
Yeah, like we're just gonna be
able to waltz in

1139
01:15:27,895 --> 01:15:30,731
- and make a phone call.
- Look, Damon was right.

1140
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,701
I owe you an apology,
so I'm sorry.

1141
01:15:33,834 --> 01:15:35,870
I'm sorry I brought you
into all this.

1142
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:40,241
I didn't think any of it would
be real. I can prove it. Ha...

1143
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,911
<i>She looks better than Tupac.</i>

1144
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:45,413
You recorded this?

1145
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:47,715
I fantasized about
getting revenge for years.

1146
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:49,884
Can you blame me
for wanting to document it?

1147
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:51,919
I thought you were
a hologram.

1148
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:54,855
And here is the proof
that I saved you.

1149
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:57,892
See? I used the Taser thing

1150
01:15:58,025 --> 01:16:00,294
and the water to take him down.

1151
01:16:00,428 --> 01:16:03,030
You want a prize
for not letting me die?

1152
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:06,700
I know asking
for all of this was crazy,

1153
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:08,903
but, please,
you have to believe me.

1154
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:10,571
I thought it was fake.

1155
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:13,774
How did you figure out
it was actually me?

1156
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:18,112
When your real husband answered
the phone, I... Wait.

1157
01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:30,091
- I don't think I can do this.
- You have to.

1158
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:43,370
- <i>What do you want, Sloane?</i>
- Will, please don't hang up!

1159
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:46,140
Uh, I need your help.
I've been kidnapped.

1160
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:50,611
I've been taken
to some island somewhere.

1161
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,581
<i>Oh, cut the bullshit.</i>

1162
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:54,715
Please, I am telling you
the truth.

1163
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:56,717
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

1164
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,292
You probably shouldn't.

1165
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:09,029
Not after what I did to you.

1166
01:17:10,231 --> 01:17:12,366
We used to be happy, Will.

1167
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:15,169
And then...

1168
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:18,639
I don't know.

1169
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:22,309
I'm not trying to make excuses,

1170
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:25,479
but I felt you pulling away from
me, so I wanted to hurt you.

1171
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:28,115
It's what I've done
my whole life, I...

1172
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:32,119
I hurt people
who don't deserve it.

1173
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:43,230
And I am so sorry.

1174
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:46,066
There is no defending

1175
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,503
the way that I treated you.

1176
01:17:50,505 --> 01:17:54,141
And I'll understand
if you can never forgive me.

1177
01:17:58,212 --> 01:17:59,747
<i>Do you think
this fixes anything?</i>

1178
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,048
Not even close.

1179
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,485
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

1180
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:07,154
<i>What do you need me to do?</i>

1181
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:08,789
I have a phone number.

1182
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:10,391
I need you to call it

1183
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:13,827
and tell them
that Damon needs the plane.

1184
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:15,996
<i>Damon? Do I even wanna know?</i>

1185
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,232
No, it's not what you think.

1186
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:20,635
I'll explain everything
when I get home.

1187
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:22,504
Will...

1188
01:18:22,637 --> 01:18:24,038
thank you.

1189
01:18:37,952 --> 01:18:39,720
Come on, Gwen, please breathe.

1190
01:18:39,853 --> 01:18:41,523
Breathe, breathe.

1191
01:18:41,656 --> 01:18:42,657
Please.

1192
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,093
Oh, good girl.

1193
01:18:48,796 --> 01:18:51,031
What are you...?
What are you doing here?

1194
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,102
You got your fantasy redo.

1195
01:18:55,236 --> 01:18:58,573
Did it work? Did you save him?

1196
01:18:58,707 --> 01:19:00,575
No.

1197
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:03,344
I think this is
someone else's fantasy.

1198
01:19:03,477 --> 01:19:04,778
Where are the others?

1199
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:06,380
Okay.

1200
01:19:06,514 --> 01:19:09,350
Damon's pilot
should be here any minute.

1201
01:19:13,954 --> 01:19:14,922
Grab one.

1202
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:18,092
Okay.

1203
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:24,798
- Whatever comes out of there...
- We'll deal with it.

1204
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,400
Together.

1205
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:43,417
Patrick? Brax?

1206
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:46,820
What...? How did you find us?

1207
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:48,255
We're looking for Roarke.

1208
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:49,624
Who are you?

1209
01:19:49,758 --> 01:19:51,425
I'm her fantasy.

1210
01:19:53,394 --> 01:19:54,495
Not like that.

1211
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,298
Where's JD?

1212
01:20:02,737 --> 01:20:05,973
- He didn't make it.
- We have to get off this island.

1213
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:08,008
Let me grab the map.

1214
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:09,877
A plane is on its way. Come on.

1215
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,045
Head for the dock.

1216
01:20:11,178 --> 01:20:13,113
- Head for the dock! Let's go!
- Go!

1217
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:14,315
Back, back, back!

1218
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:15,784
Hello, my friends.

1219
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:18,252
- Roarke, you son of a bitch.
- I warned you.

1220
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,954
Fantasies rarely play out
as you would expect.

1221
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:22,791
Play out? My brother's dead!

1222
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,958
I could not save him,
just like Mr. Sullivan

1223
01:20:25,092 --> 01:20:28,829
- couldn't save his father.
- Ah!

1224
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:31,865
The staff will do anything
to protect me.

1225
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:35,169
The island gives them
a taste of their fantasies.

1226
01:20:35,302 --> 01:20:37,171
They give me their loyalty.

1227
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:40,140
And who are you loyal to?
Do they know?

1228
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:41,942
Know what?

1229
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:44,311
We weren't brought here
to have our own fantasy.

1230
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:46,781
We were brought here to be
part of someone else's.

1231
01:20:46,914 --> 01:20:49,651
- Because of Nick Taylor.
- Who's Nick Taylor?

1232
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:51,553
He was our roommate.

1233
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:55,824
- He died, six years ago.
- In a fire that I started.

1234
01:20:55,956 --> 01:20:57,559
I had just moved
into the building.

1235
01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:59,527
I put a kettle on for tea,

1236
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:02,229
and I forgot to turn
the burner off when I left.

1237
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:05,132
My fantasy took me back there.
I saw you and JD.

1238
01:21:05,265 --> 01:21:08,001
JD wanted to check
on Nick's room,

1239
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:12,005
but I thought he was out with
a girl, so... I made JD run.

1240
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,307
You were there.

1241
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,543
You did nothing.

1242
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:21,549
- I didn't see you.
- Nick was in one of my classes.

1243
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:23,417
He asked me out.

1244
01:21:24,753 --> 01:21:26,186
But I couldn't believe

1245
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,623
that someone was
actually interested in me.

1246
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:32,627
I was supposed to see him later
that night, but I got cold feet.

1247
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,129
He shouldn't have been home.
He should've been with me.

1248
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:38,065
Everyone who got off that plane
has a hand in Nick's death.

1249
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:39,768
So this is
one big revenge fantasy?

1250
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,402
Correct.

1251
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,304
So how does this end?

1252
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,708
With your deaths.
Your lives for Nick's,

1253
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:48,375
if that's
what the island demands.

1254
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:51,880
- Call it off.
- You know I do not have a choice.

1255
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:57,251
- The plane.
- Get them out of here.

1256
01:21:57,384 --> 01:21:58,919
Come on!

1257
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,925
Someone has found his courage.

1258
01:22:05,794 --> 01:22:07,729
The plane. The plane!

1259
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:12,933
- There it is! Hey!
- Hey!

1260
01:22:13,066 --> 01:22:15,936
- Hey! Over there!
- Hey!

1261
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:19,940
- Hey!
- Oh, my God. We're going home.

1262
01:22:21,776 --> 01:22:23,277
Who are you protecting?

1263
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,212
Where are the others?

1264
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,588
Stop.

1265
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:36,457
She wants them all together.

1266
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:43,397
- Oh, my God.
- What the...?

1267
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:48,969
- No! No!
- Who is that?

1268
01:22:49,102 --> 01:22:50,070
Guys.

1269
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:52,473
- Come on, let's go!
- Go! Run!

1270
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:09,791
Shit.

1271
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:12,125
We're safe here for...
For a minute.

1272
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:15,763
Okay, not to be negative,
but we're gonna die here.

1273
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:17,998
- We're not throwing in the towel.
- She's right.

1274
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:21,001
- Everyone else works for Roarke.
- Unless they don't.

1275
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:25,673
Julia, she pulled me
from the fire.

1276
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:27,341
She saved my life.

1277
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:29,811
Roarke's servants wouldn't
interfere in a fantasy.

1278
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:32,145
Maybe she's not his assistant.
Maybe she is a guest.

1279
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:33,848
She did say she
just started there.

1280
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:35,315
She could be Nick's mom.

1281
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,986
He always told me
how controlling she was,

1282
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:40,855
and Julia's eyes,
they look a lot like Nick's.

1283
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:43,257
I saw her coughing up blood.

1284
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,192
This could be her dying wish.

1285
01:23:45,325 --> 01:23:48,495
Okay, but then why would
she save you from the fire?

1286
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:50,665
So Gwen could tell us
why we're here.

1287
01:23:50,798 --> 01:23:52,534
It's not really
a satisfying revenge

1288
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:54,903
- if your victims are oblivious.
- So we go to her.

1289
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,905
We apologize,
try to make this right.

1290
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:59,206
Someone that brought us
to this island to die

1291
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:02,209
is probably looking for a little
more than just an apology.

1292
01:24:02,342 --> 01:24:05,780
If we can't stop her,
maybe we can stop the island.

1293
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:09,283
Yeah, there's a spring
with an ancient stone.

1294
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:12,452
- It makes the fantasies possible.
- The water in the spring.

1295
01:24:12,587 --> 01:24:14,889
JD was right.
Roarke did spike our drinks.

1296
01:24:15,023 --> 01:24:17,692
We destroy the spring,
then we end the fantasies?

1297
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:20,060
- It's worth a shot.
- How do we do that?

1298
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:22,396
With this.

1299
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:40,949
Anything else we should know?

1300
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,017
It's a maze, so stick together.

1301
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:46,788
And there are sea snakes,
so don't, you know, freak out.

1302
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:49,122
Did she say sea snakes?

1303
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:57,397
We had a guide before, and even
he almost got lost, but I'm...

1304
01:24:57,532 --> 01:24:59,901
I'm 99 percent positive
it's this way.

1305
01:25:03,738 --> 01:25:05,105
Listen for the spring.

1306
01:25:05,238 --> 01:25:07,742
It sounds like dripping water.

1307
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,276
Whole island sounds like that.

1308
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:12,212
I think I hear it.

1309
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:18,218
Gwen?

1310
01:25:18,352 --> 01:25:19,821
Gwen?

1311
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:21,556
Shit.

1312
01:25:22,857 --> 01:25:25,359
We lost Gwen and Brax.

1313
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,394
Give me the grenade.

1314
01:25:27,528 --> 01:25:29,363
I'll find the spring,
you go find them.

1315
01:25:29,496 --> 01:25:31,099
No, no. It's too dangerous.

1316
01:25:31,231 --> 01:25:33,034
If you find the spring,
call out for me.

1317
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,769
I'll follow your voice

1318
01:25:34,902 --> 01:25:36,436
and then blow it.

1319
01:25:42,844 --> 01:25:44,311
Sloane?

1320
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:43,137
Just sea snakes.

1321
01:27:06,961 --> 01:27:08,596
<i>Melanie?</i>

1322
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,674
Brax.

1323
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:56,844
Am I gonna be okay?

1324
01:28:00,748 --> 01:28:03,283
- We should've never come here.
- You gotta save me, dude.

1325
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:06,286
I'd do it for you.
I did everything for you.

1326
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:07,688
I tried.

1327
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,422
It should've been you instead.

1328
01:28:09,557 --> 01:28:11,424
Mom and Dad love me more.

1329
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:13,661
They already wish
you were dead. Guh!

1330
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:16,864
- No.
- Aah! Ugh, aah!

1331
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:18,766
JD, no! No!

1332
01:28:35,216 --> 01:28:36,784
OMG.

1333
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:39,587
What a pathetic loser.

1334
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:43,524
- What are you?
- I'm the real you.

1335
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:47,094
- The coolest girl in school.
- No.

1336
01:28:47,228 --> 01:28:49,263
That's not who I am anymore.

1337
01:28:49,396 --> 01:28:52,700
There's no defending the way
that I treated you.

1338
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:55,368
And I'll understand
if you never forgive me.

1339
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:57,337
Stop it! I meant that.

1340
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,540
People never change.

1341
01:28:59,674 --> 01:29:01,709
They just get better
at hiding who they are.

1342
01:29:01,843 --> 01:29:03,211
This isn't real.

1343
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:06,981
You are not real.

1344
01:29:08,749 --> 01:29:10,450
I will never be you again.

1345
01:29:30,204 --> 01:29:32,006
Mommy, come see.

1346
01:29:33,473 --> 01:29:35,109
Lila, what are you doing?

1347
01:29:35,243 --> 01:29:36,878
I killed Daddy.

1348
01:29:38,679 --> 01:29:42,717
- Oh, God. Why?
- Because you don't deserve him.

1349
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,785
You don't deserve me.

1350
01:29:44,919 --> 01:29:47,855
You don't deserve anything good
after what you did.

1351
01:29:47,989 --> 01:29:50,691
- Oh, Lila...
- My friend was right.

1352
01:29:50,825 --> 01:29:53,861
You ruin everything.

1353
01:29:53,995 --> 01:29:55,296
Friend?

1354
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:01,903
- Hi, Gwen.
- Oh...

1355
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:22,590
Oh, God, Nick!
Please, I'm so sorry.

1356
01:30:22,723 --> 01:30:25,126
"Sorry"
won't bring me back, Gwen.

1357
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:28,863
"Sorry" won't keep me
from gagging on the smoke,

1358
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:31,265
from burning alive.

1359
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:36,137
Do you know
what that feels like?

1360
01:30:41,108 --> 01:30:42,076
You're not him.

1361
01:30:53,854 --> 01:30:55,589
Please, Nick,
you said it yourself,

1362
01:30:55,723 --> 01:30:57,425
none of this
is gonna bring you back.

1363
01:30:57,558 --> 01:30:58,893
I'm not the one doing this.

1364
01:30:59,026 --> 01:31:00,795
I know who is,
and she can have me.

1365
01:31:00,928 --> 01:31:02,163
Just let the others go.

1366
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:04,832
Do you hear me, Julia?!

1367
01:31:04,966 --> 01:31:06,767
Who's Julia?

1368
01:31:34,762 --> 01:31:35,830
Melanie!

1369
01:31:41,936 --> 01:31:43,571
Patrick?

1370
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:49,977
Patrick! Gwen?

1371
01:31:50,111 --> 01:31:52,179
- Are you okay?
- I heard screaming.

1372
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:54,682
I just saw Nick.
This is not Julia's fantasy.

1373
01:31:54,815 --> 01:31:57,551
- Then whose is it?
- It's not Patrick's.

1374
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,322
Guy just can't seem
to save anybody.

1375
01:32:01,455 --> 01:32:03,324
Not even himself.

1376
01:32:03,457 --> 01:32:05,426
As soon as I saw
this place, I...

1377
01:32:05,559 --> 01:32:08,429
I knew I had to bring
everyone here where there's...

1378
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:10,364
no escape from my fantasy.

1379
01:32:10,498 --> 01:32:13,868
- Your fantasy?
- Yes. The one I asked for

1380
01:32:14,001 --> 01:32:17,872
before any of you had
even heard of Fantasy Island.

1381
01:32:18,005 --> 01:32:22,376
When I first met Nick, it was
like I'd known him for years.

1382
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:26,047
And we got coffee, and we ended
up talking the entire night.

1383
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:28,582
And I wasn't worried
about saying something stupid

1384
01:32:28,716 --> 01:32:31,185
or trying to be cool

1385
01:32:31,318 --> 01:32:35,122
because he made me feel
comfortable in my own skin.

1386
01:32:35,256 --> 01:32:38,092
We made plans to see
each other again that night.

1387
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:41,228
It would've been
our first real date.

1388
01:32:41,362 --> 01:32:44,432
I wanted to look super pretty,
so I bought a new dress,

1389
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:46,100
I got this necklace.

1390
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:49,703
I got to our meeting place,
and I waited.

1391
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:52,840
Hour passed, then two,
but no Nick.

1392
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:56,410
I started to think, "Sloane
was right. I am worthless.

1393
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:58,679
No one could ever possibly
love me,

1394
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:00,515
and Nick must have realized
that too.

1395
01:33:00,648 --> 01:33:03,217
Why else would he be
doing this to me?"

1396
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:07,088
I stayed there all night,
torturing myself!

1397
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:10,191
And when I got home,
I read about the fire,

1398
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:13,461
and my heart shattered.

1399
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:18,199
I was this close
to my real-life fantasy,

1400
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:21,635
but all of you,
you turned it into a nightmare!

1401
01:33:21,769 --> 01:33:23,737
You could've had anything
you wanted here.

1402
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:26,240
- You could've had Nick back.
- It would've been fake.

1403
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:28,075
Our future was stolen,

1404
01:33:28,209 --> 01:33:31,712
and all of you, you just
moved on with your lives.

1405
01:33:31,846 --> 01:33:34,248
Nick deserves better.
Nick deserves justice.

1406
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,983
Melanie.

1407
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:43,624
Don't you mean
"psycho stalker freak"?

1408
01:33:43,757 --> 01:33:45,693
There is hate in my heart,

1409
01:33:45,826 --> 01:33:47,661
and it grows every day.

1410
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:51,332
You put it there! This is
as much your fault as theirs.

1411
01:33:51,465 --> 01:33:55,169
- But you saved me.
- That was an act.

1412
01:33:55,302 --> 01:33:58,005
- Why?
- So you could see my worth.

1413
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:01,610
Your very life on this island,
it depended on me.

1414
01:34:01,742 --> 01:34:02,710
I wouldn't do that!

1415
01:34:06,947 --> 01:34:10,050
Really?
You thought I needed you?

1416
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,953
I was using you
to get off this island.

1417
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:15,322
- Shut up.
- I didn't think it was possible.

1418
01:34:15,456 --> 01:34:18,359
You're actually more pathetic
now than you ever were then.

1419
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:19,793
Shut up!

1420
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,035
Go, go!

1421
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:33,807
Holy shit. She went out
with him one time?

1422
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:36,710
I can hear it. The spring.

1423
01:34:44,385 --> 01:34:45,786
Hey!

1424
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:48,222
Come on!

1425
01:35:14,014 --> 01:35:15,550
What are you waiting for? Do it.

1426
01:35:15,684 --> 01:35:18,085
It's reflecting her fantasy.

1427
01:35:21,822 --> 01:35:24,091
Please do not do that,
Ms. Olsen.

1428
01:35:24,225 --> 01:35:26,093
Julia is your fantasy?

1429
01:35:26,227 --> 01:35:28,597
- My wife.
- She said she just started here.

1430
01:35:28,762 --> 01:35:30,565
She believes that, yes.

1431
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:33,568
You see, my wish
was to have her back,

1432
01:35:33,702 --> 01:35:35,936
just as I met her, forever.

1433
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:39,039
So she appears not knowing me,

1434
01:35:39,173 --> 01:35:42,943
and soon, she takes ill,
just as she did before.

1435
01:35:43,077 --> 01:35:44,878
That plays out
again and again.

1436
01:35:45,012 --> 01:35:47,348
Courting her became too painful.

1437
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:50,818
So I lie to her.
I tell her she's my assistant.

1438
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:55,122
When Melanie requested
her fantasy,

1439
01:35:55,256 --> 01:35:57,091
I had no choice but to oblige.

1440
01:35:57,224 --> 01:36:00,160
- You can stop her, Roarke.
- No. He can't.

1441
01:36:00,294 --> 01:36:02,997
He's the genie,
and this island is his bottle.

1442
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:04,566
Trapped forever.

1443
01:36:04,699 --> 01:36:07,468
And if he doesn't give
every guest their fantasy,

1444
01:36:07,602 --> 01:36:09,571
he loses his love.

1445
01:36:09,704 --> 01:36:11,640
You think that's love?

1446
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:15,142
Letting Julia die over and over
again forever? That's hell.

1447
01:36:15,276 --> 01:36:17,679
She was your wife, Roarke.
She's not anymore.

1448
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:20,682
She's not even your assistant.
She's your prisoner.

1449
01:36:20,814 --> 01:36:22,816
You have to let her go.

1450
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:29,624
- I cannot.
- No!

1451
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,026
No!

1452
01:36:36,196 --> 01:36:40,367
I'm sorry. The fantasy must
reach its natural conclusion.

1453
01:36:44,338 --> 01:36:45,640
Those are the rules.

1454
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:57,184
The guests...

1455
01:36:57,318 --> 01:36:59,486
they're dying.

1456
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:00,988
I'm dying.

1457
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:02,856
You'll be fine.

1458
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,957
Soon enough.

1459
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:05,627
And the others?

1460
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,028
If I interfere
with the island...

1461
01:37:09,798 --> 01:37:11,533
I lose you forever.

1462
01:37:13,334 --> 01:37:14,636
Lose me?

1463
01:37:48,168 --> 01:37:50,204
You have to do something.

1464
01:37:50,337 --> 01:37:53,073
They're not the island's guests.

1465
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:54,609
They're yours.

1466
01:37:55,976 --> 01:37:57,444
It's not what I want.

1467
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:02,082
But it's what you have to do.

1468
01:38:23,937 --> 01:38:26,306
Melanie, I am sorry

1469
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,643
your life didn't work out
the way you wanted.

1470
01:38:28,777 --> 01:38:30,477
- Mine didn't either.
- Everybody's sorry

1471
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:32,413
when it's time
to pay the piper, right?

1472
01:38:32,547 --> 01:38:34,415
I'll pay.

1473
01:38:34,549 --> 01:38:37,985
It was my fault. I could've
saved Nick. Let the others go.

1474
01:38:38,118 --> 01:38:41,455
Oh, my God. Are you still trying
to be like dead daddy?

1475
01:38:41,589 --> 01:38:44,091
Well, you're not a hero.
It was just your fantasy.

1476
01:38:44,224 --> 01:38:45,894
She's right.

1477
01:38:47,762 --> 01:38:49,163
It was his fantasy.

1478
01:38:49,296 --> 01:38:51,398
All of my guests get a fantasy.

1479
01:38:55,936 --> 01:38:58,439
So if you drink the water,
you get one.

1480
01:38:58,573 --> 01:39:00,742
Sloane's fantasy?

1481
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:03,711
What, that she and her husband
get to be together forever?

1482
01:39:08,048 --> 01:39:09,751
No.

1483
01:39:09,884 --> 01:39:11,886
- That you and Nick do.
- Huh?

1484
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:15,122
Those are the rules.

1485
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:45,620
Fantasy fucking Island.

1486
01:39:59,667 --> 01:40:00,668
- Get back!
- Aah!

1487
01:40:16,684 --> 01:40:18,520
Hello?

1488
01:40:22,055 --> 01:40:23,056
Hello?

1489
01:40:26,326 --> 01:40:29,129
Gwen. You okay?

1490
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:30,932
- Hey.
- Guys?

1491
01:40:34,669 --> 01:40:36,403
What happened?

1492
01:40:37,471 --> 01:40:39,439
You saved us.

1493
01:40:39,574 --> 01:40:42,042
Where's Patrick?

1494
01:40:42,175 --> 01:40:44,913
He died, as a hero.

1495
01:40:51,418 --> 01:40:53,521
He made his father proud.

1496
01:41:16,376 --> 01:41:18,211
One star on Yelp.

1497
01:41:19,647 --> 01:41:20,949
So, what's gonna stop us all

1498
01:41:21,081 --> 01:41:23,718
from exposing this island
and suing you?

1499
01:41:23,851 --> 01:41:27,354
Well, fantasies, Mrs. Maddison,
are a lot like dreams.

1500
01:41:27,487 --> 01:41:29,023
You rarely remember the details,

1501
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:31,793
but you always remember
how they make you feel.

1502
01:41:31,926 --> 01:41:33,193
Well, I just remembered

1503
01:41:33,327 --> 01:41:35,897
that I wanna get
the hell off this island.

1504
01:41:40,167 --> 01:41:42,469
So, what happens
to you now, Mr. Roarke?

1505
01:41:42,604 --> 01:41:44,371
I stay here,

1506
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:46,874
protect this place

1507
01:41:47,008 --> 01:41:48,910
and live my life
without regret.

1508
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:04,124
Technically, you partook
in your brother's fantasy,

1509
01:42:04,257 --> 01:42:07,127
so the island can grant you one.

1510
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:10,497
I want JD back. I want him
to go home, to have a life.

1511
01:42:10,632 --> 01:42:13,300
In order for that fantasy
to last,

1512
01:42:13,433 --> 01:42:16,638
you would need to stay here.
Forever.

1513
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:27,949
I was so horrible
to her back then.

1514
01:42:29,784 --> 01:42:32,053
All you can do now
is forgive yourself.

1515
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:34,689
Okay?

1516
01:42:37,859 --> 01:42:39,861
Oh, excuse me.

1517
01:42:39,994 --> 01:42:42,830
We can't leave yet.
Brax isn't on the plane.

1518
01:42:43,965 --> 01:42:45,332
Yeah.

1519
01:42:47,769 --> 01:42:49,737
I don't think he's coming.

1520
01:42:58,546 --> 01:42:59,747
JD!

1521
01:43:33,313 --> 01:43:37,018
So, what now?

1522
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:40,588
You work for me. You'll need
a uniform and a name tag.

1523
01:43:40,722 --> 01:43:43,423
Quite the unusual one.
"Brax."

1524
01:43:43,558 --> 01:43:45,660
It's better than
my college nickname.

1525
01:43:45,793 --> 01:43:47,862
Lost a bet, had to get
the dumbest ink ever.

1526
01:43:47,995 --> 01:43:48,996
Of what?

1527
01:43:54,135 --> 01:43:56,403
Welcome to Fantasy Island,
Tattoo.
