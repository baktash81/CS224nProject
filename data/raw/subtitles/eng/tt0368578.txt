1
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,340
Mom says we have to be polite
to her dates...

2
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,020
...and we will
if he makes it to the door.

3
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,900
Merry Christmas, sucker.
And don't come back for Kwanzaa.

4
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,140
Think you're going out
with our mama?

5
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,100
l'm gonna get you two.

6
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,820
Get me out of here!

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,540
Lindsey, you really think Dad's
coming back?

8
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,260
Any day now. But until then,
we have to keep Mom available.

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,580
Problem is, she's just too pretty.

10
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,820
That just makes our job
a whole lot tougher.

11
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,100
Sometimes l feel sorry for her.

12
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,220
Well, l feel sorry for the next sucker
who tries to put the moves on her.

13
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,740
Mr. Persons.
My man.

14
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
What you got for me?

15
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,180
l'll get the door for you.
Got that newcar smell, you know?

16
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,900
This puppy's missing one thing.

17
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,740
Welcome to the big leagues, Satch.
Let's make it happen.

18
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,580
Look at this ride. Parchment leather
with the satin nickel trim.

19
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,180
Look out, ladies,
here we come. Holla.

20
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,900
Nick Persons. How's it going, man?

21
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,540
How's it look?

22
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,860
Keep driving, fool. That's the one
that sicced her dog on you.

23
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,380
What? You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of me?

24
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,660
Oh, my goodness.
Six thousand pounds of respect.

25
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,660
Yeah. lt's nice, huh?
Yeah.

26
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,140
Take it for a spin?
Yeah.

27
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,820
l don't think so.

28
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Man, what did that unit set you back?
l got a good deal on it.

29
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,500
Right. Your payments probably
cost more than my car.

30
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,260
Marty, my shoes cost more
than your car.

31
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,620
Look, Nick, here come your
favorite customers.

32
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,300
Hey, mister, you got any YuGiOh?
What you think?

33
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,180
You got any Dragon Ball GT?

34
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,260
Look, you come in here every day
asking the same questions.

35
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,900
We ain't got no Pokémon, no Digimon,
no Buffy, no SpongeBob...

36
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
...no Beanie Babies
and no shoplifters.

37
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,340
Now, get! Both of y'all, get!

38
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,140
You better get.
You better get out of here.

39
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,900
You got a way with kids.
They're like cockroaches...

40
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,500
...except you can't squish them.

41
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,700
You gonna clean that?
l don't do windows.

42
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,500
What? lt'll dry.

43
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,980
People wanna know
why l hate kids.

44
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,940
What's the matter with you?

45
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,740
l think l'm in love.
Love? No...

46
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,580
What do you mean, love?

47
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,740
Oh, yeah, that's the new girl from
the partyplanning place. Yikes.

48
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,500
She's so fine.
Yeah.

49
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,860
Man, l got to get with that.
Whoa, whoa.

50
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,220
She's a divorcée, man.

51
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,620
That's way too much baggage
for a guy like you.

52
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,700
Don't be so quick
to judge people, man.

53
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,940
This isn't the Nick the Quick
that l know.

54
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,580
Hey, l had broccoli yesterday.
So?

55
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,740
Sometimes you got to try
something new, my friend.

56
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,660
Look and learn.

57
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,380
Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!

58
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
How was school?
l got 1 00 on my test.

59
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Big deal.
Okay, all right.

60
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,980
Who wants to go shoe shopping?
Let's go.

61
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,100
What happened?
Oh, man, she's a breeder.

62
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,460
Two of them.

63
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,300
Hey, wait!

64
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,540
Oh, no.
Help!

65
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,580
Do you have any jumper cables?

66
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,980
No. No!

67
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,620
Hey, Nick, don't do this.

68
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,540
She's got two kids
and a brokendown car.

69
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,660
What's next? You gonna
ask her mama to move in with us?

70
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,100
Oh, l'm so happy to see you.
l've been standing out here forever.

71
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,540
You know what?

72
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,140
This might not be a good idea,
because we got rain, electricity.

73
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,860
Oh, but l sure do appreciate it.

74
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,460
Okay.

75
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,020
You know, you look so familiar.

76
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,100
Have we met before?

77
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,220
Well, l'm Nick. l work right across
the street from you.

78
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, that's right. You're the guy
that owns that cute little toy store.

79
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,700
Fine sports collectibles.

80
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Fine sports collectibles.

81
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,620
l'll hook this up for you.

82
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,700
l think my car hates me.

83
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,940
Oh, but, Nick, this is a nice ride.

84
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,860
Oh, you like this, huh?
Yeah.

85
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,540
You know, look.
lt even heats the undercarriage.

86
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,420
l like it.

87
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
''l like it.''

88
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,220
Remember the score:
one player, two kids and

89
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,300
Holy moly!

90
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,540
Oh, that is so cool.

91
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,540
That's a Satchel Paige bobblehead.

92
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,740
That's when he played
for the Monarchs.

93
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,340
What? A woman that knows a little
something about Satchel?

94
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,820
He was my daddy's idol.
He pitched for five decades...

95
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,860
...including three shutout innings
for the Royals at the age of 59.

96
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,060
Well, you know, my man Satch
used to have a saying:

97
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,140
''Age is a question of
mind over matter.

98
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,940
lf you don't mind, it don't matter.''

99
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,540
You know that?

100
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,180
This is Suzanne.

101
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,260
Hubbahubba. Now, that's a woman.

102
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,180
Plenty of smarts, easy on the eyes,
and can quote my stats.

103
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,220
l don't care if she got 1 00 kids.
l like her.

104
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,700
All we gotta do
is lose the small fries.

105
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,780
Now, l'm not saying
drop them in the shark tank. No.

106
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,820
But there's nothing kids like more
than military school.

107
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,340
Out of sight, out of mind.

108
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,340
Excuse me?

109
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,420
l don't mind.

110
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,140
lf you need a lift, l'll give you a ride.
Oh, okay.

111
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,460
Smooth, Nick. Here's how l think
that we gonna make our move.

112
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,380
Pretend like you gonna help her
with her seat belt...

113
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,900
...then with your free hand, put your
arm around her shoulder and Hey!

114
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,740
Let me out! How am l gonna
wave you home if l can't see the play?

115
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,660
l'm a halloffamer.
How about showing some respect?

116
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,220
And that's my story.

117
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,340
What about you, Nick?
Are you local?

118
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,100
Black man from Oregon?
Right.

119
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,260
No. l'm from St. Louis.

120
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,340
l actually moved out here to play
TripleA ball with the Beavers...

121
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,780
...but ended up hurting my shoulder,
and it kind of ended my career.

122
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,740
Oh, you threw
your arm out pitching.

123
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,660
Well, not exactly.

124
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,140
l tore my rotator cuff lifting my
bigscreen TV out of a UHaul.

125
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,540
That's really sad.
l know.

126
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,220
Good thing there's athlete's insurance,
in case you do something stupid.

127
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,940
So, you know, l was wondering...

128
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,700
...if maybe you'd consider
lf you wasn't busy

129
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,300
What is going on out here?
Mom, where have you been?

130
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,380
Miss Mable burned our dinner,
fell asleep and just keeps farting.

131
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,980
Kevin and Lindsey,
this is Mr. Persons.

132
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,140
He was nice enough
to give me a ride home.

133
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
What's he want, a reward?

134
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,500
You know what?

135
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,980
l really better get out of here.

136
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
Smart.

137
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,580
Hey, Nick?
l don't mean to be a pest...

138
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,900
...but l was just wondering if you could
give me a ride to work tomorrow.

139
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,980
Of course.
Oh, great. Thank you.

140
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,860
See you tomorrow.
Bye.

141
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,300
Mom, do you know what time it is?

142
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,820
Excuse me, l'm the mother.
Get in the house.

143
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Get in the house.
lt's raining.

144
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,220
Get in the house.
Who is this stud, Nick?

145
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,260
You're supposed to be in bed.

146
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,380
Nick, thank you so much for
helping me these past couple days.

147
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,620
You are so sweet.
Yeah, l know.

148
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,580
Hey, does this seem ripe to you?

149
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,220
l don't know. l don't eat food unless
it has an expiration date on it.

150
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,740
Nick, you are funny. You eat worse
than my 7yearold son.

151
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
You kind of dress like him too.

152
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,780
What's wrong with that?

153
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,860
And do you know l have never
seen you without a hat?

154
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,700
You don't need to see me without it.
Let me see.

155
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,180
What's under there?
What?

156
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,780
Come on, Nick.
Watch out. Get back. Hold on.

157
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,700
Get back.
Give me that.

158
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,020
Hang on. Don't move.

159
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,460
There.

160
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,780
Nick, wait.
Right.

161
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,460
Wanna go to my apartment?
No, l can't. l can't.

162
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,060
l've thought about it. l really have.
But let's be realistic. l'm a single mom.

163
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,180
No, you're a sexy mama.

164
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,420
Do you know this whole time
we've been hanging out...

165
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,820
...you've never once asked me
about my kids?

166
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,140
How they doing?
l bet you don't remember their names.

167
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,700
Rudy and Theo?

168
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,420
Nick.

169
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,780
l think we should just be friends.

170
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,700
Next point wins. Let's go.

171
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,580
Next point wins. Let's go.

172
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,980
Hold on to your earrings there,
Yao Bling...

173
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,220
...because l'm gonna embarrass you.
And it's gonna hurt because l love you.

174
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,540
Give me that.
Hey, that's a foul.

175
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,940
Come on, man, you hit my hand.
No, l didn't.

176
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,460
Right here, baby. Right here.

177
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,620
Game time.

178
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,180
Yeah, baby. Yeah.
Byebye. Byebye.

179
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,980
Get off of me, Lurch.
That was a moving pick.

180
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,060
Let's run it again. Same teams.
Come on.

181
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,940
No. l gotta go, y'all.

182
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,100
What? We're tied.
Somebody has to lose.

183
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,380
lt's the American way.
Hey, somebody did lose.

184
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,420
You know l gotta go do that thing.
What thing? What?

185
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,940
You know, l gotta take Suzanne
to the airport in the morning.

186
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,100
Take Suzanne to the airport
in the morning.

187
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,740
You are stuck in the friend zone.
Get out of here.

188
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,660
Listen to me. We've been friends
a very long time...

189
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,340
...and l am telling you,
you gotta dump this girl.

190
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,620
What? We not even going out.
That's the point, Nick.

191
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,780
Whatever it is you don't have
going on, it has got to end.

192
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Okay, for all those who listen
to this clown...

193
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,180
...Nick Persons will never be
in the friend zone.

194
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,740
Understand that and believe that.
Friend zone. Friend zone.

195
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,340
Don't say l didn't warn you.
Friend zone.

196
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,820
Here you go.
Oh, Nick, thank you so much.

197
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,780
You are such a great friend.

198
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,980
<i>The friend zone is for losers only.</i>

199
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,580
<i>Please unload your friend
and get on with your life.</i>

200
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,580
Well, wish me luck.
Good luck.

201
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,780
Thanks for everything, Nick.

202
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,700
Suzanne, can l talk to you
real quick?

203
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,540
Sure.

204
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,340
You know, what we got going l mean,
we don't really have something

205
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,380
l don't really know what to call this...

206
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,460
Hang on.
...but it seems kind of...

207
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,780
This is Suzanne.

208
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,340
Yes, Frank.

209
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,500
Just one sec.

210
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,220
Well, when did that happen?

211
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,780
Well, actually,
l'm already at the airport.

212
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,660
Hey. You can't park here.
l know.

213
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,660
My friend's making a call.
She'll be off in a second.

214
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,940
Gonna be an expensive call.
l'm right here.

215
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,980
That's why you're getting a ticket.

216
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,180
They're expecting to spend
New Year's Eve with you.

217
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,300
Oh, don't Don't even go there
with me, Frank.

218
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,420
You haven't spent five minutes
with your kids since Labor Day.

219
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,820
Frank, you know what?
l am so sick of this.

220
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,980
l Hello? Hello?

221
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,180
Know what?
That lady's got enough problems.

222
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,780
All right, let's move it along.

223
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,300
l'm not going.
What's the matter?

224
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,820
My ex is sick, and he's not
gonna pick up the kids.

225
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,260
What about the babysitter?
She's leaving for Las Vegas...

226
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,860
...with her church group.
Oh, no.

227
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,940
You know,
my kids miss him so much...

228
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,900
...and all he ever does is pull the rug
out right from under them.

229
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,940
l'm gonna lose my job.

230
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,980
What if l bring them?

231
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,580
l couldn't ask you to do that.
That's too much.

232
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,580
Why not?
Look, it's no big deal. Serious.

233
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,180
Really?
Positive.

234
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,580
Are you sure?
l wanna help you on this.

235
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,460
Nick, this is huge.

236
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,340
Thank you so much.

237
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,380
You are a lifesaver.

238
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,300
Okay, so l'll get the three tickets, and
as soon as you guys land, call me.

239
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,460
Oh, no, l meant that l'll drop them off
at the airport.

240
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,580
Oh, no. You can't expect the kids
to travel alone, Nick.

241
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,020
Kevin's got asthma. That recycled air
in the plane l mean, yuck.

242
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
But it'd be fine. Kids fly all the time.

243
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,820
lt's nothing.
l'll make sure they get on the plane.

244
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,820
They'll get milk and cookies, little
plastic wings, get to meet the pilot.

245
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,660
You know, it'd be real cool.

246
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,860
Especially with me sitting next to them
making sure everything is all right.

247
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,900
Oh, how could l ever repay you?

248
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,740
Obviously, you don't care
that she's using you.

249
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,380
But ask yourself this:

250
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,260
Would you trust a woman
who'd trust you with her kids?

251
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,660
l'm tempted to call Child Services
right now.

252
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,340
Uncle Nick loves kids.

253
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,420
Big lummox.
Might as well just put myself on eBay.

254
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,540
Hello. l'm here to pick up the kids.

255
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,660
Now, that's what l'm talking about.

256
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,780
What you wasting your time
with Miss Suzanne for?

257
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,300
Excuse me?
You come with me.

258
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,620
Miss Mable will take you
on a guided tour to Sin City.

259
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,740
Oh, God. Excuse me.

260
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Hello? Somebody?

261
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,580
Who wants to go to Vancouver?

262
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,860
Mom says that we should be polite.

263
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,060
Now, kids, l know you're disappointed
about your father...

264
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,540
...but you're going to have fun.

265
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,660
Aren't you?

266
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,980
Yes, Miss Mable.
Yes, Miss Mable.

267
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,860
Hey, did you bring us a gift?

268
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,460
Yeah, Mom's man friends
always bring us presents.

269
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,060
Oh, of course.

270
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,300
What kind of guy you think l am?
Uncle Nick loves kids.

271
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,420
As a matter of fact...
Look, look, look.

272
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,820
Dr. Munchies pizza coupon.

273
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,620
You get a free liter of soda with any
purchase of a large pepperoni.

274
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,900
What's a liter?
Oh, yeah, and for you...

275
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,180
Look at that. Corkscrew.
Cool.

276
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,620
Hey, it's got a knife.
You can't give him that.

277
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,580
Shut up.
Make me.

278
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,580
l don't make trash. l bury it.

279
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,780
Well, l'll bury my foot in your
Say it. You're too scared to say it.

280
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,660
Be quiet, you paranoid dunce.

281
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,180
Chicken.
Stop it. Stop it.

282
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,740
Hey, wanna learn some Chinese?

283
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,660
Sure. What you got?

284
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,580
Sensei says,
''The first one is always a decoy.''

285
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,020
Shotgun!

286
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,060
That's my seat. You stop.

287
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,420
They gonna eat you alive.

288
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,380
You're too ugly to sit in the front seat.
That's my seat.

289
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
Hey! Watch the paint.

290
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay, now, once we get
in this terminal...

291
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,620
...l want everybody
sticking together.

292
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,460
Now, be careful opening that door.

293
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,780
Man! What did?

294
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,700
Sorry, Nick.
Oh, damn!

295
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,860
Boy, didn't you hear what l just said?
You swore.

296
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,620
You damn right l swore. That's about
$400 worth of damage to my new car.

297
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,820
That's twice. Now you have to put
$2 in the swear jar.

298
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,420
Yeah, well, he gotta put about $400
in my pocket.

299
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,340
You got $400 for me?
No.

300
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,540
And l want it cash.

301
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,900
Okay, man, no tears, all right?

302
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,540
l won't change diapers
out here.

303
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Real good. Have you ever thought
of being a youth pastor or a therapist?

304
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,820
Look, it ain't like l said l was gonna
take off my belt.

305
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,180
He's gonna beat me, Lindsey!
Save me!

306
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,220
Hey. Hey, man.
Don't touch me!

307
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,540
Little dude. Kevin. Come here.
Get away!

308
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,140
ls there a problem here, sir?

309
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,460
Just a little game l'm playing
with the kids.

310
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,740
Boy, bring your butt back here!

311
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,340
Kevin. Boy. Look.

312
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,660
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, hey.
Look, look.

313
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,380
Look, l got money. Check it out.

314
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,220
Will that shut you up, huh?

315
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,620
Here you go. Ten bucks. Come on.

316
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,100
Yeah. That's right.

317
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,820
Hey, you can't buy us off.
Apologize.

318
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,900
No, no. We're cool.

319
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,420
Yeah. We cool, little mama.

320
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,220
Plus, there's enough to go around.
Got a tenspot for you too.

321
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,420
l do believe l'm older than him.

322
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,580
l can't believe l'm getting hustled
by a couple of gangsters. Here.

323
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,660
Now, hurry up. We can't be late.

324
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,980
When we go through, they can see
our bones and innards?

325
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,060
No, fool, that's an xray.
Wrong answer.

326
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,460
lt's a metal detector.

327
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,260
Oh, to see if you have
any bombs?

328
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,700
You're not allowed to say
''bombs'' here.

329
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,540
Why can't you say ''bomb''?
Please remove all metal objects.

330
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,820
Keys, loose change,
cell phones, jewelry.

331
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,140
Okay. Just might take a minute.

332
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,620
l hope you left Nick's little present
in the car, or else you're going to jail.

333
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,500
Cell phone.

334
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,540
Car keys.

335
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,860
Excuse me. Sir?

336
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,900
What? What?

337
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Sir, can you step
to the red line, please?

338
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,500
l put everything on the tray.

339
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,860
Please raise your arms
and separate your legs.

340
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,540
Corkscrew!

341
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,700
Let's just get out of here before
l end up in Guantánamo Bay.

342
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,820
Our dad would've never
given him a knife.

343
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,620
Yeah, l'm not your dad.
That's for sure.

344
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,140
All right, let's go. Pick it up.

345
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,540
lt's actually gonna work out better
because trains are more fun.

346
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,420
Do you got any snacks?
You mean candy?

347
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,220
No way.
l have to pee.

348
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,940
Can't you wait till we get on the train?
lt's right there.

349
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,620
l don't think l can wait that long.
Yes, you can. Come on.

350
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,460
He's prone to bladder infections,
you know.

351
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,900
All right, man, go do your business.

352
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,220
Aren't you coming in with me?

353
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,820
Yeah, but l'm not touching nothing.

354
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,060
All aboard!

355
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,020
Come on, come on.
l'm coming.

356
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,100
Wait. My shoe's untied.

357
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,740
Come on.

358
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,740
All clear.

359
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,700
Come on, Kevin. Hurry up.

360
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,620
Over...

361
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Loop. Other loop.

362
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,020
You know what? Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

363
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,260
No! Pull from the first loop.

364
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,740
Otherwise it's too tight at the top.
Okay, okay.

365
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,380
The boy has problems. He won't eat
anything orange, steamed or poached.

366
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,180
And what he does eat,
they can't touch.

367
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,860
Okay, there you go.
No. Do it again.

368
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,620
That doesn't feel right.

369
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,580
His socks can't have elastic
in them.

370
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,260
And he won't use a toothbrush
more than five days.

371
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,060
Shut up!
Make me.

372
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,900
Who'd wanna make another one?

373
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,460
Come on.

374
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,820
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

375
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,900
Hey. Where's Galaktico's cape?

376
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,540
Kevin.

377
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,460
<i>Final boarding call
for Vancouver passengers...</i>

378
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,060
<i>...departing from track two.</i>

379
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,740
Look, it's damp.

380
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,300
Kevin! Lindsey!

381
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,500
Hey! Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!

382
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,140
Hey. The train's moving.

383
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,460
Out my way.

384
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,100
Hey! Crazy kids. Yo!

385
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,260
Hey! Hey, come on!

386
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,820
What are you doing?

387
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
Sorry, lady.

388
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,540
Hey!
What's he doing?

389
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,420
l think he wants us to jump
onto a moving train.

390
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,620
Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!
Hey! Get up here!

391
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,140
Come on!

392
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,860
Hey, what are you doing? Run!

393
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Are you crazy? Jump!

394
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,260
Come on!

395
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,420
Mama.

396
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,500
Hey, Nick, how's the train ride going?
Well, we haven't exactly left yet.

397
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,500
We decided to drive.
lt should be much more educational.

398
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,060
Oh, no, Nick, l cannot let you do that.
That's way too much trouble.

399
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,260
No, no. lt'll only take
a few more hours...

400
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,220
...and gives me a chance to get
to know Kevin and Lindsey.

401
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,340
<i>Okay. I'm really impressed.</i>

402
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,100
<i>You're very sweet.
Yes, l am.</i>

403
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,700
You sound like you have everything
under control. Can l talk to the kids?

404
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,340
Oh, okay.

405
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,780
Look, don't tell them nothing
that happened, okay?

406
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,820
<i>He lost our luggage.
What?</i>

407
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,300
Are you guys dating?
No.

408
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,940
No.
Let me talk.

409
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,620
We wanna go to Dad's.

410
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,060
You cannot go to Dad's now.
You're going with Nick.

411
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,780
Why? Dad's house is
in the same direction.

412
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,940
Nick could drop us off there
on his way not to date you.

413
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,180
<i>Honey, your dad is sick
and in bed.</i>

414
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,660
<i>Now, if you want me to...</i>

415
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,820
...l can just quit my job, and we'll
go live in a cardboard box.

416
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,820
Whatever.

417
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,900
Let him drive.
Be nice.

418
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,740
<i>l love you.
Love you too.</i>

419
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,460
Bye.

420
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,940
Now, look, driving you two gremlins
on New Year's Eve...

421
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,260
...for over 300 miles was never
on the agenda. Okay?

422
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,700
We just drove across town,
and y'all done messed up my door.

423
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,540
So now l got to lay down
some rules.

424
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
Rule number

425
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,820
Rule number one:
Don't touch the climate control.

426
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,260
Rule number two:
Don't kick the seat.

427
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,060
Rule number three:
Don't play with toys.

428
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,420
Can l play with my pizza coupon?
No sassing me.

429
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,660
No eating in the car, no drinking
in the car and no smoking.

430
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,500
l don't smoke.
Good.

431
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,100
Don't start on my watch.

432
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,020
l don't want you to touch the radio.

433
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,060
l don't even want you to sniff
the newcar smell.

434
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,820
l want you to sit down
on that protective plastic...

435
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,380
...and be seen, not heard.

436
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,700
You know, if you're thinking about
my mom, you're wasting your time.

437
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,100
l'm not wasting my time, because
me and your mom, we're just friends.

438
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,900
That's good, because Mom's still
into Dad, and he's totally into her.

439
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,580
They're getting back together.

440
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,540
Whoopee! l'm happy for them.

441
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,180
Or maybe you guys should go out.

442
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,460
A couple of dates with you would
really make her appreciate Dad.

443
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,980
Let's go.

444
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,940
Have a taste of my steel, zombie.

445
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,180
Yes!
That game doesn't sound Grated.

446
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,300
Yeah, but it's
keeping him occupied.

447
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,340
The boy played Lady PacMan at the
mall and had nightmares for a week.

448
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,420
Give it here, Kevin.
Hey, give it!

449
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,780
Give it to me. What did l say?
lt's not yours!

450
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,820
Give it here now!
You're not the boss of me!

451
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,260
Cut it out.

452
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,100
Why don't we call Mom
and see what she has to say.

453
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,180
Fine.

454
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,940
You win.

455
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,420
Snitch.

456
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,220
Baby.

457
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,060
Big baby.
Bigger baby.

458
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,900
Giant baby.
Enormous baby.

459
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,660
Humongous baby.
Colossal baby.

460
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,740
Am not. Am not.
Are too. Are too.

461
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,260
Am not. Am not.
Are too.

462
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,780
Okay, okay.

463
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,620
You're both acting
like a couple of babies.

464
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,340
Keep it moving. Come on.

465
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,020
That's right.
Drink your juice, baby.

466
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,540
Hey, no food in the car.
lt's not food. lt's juice.

467
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,140
Same difference. Give it.
Mine.

468
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,780
Hey!

469
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,340
Man, see?

470
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,660
Oh, y'all think that's funny,
don't you?

471
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,420
lt's not funny.

472
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,060
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

473
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,820
One thing you gotta know here,
we keep it real.

474
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,580
You can believe that.

475
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,620
Yuck! Noisy.

476
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,900
What is that?
50 Cent.

477
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,540
Well, l'll pay him a dollar
just to shut up.

478
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,740
Do you have any Justin Timberlake
or Clay Aiken?

479
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,660
Lord, these kids
are ethnically challenged.

480
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,660
Do you know you can get shot...

481
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,100
...by playing those CDs
in my old neighborhood?

482
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,580
We're not ghetto.
Or trying to be ghetto fabulous.

483
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,860
We're just fabulous.

484
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,580
About time. Open road.

485
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,500
Vancouver, here we come.

486
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Yeah.

487
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,460
l have to pee.

488
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,460
What? No, no,
you do not have to pee.

489
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,380
Didn't you go at the train station?

490
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,260
l tried to go, but there was a man
standing next to me...

491
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,740
...so it just went away.

492
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,100
But look, man, all this open road.

493
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,860
You can hold it. l know you can.
Cross your legs.

494
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,180
You should've asked before we left.
l did.

495
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,020
No, you asked before we got on the
train, not before we left the station.

496
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,420
You're supposed to ask
before every segment.

497
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,260
Everyone knows that.
Evidently not.

498
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,260
l'm not gonna make it.
Do you have a bottle?

499
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,580
No.
How about this ashtray?

500
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,860
Kevin, there's no receptacle
in this vehicle.

501
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,140
Now, look, the exit is about
a mile away, and you can hold it.

502
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,820
How far is a mile?

503
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,100
l don't know, 5000
and some kind of feet.

504
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,700
Look, think of something else.
Football, a math test...

505
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,820
...puberty.

506
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,540
Are we there yet?
No.

507
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,540
l'm sure the carpet is absorbent.

508
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,060
Oh, here it comes!

509
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,820
For God's sakes, man,
he's gonna make his water in your car!

510
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,260
No, he ain't.

511
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,940
lncoming! lncoming! lncoming!

512
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,860
Hold it, man.

513
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,740
Hold it. Oh, no. Look, right here.
Yeah.

514
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,780
Here we go. Here we go.

515
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,020
ln here, in here.
Hold it, hold it.

516
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,620
This is taken!
l'm sorry!

517
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,740
Oh, it's dribbling out.
Okay, go, go. Just go.

518
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,780
That's disgusting!
Hey, wait a minute.

519
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,460
Wait a minute, lady. Hold up.

520
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,540
Bought us some groceries for later.

521
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,260
Your mama said you liked fruit.

522
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,060
Garlic olives?
Hey, it's a truck stop.

523
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,620
That's all they had.

524
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,020
You see this?

525
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,380
Because of you guys,
l gotta do this right here.

526
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,220
You squeezed it, not me.

527
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,060
lt's not coming out.

528
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,380
Hit that green button for me, please.

529
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,380
Yo, yo, yo.
Hey. Hey, it's Marty. What's up, man?

530
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,260
How's it going with those
stupid brats you got with you?

531
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,540
<i>Remember this: If the kids hate you,
the mama won't date you.</i>

532
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,860
Man!
Where'd you go?

533
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,340
What, are you in a tunnel?

534
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,180
Are you? Hello?

535
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,860
Okay. All right.

536
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,780
Seat belts.

537
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,140
Nobody gotta go
to the bathroom, right?

538
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
Okay, here we go.

539
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,460
Nick, we already know
about you and Mom.

540
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,900
You do?
Of course.

541
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,980
She talks about you all the time.
Yeah, Mom's into you.

542
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,660
She says you're better looking
than Taye Diggs.

543
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,020
Oh, yeah?

544
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,460
l am, huh?
Oh, sure.

545
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,820
ln fact, she told me

546
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,620
My gosh. Get his inhaler.
He's having an asthma attack.

547
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,140
What? Where is it?
lt's in the back. Hurry up!

548
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,860
Go! Go!
All right, l'm going.

549
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,500
l got it. l got it.
Move it!

550
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,300
Good one, Lindsey.

551
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,340
Very funny.

552
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,140
Open up.
l knew you were lying.

553
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,620
''We're just friends.'' You're just
using us to suck up to our mama.

554
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,980
What?
Yeah.

555
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:36,100
You're just a dirty, horny sex man
like all the others. Nasty man.

556
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,260
You're a nasty, bad man.
Look...

557
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,700
...l tried to do your mama
a favor, you booger.

558
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,380
You probably wanna kiss her,
don't you?

559
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,180
Look, look. Off the glass.
Off the glass.

560
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,140
And you, open this door.

561
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
You forgot the magic word.

562
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,700
Open this damn door.
You just swore again.

563
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,780
Lindsey, he just swore again.
So what?

564
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,020
Hey, l'm not playing with you.
You can't make us do anything.

565
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,220
Hey, this is my car!

566
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,500
You hear me, little girl?
This is my car!

567
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,380
You better not.
Look at me. l'm serious.

568
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,900
l'm not playing with you,
little girl, okay?

569
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,580
lf you don't open up
before l count to three...

570
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,900
...somebody gonna get it.

571
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,260
One.

572
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,060
Two.

573
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,500
Three.

574
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,300
No! No!
Hey, you stop that car!

575
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,220
Where did he go?

576
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,340
Now you gonna get it!
Go! Floor it!

577
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,460
Get out of there!
Whoa! Hey!

578
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,980
Stop! Wait a minute!

579
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,700
l don't have
any insurance on you, girl!

580
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,180
Hey!

581
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,100
Watch what you're doing!
Watch the spinners!

582
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,380
You're messing up my spinners!

583
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,140
You know how much they cost?
You can't catch us.

584
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,100
No!

585
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,420
You little Give me them keys!

586
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,900
Dirty sex man.
What y'all think you're doing?

587
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,900
Let go of my hat!
Give me them keys!

588
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,620
Hey, Lindsey, stop this crazy thing!

589
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,580
That man's setting a bad example
for them kids.

590
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,980
Wait a minute!
Go! Go!

591
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,020
Now that's frontier justice.

592
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,700
Hey, turn up the rear heat.
Yeah.

593
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,300
No. No heat.

594
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,900
No talking.
You're lucky l'm letting you live.

595
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,020
But
But my butt.

596
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,580
l should pull off
on the side of the road...

597
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
...dig a hole,
and bury both you two.

598
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,180
That's what l should do. Yeah.

599
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,260
A hundred years from now,
a grizzly will find your bones...

600
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,900
...and pick his teeth with them.
Wouldn't like that.

601
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,860
Can't believe you two.
Are you crazy?

602
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,700
We have rights.
No, no, you have no rights.

603
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,100
This is my ship, buddy.
l'm the CEO of this SUV.

604
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,700
Believe that.

605
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,340
<i>Breaker, breaker, 26, this is Big Al
out on Highway 5, mile marker 1 6.</i>

606
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,700
l got two little lambs here been
snatched up by the big, bad wolf.

607
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,260
l need some backup, pronto.

608
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,700
<i>Tenfour, Big Al.
Let's squash this bug.</i>

609
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,060
You had no consideration
for my life, your life or my spinners.

610
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,820
What? What do you want?

611
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,860
l'm driving here!

612
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,860
Mister lnaHurry. ldiot.

613
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,580
Why is he slowing down?

614
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,540
l don't like this.

615
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,660
Pull over right now.
Pull it over. Pull it over.

616
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,340
You better do what he says.
Like hell l will.

617
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,660
l've seen those vigilante
trucker movies.

618
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,100
l said, pull over!

619
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,300
What you doing?

620
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,100
Oh, no!

621
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,700
My paint!

622
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,540
You think you got me boxed in?

623
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,180
Well, you can kiss my 330
cubic inches of V8 power, sucker!

624
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,620
Hold on.

625
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,420
Help!

626
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,820
Your insurance premiums
are going through the roof.

627
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,740
No! No! No!

628
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,340
What was Mom thinking?

629
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,540
l don't know. l like him.
He's kind of funny.

630
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,180
Hey, don't get soft.

631
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,700
This man is not our daddy.
He's the enemy.

632
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,300
Take me now! Take me now!

633
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,860
This is why we don't
come to the city.

634
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,860
Come on.

635
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,660
Come on. Get! Go!

636
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,540
Come on, fleabag.

637
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,860
No way!

638
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,420
What? Now, get your narrow
butts on this horse now!

639
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,020
Hey, how you doing, baby?
Hi. ls everything okay?

640
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,940
Oh, yeah, everything is cool.

641
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,620
Can l call you right back?

642
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,060
Wait, what's that sound?
You sound very jiggly.

643
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,900
Must be your phone.
Everything's cool on this end.

644
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,820
Are you gonna be here soon?
Sort of. Kind of.

645
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,740
Let me call you back
in 1 0 minutes.

646
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,020
Wait, wait, l wanna say hi
to the kids.

647
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,860
Oh, okay.

648
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,540
She wanna talk to you guys
and make sure everything is all right.

649
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,660
Hi, Mom.
Hey.

650
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,540
<i>Hi, babies. How are you doing?</i>

651
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,980
<i>Are you having fun with Nick?
Come on.</i>

652
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,300
Hit the turbo!

653
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,020
Let's go! Let's go!

654
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,780
l know, baby, but just try
to make the best of it, okay?

655
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,540
<i>I love you.
Love you too. Bye.</i>

656
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,780
Scoot over, l'm coming aboard.
That's a bad idea.

657
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,420
Says who?
Says the guy...

658
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,220
...who put all that junk there.

659
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,580
Oh, snap!

660
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,500
l hate horses.

661
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,180
What take so long?
l have to hang mirror ball.

662
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,620
You little snottynosed runts.

663
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,420
l know exactly where you are.

664
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,500
You messing with
Nick the Quick, baby.

665
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,660
Now's your chance. Hit yourself
over the head with a brick...

666
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,100
...and say that they were kidnapped.

667
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,660
Shut up.

668
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
Happy New Year.

669
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,660
You think Nick's okay?

670
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,660
What are you worried
about him for?

671
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,380
l'm not. lt's just...

672
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,260
...maybe we were a little rough.

673
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,580
Oh, please.

674
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,780
That player got what he deserved.

675
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,820
''Get your butts on this horse.''

676
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,540
''You got $400?''

677
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,780
l've been thinking. We should've
brought soup or something.

678
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,140
What for?

679
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,020
Because Dad's sick.
What is he gonna eat?

680
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,060
He's a dad.
l'm sure he has soup.

681
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,260
He must be lonely,
living all by himself.

682
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,060
Look, don't bug him about that.

683
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,220
lf we want him to hook up with Mom,
we have to be subtle. Got it?

684
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,020
l got it.

685
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,340
Come on, y'all.
Let's get out of here.

686
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,580
Want some chocolate cake?
lt's worldfamous.

687
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,820
Mom says l shouldn't have sugar.

688
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,940
What about you?
lt'll make your mouth all chocolatey.

689
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,020
No, thanks.

690
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,500
Hey. You forgot something.

691
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,220
Sorry about what happened today.

692
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,540
l really wish you guys
didn't have to see that.

693
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
He used to look at me like that.

694
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,020
l know, man.

695
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,980
And when he hugged you,
you thought he'd never let you go.

696
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,220
They make you laugh,
they tell you they love you...

697
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,300
...then one day,
they never come back.

698
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,140
l bet you know all about leaving,
don't you, player?

699
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,980
Know what?
As a matter of fact, l do.

700
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,580
But only because the same thing
happened to me when l was your age.

701
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,420
Yeah, my pops
walked out on us too.

702
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,580
lt's a shame that anybody
can call theyself a father.

703
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,220
But listen...

704
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,780
...he's the failure in this, not you.

705
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,500
He's the one that's gonna miss out.

706
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,420
l just hope it don't take you guys as
long as it took me to figure that out...

707
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,860
...because it's true.
You guys are some cool kids.

708
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,660
There you go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

709
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,900
Nick?
What's up, little man?

710
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,780
lf my dad left and your dad left...

711
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,580
...does that mean
l'll end up like you?

712
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,220
l ain't doing too bad.
Look, l have blingage.

713
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,180
That's not exactly what l meant.

714
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,020
<i>l was watching Oprah, and it was
all about how depressed and lonely...</i>

715
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,260
...bachelors like you are.
But l'm not depressed or lonely.

716
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,980
Yes, you are.
No, l'm not.

717
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,700
Yes, you are.
No, l'm not.

718
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,980
Mom says that if a man is
not married by the time he's 35...

719
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,860
...he's either damaged or gay.
What?

720
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,580
Well, that would explain
those earrings.

721
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,460
Watch it, sucker.

722
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,980
But you do have intimacy issues,
don't you?

723
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,660
No, l don't.
Yes, you do.

724
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,100
No, l don't.
Yes, you do.

725
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
Look, it's obvious
you need a timeout...

726
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,300
...and you need
a little tickle time.

727
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:49,020
Because all you do is ask
a thousand questions, huh?

728
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,460
Hey. Are you all right?

729
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,700
Kevin.

730
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,020
l'm good.

731
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,300
You sure?
Yeah, except...

732
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,980
...l'm out.
Okay, don't worry about that.

733
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,060
We'll get you more
once we get there.

734
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,980
Oh, sure, we can wait...

735
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,940
...if you want me to die!

736
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,820
They're closing!
Do something, Nick.

737
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,780
No, no, wait. Hold on!
Wait a minute. We need a refill.

738
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,180
Sorry, we're closed.
Come back Tuesday.

739
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,260
But l got a sick kid here.

740
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,740
Look, l couldn't help you
even if l wanted to.

741
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,860
The pharmacist
has left for the holiday.

742
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,460
Well, where is he?
He's off duty.

743
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,340
And l doubt very much he's gonna
want some guy interrupting his holi

744
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,940
Just a second, sir,
and l'll draw you up a map.

745
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,980
Hey, Nick, that guy
was such a meanie.

746
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,100
How'd you get him
to do what you wanted?

747
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,900
Oh, that was simple.
l just gave him the look.

748
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,380
lt works every time.

749
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,780
lt even worked through glass?
Oh, yeah.

750
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,460
The look is something
l developed when l was a kid.

751
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,340
l had somewhat of a reputation.

752
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,500
Surprise, surprise.

753
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,940
l don't want everybody stepping
to me, so l give them the look...

754
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,780
...which told them, ''Back off.

755
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,660
That's a bad mother''
''Shut your mouth.''

756
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,740
l wish l could do that.

757
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,980
You got somebody
bothering you at school?

758
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,060
An asthmatic in the accelerated
program? What do you think?

759
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,180
Try this. lt's foolproof.

760
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,980
No, no, check the lip,
check the lip.

761
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,740
Man, do not take my lunch money.

762
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,700
Here we go, killer. Come on.

763
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,780
Hey, hey, where y'all going?

764
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,260
Excuse me, l'm looking
for the pharmacist.

765
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,780
Delwyn? Sure.

766
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,820
He's...

767
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,260
He's right over there.
That's enough.

768
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,820
l got it.
Give me that.

769
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,620
Stop clowning around now.

770
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,260
Yo.
Give me my shoe.

771
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,540
Yo. Excuse me,
are you the pharmacist?

772
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,860
Not at the moment. Why?

773
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,460
Well, look, l got a kid with me, man.
He's got asthma real bad.

774
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,300
Try some steam.
That usually helps.

775
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,460
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

776
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,620
Steam?
That's enough of that.

777
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,260
Look, look, all l need is a refill, okay?
And l know you can help.

778
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,580
l'm asking you nice.

779
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,940
Mister, l've been married
for 38 years. You can't scare me.

780
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,540
Come on, man, you the pharmacist.
l know you took a oath or something.

781
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,780
Not that l can remember, no.

782
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:01,140
Hey, will you go over there
and behave yourself?

783
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,380
Yeah, go get him over there.

784
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,460
You know, folks around here
like to barter.

785
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,060
You get what you want,
l get what l want.

786
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,620
One hand washes the other.
l scratch your back

787
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,460
Get to the point.

788
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't clown me.

789
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,980
Watch the kids.

790
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,500
All of them?

791
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,620
You little

792
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,100
Oh, my word.

793
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,660
Pie and cake and brownies and pie.

794
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,060
You said ''pie'' twice.

795
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,740
l like pie.

796
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,300
Kevin, you know Mom
would be upset...

797
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,740
...if we were even thinking
about trying any of these...

798
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,940
...chocolatey...

799
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,700
...creamy...

800
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,980
...delicious...

801
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,100
Hey, l was gonna eat
those brownies.

802
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,140
What? Just take those.

803
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,940
No, l want yours.

804
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,340
Take it easy, man.

805
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,460
Sorry.

806
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,340
Ridiculous.

807
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,660
What? l got this.

808
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,260
All right, timeout. Get off of him.

809
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,580
Get off of him.
Get out of here.

810
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,180
Get off of him, you little gangsters.
Watch out.

811
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,100
You too! Off of him!

812
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,420
What is wrong with you kids?

813
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:02,220
Why y'all ganging up on him?

814
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,780
You think you so tough?

815
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,980
l'd like to see you try that
with somebody my size.

816
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,780
Okay! Okay, man!

817
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,340
All right, get off me,
you little maggots!

818
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,220
Do you think we should help him?
l'm getting mad now. Hey!

819
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,540
After this bite.
Hey, that's it.

820
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,820
Now, l'm gonna count to three.

821
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,460
Hey, wait a minute!

822
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,420
Okay! Get off!

823
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,260
My shoe!
Come back here with my shoe.

824
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,500
All right, people,
it's time for some karaoke.

825
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,420
What is she doing?

826
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,820
She can sing?

827
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,300
She can sing.

828
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,300
Kevin, enough. Kevin, please.

829
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:53,020
l didn't know you could sing that good.
Why you didn't say nothing?

830
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,380
Because before,
you were the enemy.

831
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,100
You know who can sing?
Galaktico can sing.

832
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,060
Hey.

833
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,340
Okay. All right, okay, okay.

834
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,260
Put that down, settle down
and put on your seat belt.

835
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:10,660
l know why your mama
won't let you have sugar.

836
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,660
Hyper down. You're like some kind
of crazy dog.

837
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,540
l know you are,
but what am l, Rover?

838
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,780
Nick, l don't feel so good.

839
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,540
Do you got anything to drink?

840
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,460
There you go.

841
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,740
l'm sorry, Nick, l accidentally
spilled a drop on the floor.

842
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,140
Little man,
don't even worry about it.

843
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,620
There's nothing more
that you can do to this car.

844
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,060
Oh, no!

845
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,260
l can't see. l can't see!

846
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,380
ls everybody all right?

847
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,380
l feel much better now.

848
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,340
Nick, where are my kids? You were
supposed to be here two hours ago.

849
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,500
We had a slight delay at the border.

850
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,300
We're gonna need
more paper towels.

851
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,020
<i>Paper towels?
What's going on?</i>

852
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,180
Nothing. We just pulled over
to clean out the Navigator.

853
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,620
Are you kidding me?

854
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,420
lt's freezing outside, and you've got
my kids cleaning your precious car?

855
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,460
Suzanne, it's not like it seems, okay?

856
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,340
<i>Well, it sounds pretty bad
from here.</i>

857
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:34,060
<i>Nick, if you're not here by 8:00,
you're gonna be in big trouble.</i>

858
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,660
<i>Suzanne, I got this.
Eight o'clock, Nick.</i>

859
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,540
All right, guys, we gotta hustle.
Your mom's getting worried.

860
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,020
But it stinks in here.
Hold your breath.

861
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,780
What?

862
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,460
lf we don't move...

863
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:51,180
...maybe it won't kill us.

864
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,980
Oh, man, you're scared of that deer?

865
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,620
He ain't gonna hurt you.

866
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,100
They come out of the woods when
they get cold. He's probably hungry.

867
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,620
Try this.

868
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,620
Hey. Look what l got.
Nick, deers are herbivores.

869
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,340
So what?
Everybody loves chocolate chip.

870
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:19,180
Hey, buddy, come on.

871
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,540
Cookie.

872
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,700
Okay, okay, hey, hey,
come on.

873
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,340
No.
What? He's not gonna hurt you.

874
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,340
Look, l'm right here with you.
Come on, come on. Come on.

875
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,260
Slow. Come on.

876
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,820
Slowly. Don't scare it. Get in there.

877
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,900
What if he's rabid?
Come on, come on. There we go.

878
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,020
There you go. There you go.

879
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,300
See, he's gentle.
He's not gonna hurt you.

880
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,100
Give him another.
No way.

881
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,780
Now, look.
Where's my camera?

882
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,100
Hey, hey. Hey.

883
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,100
Down, boy. Sit.

884
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,980
Hey, Bambi. Sit!

885
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,100
Come on, now.

886
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,860
Bambi.

887
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,220
Give him the look, Nick!
Give him the look!

888
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,660
All right, you want a piece of me?

889
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,020
Say uncle. Are you done?

890
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,060
Your head gotta go
over my fireplace?

891
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,980
Show him who's boss, Nick.
Now, just let it go.

892
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,380
Let it go.

893
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,420
Now, get your tail out of here
before l kick some deer butt.

894
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,300
You better run.

895
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,580
l hope you got some nice shots.
Yep.

896
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,300
Now help me find my keys.

897
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,060
Come on out of there.

898
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,500
lf your mama ever asks...

899
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,540
...don't let her know
l know how to hotwire a car.

900
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,420
But you don't know how to do it.

901
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,220
Quiet down out there.

902
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,420
Have patience.

903
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,420
Turn it off, Nick!
All right, calm down.

904
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:15,340
Hurry up. lt's loud.
And scary.

905
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,420
This should do it.

906
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,980
Nick, the car's on fire. lt's burning.
Oh, no.

907
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,060
lt's gonna burn. Nick, hurry.

908
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:34,660
Be careful.
Come on, Nick, do it.

909
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,340
Put it out! Put it out!

910
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,140
lt's gonna burn, Nick! Hurry!

911
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,260
This could be toxic.

912
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,140
Worthless.

913
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,660
Galaktico!
Kevin, step back. l got it.

914
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,060
Hey, Nick, don't forget me.
l'm over here.

915
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,820
l'm on the dashboard, remember?

916
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,620
Hey! Don't let me burn!

917
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,620
l'm a limited edition!

918
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,340
Oh, man.
l never even got to read the manual.

919
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,420
Hit the dirt!

920
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,980
Why?

921
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,180
Oh, no.

922
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:37,220
This is about a year's pay.

923
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,260
What did l do?

924
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,900
What did l do?
Why is this happening to me?

925
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,020
lt was you two.

926
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,260
lf l didn't volunteer to babysit
you two little demons...

927
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,580
...this wouldn't have never happened,
and l'd still have my car.

928
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,340
Go ahead and cry. l don't care.

929
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,220
Okay, all right, stop the waterworks.

930
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,260
Oh, all right. Oh, come on,
come on.

931
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,220
Stop crying. Stop crying.

932
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,940
lt's not your fault. lt's not your fault.

933
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:23,020
No, no. l just got
a little upset, okay?

934
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,100
That's why you buy insurance.

935
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,780
All right, let's sit down. Sit down.
Come on, now.

936
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:31,420
Right here, right here.
lt's only a car, okay?

937
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,860
We are a lot of trouble.

938
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,780
That's why our daddy
doesn't wanna be with us.

939
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,860
Whoa, whoa.

940
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,740
Look at me.

941
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,820
Don't say that. That's not true.

942
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,860
But we destroyed your Navigator.

943
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:48,820
That? Oh, that's nothing.

944
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,700
That's just a material object.

945
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,540
lt means nothing.

946
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,140
l wouldn't wanna spend New Year's
with us either.

947
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,260
Who would?

948
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,140
Me.

949
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,180
l would.

950
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,740
But you know what?

951
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,220
Maybe your mother's right,
you know.

952
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,940
Maybe l'm not cut out for this.

953
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,540
l mean, look at you two.
You're a mess.

954
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,820
l keep losing you,
feeding you the wrong stuff.

955
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,500
lf you were goldfish,
you'd be dead.

956
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,660
You know, you're doing okay.
This is just your first day.

957
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,180
Yeah, you have to get experience.
You'll get used to it.

958
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,660
Yeah, and there's books
you can read too.

959
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,260
Thanks.

960
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,660
But you know what?

961
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,460
lf we're not magically in front
of your mother...

962
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,500
...in the next 30 minutes or so...

963
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,460
...she'll never talk to me again.

964
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,660
Hey, if it's the bottom of the ninth, and
you're down two runs, do you quit?

965
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,500
No. You put that ball back on the tee,
and you keep swinging.

966
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,420
Well, let's keep swinging.

967
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,460
Come on. Let's go.

968
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,300
Now we gotta figure out how
we gonna get to Vancouver.

969
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,500
Hey, look.

970
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,860
l found your keys, Nick.

971
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,300
What?

972
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,740
lt's just my luck.

973
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,820
Let's get out of here.

974
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,980
Come on.
Right here, baby. Come on, now.

975
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,300
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

976
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,860
You got one.

977
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,500
Oh, man, thanks.

978
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,700
We're on our way to Vancouver,
and l really, really appreciate this.

979
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,260
l couldn't leave these kids
here on the highway.

980
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,940
That's why l'm leaving you,
you animal!

981
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,220
Wait a minute!
Come back here, you hillbilly!

982
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,700
Come here!

983
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,900
No. Let me in. Let

984
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:12,020
Hey, yo, bring me back my kids!

985
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,060
Stop.

986
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,380
Mister, are you crazy?

987
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,260
Some psycho trucker took my kids.
We gotta catch him.

988
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,500
Well, hop aboard. l'll help you.
Ernst to the rescue.

989
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,620
Suzanne, they'll be here any minute.
l'm sure they're fine.

990
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,660
Now, let's concentrate on the party.

991
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,740
We were completely wrong
about Nick.

992
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,380
Yeah, but now we know
he's kind and gentle.

993
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:03,380
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, slim, get me closer.

994
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,940
Come on, Nick.
l got it.

995
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,460
Get off.
Open up, you jerk.

996
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,220
Nick, save us! Help!

997
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,700
Stop this truck!
Get off!

998
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,140
You lunatic!
Stop this truck!

999
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,980
Kind and gentle, huh?

1000
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,860
Go, man.
l'm moving.

1001
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,860
This thing wasn't built for speed.

1002
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,700
Come on,
you're driving like a old lady.

1003
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,420
No, no, you watch.
Ernst knows how to drive.

1004
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,860
That's what l'm talking about.

1005
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,380
Let us out now.
We wanna go with Nick.

1006
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,220
Let us out.

1007
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,220
Come on, slim, don't let him
push you around. Do it. Do it.

1008
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,860
Dagbernit, l've had enough of this.

1009
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:05,340
Come on, slim, they getting away.
lt won't turn over.

1010
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,300
l can't do anything about it.

1011
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,700
l'm sorry.

1012
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,300
Boy, it's true. Never a cop around
when you need one.

1013
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,460
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1014
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,860
Bad! Hit you!

1015
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,060
Geronimo!
Geronimo!

1016
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:42,180
Look, it's Elite Catering.
This is Mom's party.

1017
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,700
Let's go.

1018
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,660
Come on.
l want some cotton candy.

1019
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,180
Got you.
Run! Save yourself!

1020
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,740
Wait. Wait.

1021
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,860
At least slow down.

1022
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,220
You two are a peck of trouble,
you know that?

1023
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,540
Wait. l'm trying to protect you.

1024
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,660
You're going down, sucker.

1025
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,580
Get off me.

1026
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,940
Come on. Come on.

1027
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,780
l'm gonna give you
a knuckle sandwich.

1028
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,140
Let me at him. Get your hands off me.
What's wrong with you two?

1029
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:51,140
He's a kidnapper!
He's a kidnapper!

1030
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,020
He's a kidnapper!
He's a kidnapper!

1031
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,860
Let me at him.
Yeah. Nick, get him!

1032
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,100
Police.

1033
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,660
Mom!

1034
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,380
Lindsey, honey.

1035
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:17,460
Oh, baby, Mommy was so worried
about you. Are you okay?

1036
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:20,380
Yep. Eight o'clock,
just like you said.

1037
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,660
Now, where is your brother
and that Nick?

1038
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,580
l left them by the iceskating rink.

1039
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:29,420
Now, l need to know what's going
on here, and l want the truth.

1040
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,380
The truth? l don't think there's time
for the truth.

1041
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,980
Get him!

1042
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,780
l'm the good guy. Get him.

1043
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,180
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

1044
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:46,860
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

1045
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,740
Wait a minute.
You don't understand.

1046
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:54,700
l got permission from his mother
to bring him here. Kevin, tell him.

1047
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,740
Kevin!

1048
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,900
Let me go. He needs his inhaler.

1049
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,100
Kevin. Kevin.

1050
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,260
Oh, no. Come on, man.

1051
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,220
Come on, Kevin.

1052
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,140
Come on, man. Breathe.

1053
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,060
Breathe, breathe.

1054
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,420
Come on. Come on, breathe.

1055
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,700
Kevin.

1056
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,820
Kevin.

1057
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,380
Don't you ever scare me
like that again. You hear me?

1058
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,100
Don't you ever do that.

1059
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,700
Maybe it won't be so bad
to turn out like you after all.

1060
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:41,300
Kevin!

1061
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,420
Mommy.
Oh, Kevin, honey, come here.

1062
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,500
l don't know what Mommy was
thinking. l should've come home.

1063
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,980
Are you okay?
lt's okay, Mom. l'm fine.

1064
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,500
Yeah, it's okay. He's fine.

1065
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,900
You call this fine?

1066
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,180
Look at this.
This is a catastrophe.

1067
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,020
No, Suzanne,
you don't understand.

1068
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:00,900
l mean, we Me and the kids
Nick, please.

1069
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,660
lt's bad enough as it is.

1070
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,580
l really wanted to believe in you.

1071
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,900
Ma'am, did this man have permission
to watch your children?

1072
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,340
Yes.

1073
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,580
But it was a mistake,
and it won't happen again.

1074
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,620
Come on, you guys.

1075
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,660
Suzanne, no.
But, Mom

1076
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,900
l don't wanna hear it.
l'm not in the mood to argue. Let's go.

1077
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,700
Mommy.
Let's go.

1078
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,260
Suzanne.

1079
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,540
Nick.

1080
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,060
Listen...

1081
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,620
...l'm sorry for all the trouble.

1082
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:01,300
lf you're serious about heading home,
l'd be proud to give you a lift.

1083
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,620
Appreciate that, Big Al.

1084
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,740
l got my truck right

1085
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,220
Hey, what are you doing, you turkey?
You can't tow my truck!

1086
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:13,220
Put it down. l'm here.
Put it down right now.

1087
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,940
Officers, arrest this man!

1088
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,540
Yo, Nick.

1089
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,620
Excuse me.

1090
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,900
Hey, Nick, remember me?

1091
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,700
l'm in here with a mint
stuck to my head.

1092
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,540
Hey, brother.

1093
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,260
What are you moping about?
You should be celebrating.

1094
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,900
You finally got rid
of that highfalutin woman...

1095
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,300
...with that smartmouth little girl
and that sickly boy.

1096
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:47,340
Yes, sir. lt's New Year's Eve,
and you are free at last.

1097
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,340
Time to hit some clubs.

1098
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,740
And they got some foxy ladies here.

1099
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,340
Did you know Vancouver
produces more Playmates...

1100
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,500
...than any other city in the world?

1101
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,420
Let's go, player.

1102
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,460
Thanks, Dad, that was a lot of fun.

1103
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,980
Hey, Nick.

1104
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,500
You know what they call
a 50yearold bachelor?

1105
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,260
What?

1106
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,060
Lonely.

1107
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,700
Who is it?

1108
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,460
Room service.

1109
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,980
We didn't order anything,
and that won't change.

1110
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,260
Let me explain, okay?

1111
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,940
l know you're upset,
and you have a right to be...

1112
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:38,060
...but there's a good reason why all
Nick, they're kids.

1113
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,860
They don't need reasons and excuses.
They need a man.

1114
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,980
So whatever it is that you have to say,
just drop it.

1115
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:47,260
l've been down this road before,
and l'm not going back.

1116
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,460
Good night.
Wait, wait.

1117
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,300
Just let me say goodbye to the kids.

1118
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,860
l don't think that's a good idea.

1119
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,300
Please.

1120
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,700
Make it quick.

1121
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,900
Nick!
Nick!

1122
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:14,700
Hey, how you guys doing?
You all right?

1123
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,940
l knew you'd come back.
Lindsey didn't think so, but l did.

1124
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,140
Boy, you know l'm gonna be
your friend always, right?

1125
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,860
But Mama's not gonna
date you anymore.

1126
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,500
Listen, you guys.

1127
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,420
Up here.

1128
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,100
Your mother is a very,
very wonderful lady.

1129
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:41,500
And she's gonna be dating guys
that are much better than me.

1130
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:45,380
So you guys gotta stop
chasing them off, okay?

1131
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,740
And stay away from their cars.

1132
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,620
Unless they're bulletproof.

1133
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,100
How do l know
we'll ever see you again?

1134
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,540
l got something for you.

1135
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:04,660
l want you to hold on
to my man Satch, okay?

1136
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,700
That's until l see you again.

1137
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,620
All right...

1138
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,060
...l gotta get going.

1139
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,740
Do you have to?

1140
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:17,620
Yeah, little man, l think so.

1141
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:21,060
Look, l got one more thing for you.

1142
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
There you go.

1143
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,660
And for you.

1144
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:33,900
Now you have blingage.

1145
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,500
l love you guys.

1146
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,060
See you later, okay?

1147
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,740
All right.

1148
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,380
Suzanne, l'm sorry about
what happened today.

1149
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,660
l really am.

1150
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,740
l just wanna know if
we can still be friends.

1151
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,780
Nick, l don't think
that's gonna happen.

1152
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,260
Okay.

1153
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,820
Nick?

1154
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,020
We can't be friends...

1155
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,700
...because l wanna be so much more
than just your friend.

1156
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:23,980
What?

1157
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:25,940
Come here.

1158
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,620
Yes.
Yes.

1159
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Hey.

1160
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,340
lt's New Year's.
Aren't you supposed to kiss her?

1161
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:50,740
l love a happy ending.

1162
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,340
Yeah!
