which is said to be
a magical doorway to Storyland.

- Yeah, I think that's about it.

I'm sorry.
I didn't get here sooner.

Where will you go?

28
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,735
Well, the family
has an old house up in Bedford.

29

Needs a little work, and no one
seems to want it.

30

So I think we'll go
up there and give this try.

Good luck to you.

Is it really haunted?

96
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:23,420
I wouldn't say haunted.
I... would rather...

97
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,631
think of it as Enchanted.

98
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,092
- Enchanted?
- Your great old aunt Cat,

99
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,720
she says that up in the attic
there, there's a doorway

104
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,813
You think I could go there?

Absolutely not.

106

Not you stay
away from that attic.

107
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,362
You have to promise. Promise!

108
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,656
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,826
This place isn't so bad,
now is it?

110
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,414
Oh, come on.
I figure we just camp out here

all right?

112

want to sleep in Uncle Monty's?

I'm sure.

117
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,974
Now, did you say your prayers?

118

home soon.

it's been for you.

that Daddy couldn't have
survived the plane crash.

He's alive.

126
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,660
He promised he'd come home.

127

He promised.

128
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,625

[ominous music]

191
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:37,753
This is the child,
who is prophesized.

192
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,589
This runt?

193
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,594
You can't be serious.
He's a worm.

194
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,058
But my queen of repugnancy.

195
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,603
He has the book.

196
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,605
The book?

197
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,485
Well then. Dispatch the rats.

198
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,113
As you wish.

199

Where are you?

203
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,428
Come here boy. Come here.

204
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,139
Leo?

You hear Leo?

208
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,574
Leo.

Did you fall in?

[dog barks]

213
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,255
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

Hey, stop it!
Get away from there!

[rat burps]

221
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,752
Go away!

222
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,003
Stop it!

00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,630

[sinister chuckle]

233
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,457
What in tarnation have you
done to my trap?

234
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,544
Took me two weeks
to dig this hole!

235
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,879
We're sorry, sir.
My dog must have fallen in,

236
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,840
and I was just trying
to get him out.

237
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,134
[suspenseful music]

238
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,639
Oh, all right.

239
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,268
Come here.

240
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,312
You know, one more minute

241
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,481
and you would have been
in there for good.

242
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,192
Those are Queen Evilia's
dirty rats, you know.

243
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,028
What did you do to make her mad
enough to send them?

244
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,115
Queen Evilia. Who's she?

245
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,368
You don't know
who Queen Evilia is?

246
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,870
No, sir.

247
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,708
- She's the queen of Storyland.
- Storyland?

248
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,251
What's that?

249
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,464
Don't you know where you are?

250
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,307
Whoosh! What a story.

251
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,685
But how are you
going to get back?

252
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,062
That's what I've been
trying to figure out.

253
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,194
Maybe there's
something in this book.

254
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,660
I can't read.

255
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,579
Everyone can read.

256
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,499
I never learned.

257
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,085
I'll teach you.

258
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,546
Open a new page.

259
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,257
[clears throat]

260
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,386
Okay, let's see what this says.

261
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:02,768
- As Queen Benevolence...
- As Queen Benevolence...

262
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,522
kissed her beloved king...

263
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,024
Kissed?

264
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,236
Well Benevolence
was Evilia's sister.

265
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,697
But while Evilia is cruel
and greedy,

266
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,742
Benevolence was
generous and kind.

267
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,913
So Benevolence became Queen
and bore King Love-All

268
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,290
a son, Prince Arthur.

269
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,253
And King Love-All,
and Queen Benevolence

270
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,089
ruled Storyland
in peace and harmony.

271
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:38,595
Those were the happy
times, the golden times.

272
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,351
But Evilia remained consumed
with jealousy and envy.

273
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:51,233
Then, King Love-All was killed
on a hunting expedition...

274
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,694
The King was killed?

275
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,991
It took all Benevolence's
strength just carry on and live,

276
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,660
without her beloved King.

277
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,663
She must have been very sad.

278
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,250
She was. But all the while,

279
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:15,382
Evilia was waiting and plotting.
She wanted her sisters throne.

280
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,219
Sister, you look weary.

281
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,473
I brought you a tonic
to improve your vitality.

282
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,934
Evilia, how kind you are.

283
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,979
Could you ask Nanny to
bring some berry juice

284
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,522
for our young prince?

285
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,399
Of course, sister.

286
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,652
[sinister music]

287
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,619
Someday, you'll have to spend
some quality time

288
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,495
with your aunty, Arthur.

289
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,665
But Evilia's tonic
seem to make Benevolence

290
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,334
grow even more frail.

291
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,213
Maybe Evilia
was poisoning Benevolence.

292
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:55,506
Yeah.

293
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,550
You know many of us
thought so even then.

294
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,136
Then why didn't they
put her in jail?

295
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,804
Jail?

296
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,223
What's that?

297
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,517
A place where
you put bad people.

298
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,393
Oh.

299
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,481
Well until Evilia, we don't
have no bad people.

300
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,399
Wow.

301
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,276
Keep reading.

302
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,697
As Queen Benevolence lay dying,

303
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,326
Benevolence sent
for the King's sword.

304
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,665
This belongs to you now,
my son.

305
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,419
When you reach
manhood, in your good hands,

306
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:37,881
- it will have magical powers.
- Magical power?

307
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,717
What kind of magical powers?

308
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,136
The power to do right, Arthur.

309
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:47,391
The power of truth which flows
from the pure of heart.

310
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:51,770
So you must always
keep your heart pure.

311
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,439
Free from anger or fear.

312
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:00,821
Use the sword to protect
yourself from Evilia.

313
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,950
She has become obsessed with
power and...

314
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,746
I fear she will surely try
to rob you of the throne.

315
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,915
She died?

316
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,378
I can finish the story
without being able to read.

317
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,756
Evilia became queen and
sent her henchmen

318
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,675
to find Arthur and the sword.

319
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,760
See, 'cause without the sword,

320
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,847
Evilia could never have
absolute power.

321
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,225
But where did Arthur
hide the sword?

322
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,980
Well, you see, Katarina
was no ordinary friend.

323
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,941
She'd come from
a place far away.

324
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,278
They were both
very young back then.

325
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,155
Katarina.

326
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,033
Katerina! Wait a minute.

327
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,743
My great aunt's name was Kat.

328
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,661
Couldn't that be short
for Katarina?

329
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,164
It was her house I moved into.

330
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,541
I got here through her attic.

331
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,588
You couldn't be him.

332
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,591
No way, you're too young.

333
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,092
Couldn't be who?

334
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,802
The one.

335
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,388
The one what?

336
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,432
The one in the prophecy.

337
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,560
The one sent
from Katarina's world,

338
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,605
to find the sword for Arthur.

339
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,983
Me? You think it's me?

340
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:26,198
Well... you're from her world
and you got the book.

341
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,575
That's two proofs right there.

342
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,702
I forgot to ask what happened
to Arthur.

343
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,829
Did Evilia let him
stay in the castle?

344
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,248
[scoffs]

345
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,085
Oh, he's in the castle,
all right. In the dungeon.

346
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,671
They say
she tortures him every day,

347
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,423
trying to find out
where he's hidden the sword.

348
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,760
-[ominous music]
-[Arthur grunts]

349
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,471

350

[Arthur grunts]

352
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,289
Ah, it's the old tickle and
poke torture. Must be Tuesday.

353
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,665
[grunts]

354
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,000
Where is it?

355
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,043
Where's what Aunty Dearest?

356
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,296
Don't trifle with me, Arthur.

357
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,465
I want that sword
and I want it now.

358
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,343
Oh really Evilia. How many
years we've been at this?

359
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,387
[Arthur chuckles]

360
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,723
I'm losing patience
with you, nephew.

361
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:33,807
[Arthur grunts]

362
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,852
I'm teetering on the brink
of forgetting about that sword.

363
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:40,063
Which means I have no further
reason to keep you alive.

364
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,315
[Arthur grunts]

365
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,901
[ominous music]

366
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:49,781
[Woody snoring]

367
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,453
[wolf howls]

368
00:24:58,123 --> 00:24:59,166
[snoring continues]

369
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,881
[snoring continues]

370
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,927
[ominous music]

371
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:15,098
Forgive me Your Majesty.
I know it's late but...

372
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,310
you're so beautiful.

373
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,604
The rats have not returned.

374
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,689
I fear something dreadful
has happened to them.

375
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,024
They never miss dinner.

376
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:25,651
Rats!

377
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,154
Did you put out the
cheese the cheese?

378
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,364
The cheese?

379
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,991
Yes, you lop eared marmoset.

380
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,287
The cheese,
for the rats to lure them back.

381
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:39,706
Oh, for Satan sake.

382
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,458
Did you put out the cheese?

383
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,086
I put up the cats.

384
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,923
You know, as usual before
I lock the castle.

385
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,093
Let me get this straight.

386
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,888
You knew the rats
had not returned.

387
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,350
And yet you released the cats.

388
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:02,396
- Is that right?
- Yes.

389
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,731
[sighs]

390
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:11,488
Idiot! Numbskull!
Saliva from a baboon's tongue!

391
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,825
That is the end of the rats.

392
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,410
[whines and groans]

393
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,079
[Evilia] Oh my precious rats.

394
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,497
[Evilia sobs]

395
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:21,832
Gone!

396
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,502
Eaten. History.

397
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:27,296
[cries]

398
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,757
How about I put out the cheese?

399
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,763
[screams in frustration]

400
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,187
Leave, while you can.

401
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,524
[dark ominous music]

402
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,694
[cries in pain]

403
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,075
Good help is so hard to find.

404
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,418
[dark music continues]

405
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,131
Dispatch the Beasts.

406
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,263
[dog snarls]

407
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,977
Woody, wake up!

408
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,982
-[beasts growling]
-[suspenseful music]

409
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:35,405
[beasts growl and bark]

410
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,243
They're afraid of fire.

411
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,452
[Dog growls]

412
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,711
[Woody screams]

413
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,175
[Woody] Demons!

414
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,304
[beasts whimper]

415
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,190
What were they?

416
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,985
More of Evilia's little helpers.

417
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,196
They'll be back,
but not tonight.

418
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,991
Try to get some sleep
little friend.

419
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,244
Woody.
I know what I have to do.

420
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:25,247
I have to find the sword
and bring it to Arthur,

421
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,416
so I can get back home.

422
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,085
I don't understand.

423
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,715
It's all in the book.
When Katarina had the sword,

424
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,552
she hid it with the key that
opens the door back to my world.

425
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:44,975
Don't you see? It was her way
of trying to protect Arthur,

426
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,811
in case she couldn't
come back herself.

427
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,022
That way, whoever
did come into Storyland,

428
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,900
would have to save Arthur
before they could get back home.

429
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,026
Yeah.

430
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,069
I sure wouldn't
have thought of it.

431
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,071
But where is the sword?

432
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,490
- Does the book say?
- Something's missing.

433
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,619
Here, look.
Something goes here.

434
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,163
And the rest
of the pages are blank.

435
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,373
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

436
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,877
The Kings sword was inlaid
with a sapphire crystal,

437
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,128
but I don't see it.

438
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,048
Truth is revealed,
when one has Faith.

439
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,510
Some sort of clue. Can you think
what it might mean?

440
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,764
There used to be
a beautiful cave

441
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,142
set in a large rock formation
in the North country.

442
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:32,105
In the Golden Days, Arthur
and Katarina would picnic there

443
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,398
with their nanny.

444
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,944
I think they called it
"The Cave of Faith".

445
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,612
The Cave of Faith?

446
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,988
You know where it is?

447
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:43,909
Yep,

448
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,666
[sweet music]

449
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,558
The Lake of Tears.

450
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,601
The Lake of Tears?

451
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,603
Yep.

452
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:16,608
When Queen Benevolence
died, everybody cried and cried.

453
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,736
The tears formed this lake.

454
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,781
But, where's the cave of Faith?

455
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,826
All the way across the lake.

456
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,328
But nobody's ever
been able to cross it,

457
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:32,040
because Queen Evilia
filled it with a razor fish.

458
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,709
Razor fish?

459
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:34,877
Yep.

460
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,213
He'll cut you to
shreds if you fall in.

461
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,298
I'm not afraid.

462
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,092
Come on.
Where can we find a boat?

463
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:43,969
What do you mean we?

464
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,934
Well look, I mean it's going
to be impossible.

465
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,645
You know that I mean would
never make it across alive.

466
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,524
My dad always says,
"The only failures in life,

467
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,484
are the ones you never try."

468
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,655
-[sighs]
- Oh no.

469
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,533
[light flute music]

470
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:14,166
So, your mama thinks
he's gone, too?

471
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,212
Everyone thinks Dad
died in the plane crash.

472
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,590
Everyone but me.

473
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,011
I still hear his voice
sometimes Woody.

474
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,763
You know, like in my head,

475
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,681
telling me not to
give up on him.

476
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:36,063
Jeez. I know when people die,
they don't come back to life.

477
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,940
I mean, I'm not a kid.

478
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,318
Mom and everyone
thinks I'm in denial.

479
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,362
Whatever that means.

480
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,114
That I'm just not
accepting his death.

481
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,699
Mmm.

482
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,205
I know, just know
he's alive... somewhere.

483
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,917
I can't stop believing.

484
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,382
I don't care if you
don't believe me either.

485
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,764
[ominous music]

486
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,818

Meddling woodsman.

491
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,897
Remind me to put a
scorpion in his overalls.

492
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,200
Coast looks clear.

493
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,827
[Woody screams]

494
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,724
Razor fish?

495
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,601
Dinner.

496
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,323
You what I think Woody? The
sword must be hidden

497
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,200
in the cave of Faith.

498
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:58,914
What I think is, spudder fish
makes a fine barbecue.

499
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,499
[chuckles]

500
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,836
Woody, time for our
reading lesson.

501
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,462
Hm, very well.

502
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,935
Children wept at the loss
of their queen.

503
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:24,231
The children wept
at the loss of their queen.

504
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:31,113
Young Prince Arthur realized
his new responsibility.

505
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:38,036
Young Prince Arthur realized

506
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:43,917
his new we... ponsibility

507
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:49,131

No! Here boy.

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,599
What's that?

530
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:13,317
Looks like poultice root.
Only grows in the High Country.

531
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,861
Supposed to have
great healing powers.

532
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,114
Can we try it on Leo?

533
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,033
Reckon that's why he brought it.

Boy, you're all right.

539
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,071
Well. Looks like you're fit
as a fiddle again pooch.

540
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,489

is that boy?

00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,807
You're the all-knowing one.
You're the one

545
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,142
with the Crystal Snake Eyes.
You tell me.

546
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,352
Tighter!

547
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:32,604
[Arthur grunts]

548
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:38,485
Now, nephew.
I ask you again.

549
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,281
Who is that boy?

550
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:44,992
You know,

551
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:49,079
I believe I liked
you better as a blonde.

552
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,166
[Arthur screams in pain]

553
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,377
[laughs]

554
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,017
Come on boy. Come on.

555
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,315
Wow,

556
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,442
- Is that the Cave of Faith?
- Yep,

557
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,110
Let's go.

558
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,404
[lively music]

559
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,659
- Why are we hiding?
- Because there's a guard.

560
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,162
Where? I don't see anybody.

561
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:31,955
Oh, he's down there,
all right,

562
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:35,709
And he's plenty mean.
Fierce and vicious.

563
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,419
His name's Pouch.

564
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,964
Most vexatious critter
I ever knew. He's Australian.

565
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,219
[sniffs]

566
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,895
Clear. Time to go a couple of
rounds with the old shadow then.

567
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:56,396
All right.

568
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,733
Ready? And sound the bell.

569
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,402
As Pouch comes out swinging.

570
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,822
A right, a left.
A stinging right to the jaw

571
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,076
Right, left right, left
right left.

572
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,663
[Pouch mumbling]

573
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,213
Oh, you're flailing.

574
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:23,048
He is flailing. What's that?

575
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:26,718
Oh, he's got it, and a beautiful
carriage ride to the jaw.

576
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,137
That's it, he's down.
Down for the count.

577
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:32,057
- Good champeroo!
-[laughing]

578
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,351
[Pouch mumbling]

579
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:38,313
[mumbling continues]

580
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,693
Fierce and vicious?

581
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:47,698
[Pouch mumbling in confusion]

582
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:53,579
- Well, what do we do now?
- We'll have to sneak up on him,

583
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,664
and get him from behind.

584
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,000
That doesn't sound very fair.

585
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,962
Well you might like
getting punched in the nose,

586
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:03,255
but I don't.

587
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:06,842
Come on, let's go.

588
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,680
Are you a man or a marsupial?
Come on man.

589
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:13,724
[Pouch mumbling]

590
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,726
I've got you now.

591
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,644
[Pouch mumbling]

592
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,438
[Woody and Brandon scream]

593
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,983
[Pouch yelling]

594
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,695
[Pouch] Help me!

595
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,116
Somebody help!

596
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:32,951
[Pouch] I can't swim!

597
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,912
Then you shouldn't work
around water!

598
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,539
Come on, we'll save you!

599
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,625
No we won't! [indistinct]

600
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,377
Down into the briny deep.

601
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:47,382
- Come on, Woody. Help him.
- Mm-mm.

602
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:52,721
Woody. I won't give you another
reading lesson if you don't.

603
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,642
I didn't need you, mate.
Could have saved meself.

604
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:57,809
Didn't need you at all.

605
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:58,977
You just got in me way.

606
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,522
We should
have let you drown.

607
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,190
Huh?

608
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,361
I'm Brandon. You are?

609
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,196
My name's Pouch.

610
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:13,450
The perspicacious pugilist
and pulchritudinous master

611
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,245
of pugnacity.
At your service, mate.

612
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,790
Oh, well...

613
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,125
- This is my friend, Woody.
-[Woody scoffs]

614
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,294
-[Pouch] Never mind.
- Since we saved your life,

615
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,129
will you take us into the cave?

616
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:28,257
Into the cave?
Oh dear, dear, no.

617
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,591
Afraid I can't do that at all.

618
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,512
See I was sent by Prince Arthur
to guard the cave with me life.

619
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,305
Afraid I can't let
any of you inside.

620
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,390
Sorry mate,

621
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,518
But I'm the one who was
sent to return the sword to him.

622
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,311
You?

623
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,023
You can't be serious.

624
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,108
Oh, yeah?

625
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:47,943
We have the book.

626
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:49,903
[sweet music]

627
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,157
You see mate,
I've never been inside.

628
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,035
But you were inside
when we just saw you now.

629
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,121
Just in the entrance.

630
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:01,373
I've never been
deep in the cave.

631
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:02,457
Oh, no, no, no, no.

632
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:03,542
You see...

633
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,005
It's very dark in there.
Quite dark.

634
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:11,258
You're not afraid of the dark,
are you?

635
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,469
[door creaks open]

636
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,264
[ominous music]

637
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:35,574
[Pouch nervously stutters]

638
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,290
[ominous music continues]

639
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:04,603
[ominous music intensifies]

640
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,732
-[loud flash]
- Voila!

641
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,361
[wizard breathes heavily]

642
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:14,363
Put them up mate,
put them up I say.

643
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:18,575
What are you nuts?
I am Illuzor.

644
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:21,787
You bet you're a loser.
Now put them up mate.

645
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:23,205
Put them up.

646
00:44:23,288 --> 00:44:24,623
- Come on...
- Not a loser.

647
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:30,337
You crooked kangaroo.
Ill... Ill...

648
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,715
If you're ill,
maybe we can help.

649
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:40,347
You don't understand.
Illuzor is my name,

650
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,561
- and illusion is my game.
- Illusion? What's illusion?

651
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,981
That's something you can see,

652
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,569
but it doesn't really exists.
Abracadabra ...

653
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,697
Watch my hands, empty.

654
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,616
[mumbles magic words]

655
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:02,327
[chuckles with delight]

656
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,624
My dad used to do that.

657
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,126
Oh he did?

658
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,503
Oh. Your dad...

659
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:15,215
- is he a sorcerer?
- A fighter pilot.

660
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,759
A fighter pilot.

661
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:22,055
- Sort of a flying sorcerer.
-[chuckles]

662
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,354
A noble line of work,

663
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:33,567
But can your father do this?

664
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:42,367
[Illuzor mumbles]

665
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,168
Magic. Mystic by you.

666
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,128
Magical.

667
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,013
Anyway, son.

668
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,140
What are you want from me?

669
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:07,142
My name is Brandon Bergen.

670
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,687
And I'm from the human world.
I think I'm the one, you know,

671
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,731
the one chosen to return
the sword to Arthur

672
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,483
so he can free Storyland.

673
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,110
These are my
friends Woody and Pouch.

674
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:20,322
- That's my dog Leo.
-[barks]

675
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,992
So if you would just
shows for the sword is hidden,

676
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:27,621
we can go and free the prince
and I can get home for dinner.

677
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:31,083
Hold it, hold it.
Hold everything.

678
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:36,338
First of all, aren't you
a little too, shall I say...

679
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,552
diminutive to be the one?
Aren't you?

680
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,847
If you mean small, David slew
Goliath didn't he?

681
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,139
That's true.

682
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,976
He gave him a shot in the head.

683
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:53,605
So if you are the one who
will have to answer these,

684
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:59,236
these, these questions,
I have them here somewhere.

685
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:05,367
Oh, good, good.
I found the questions.

686
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:08,829
Would you step over there?

687
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:16,128
[loud rumbling]

688
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,006
There was a young man
from Nantucket.

689
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:22,593
Oops, sorry. Wrong kind.

690
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,681
Now, here's the first question.

691
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,099
[barks]

692
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,809
Shut up.

693
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:32,769
[growls]

694
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:36,899
If you were walking through
the hallway of your school

695
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,986
and you found
a five Zanzar bill...

696
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,739
Zanzar? What's a Zanzar?

697
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:46,158
Our hopelessly inflated money.

698
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:47,534
Oh.

699
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:52,080
I'll repeat it.
If you were walking through

700
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,167
the hallway of your school
and you found

701
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,296
the five Zanzar bill
lying on the ground,

702
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:03,884
would you "A": pick it up and
put it in your pocket?

703
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:09,348
"B": Pick it up and turn it
to the Schoolmaster General?

704
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:15,938
Or "C": ask those around you
if one of them lost it?

705
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,441
Well,

706
00:48:19,775 --> 00:48:22,736
I found a five Zanzar bill
in my school yard,

707
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:26,031
I would pick it up
and put it in my pocket...

708
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:29,493
[loud rumbling]

709
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,708
...and then look around secretly
for the person from your world

710
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:37,960
who left it there.

711
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:40,379
Excellent, my boy.

712
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:41,713
Excellent.

713
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:46,593
[Woody and Pouch
laugh with delight]

714
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:51,306
Which is more important?
Seeing or believing?

715
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,187
Well, it's important to see
things as they really are.

716
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:00,816
But sometimes you have to
believe in something,

717
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,818
even if you can't see it.

718
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,530
Splendid my boy, splendid.

719
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:11,827
"Faith", that's another word
for "believing".

720
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,499
That's why this
is known as the Cave of Faith.

721
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:22,838
Because you can only find
it if you believe you can.

722
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,756
There's a third question?

723
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,800
I thought oh,
yes, yes, absolutely.

724
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,806
Here it is.
If you could make one wish,

725
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,683
yourself at this moment...

726
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,853
what would it be?

727
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,278
To return the sword
to Prince Arthur,

728
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,197
and to see my father.

729
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:50,699
That's perfect.

730
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:52,951
You must be the one.

731
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,828
-[Woody and Pouch laugh]
- Yes!

732
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,999
Thank you, Illuzor.
S you'll give us a sword?

733
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:04,588
Sword? What sword?
I don't have a sword.

734
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:10,511
But I have a stone here,
but no sword

735
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,556
You don't have the sword?

736
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,807
But that, that...

737
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:18,810
That's what we came
all this way for.

738
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:24,650
[loud rumbling]

739
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,447
The book!

740
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,115
Woody, hand me the book.

741
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,867
Give me the book, furball.

742
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:37,162
[Pouch] Here, here.

743
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:41,959
Where's the page?

744
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:47,714
[suspenseful music]

745
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,595
[loud rumbling]

746
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,229
[barks]

747
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,941
[suspenseful music continues]

748
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:09,111
[loud puff]

749
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,120
Sure...

750
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:21,206
sure gonna miss those guys.

751
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:24,918
You were right.

752
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,420
He does have the book.

753
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,048
And he's growing stronger.

754
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,467
He doesn't look any stronger.

755
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:36,597
See, each turn of the page
the boy grows stronger.

756
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,390
You're an ignorant shit.

757
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:40,934
But he's still a boy.

758
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,438
Just a boy. Boy with a book.

759
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:50,527
And I, I devised
my brother-in-law's murder,

760
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:54,698
poisoned my sister, imprisoned
her son,

761
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:58,410
threw an entire kingdom into
chronic depression.

762
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,495
Let him top that.

763
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:04,082
His power comes from
strength of heart,

764
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:07,503
Your Royal Moronicness.

765
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:14,092
You think I cannot overcome
a boy with a book?

766
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:17,304
I have the power.

767
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,227
Faith my obtusity, is power.

768
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:26,688
Well I have faith,
that I am more...

769
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,819
powerful. If I have to I'll go
myself and get that stupid book.

770
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:36,657
[owl hoots]

771
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:38,325
[Woody snores]

772
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:42,371
[birds cackling]

773
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:47,751
-[dog barks]
-[Pouch] Ah, ah, oh!

774
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,004
Woody, wake up, wake up.
There we go.

775
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,048
Good day.

776
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:56,385
Look. What's this then?

777
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,637
Look. Isn't this great?

778
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:00,681
Who could have done this?

779
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:05,602
[owl] Who do you think did it?
The food fairy? Hello? Hello.

780
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:08,188
Did you just talk.

781
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,482
Does a bear
go poop in the woods?

782
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:11,900
You heard
me didn't you?

783
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:16,280
- Yes, but I don't believe it.
-[owl] Another non-believer.

784
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:18,532
Who do you think did it?
Your little doggie?

785
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,701
Will you think these
other two clowns did it?

786
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,828
Well, we could if we wanted to.

787
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,872
We most certainly
could have mate.

788
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:26,164
We most certainly could...

789
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,125
I have been schlepping
all night.

790
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,086
Fly here for some berries,
fly there for some nuts.

791
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,504
I'm tired already.

792
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,798
What do you think? I just
ordered takeout?

793
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:39,678
Admit it. You needed me.
And do I even get a thank you?

794
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,556
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Sir?

795
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:46,018
I feel so old. My name's Hoot.
As in owls go hoot.

796
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,102
Sorry, Hoot.

797
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:50,480
- Why are you even helping us?
- Ever hear of Prince Arthur

798
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:53,233
in the dungeon? Didn't think so.
He'll be no Legend

799
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:56,320
unless he becomes king.
But first there's an evil queen

800
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:57,404
and a snake.

801
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,656
...that slimy serpent, Hiss?

802
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:01,867
Evilia's evil [indistinct].

803
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:04,703
Never trust the snake.
You befriend somebody,

804
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,413
you help them,
you give of yourself

805
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,956
and how do they repay you?

806
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,334
By stabbing me in the back
and taking my old job

807
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,460
as royal advisor.

808
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,295
I led Moses across the desert,

809
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,421
I can lead you out
of the forest

810
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:15,589
until the soil.

811
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,383
Arthur becomes king,
I become a trusted advisor.

812
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,593
Everybody's happy.

813
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,513
- Wow.
-[Pouch] I like that.

814
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:23,597
[Pouch chuckles]

815
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,183
You've been following us
for days.

816
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:29,269
How come you never told
us you could talk?

817
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,980
If I told you
I'd have to kill you.

818
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:34,358
Just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

819
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:38,362
-[owl hoots]
-[tranquil music]

820
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,671
[dog barking]

821
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,761
[triumphant music]

822
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:13,939
So, they found the sword.
Big deal!

823
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,858
Doesn't mean
they can pull it out.

824
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:19,528
[Woody grunts]

825
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,371
That woodsman.
More brawn than brain.

826
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:34,585
Step aside, Woodsday.
Let a real taproom give it a go.

827
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,595
[Pouch grunts]

828
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,557
Kangaroo?
Don't make me laugh.

829
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,225
[scoffing laughter]

830
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:54,897
[grunting continues]

831
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,483
Stupid.

832
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:23,467
What's happening?
Why can't I see them?

833
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:28,722
He must have the sword.
Only the power of the sword

834
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,599
can blind my vision.

835
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,142
Dispatch the rat.

836
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,020
The rats are dead.

837
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:36,605
Dispatch the Beast.

838
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,566
They're history.

839
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:42,194
Well, the birds of prey then.

840
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:44,905
Heads will roll this time.

841
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:51,370
Dispatch with the dispatching.
We make them, come to us.

842
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:54,957
Hm.

843
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,876
Not a bad idea.

844
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,421
We have to sneak into
the dungeon where Arthur is.

845
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,715
But that's impossible.

846
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,928
You said finding
the sword was impossible.

847
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,765
We have to go to the castle.

848
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,060
But Evilia's there.
She's very powerful you know,

849
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:17,980
and hiss...

850
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:21,525
It's Friday. Where are those
blood sucking leeches?

851
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,319
- You sure it's Friday?
- With great certainty.

852
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:25,821
Something's definitely wrong.

853
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:27,781
She's never missed
a leech Friday.

854
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:30,200
It's her
favorite form of torture.

855
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,452
This can mean
only one of two things:

856
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:37,040
"A": Evilia's renounced the
very evil, which is the essence

857
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:40,919
of her existence
and grown a heart.

858
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,213
Nah.

859
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,843
Two: She's found the sword.

860
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,678
Arthur!

861
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:54,183
- Auntie dearest.
- Your end is near.

862
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:59,605
I wouldn't say near it's like,
two maybe three feet away.

863
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,941
His death you nincompoop!

864
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:04,318
- His death?
- My death?

865
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:08,906
Your death, your end,
your extinction.

866
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:16,872
Over. Finito. Kaput.
You've waited this long.

867
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,291
You may as well stick around,

868
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:23,128
see me finally obtain
absolute power.

869
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:27,299
Then I'm going to have to kill
you with the very sword

870
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:32,429
- that could have saved you.
- Sword? who has the sword?

871
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,432
- Wouldn't you like to know?
-[laughs evilly]

872
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,319
-[ominous music]
-[crows cawing]

873
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,739
What are we gonna do now?

874
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,575
Storm the castle
with just the three of us?

875
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:56,036
- Don't you know how to count?
- What?

876
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,830
Dog, owl, three people.
That makes five.

877
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,291
Well you know what?
A dog and an owl

878
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,795
ain't gonna be much help against
the army of Castle guards.

879
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,381
Whatever.

880
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:11,218
[energetic music]

881
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:15,430
If only there were more of us.

882
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,602
Don't look now, but there's
more of us than you know.

883
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,938
[Pouch] All right, put 'em up.
Put 'em up.

884
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,356
[Pouch] A lot of them.

885
00:59:25,816 --> 00:59:28,193
Bunch of Tasmanian Devils,
that's what they are.

886
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:32,114
[Pouch] Come on. Come on.
Put 'em up, one at a time.

887
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:36,493
[Pouch mumbling]

888
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:40,789
Greetings.

889
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:45,627
- Do you speak English?
-[kids giggling]

890
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:51,842
Of course we do.
And we'll hear perfectly well.

891
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:56,096
[trumpets sounding loudly]

892
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,015
Silence!

893
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,350
[people muttering]

894
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,103
My disloyal subjects!

895
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:08,817
Your precious prince
dies tonight.

896
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:13,030
[ominous music]

897
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,746
Okay. Everybody remember
what to do?

898
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,709
Remember, watch out
for the guards.

899
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:29,963
Good luck my little friend.

900
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:31,215
I'm gonna need it.

901
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:35,969
[Pouch] Good luck.

902
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:43,602
[ominous music continues]

903
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:50,567
[Pouch] Hey you!
Anybody wanna fight?

904
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:55,197
[Woody] Right over here!
Who dares? Who dares?

905
01:00:56,031 --> 01:01:02,246
[Pouch and Woody
continues yelling]

906
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:08,627
[dog barking]

907
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,796
Prince Arthur, the sword.

908
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:25,102
Thank you. You have performed
a great service to me.

909
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:30,274
You deserve a reward.

910
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:35,821
[evil laughter]

911
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,125
[Panzius] Hey, hey! Easy, easy.
Come on, now.

912
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,252
Come on,
there's a kid there. Easy.

913
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,257
It's all right.

914
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:58,093
All right.

915
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,345
All right this way.

916
01:02:02,306 --> 01:02:04,308
Watch those stairs.
Come on, over there.

917
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:07,895
All right, that's it.
What's that? Damn? All right.

918
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:16,987
Please rise.

919
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,368
We're sorry Prince Arthur.

920
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,787
We tried to help.

921
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:30,501
Your majesty,
we gave it our all we truly did.

922
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:37,549
- Are you real Prince Arthur?
- Yes, I am young friend.

923
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,718
So you must be the one.

924
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:44,306
Thank you, for trying.

925
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,018
All of you.

926
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:49,645
Excuse me, I hate to interrupt,

927
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,855
but I have to start
shackling you.

928
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:52,940
Right this way.

929
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:55,150
We'll have plenty of
time to get acquainted.

930
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:56,944
- Be careful.
- Okay.

931
01:02:57,486 --> 01:02:58,487
Watch that.

932
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,448
[evil laughter]

933
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:05,619
I'm finally queen
of all the world!

934
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:07,913
The boy and his friends,

935
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,624
have you killed them yet
my Bloatfullness?

936
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,377
Oh I'll kill them later.

937
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,547
Right now I wanna
play with my sword.

938
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,591
[chuckles eerily]

939
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:27,808
Now that I have absolute power,
I must find many more kingdoms

940
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:30,686
to make miserable,
to make suffer.

941
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:36,650
I really think you should
kill them now, oh Insipid One.

942
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,696
Later, you slithering reptile.

943
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,575
Don't you have a mouse to eat?

944
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,410
[hisses aggressively]

945
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,040
I'm so sorry about this.

946
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,836
I hope you're not
terribly uncomfortable.

947
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,881
Yeah, aren't we supposed to be?

948
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:02,009
Well she would like it that way,
but I'm very sensitive

949
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,303
and I hate
when my prisoners suffer.

950
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:07,264
But there was this one time
when I try to help,

951
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:11,101
and well there was this poor
starving child,

952
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:15,272
and all I did was steal
a measly little piece of cheese

953
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,899
from one of her rats,

954
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:23,739
and she pulled out my molars.

955
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:29,036
[Panzius crying]

956
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:36,418
You wanna use my hanky?

957
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:40,589
Thank you.

958
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:44,635
[blows his nose]

959
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:49,056
I simply can't believe
that after all these years,

960
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:50,974
it's gonna end like this.

961
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:52,184
Leo's out there.

962
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:55,646
Leo and Hoot. They'll come up
with something.

963
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,481
Two of your friends escaped?

964
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:01,193
Only a dog and an owl.
What help could they be?

965
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:04,738
You'd be surprised what the wise
old owl can come up with.

966
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:06,657
Quite surprised.

967
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:09,660
[Hoot] Here's what we gotta do.
We gotta go in the dungeon,

968
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,621
we gotta get them out.
Any questions?

969
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,666
What about Cocoland?

970
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:20,337
I think that should be the next
story Kingdom I conquer.

971
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:23,006
Yes.

972
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,093
Then I can go straight
across the border

973
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:27,678
[indistinct]

974
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:33,016
I suggest you dispose
of your enemies at home,

975
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,978
before you make new ones.

976
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,231
[dog panting]

977
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:52,995
Hello. Over here in the window.

978
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:55,289
Yeah you. Come over here.

979
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:58,125
My God. Your bodies,
those biceps.

980
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,793
What do I gotta do to get
a body like that?

981
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:01,170
You must go to the gym a lot.

982
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:02,504
Let's start going.

983
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:05,257
[suspenseful music]

984
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,345
[machinery creaking]

985
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:22,608
[dog barks]

986
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:28,447
Arthur look. It's my dog, Leo,

987
01:06:28,947 --> 01:06:30,824
The little rogue,
he's brought the keys.

988
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:36,997
Panzius old friend!
Wouldn't mind terribly

989
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,582
would you collect
those keys at the ledge

990
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:41,001
and bring them to me?
I'd do it myself,

991
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:44,213
but I seem to be shackled
up with the moment.

992
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:48,217
Oh dear, I don't think
Evilia would like that.

993
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,594
I mean she might take
my canines next

994
01:06:50,677 --> 01:06:52,638
and then I'd have
the devil's own time

995
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:53,722
eating my mutton.

996
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,058
If you free Arthur,
then he'll be king,

997
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:57,893
and you'll never lose
another tooth.

998
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:00,604
- Really?
- You have my word.

999
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:04,066
Good Enough for me, Sire.

1000
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,069
Bless you Panzius.

1001
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,362
Don't mention it.

1002
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:11,990
[suspenseful orchestral music]

1003
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:19,873
Shh.

1004
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,561
[suspenseful music continues]

1005
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,303
-[Pouch] All right. Let's go.
-[guards laughing]

1006
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:20,809
[Pouch mumbling]

1007
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,107
Start with you.
Yeah, this one here.

1008
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:30,527
Let me just get the bad.
Give me a moment.

1009
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:34,990
Hey,

1010
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,244
What'd you do that for?
I could have taken them.

1011
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,207
Prince Arthur, Brandon.
Shake a leg.

1012
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,711
[Pouch] I had him right
where I wanted him.

1013
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:49,129
No, no,
you were very brave, Pouch.

1014
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,255
Save your strength for Evilia.

1015
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:51,632
Yeah,

1016
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:54,968
[evil laughter]

1017
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,517
What sounds better?

1018
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:05,312
Queen of the World
are Queen of the Universe.

1019
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:09,858
I think you're the most vain
and foolish villainess

1020
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:14,029
to draw breath since the wicked
queen in Snow White.

1021
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,698
What did you say?

1022
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,076
I'm sick of you.

1023
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,288
Oh you slimy,
snake faced lizard.

1024
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:25,582
I don't need you anymore.

1025
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,543
[evil laughter]

1026
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:34,424
I wanna dance. I wanna dance.
Oh yes!

1027
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:35,968
Dance with me.

1028
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:40,347
Dance with me.

1029
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:43,517
I order you to dance with me!

1030
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,854
I am the queen of the universe.

1031
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,067
[dramatic music]

1032
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,277
Sword!

1033
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:16,341
[Woody grunts]

1034
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:19,761
Tail, yes!

1035
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:28,854
I did it!
I actually hit someone. Whoo!

1036
01:10:30,856 --> 01:10:33,942
Give me that!

1037
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:35,485
I have it, Prince Arthur!

1038
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,237
I have the sword.

1039
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,741
Give it to me, little boy.

1040
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,118
The sword is mine.
It's of no use to you.

1041
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:46,997
It belongs to Prince Arthur.
It said so in the book.

1042
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,917
Give it to him
and you'll never get home.

1043
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:51,710
I'm the only one who knows

1044
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:53,545
where the key to your world
is hidden.

1045
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,425
Is that true? Don't you know
where the key is?

1046
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,552
Can't you get me home?

1047
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,804
No, I cannot get
you home Brandon.

1048
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:06,683
But I don't believe she can
either. She's bluffing.

1049
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:08,477
Give the sword to me Brandon.

1050
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,146
And I'll have you
home in time for dinner.

1051
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:14,775
Your mother's making
your favorite pizza.

1052
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:17,486
How did you know I liked Pizza?

1053
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:19,196
I can see her.

1054
01:11:20,781 --> 01:11:23,158
She's very lonely Brandon.

1055
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:29,915
She misses you deeply.
She weeps for you, at night,

1056
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,584
quietly into her pillow.

1057
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:39,216
She goes into your room.
Angels on your pillow, she says.

1058
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:44,429
Only...
there's no Brandon to answer.

1059
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,183
Give the sword to me,

1060
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,811
and I'll have you home
in no time.

1061
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:53,564
[Woody] No Brandon!
Don't believe her.

1062
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:56,108
Only I can get you home.

1063
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:59,111
But I must have
the sword to do it.

1064
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:01,947
What do I do?
I want to go home.

1065
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:04,199
Follow your heart Brandon.

1066
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:08,078
I can ask nothing more of you.

1067
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,085
[suspenseful music continues]

1068
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,939
[loud explosion]

1069
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:50,078
[Woody laughs triumphantly]

1070
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,123
You had me scared
there for a minute,

1071
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,209
but you made
the right choice.

1072
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:58,795
- I'm proud of you.
- Me too, mate. Real proud.

1073
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,969
So, you've won at last.

1074
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:13,852
Who could have foreseen
you bringing about my demise,

1075
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:17,231
with such a
mutley crew of allies?

1076
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,986
A woodsman, a kangaroo.
The child.

1077
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:25,614
The book.

1078
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:33,705
My whole life...
devoted to the pursuit

1079
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:36,542
of absolute power and evil.

1080
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:45,717
And now... I'm going to die.

1081
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,680
I'm going to die.

1082
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:52,432
No, I shall not
kill you Evilia.

1083
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,394
Death is too fine
a fate for you.

1084
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,229
Instead, you shall spend
the rest of your days

1085
01:13:57,312 --> 01:14:00,607
suffering the most
hideous sight imaginable.

1086
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,569
No.

1087
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:10,576
[Evilia screams in agony]

1088
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:27,467
[sweet music]

1089
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:43,859
You've helped save
an entire Kingdom.

1090
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:46,737
And yet you seem so sad.

1091
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,615
What's troubling you,
young friend?

1092
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:54,369
I guess I just never thought
about staying here forever.

1093
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:57,414
I always thought
I'd get back home.

1094
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,921
And you really
want to go home?

1095
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:07,216
Yes. I mean not that
I don't like it here.

1096
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,760
You've all been so nice to me.

1097
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,803
Except Evilia, of course.

1098
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:14,681
But I miss my mom.

1099
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,059
I'm sure she misses me, too.

1100
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,021
And home you
shall go Brandon.

1101
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:24,483
But how? I thought you couldn't
get me home without the key.

1102
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,528
I can't.

1103
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:30,489
I don't understand.

1104
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,785
The key you seek,
is in your heart.

1105
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:39,206
The power to return home
as been yours all along.

1106
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:42,292
All you had to do,

1107
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:44,962
is believe in yourself.

1108
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:09,027
Are you certain
you don't want to stay?

1109
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:10,612
I'll make you my
Sergeant at Arms.

1110
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,739
You'll have all
the riches you desire.

1111
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:17,035
Thank you King Arthur,
but now I have to go home.

1112
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:24,334
[sentimental music]

1113
01:16:25,294 --> 01:16:27,004
You'll always be me mate.

1114
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,381
I'll never forget you, Brandon.

1115
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:32,634
[Pouch sniffs]

1116
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,516
I'll miss you, small friend.

1117
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,207
[sentimental music continues]

1118
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,896
-[dog barks]
- All right, I'm home! Mom!

1119
01:17:27,856 --> 01:17:29,358
Mom!

1120
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,736
- Mom!
- Oh my god.

1121
01:17:33,028 --> 01:17:37,533
- Brandon, thank God. My baby!
-[Cathy cries]

1122
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:41,537
So I went into the
attic and land in Storyland,

1123
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,456
where I had to defeat queen
of Elia and her pet snake.

1124
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:47,042
So I could get the sword
back to the prince,

1125
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,669
because I was the one.

1126
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,213
Woody the woodsman,
Pouch the kangaroo

1127
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:53,674
and Hoot the owl
helped me get back.

1128
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,717
-[dog barks]
- And Leo.

1129
01:17:58,095 --> 01:17:59,096
Sweetheart.

1130
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:01,974
I'm so glad
to have you home.

1131
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:04,768
I warned you
about that attic.

1132
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:06,728
Sorry I broke my promise to you

1133
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,772
about going in there
Uncle Monty.

1134
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:12,943
Well, I'm pleased to have
you back in one piece.

1135
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,697
Brandon, listen to me.

1136
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:20,617
I know this has been a
really difficult time for you.

1137
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,704
But honey, you cannot
make up stories.

1138
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:26,456
You have to tell
me where you really were.

1139
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,711
When you're ready to.

1140
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:33,422
Mom I'm telling the truth.

1141
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:39,803
Catherine, these things do have
a way of working themselves out.

1142
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,808
Brandon, sweetheart
your story is impossible.

1143
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:47,769
I'm sure
there is some logical...

1144
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:50,772
Nothing's impossible
if you believe.

1145
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:52,816
You have to believe.

1146
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,862
[doorbell rings]

1147
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,947
You're expecting anybody?

1148
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:02,159
No. I'm gonna go see who it is.

1149
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,163
Maybe it's Santa Claus.

1150
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,082
[sweet sentimental music]

1151
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,215
Oh my God.

1152
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:23,722
Merry Christmas.

1153
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:26,558
Catherine.

1154
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:29,520
Oh my God.

1155
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:36,276
[Catherine crying]

1156
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:50,499
Dad?

1157
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:53,585
- Dad?
- Brandon.

1158
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:55,128
Dad!

1159
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:00,592
[sentimental music continues]

1160
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,303
[Brandon] I love you so much.

1161
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:12,980
I knew you'd come back.
I knew you'd come back.

1162
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,108
I came back.

1163
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:34,293
[sentimental music continues]

1164
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,339
-[Catherine laughs]
-[Dad] Merry Christmas.
