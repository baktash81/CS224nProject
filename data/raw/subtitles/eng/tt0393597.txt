1
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,869
Of all the planets in our universe,

2
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:48,349
there is only one we know can support life.

3
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:53,385
just the right distance from its sun
with a perfect climate.

4
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:57,424
lt's been called the lucky planet.

5
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:07,148
About five billion years ago,
a huge asteroid crashed into Earth

6
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:12,221
tilting it at an angle
of exactly 23 and a half degrees to the sun.

7
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:19,025
This cataclysmic accident
turned out to be nothing short of a miracle.

8
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,867
Without that crucial tilt,

9
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,904
everything would have been different.

10
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:32,743
For it created the seasons,
the extremes of climate, hot and cold,

11
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,785
and landscapes of spectacular beauty.

12
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:52,786
The perfect conditions for life on Earth.

13
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:21,984
All life on Earth is built on chance
and powered by the sun.

14
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:26,350
But the delicate balances of our world
are faltering,

15
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:30,068
as the planet struggles to support
our growing demands.

16
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:36,227
This is the time to take stock of what we have
and what we stand to lose.

17
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,264
We follow a year on Earth,

18
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:44,067
joining our fellow creatures
as they battle to raise their young

19
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,911
in a world that is rapidly changing.

20
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,665
January, the high Arctic,

21
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,546
and there has been no sun
for over a month.

22
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:16,863
At this time of year, it's permanent night.

23
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:30,709
Male polar bears are on winter patrol,
but there is little to eat.

24
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,152
(Bear grunting)

25
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,585
Every living thing is just waiting.

26
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,465
February,

27
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:21,301
and the sun makes its first appearance
over the horizon.

28
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,986
This female bear has been underground
in her den the whole winter.

29
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,544
She toboggans down the slope.

30
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,953
Perhaps it's just to clean her fur,

31
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,382
but it looks like sheer joy.

32
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,064
She hasn't been alone down there.

33
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,911
Her cubs were born underground.

34
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,232
(Mewling)

35
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,027
They're two months old,

36
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:22,463
but this is the very first time
they've seen the light of day.

37
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,707
(Mewling)

38
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:26,108
(Soft grunts)

39
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,502
(Mewling)

40
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,628
They're drawn to their mother's calls,

41
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:39,592
but these slopes are not the easiest place
to take your first steps.

42
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:40,622
(Mewling)

43
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:26,465
The cubs haven't been fed this morning.

44
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:30,108
The mother has delayed their first meal
on this special day.

45
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,547
Hunger will draw them to her.

46
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,982
lt's the beginning of their training.

47
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,787
Milk is the only food the cubs have known

48
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:11,111
since they were born deaf and blind
beneath the snow.

49
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,987
The mother hasn't eaten for five months,

50
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,422
and has lost half her body weight.

51
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,470
She's giving the last of her reserves
to her cubs.

52
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,152
She can't leave yet in search of food.

53
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:31,550
She's trapped on these slopes
until the cubs find their feet.

54
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,748
lt's a trial female bears have always endured.

55
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:46,993
Every year at this time,
female bears need food desperately.

56
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:51,072
They know they must get down
to their hunting grounds on the ice.

57
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:56,665
What they can't know, is there's a problem
waiting for them there.

58
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,112
A new problem.

59
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:04,382
our planet is warming and the sea ice
is melting earlier every year.

60
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:07,709
This is the only place
the bears can hunt for seals.

61
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,029
lf they don't make it there
before the ice breaks up,

62
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,462
their families will starve.

63
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,870
So far this year, the ice holds firm,

64
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:26,828
firm enough to support the male polar bear,
the father of the cubs,

65
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,182
as he searches for his prey.

66
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,624
He won't help the female.

67
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:35,983
lnstinct makes him fend for himself alone.

68
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,666
Ten days later,

69
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:57,752
and the starving mother is trying to lead
her young down to the sea ice.

70
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,784
They've found their feet now,

71
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,462
but they still don't share
her sense of urgency.

72
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:08,667
(Soft barks)

73
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:11,787
(Mewling)

74
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:33,782
(Mewling)

75
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:01,711
At last,
everyone seems ready for the journey,

76
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:05,022
but it may already be too late.

77
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,984
(Cracking sounds)

78
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:20,784
A few miles from the coast,
the ice is already breaking unp.

79
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:55,545
She is leading them into
an increasingly dangerous new world.

80
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:01,826
lt's unlikely both of her cubs will survive
their first year out on the ice.

81
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,184
(Cracking sounds)

82
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,344
(Cracking sounds)

83
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,507
March, and munch of the north
remains snow-bound.

84
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,581
A thousand miles south of the bears,

85
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:31,750
stunted conifers are still locked in ice.

86
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:38,225
They mark the tree line of our planet
and the start of the Taiga Forest.

87
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:44,269
This vast belt of trees forms an almost unbroken
circle around the north of the globe.

88
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:47,464
lt's one of the last great wildernesses.

89
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,069
These conifers have needle-shaped leaves -

90
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,910
virtually inedible -

91
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:03,390
so the forest supports very little animal life.

92
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:15,148
ln this silent world,
the snow is rarely marred by footprints,

93
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:21,029
and those who do live here
are so hard to glimpse, they're like spirits.

94
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:40,463
The lynx roams hundreds of miles
in search of prey.

95
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:43,983
lt may never visit
the same patch of forest twice.

96
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:57,186
This creature
is the very essence of wilderness.

97
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:13,066
There are as many trees here
as in all the world's rain forests combined -

98
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:20,031
one third of all the trees on Earth.

99
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:29,146
As spring creeps up from the south,
the Taiga is unveiled.

100
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:33,463
lt's now that this forest
produces so munch oxygen

101
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:38,109
that it refreshes the atmosphere
of the entire planet.

102
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,106
April,
and life starts returning to the far north.

103
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:09,468
Visitors flock to this haven
from all over our planet.

104
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:13,631
They've come to make the most
of the brief flush of spring food

105
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,664
and to have their young.

106
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,808
ln this changing world

107
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,691
every new generation is precious.

108
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,777
(Playful growling)

109
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,848
Caribou travel north following the form -

110
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,972
more than three million
in vast herds crossing the tundra.

111
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,696
Some herds travel
more than two thousand miles every year

112
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,729
in search of fresh pasture.

113
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,770
lt's the longest
overland migration on Earth,

114
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:37,811
totally dependant on vast open spaces.

115
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,687
They are constantly on the move.

116
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,535
lf newborn calves are to keep up,

117
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,253
they must be on their feet and running
the day they're born.

118
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:23,536
but these vast herds don't travel alone.

119
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:33,332
Wolves shadow them all along the way...
and they're hungry.

120
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,049
At first, the attack seems casual, random,

121
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:10,410
but this running of the herd
is a tactic to generate panic.

122
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:18,129
ln the chaos, the young can be separated
from their mothers.

123
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:32,055
Now it's easier to target an individual calf.

124
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:46,173
The calf may be young
but it's capable of outrunning the wolf,

125
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,209
if it manages to keep its footing.

126
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,654
By this stage, the odds are even.

127
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,973
Either the caribou will make a mistake,

128
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,896
or after a mile or so, the wolf will give unp.

129
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:56,568
April in the Arctic,
and already the sun never sets.

130
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:07,847
but further south, the sun works its magic
in more gradual familiar ways.

131
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:20,690
(Birdsong)

132
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,457
(Birdsong)

133
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,258
These are the forests that we know well.

134
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:14,734
The broadleaf woodlands
of Europe and North America.

135
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:20,455
More than any other, these have been
crowded out by towns and farmland.

136
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,489
Only fragments remain.

137
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,130
(Birdsong)

138
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:37,171
Summers are longer here
and deciduous trees can flourish.

139
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:40,130
They're far more edible than conifers,

140
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:43,727
so these forests bustle with life.

141
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:53,291
Spring has also come early
for the mandarin ducks.

142
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:58,051
The female is leaving her nest
high in the treetops.

143
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:00,168
lt's her job to lead the way.

144
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,488
lt's a long way down for a maiden flight.

145
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:09,527
(Quacks)

146
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,052
A few calls of encouragement
are needed here.

147
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,649
There are still two missing.

148
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:33,574
Only two days old and already
one great adventure behind them.

149
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:38,856
What will the rest of the year hold
for our planet's latest recruits?

150
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:08,006
This is the legacy we've inherited,

151
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:12,848
thanks to that all-important tilt
of the Earth's axis -

152
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:14,889
the rhythm of the seasons.

153
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:44,096
The transformations of our world
year on year,

154
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:01,131
a seasonal cycle
that seems increasingly unreliable.

155
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:14,729
but there are parts of our world
that have no seasons.

156
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:40,332
May, in the tropics,
but there is no spring.

157
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:46,412
Here the sun shines for 1 2 hours a day
every day of the year.

158
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,609
This is what allows the jungle
to grow unchecked

159
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:52,218
and support so munch life.

160
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:01,937
Rainforest now covers a third of the area
it once did -

161
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,936
a mere 3% of our planet's surface -

162
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:10,655
and yet, it contains more than half
of all the plants and animals on Earth.

163
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:12,848
(Bird and animal calls)

164
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,133
(Bird and animal calls)

165
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:13,734
The rain forests of New Guinea
are especially precious -

166
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:18,090
home to 42 different kinds
of birds of paradise,

167
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:20,732
each more extraordinary than the last.

168
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:28,498
(Cawing)

169
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,255
(Squeaking echoes)

170
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:51,613
(Cawing)

171
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,368
(Cawing)

172
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:05,096
This is a particularly rich forest,

173
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:09,529
so the six-plumed bird of paradise
has no problem finding food.

174
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:12,729
He can concentrate
on more important tasks,

175
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,814
like tidying up his display area.

176
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:18,048
He's obsessed with housework.

177
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:21,053
Everything has to be spick and span.

178
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,248
Finally, the stage is set.

179
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,687
lt's a virtuoso performance.

180
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:01,650
Unfortunately, no-one was watching.

181
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,689
(Cawing)

182
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,812
This contender is called
the superb bird of paradise.

183
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:12,530
This magician has a special trick.

184
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:15,331
First, he advertises his show,

185
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:17,573
calling to attract a female.

186
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,290
With the audience in place,

187
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:22,976
the show can begin.

188
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:40,457
She just has to have been impressed
with that.

189
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:43,808
She retires a little way off
to consider her verdict.

190
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:48,930
After all that effort,
can she still have doubts?

191
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:56,733
You can't help feeling deflated
when even your best wasn't good enough.

192
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:07,448
3% of our planet,
50% of its plants and animals -

193
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:11,173
nowhere is there more at stake.

194
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:19,130
These tropical forests
enjoy 1 2 hours of sunshine all year round,

195
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:22,136
but they also need lots of rainfall.

196
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:30,488
As weather patterns change,
there are already signs

197
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,813
that these forests are starting to dry.

198
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:15,135
(Howling wind)

199
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:36,527
Deserts cover one third of the land's surface
on Planet Earth,

200
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:39,570
and they're getting bigger every year.

201
00:31:14,098 --> 00:31:17,249
This is a land where only few can survive -

202
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:19,971
only a special few -

203
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,776
and the challenges
are becoming greater than ever.

204
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:46,088
June in the Kalahari Desert
of Southern Africa.

205
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,857
(Trumpeting)

206
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,449
lt's the dry season here,

207
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:59,969
and thousands of elephants have started
the desperate trek for food and water.

208
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:23,770
Using ancient route-ways
handed down through the generations,

209
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:28,767
all are making their way to the Okavango,

210
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:31,810
a vast inland delta in the heart of the desert.

211
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:37,289
At the moment it is dry,
but water should come.

212
00:32:42,258 --> 00:32:44,977
Buffalo join the great trek.

213
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:49,170
All across Southern Africa,
millions of animals are on the move,

214
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:53,177
on the same life or death quest for water.

215
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,855
This tiny calf struggles to keep unp.

216
00:33:24,578 --> 00:33:26,773
lts mother's instinct is to care for it,

217
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:29,855
but her need for water is so desperate,

218
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:32,617
she may be forced to leave it behind.

219
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:55,807
Dust storms make the going tough
all the way.

220
00:33:59,898 --> 00:34:01,126
(Trumpeting)

221
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,130
They've become separated from the herd.

222
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:07,817
This is a dangerous place to lose your way.

223
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:30,891
There's sanctuary a few miles ahead -
a small patch of woodland.

224
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:33,611
They daren't rest until they reach it.

225
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:48,812
The rest of the herd have escaped the storm,

226
00:34:48,858 --> 00:34:52,214
but they would all be at risk
if they waited for the mother and the calf.

227
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:07,489
Finally, the stragglers emerge from the dust.

228
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:20,853
Blinded by sand,
the calf barely has the strength to go on.

229
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,729
The storm has died down.

230
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:58,128
but not all the animals have been so lucky.

231
00:35:58,178 --> 00:36:00,533
One youngster got lost.

232
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:10,294
Thirsty and exhausted, it follows the tracks
of its mother, but in the wrong direction.

233
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:31,929
Where dust meets water,
the march of the deserts is halted.

234
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:40,368
Sand dunes give way
to prairies and savannah.

235
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:45,166
Grass is a great unsung hero of our planet.

236
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:51,168
lt keeps deserts in check
and fuels many of Earth's great spectacles.

237
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:25,535
The great game herds of East Africa
all rely on this one miraculous plant.

238
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:02,247
Every day on wide open plains
the world over,

239
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:05,529
a timeless ritual plays itself out -

240
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:08,809
the drama of hunter and hunted.

241
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:54,137
This is the circle of life that most of us,
in our urban lives, have lost touch with.

242
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,536
The elephants have been marching now
for two weeks.

243
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:59,967
The little calf and its mother
have caught up with their herd,

244
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:02,213
but they're desperately thirsty now.

245
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:15,138
Perhaps spurred on
by a memory from the past,

246
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:18,966
the matriarch leads the herd
to a temporary water hole -

247
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,408
one that may have saved her life years ago.

248
00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:14,454
The elephants have to share the water
with others.

249
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,331
These are uneasy alliances.

250
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,646
(Growls)

251
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:29,727
(Trumpeting)

252
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:30,767
(Growling)

253
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:38,368
By day,
the elephants dominate the water hole.

254
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,497
(Thunder)

255
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:50,173
ln the night time,
the balance of power shifts.

256
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:55,052
(Trumpeting)

257
00:42:58,258 --> 00:43:00,169
The calf and its mother are most at risk.

258
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:03,777
They're closer to the lions
than they can know.

259
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:11,850
(Elephant growls)

260
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:16,527
ln the darkness, an elephant's vision
is little better than our own.

261
00:43:19,218 --> 00:43:21,812
Lions can see easily.

262
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:28,616
(Elephant growls)

263
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:30,171
(Lions growl)

264
00:43:32,298 --> 00:43:33,617
(Trumpets)

265
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:36,853
The cats are ravenously hungry

266
00:43:36,898 --> 00:43:39,207
and the elephants sense the danger.

267
00:43:42,978 --> 00:43:44,093
(Elephant growls)

268
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:47,092
(Trumpeting)

269
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:51,967
(Elephant growls)

270
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:54,009
The lions bide their time.

271
00:44:02,978 --> 00:44:05,412
lt's the calves they're after.

272
00:44:15,898 --> 00:44:17,297
(Elephant growls)

273
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:31,496
(Squealing and growling)

274
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,617
(Lions growling)

275
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:42,367
As the lions rally, the elephants
herd their young together,

276
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:46,172
forming a protective circle
to keep them away from the predators.

277
00:44:59,178 --> 00:45:03,490
The cats have to find an opening
in this defensive wall of hide.

278
00:45:08,418 --> 00:45:10,056
(Elephants growl)

279
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:20,052
(Lion growls)

280

(All lions growling)

284
00:45:58,218 --> 00:46:00,288
The calves are too well protected.

285
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:04,570
The lions will have to take a risk,
change their tactics.

286
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:11,330
Normally, a solitary lion would stand no chance
against this elephant,

287
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:14,814
but the whole pride is here -
30 of them -

288
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,418
and they're specialist elephant hunters.

289
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:21,568
(Elephant growls)

290
00:46:27,658 --> 00:46:29,250
(Elephant growls)

291
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:43,410
(Elephant squeals)

292
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:50,457
(Thunderclap )

293
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:08,133
For the survivors, the Okavango Delta
is still many miles away.

294
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:27,294
As the deserts grow, and traditional migration
routes are blocked by farms and fences,

295
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:30,410
elephants must trek
ever greater distances.

296
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:46,254
The sun that scorches the desert
also brings water to the land.

297
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:49,772
As it beats down on tropical seas,

298
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:55,097
moisture rises from the warming oceans
powering our global weather system.

299
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:46,847
Moist winds from the Indian oceans
sweep north towards the Himalayas.

300
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:54,366
As the air rises, so it cools
and the water falls as snow.

301
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:12,697
The scene is set for one of natures
most challenging migrations.

302
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:22,453
Each year, thousands of demoiselle cranes
try to escape the harsh winters in Mongolia,

303
00:49:22,498 --> 00:49:26,286
by flying south to the warmer climes of lndia.

304
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:37,974
To get there, they have to cross
the highest mountain range on Earth,

305
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:40,570
the Himalayas.

306
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:58,372
As the sun heats these great slopes,
warm air rises from the valleys,

307
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:02,206
turning, by late morning, to ferocious winds.

308
00:50:15,738 --> 00:50:18,332
The cranes hit violent turbulence.

309
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:26,017
They'll have to turn back
or risk certain death.

310
00:50:58,178 --> 00:51:03,127
The sun's rays weaken in the afternoon
and the turbulence falls away,

311
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:05,214
but it's too late for today.

312
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:39,538
A new day, a new chance.

313
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:44,053
The adults must guide their young
on this hazardous trip.

314
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:55,529
lt's early morning
and the warm air is already rising fast.

315
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:58,854
They use the thermals to gain height.

316
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:12,457
Soon it'll get stormy again,
maybe too stormy to go on.

317
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:37,897
ln the final ascent, every wing beat is a
desperate battle against the freezing winds.

318
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:10,772
At last, they've made it. They've conquered
the highest peaks on Earth.

319
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:16,410
On the other side
there's sanctuary for the winter.

320
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:40,335
The sun melts the snow
and the waters go on their way again -

321
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:44,535
the start of their long journey
back to the oceans.

322
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:46,972
This is the great unending cycle.

323
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:52,456
sunlight and fresh water bringing life
to every corner of Planet Earth.

324
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:24,333
For generations,
humans and animals alike

325
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:29,133
come to depend on the great rivers
and their seemingly endless flow.

326
00:56:41,138 --> 00:56:45,689
After months of drought,
the rivers begin to flow again in the Kalahari.

327
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:49,208
The buffalo reach the end
of their long journey.

328
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:58,772
As the water sweeps through desert lands,

329
00:56:58,818 --> 00:57:03,255
the Okavango is transformed
into a fertile paradise.

330
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:28,051
This is an Africa we rarely see -

331
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:33,297
a lush water world
totally reliant on a seasonal flood,

332
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:38,093
originating from a tropical ocean
thousands of miles away.

333
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:00,246
Many animals
are quite at home in the flood,

334
00:58:00,298 --> 00:58:03,927
but there are some
more apprehensive bathers.

335
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,812
(Grumbling)

336
00:58:15,418 --> 00:58:16,897
(Squeaking)

337
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:25,687
(Grunts)

338
00:58:30,218 --> 00:58:31,207
(Grunts)

339
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:38,927
(Squeaks)

340
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:42,847
(Squeaks)

341
00:59:15,338 --> 00:59:19,650
After weeks of marching,
the elephants are exhausted.

342
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:23,491
They struggle to stay focussed
on the road ahead.

343
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:34,656
(Soft growls)

344
00:59:34,698 --> 00:59:36,097
(Calf squeaks)

345
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,167
The matriarch can smell the water,

346
00:59:43,218 --> 00:59:46,813
and encourages the herd
to make one last effort.

347
00:59:48,738 --> 00:59:49,932
(Calf squeals)

348
01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:19,894
After so many weeks,

349
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:23,055
many hundreds of miles,

350
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:24,895
they've arrived.

351
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:27,297
(Trumpeting)

352
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,055
(Trumpeting)

353
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:54,617
(Trumpeting)

354
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:12,697
(Trumpeting)

355
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:25,527
(Soft growls)

356
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:35,296
Like the elephants, these waters
have travelled great distances to reach here.

357
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:42,010
And all along the way, their flow is threatened
by extraction for towns and farmland.

358
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:47,375
ln its long life,
the calf will make this journey many times.

359
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:53,414
Whether the flood will always arrive
is far from certain.

360
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:15,731
The seasonal cycle
that drives the lives of elephants on land,

361
01:02:15,778 --> 01:02:19,134
is just as important in the oceans.

362
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,649
(Whale song)

363
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:11,336
lt's July and the humpback whales
are in their breeding grounds in the tropics.

364
01:03:30,938 --> 01:03:33,736
This calf is no more than a few weeks old

365
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:35,848
and as he begins to tire,

366
01:03:35,898 --> 01:03:40,289
his mother supports him close to the surface,
so that he can breathe.

367
01:03:59,778 --> 01:04:03,327
These shallow equatorial waters
make good nurseries -

368
01:04:03,378 --> 01:04:07,166
they're warm and calm
and there are few predators.

369
01:04:21,698 --> 01:04:26,897
The playful calf
is now drinking 600 litres of milk a day,

370
01:04:26,938 --> 01:04:28,929
but its mother is starving.

371
01:04:28,978 --> 01:04:32,687
There's nothing for her to eat
in these crystal clear waters.

372
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:59,374
To find food, she will have to lead her calf
on an epic 4,000-mile journey

373
01:04:59,418 --> 01:05:04,173
to richer feeding grounds
at the southern extremes of our planet.

374
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:12,247
This is the longest migration
by any marine mammal,

375
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:17,053
and it depends entirely
on a healthy ocean all along the way.

376
01:05:46,178 --> 01:05:50,490
out in the open ocean,
the whales meet others searching for food.

377
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,926
Dolphins are closing in on their prey.

378
01:06:12,498 --> 01:06:15,092
A hundred sailfish join in the attack.

379
01:06:18,898 --> 01:06:23,335
Reaching almost 70 miles an hour,
they are the cheetahs of the sea.

380
01:07:07,538 --> 01:07:12,054
Mother and calf swim on south
through the vast open oceans.

381
01:07:12,098 --> 01:07:14,009
They have to cross half the globe,

382
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:18,131
from the equator all the way
to the edge of Antarctica.

383
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:29,776
The tropical seas
are a long way behind them now.

384
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:32,696
They're heading for stormy seasonal waters.

385
01:07:33,898 --> 01:07:38,494
Strong winds and currents
draw nutrients up from the depths

386
01:07:38,538 --> 01:07:42,577
and life blooms
wherever the sun's rays can penetrate.

387
01:08:29,578 --> 01:08:33,287
The mother knows there are
even richer feeding grounds further south,

388
01:08:33,338 --> 01:08:37,217
and hurries her calf
through these dangerous waters.

389
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:55,289
The great white shark.

390
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,933
Great whites attack whale calves,

391
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,168
but they're not the victims today.

392
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:24,174
These magnificent predators,
at the very top of the food chain,

393
01:10:24,218 --> 01:10:27,290
are a vital part of a healthy ocean...

394
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:32,576
and yet we slaughter
almost a hundred million of them every year.

395
01:10:34,138 --> 01:10:36,732
Their populations are in freefall.

396
01:11:05,818 --> 01:11:07,410
(Creaking)

397
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:22,088
August in the Arctic
and the ice is vanishing fast.

398
01:11:23,138 --> 01:11:26,175
The two cubs cannot cope
with the shifting platform

399
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:29,733
and their hungry mother
is forced to lead them back to shore.

400
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:36,297
(Soft growls)

401
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:47,817
out to sea, the ice is now too thin
to support the cubs' father.

402
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:13,851
Glacial melt waters pour from the land,
mix with the sea, and speed up the thaw.

403
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:29,653
Each year, as the climate warms,
there is less and less ice in the Arctic.

404
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:33,536
This is a disaster for polar bears.

405
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:38,698
Without a solid platform, they struggle
to hunt the seals they need to survive.

406
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:50,933
(Growls)

407
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:56,727
(Growls)

408
01:13:13,578 --> 01:13:18,129
How will the father make it through the year
now that the ice is almost gone?

409
01:13:25,018 --> 01:13:28,977
September and the whales
are 3,000 miles from the equator.

410
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:32,408
The waters are getting colder and rougher.

411
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:35,648
Mother and calf must stay close.

412
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:48,975
So as not to lose track of each other,
they slap their fins on the surface.

413
01:13:49,018 --> 01:13:53,057
They can hear these sound signals
above the roar of the ocean.

414
01:14:30,658 --> 01:14:33,297
The far south...at last.

415
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:55,810
October,
and the whales are entering polar waters.

416
01:14:55,858 --> 01:15:01,091
Summer is drawing to a close in the north,
but here it is only just beginning.

417
01:15:12,938 --> 01:15:17,056
As the sun melts the ice, life returns.

418
01:15:29,978 --> 01:15:35,450
The whales have finally reached Antarctica
in time for the summer.

419
01:15:40,018 --> 01:15:41,815
Adelie penguins...

420
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:45,895
and they're in a hurry
to reach their nesting grounds.

421
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:16,531
December and the sun does not set.

422
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,496
The Antarctic summer is all too short,

423
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:29,851
but for a few brief months
its warmth unlocks sheltered bays.

424
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:48,056
ln the depths, something stirs.

425
01:17:15,218 --> 01:17:21,327
At last, after their 4,000-mile journey,
the humpback whales can feed.

426
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:36,447
They harvest krill, shrimps that begin
to swarm here as soon as the ice retreats.

427
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:54,214
Now, at last,
the mother can replenish her reserves

428
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:57,967
as she and her calf
join the rest of the team.

429
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:07,248
The whales create
a spiralling net of bubbles,

430
01:18:07,298 --> 01:18:10,973
concentrating the krill
into one gigantic feast.

431
01:18:22,138 --> 01:18:25,289
They work round the clock,
for the boom will be short-lived.

432
01:18:25,338 --> 01:18:30,856
Summer is fading fast and they'll soon
have to return to tropical waters.

433
01:18:36,498 --> 01:18:42,334
These whales, and most of the life in Antarctica,
ultimately depend on krill.

434
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:47,377
Without it,
the far south would be almost deserted.

435
01:18:48,658 --> 01:18:53,493
but krill depend on ice
and ice is in decline.

436
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,133
Winter in Antarctica

437
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:09,534
and the greatest seasonal change
on our planet is underway.

438
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:30,727
The sun begins to retreat.

439
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:36,531
Soon the continent
will be plunged back into darkness.

440
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:50,457
The Aurora Australia
illuminates the southern skies,

441
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:56,209
but these spectacular lights
bring no warmth to the wilderness of ice.

442
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:36,007
Back in the north of the planet,
where our story began,

443
01:20:36,058 --> 01:20:39,494
the sea ice has completely disappeared.

444
01:20:55,658 --> 01:20:58,218
our male polar bear is in great danger now.

445
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:04,489
lf he doesn't find land soon in this vast ocean,
he will drown.

446
01:21:29,738 --> 01:21:31,729
(Grunts and growls)

447
01:21:52,098 --> 01:21:53,975
After many days at sea,

448
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:59,012
the exhausted bear is drawn
by the pungent smells of the colony.

449
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:12,012
He has lost half his body weight.

450
01:22:12,058 --> 01:22:14,333
He's desperate for food,

451
01:22:14,378 --> 01:22:17,734
but walrus are munch larger
than his unseal prey.

452
01:22:23,498 --> 01:22:25,489
lt's the pups he'll have to get to.

453
01:22:25,538 --> 01:22:30,089
The powerful adults can do terrible damage
with their huge tusks.

454
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:36,289
(Grunting and growling)

455
01:23:08,658 --> 01:23:10,774
The walrus sense the danger.

456
01:23:11,858 --> 01:23:14,167
The adults close ranks around their young.

457
01:23:17,218 --> 01:23:18,890
He tests the barrier.

458
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,851
lt stands firm.

459
01:23:27,258 --> 01:23:29,726
He may be the world's biggest land carnivore,

460
01:23:29,778 --> 01:23:34,647
but it looks like he's met his match
and he's badly weakened by starvation.

461
01:23:43,058 --> 01:23:45,333
A pup hides behind its mother.

462
01:23:48,498 --> 01:23:50,728
lf he can just prize her off.

463
01:24:13,658 --> 01:24:16,013
With the herd retreating
to the safety of the water,

464
01:24:16,058 --> 01:24:17,969
the bear has little time left.

465
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:22,166
He tries again.

466
01:24:22,218 --> 01:24:23,412
(Growling)

467
01:24:24,738 --> 01:24:26,535
(Walrus growls)

468
01:24:34,098 --> 01:24:36,817
And again,
in sheer frustration now.

469
01:25:06,778 --> 01:25:10,293
He has to avoid the lethal tusks
at all costs.

470
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,737
(Walrus growls)

471
01:25:13,258 --> 01:25:14,657
(Howls)

472
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:38,488
lt slips from his grasp.

473
01:25:54,698 --> 01:25:57,656
lt's only when bears
are on the verge of starvation

474
01:25:57,698 --> 01:26:00,929
that they'll risk attacking
such dangerous prey.

475
01:26:11,778 --> 01:26:12,767
(Grunts)

476
01:26:12,818 --> 01:26:15,173
This one took the gamble...and lost.

477
01:26:32,978 --> 01:26:34,969
The walrus are calm again.

478
01:26:36,178 --> 01:26:38,169
The bear is no longer a threat.

479
01:26:41,778 --> 01:26:45,612
Unable to feed, he can't survive.

480
01:27:00,738 --> 01:27:03,616
As the global climate continues to warm,

481
01:27:03,658 --> 01:27:07,014
and the arctic ice melts sooner every year,

482
01:27:07,058 --> 01:27:10,448
more of his kind will come to this sad end.

483
01:27:33,698 --> 01:27:38,010
A year has passed
and the two bear cubs have beaten the odds.

484
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:47,815
They've left their mother...and are thriving.

485
01:28:17,738 --> 01:28:21,936
Their ever-shifting world
is changing faster by the day,

486
01:28:21,978 --> 01:28:25,607
but for now,
they're keeping one step ahead.

487
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:32,011
Their father's adventurous spirit lives on
in these magnificent youngsters -

488
01:28:33,098 --> 01:28:37,614
the next generation
and proof of the resilience of life.

489
01:29:07,298 --> 01:29:11,769
The polar bear has become an emblem
for the state of our planet

490
01:29:11,818 --> 01:29:15,493
and for all the creatures
who are struggling to live alongside uns.

491
01:29:47,898 --> 01:29:50,458
Finally, we've begun to understand

492
01:29:50,498 --> 01:29:55,652
how precarious is the state
of our once lucky planet.

493
01:29:57,378 --> 01:30:02,168
lf we are to go on sharing Earth
with such a rich variety of life,

494
01:30:02,218 --> 01:30:06,370
and preserve its fragile balance
for our own children,

495
01:30:06,418 --> 01:30:08,409
now, more than ever...

496
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:11,529
it is in our hands.
