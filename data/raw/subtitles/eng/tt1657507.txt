1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,310
- I can't believe this.
- Why not?

2
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:32,319
Because I love you, Fabio, like a son.

3
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,737
And I love you, Don Luis, like a father.

4
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,890
I'm going to miss you.

5
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:43,240
And I'm going to miss you.

6
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,354
Okay,

7
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,242
enough of this sentimental bullshit.

8
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:51,761
One last drink?
Next, we'll be crying like two old women!

9
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,496
Come on.

10
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,278
To the future.

11
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,917
Good health and life!

12
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,363
So, business is all clear?

13
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,887
It's all here.

14
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:19,601
- No other copies?
- You have to ask? -Hey!

15
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,295
Come on.

16
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:29,997
I'm going to miss you.

17
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,288
Bye, Marco.

18
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,082
Kill this motherfucker.

19
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:53,527
I cannot believe this.

20
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,772
Not okay, boss?

21
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:59,859
The bastard thinks I'm an idiot,
playing it all mellow and shit.

22
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,331
If he would have yelled and screamed
and threatened to kill my whole family...

23
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:03,963
it would've been better.

24
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,420
We have about an hour to get
outta here at the most! Let's go!

25
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,404
We've got ten minutes.

26
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:47,844
- Cataleya, go pack.
- I'm packed Mamma.

27
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,495
Cataleya.

28
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:05,052
Listen to me.
In case anything happens...

29
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:08,502
this is your passport.

30
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:12,433
If you find yourself alone,
you go to this address on this card.

31
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:15,297
Show it to the man at the gate.

32
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:20,114
- I don't understand, Papa.
- You don't have to understand.

33
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:23,920
You just have to listen
and remember.

34
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:30,426
Take the bus and go here.

35
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:39,082
And this... this will keep you safe.

36
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,631
The cataleya orchid.
My mother, your grandmother...

37
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:50,093
used to grow them. Every morning I'd wake
up to the sight of them. The smell of them.

38
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:54,330
That's why I named you 'Cataleya'.

39
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,371
Never forget where you came from.

40
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,508
Hi. We want to see Don Fabio.

41
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,594
He's not home.

42
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,847
- I'm ready.
- It's time! Come! Come!

43
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:25,941
- Let's go!
- Come on.

44
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,724
Back, back, back.

45
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,530
They say he is not home yet.

46
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,149
Wait a minute.

47
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,286
It's too late.
Get ready.

48
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,806
I love you very much.

49
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:01,886
I love you too, Papa.

50
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,058
Do it now.

51
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,818
Change of plans.

52
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:50,459
Do you remember me, Cataleya?

53
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:54,008
I was at your confirmation.

54
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,955
My name is Marco
and I was a very good friend of your father.

55
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:03,221
You know who Don Luis is, right?

56
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:06,417
He was like a father to your father.

57
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:09,289
That makes you family too.

58
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,157
But... when... someone...
is good to you...

59
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:22,083
and you're not good to them back,
then bad things happen.

60
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,638
You do very well in school,

61
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,188
so I know this is not too complicated
for you to understand. Am I Right?

62
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,881
Excellent.

63
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:38,618
Now, your father had something that belonged
to Don Luis. It's a small thing.

64
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,647
Not bigger than this.

65
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,022
Do you know where it is?

66
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,833
Well,

67
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:52,058
if you give it to me, Don Luis will be
very happy and very grateful.

68
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:58,911
So... why don't you just give me that
little thing, which belongs to him.

69
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,554
Would you do that?

70
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:03,906
You're a smart girl.

71
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:10,086
And in this life smart girls
always get what they want.

72
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,120
Just tell me, sweetheart...

73
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,190
What do you want?

74
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:22,261
To kill Don Luis!

75
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,266
Grab that little bitch.

76
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,239
We need her alive.

77
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:56,845
Find her! Find the little bitch.

78
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,100
Do not stop.

79
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,122
Got you.

80
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,695
Excuse me.

81
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:09,292
And you said you...
you have something for us, sweetie?

82
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:14,045
Well, may I see it?

83
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,741
Okay, everybody,
take a five-minute coffee break.

84
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,570
Jim, we're gonna have to record this.

85
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:09,275
- Where did you get this?
- My Papa.

86
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,296
where is your Papa?

87
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:13,333
Dead.

88
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,829
Do you know what this is?

89
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,621
Yes.

90
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,240
My passport.

91
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:28,665
We're about to arrive in Miami.

92
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:31,605
I'll buckle you up.

93
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,479
Welcome to America.

94
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,946
Go ahead, I'll wait right here.

95
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:31,676
Hello, young lady, where are we wanting
to go today?

96
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,718
Chicago? That's not just down the street,
you know?

97
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,465
How much?

98
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:36,031
Hey, kid, what are you doing here?

99
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,926
Emilio.

100
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:08,882
There's a girl looking for you.

101
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,923
It does not matter.

102
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,775
Her name is Cataleya.

103
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:48,725
- Cataleya...
- Tio?

104
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:21,586
I thought you were dead.

105
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,531
You're safe.

106
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:34,171
It's okay.
You're safe now.

107
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,510
You're safe.

108
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:22,224
You have your mother's beautiful eyes.

109
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,724
Don't be afraid.

110
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,827
This is your home.

111
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,609
How long has it been since you sleep?

112
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,654
I don't know. A long time ago.

113
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,617
Well, good.
A young body needs to sleep.

114
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,162
When I was your age,
I would sleep half the day.

115
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,516
I don't know if it helps
with your growing pattern,

116
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:52,394
but I was always ready
for what came after.

117
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,691
Whose room did I sleep in?

118
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,218
My son.

119
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:05,573
Your cousin.

120
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,504
Where is he?

121
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,859
He's dead.

122
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:16,294
Killed?

123
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,535
Yes.

124
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,877
By whom?

125
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,581
No one who is still alive.

126
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,831
You are very talented.

127
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:36,877
- Is this what you want to be, an artist?
- I used to want to be like Xena.

128
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,505
A Warrior Princess.

129
00:21:39,826 --> 00:21:42,250
Not any more?

130
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,717
No?

131
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,077
I want to be a killer.

132
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,494
Can you help?

133
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,665
Sure.

134
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:20,595
Normally we don't accept students
in the middle of the academic year.

135
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:27,505
But under these circumstances,
losing her parents in a tragic car accident.

136
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,437
Here you are. These are...
the school supplies you'll need.

137
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:32,684
Sorry...

138
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,642
She's a little traumatized.

139
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:35,995
Of course.

140
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,303
See you Monday, Cataleya.

141
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,072
Such a pretty name.

142
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,605
Thanks.

143
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:51,481
After we get all this stuff,
we go over to Maxwell Street...

144
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:54,360
to get hot dogs
from those Polish people here.

145
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:55,704
You like hot dog?

146
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:01,629
What is it now?

147
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,322
That school has nothing to teach me.

148
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:07,083
I told you what I want.

149
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,800
You don't want to help me? Fine.

150
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,303
I'll do it myself.

151
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,720
Look.

152
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,370
See that?
Is that what you want?

153
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:35,592
You want me to teach you how to be
a killer? Sure, no problema, I'll teach you.

154
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,896
But you'll be dead in five years.

155
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:45,740
If you want to be a killer and survive,
you got to be a smart one.

156
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,100
You have to know things besides
how to pull a trigger.

157
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:51,240
You have to know how the world works,
how people think...

158
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:53,336
You gotta learn how to stand,
how to be psychological.

159
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:56,789
And I cannot teach you that
unless you learn the basics out of school.

160
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,423
You got that? Hmm?

161
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,636
Come on. What's it going to be?
Cataleya? You choose.

162
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:04,648
Come on.

163
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,564
Now. Choose.

164
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:11,241
What you want? Choose.

165
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,818
Better.

166
00:24:45,131 --> 00:24:47,766
Hey, buddy.
I got the good stuff.

167
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,183
- So, might I suggest...
- Yeah?

168
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,798
Let's buy some things.
You know,

169
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,405
spice it up a bit,
like we talked about.

170
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,310
Some of those stockings...

171
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,128
- that come up to the thigh.
- Right, nice.

172
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,135
It's been fourteen years,
you know what I mean?

173
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,989
No matter how much you like steak...

174
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,605
sometimes a lamb chop
isn't a bad thing, right?

175
00:25:03,606 --> 00:25:05,284
Exactly.

176
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,181
Son of a bitch!

177
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:27,586
- Put your hands on the car!
- Hands on the vehicle, right now!

178
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,966
Oooh, back...

179
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:34,812
- Stupid, crazy bitch.
- I'm really sorry.

180
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:37,594
This is not...
it's not even my car.

181
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:40,607
- You think this is funny?
- No, sir!

182
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:45,152
I'm gonna give you something to laugh about.

183
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:48,927
I'm sorry, officer.
I'm sorry, I don't drink...

184
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,933
There's nothing here.

185
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:17,644
No license, no registration, No ID...

186
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,940
except for a library card.

187
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:24,326
Miss Valerie Philips.

188
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:27,052
In addition to all that,
you are being charged with,

189
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:30,985
D.U.I. driving on the wrong side
of the road and...

190
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,987
the destruction of police property.

191
00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:36,900
Miss Philips!

192
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:39,070
Do I have your full attention?

193
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:44,438
Yeah...
That's it?

194
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:48,164
Unless there's anything else
you can think of?

195
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:52,792
- I have to throw up.
- Oh, no, no, no. Get her out of here.

196
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,143
And a cup of coffee too.
We can book her tomorrow.

197
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:59,645
Let her sleep it off,
for Christ's sake...

198
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:10,629
Alright, big step. Down you come.

199
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:14,535
Alright, stretch those legs. Come on, move!

200
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,635
McGee just checked downstairs.

201
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,850
She's from Rome, okay?
And she says to the other...

202
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:22,668
Excuse me. U.S. Marshall Warren.

203
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,020
We're here with Gennaro Rizzo
on an overnight.

204
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,939
Wait, wait, wait...
hold on a second.

205
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,794
You know, it says here that
you're not expected until tomorrow.

206
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,992
Yeah, well, never expect
the expected, sergeant.

207
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,431
Is that coffee there?
Is that fresh?

208
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:35,313
- Yes, it is.
- Do you mind?

209
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:36,417
My treat.

210
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,068
- Appreciate it.
- You know, uh...

211
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,696
Officer Doyle is gonna show you
where the cell blocks are.

212
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:42,166
Oh, come on.

213
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,228
Home, sweet home.

214
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:52,097
After you, sir.

215
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:02,206
I'm going to miss you, Rizzo.

216
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,910
I gonna leave that just there,
just in case you get hungry in the night.

217
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:09,081
Sleep well.

218
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:12,891
This'll be a caffeine kinda night, Joe.
Keep your eyes open.

219
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,878
Two...

220
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,162
Three...

221
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:53,786
Not again.

222
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,584
Hey, Doyle, go check
on the ventilation system, will you?

223
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,079
As in today, please?

224
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,428
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I gotta pee...?

225
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,822
- Unbutton your shirt... Now.
- What?

226
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:11,152
Who are you?

227
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,318
Go! Come on!

228
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,903
We have a security threat.

229
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:25,034
Come!

230
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:28,398
Get inside.
Somebody open the fucking door!

231
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,512
Look at me, Joe, look at me.
Give me the gun.

232
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:41,271
Just give it to me, OK. It's good.

233
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,480
- Hold on, hold on.
- I didn't do it.

234
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,353
I didn't do it!.

235
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:52,348
- Get him out of here.
- I didn't do it!

236
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:54,993
Call it in. Call it in!

237
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:49,105
Damn.

238
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,699
Check on the other side.

239
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,734
It's clear here.

240
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:37,285
I'm outta here.

241
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,637
Agent Ross.

242
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:59,315
- Where is he?
- He's in the morgue.

243
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,205
Let's go.

244
00:36:07,454 --> 00:36:09,495
This is just how he came in.

245
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:14,393
It's the same handwriting.

246
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:19,668
Same drawing, right?

247
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,740
That's him.

248
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:25,076
I want to see the location, please.

249
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,134
Thank you.

250
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,614
- Oh, I shouldn't drink.
- No, you shouldn't.

251
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,611
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

252
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:37,542
Yeah, you can tell that to the Judge
in ten days' time, at your hearing.

253
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,517
What's going on down there?

254
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,490
Nothing. You can sign this form,
and then you can go.

255
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,582
- Really?
- Yeah, really,

256
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,788
but I'm quite sure
the judge will send you back here.

257
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,031
- I'd probably deserve it.
- Oh, you're just lucky no one got hurt.

258
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,902
Okay, now, back up.

259
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,080
You're gonna have to lock it down.

260
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:10,478
Hey, it was after the fact,
I didn't think anybody would...

261
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:13,938
You gotta do it, okay?
Nobody in, nobody out, please.

262
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:19,656
You heard that man. Lock it down.
Nobody in or nobody out.

263
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:57,351
I wanna see paper, on everybody in
and outta this station in the last 24 hours.

264
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:03,505
And I want the tapes.

265
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:06,138
From all the security cameras.

266
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,935
All of them.

267
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:53,387
- It's all okay?
- We're good.

268
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:55,821
- When you're back?
- The day after tomorrow.

269
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,373
Look, I have something for you.

270
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,236
Give me a day.

271
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:01,291
Okay.

272
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:03,163
We can't wait to see you back.

273
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,890
- Give mama a kiss for me.
- I will.

274
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:16,002
Twenty-two murders in the last four years
all with the same MO.

275
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,559
I think I'm right,
he is sending a message...

276
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,477
but I'm beginning to believe
it's not meant for us.

277
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:22,626
Well, we're the only ones
with that information.

278
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,642
Well, we're not getting anywhere
with it, are we?

279
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,071
Put it out to the press.
It's time.

280
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:30,200
The word, this lipstick drawing,

281
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:35,571
I want it splashed over every newspaper,
every magazine, front page, national.

282
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:36,745
The message ain't meant for us.

283
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,240
Let's make sure it gets
to who it's intended for.

284
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,428
Mr. Richard.

285
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,563
- Marco.
- It's been a long time.

286
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,256
Yes, it has.
How is the hand?

287
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:02,056
It only hurts...
when it's humid.

288
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:05,114
Well, you should've let us relocate you
to Arizona instead of New Orleans.

289
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:08,140
Yeah, right,
but the boss likes it humid.

290
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:09,425
He's waiting for you.

291
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:14,530
What do you think?

292
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,229
Hm?

293
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,675
- Coincidence.
- Twenty-two times?

294
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:21,308
A flower that only grows
in one place on earth?

295
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,497
Couldn't it be the calling card of...
shoot, I forgot his name.

296
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,340
What's his name,
your former partner,

297
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,259
you know, the one who used to do
your wetwork?

298
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:33,809
- Fabio.
- Fabio.

299
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,921
Fabio Restrepo.

300
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:37,186
May I?

301
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:42,393
The CIA is not an amusement park.

302
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:46,567
When the agency extracted your ass
from Colombia 15 years ago...

303
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:50,006
and set you up here, we allowed you
to resume you little business,

304
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:52,403
but what we should've done
was lock you away for life.

305
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:55,928
Now, in exchange,
you should've kept the information flowing.

306
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:57,992
- And I have.
- Not much.

307
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:03,122
- I have nothing to do with this.
- Then find out who did.

308
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,626
She's talking to us.

309
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:21,346
Could be anyone.

310
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:27,030
You idiot. I told you,
everyone dead, down to the dog.

311
00:41:29,243 --> 00:41:30,864
You screwed it up the first time.

312
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,925
Now, go fix it.

313
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:26,921
Each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple.

314
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:29,520
As for motive,
I'm narrowing it down to, uh...

315
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:31,823
payback, but, um...
not much else.

316
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:34,370
My best guess, Alexa Milshinova,

317
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:40,030
she made a career out of getting intimate
with high stake gamblers out of Vegas.

318
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:43,567
She would, uh... rip 'em off and then
send them to meet their maker.

319
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:46,126
Here.
D'Angelo James.

320
00:43:46,511 --> 00:43:49,192
He tried to take over the heroin trade
from Houston

321
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:52,933
From the, uh...
Gemini Cartel.

322
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:56,016
If you do not know, all there is to know
about these twins...

323
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,511
you should not be in this room.

324
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,462
Now you see,

325
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:05,638
he tilts the camera just enough,
so he won't be seen going into the cell.

326
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:08,021
The Time:
1:55 am.

327
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:10,763
That means that our perp
was in that station, that...

328
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:13,711
I don't have to spell it out for you,
do I?

329
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:17,865
Excuse me.
Hand these out, please.

330
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:22,199
These are the names, addresses
and phone numbers of everyone...

331
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,677
with a pulse who was in that station
before 1:55 am.

332
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:30,923
Everyone.
Which means one of them was our target.

333
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:34,724
I want you to locate the ten people
in the folder you've just been handed.

334
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:38,905
I want a detailed dossier on each of them
for the last ten years of their lives.

335
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:42,917
I want you to run down every lead,
we will check every story.

336
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:45,581
'Coz our killer, ladies and gentleman,
is in those folders...

337
00:44:45,678 --> 00:44:48,480
and I mean to catch him
before he kills again.

338
00:45:17,663 --> 00:45:18,782
Don't move.

339
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,003
Hello, Jennifer.

340
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:26,706
Hello, Danny.

341
00:45:38,228 --> 00:45:39,408
You haven't finished painting.

342
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,248
Never really finished painting,
I just stopped working on it.

343
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:44,798
I know something
you're gonna finish.

344
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:55,011
Tell me something.

345
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:58,764
Are we ever gonna go
on a normal date together?

346
00:45:58,765 --> 00:45:59,916
What's a normal date?

347
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:03,586
Well, you know. Go out, have dinner,
drink wine, get drunk.

348
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,176
Hm...
Dessert?

349
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:24,850
- Safe?
- From my end. And you?

350
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:28,053
- Safe.
- How's Mama?

351
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:33,571
- She... is missing you.
- Well, tell her I miss her back.

352
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:36,583
I think
she would love to hear that from you.

353
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:37,543
I know.

354
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:39,678
What do we got?

355
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:46,733
Remember the guy on the news for running
a Ponzi scheme about a year ago?

356
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:47,596
Mh-hm.

357
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:51,069
Made 50 million dollars and vanished
into thin air. Clever guy.

358
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,561
Now he's living in the Caribbean.

359
00:47:52,658 --> 00:47:53,905
- No.
- Mh...

360
00:47:54,001 --> 00:48:00,596
So, he left a lot of people very upset.
Want to give him a break, permanently.

361
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:07,886
There's something else.

362
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:14,644
How long has this been going on?

363
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:23,258
- Not long.
- The newspaper says, 22.

364
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:26,445
- Why?
- You know why.

365
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,791
You think this is going to smoke
Don Luis out? You think he's that stupid?

366
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:32,640
It's not just about you, okay?
Cataleya?

367
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,358
There's me, Mama, and my family.

368
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,223
- Familia?
- Okay.

369
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,470
Tio, please.

370
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:43,598
You're clean. You book the work,
you collect the money...

371
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,550
The problem is,
I watch your back, that's why.

372
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,921
Each and every job,
I make a dollar with, if I give you a job,

373
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:55,128
I turn down five, ten, because
I made a promise to keep you safe.

374
00:48:55,642 --> 00:49:00,174
I'll keep you safe. Cataleya, that is
a full-time job, no matter what you think.

375
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,945
But this is not a professional,
it's not what I do...

376
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:06,420
I don't care, about what's professional
and what's safe. I'm doing this my way.

377
00:49:06,517 --> 00:49:08,440
- That is your way?
- Yeah.

378
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:13,990
A dead killer, is stupid.

379
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:18,747
Please, start listen...

380
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:21,919
I should never have let you do this.

381
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:29,908
You didn't let me do anything.
I chose this, remember? I chose this...

382
00:49:31,286 --> 00:49:33,419
From the first moment
I walked in your door,

383
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,818
- I had already made my decision.
- By yourself?

384
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:36,874
Yes.

385
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:40,901
Not you, or anybody,
are gonna change that.

386
00:49:45,344 --> 00:49:47,399
We love you, Cataleya.

387
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,856
Then watch my back
until it's done.

388
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:09,424
Cataleya.

389
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:12,423
- Excuse me?
- It's an orchid.

390
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,533
- That's what this is?
- Sure does.

391
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,785
- It grows in Colombia.
- How do you know that?

392
00:50:17,786 --> 00:50:19,427
My wife, she's Colombian.

393
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:24,229
- Uh, uh... Cataleya?
- That's right.

394
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:36,535
AMAZON

395
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:40,169
Let's try 'organization'.

396
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:43,239
What's this shit?

397
00:50:50,976 --> 00:50:53,164
Hi, boys.
Did you miss me?

398
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:56,250
I've missed you too.

399
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,868
Hi. Come!

400
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,866
Have you guys been good?
Hm?

401
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:05,399
Alright.
Stay.

402
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:09,632
Sirloin...
Juicy.

403
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,985
Delicious.
Want one?

404
00:51:13,177 --> 00:51:14,078
Good.

405
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:21,991
Eat.

406
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:34,980
I know that song.

407
00:51:35,607 --> 00:51:38,391
- I guess the boys gave me away, huh?
- You spoil them.

408
00:51:38,392 --> 00:51:39,495
I train them.

409
00:52:04,396 --> 00:52:08,744
Fishie, fishie...
Willy, why are they ignoring me?

410
00:52:10,913 --> 00:52:14,380
- What?
- Baby, you put one drop of blood in there,

411
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,463
- and they'll be your biggest admirers.
- Really?

412
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,312
Oh yeah, baby. All the way down
to your clean, stripped bones.

413
00:52:22,697 --> 00:52:24,315
Cool...

414
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:32,496
Alejandro, you bring in
extra security for tonight.

415
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:33,359
Yes, sir.

416
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,809
And make sure
that we are shut down, tight.

417
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:37,865
Yes, sir.

418
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,807
Girls, come to papa, huh?

419
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:00,786
There already guys in the garden
and guys out back.

420
00:53:00,787 --> 00:53:02,444
- I want you three upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:53:03,404 --> 00:53:04,431
Two on the roof.

422
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:07,598
Hurry!

423
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,603
Jesus, what is this?

424
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:38,290
- Come back to bed.
- Shh...

425
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:18,480
Who the fuck is here?

426
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:40,317
Turn around.

427
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:53,279
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who I am.

428
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:56,254
Damn it!

429
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,600
- Okay. What do you want?
- I want you exactly where you are.

430
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:10,694
Whatever they pay,
I'll double it.

431
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,762
- Please... please don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

432
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:20,847
Oh, no, no, please.

433
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:50,208
Yeah.

434
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,135
- Mr. Steven Richard?
- Who is this?

435
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:54,277
This is FBI special agent James Ross.

436
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,254
Look, I'm the lead agent on a case,

437
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:59,420
it's a serial we call the tag killer.
You might've heard of him?

438
00:57:00,132 --> 00:57:04,146
- I've seen the publicity.
- He mocks his victims with a flower.

439
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:06,961
It's from Colombia.
A cataleya orchid.

440
00:57:06,962 --> 00:57:09,552
Each time I try to access
information I get stuck...

441
00:57:09,553 --> 00:57:11,759
with a CIA "Access Denied" tag...

442
00:57:11,855 --> 00:57:14,298
I'm at the end of a very long road,
Mr. Richard,

443
00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:16,600
and I believe
that you are the man I need...

444
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:21,076
Listen, Agent Ross, I can't give any
information out over the phone,

445
00:57:21,077 --> 00:57:24,732
but what I suggest is you file
a formal request with the agency...

446
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,979
for any information you might want.

447
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,719
And I'll be more than happy
to get back to you as soon as I can.

448
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,148
Thank you.

449
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:48,155
Stop bullshitting me, Marco.
I got the FBI on my ass now.

450
00:57:48,252 --> 00:57:51,438
And I want that problem taken care of
yesterday, do you hear me?

451
00:57:51,823 --> 00:57:53,667
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

452
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:02,477
- Where to?
- Downtown.

453
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,109
And we question
every Colombian we meet...

454
00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:08,465
until we find an address
to get her family. Okay?

455
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:34,740
In case you show up,

456
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,906
I want to let you know that I went
to New York to meet the galleries.

457
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:39,913
I'll be back tomorrow night,

458
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:43,463
but if you're already here,
make yourself at home.

459
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,108
What have we got?

460
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:12,891
We do have the surveillance tapes
from a few angles.

461
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,138
Few angles.

462
00:59:19,486 --> 00:59:20,800
- That's it?
- That's it.

463
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,418
- I mean, it's not a lot to go on...
- Oh, come on...

464
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:24,241
but run it through the database,
see what happens.

465
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:40,937
We're not looking for a woman.
It's not possible.

466
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,844
- And wine.
- Thank you.

467
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:08,618
- Come on.
- I'm impressed.

468
01:00:12,674 --> 01:00:13,969
I got you something.

469
01:00:14,162 --> 01:00:15,807
- You did?
- Yeah.

470
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:22,359
- A stuffed alligator?
- Yeah.

471
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,895
Exactly what I've always wanted.

472
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:31,770
Wait, wait.

473
01:00:34,453 --> 01:00:36,831
Let's just, uh...
let's just sit,

474
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:39,038
have a little of this food
and talk for a little bit first.

475
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,418
What you wanna talk about?

476
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:47,383
I don't know. Anything.
Ask me something.

477
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,544
- How was your trip?
- Actually it was great.

478
01:00:52,545 --> 01:00:55,414
The gallery liked my new paintings,
they're gonna put up a show in October.

479
01:00:55,511 --> 01:00:58,299
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

480
01:00:59,163 --> 01:01:01,490
My turn.
How was your trip?

481
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:06,973
- Hot.
- Did you do anything exciting?

482
01:01:07,453 --> 01:01:09,684
- I went swimming.
- Anything else?

483
01:01:13,485 --> 01:01:16,694
- Come on. Talk to me.
- What do you wanna know?

484
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:20,517
Anything. Something about you.
Something...

485
01:01:22,252 --> 01:01:23,484
Where are you from?

486
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:28,081
Are your parents from here
in the city?

487
01:01:34,086 --> 01:01:35,045
Okay...

488
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,141
let's start with
something a little more simple.

489
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:38,580
What do you like to eat
for breakfast?

490
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:40,342
I don't eat breakfast.

491
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:43,417
I'm not gonna hurt you.

492
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:46,428
I just wanna know
a little bit more about you.

493
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:48,923
About what you feel inside.
What you feel about me, anything.

494
01:01:49,594 --> 01:01:50,619
Just a little.

495
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,729
I feel lonely sometimes.

496
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:08,903
Thank you.
Me too.

497
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:31,756
Let me this time.

498
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:16,270
Good morning.

499
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:22,302
I know you say you don't eat breakfast,
so I thought I'd make us some lunch.

500
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:24,244
Shit.

501
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:26,689
- Wait. Where you going?
- I shouldn't have done this.

502
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:29,065
- Shouldn't have done what?
- Any of it.

503
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:31,798
I don't understand. Why?
What're you talking about? Why?

504
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,660
- Because...
- Because...? Look...

505
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:35,580
can you just hold on a second?
Can we just talk about this?

506
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:38,216
No, no, Danny.
We've talked too much.

507
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:41,263
- Jennifer, just stay for a minute.
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

508
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:42,894
Jennifer!

509
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:55,830
I'm sorry I'm late.

510
01:03:57,869 --> 01:03:59,008
Look!

511
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:04,967
Eight people, slaughtered in Miami.
One of them is my friend.

512
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,880
- So what?
- You know exactly what.

513
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:11,242
- It's getting too close.
- Ay, Tio, please. Again, with that?

514
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:14,211
They are looking for you.
Don't play with me.

515
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:19,840
You'll bring me in for sure.
I know how your twisted little mind works.

516
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:23,835
Do you think this is a game?
I'm a fucking joke to you?

517
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:26,714
Hm?

518
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:30,103
But you scare me, Cataleya.

519
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:32,886
I won't deal with your shit anymore.

520
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,958
I won't give you work,
or anything, anymore.

521
01:04:37,337 --> 01:04:38,629
You are retired.

522
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:41,499
- You can't do that.
- Quiet!

523
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:45,550
How many people did you kill
when your boy died?

524
01:04:48,861 --> 01:04:52,518
- How many?
- What you know my son?

525
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:55,811
You know fucking nothing
about my son.

526
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:58,594
Tell me.

527
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,558
But it changed nothing.

528
01:05:01,962 --> 01:05:04,670
When I lose my son,
I lose my life.

529
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:06,838
Everything is important to me,
is gone.

530
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,906
And I want to believe in you,
Cataleya.

531
01:05:10,914 --> 01:05:15,788
Why? I still pray that you find a life,
away from this.

532
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:19,679
Because no one in our entire family
has a chance for one.

533
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:28,660
Listen. Never come to the house,
never come to the church.

534
01:05:29,044 --> 01:05:32,821
Don't bother. I don't wanna wait
for your phone call no more.

535
01:05:33,014 --> 01:05:35,285
I don't want you
to break my mother's heart.

536
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:40,223
Maybe this
will help you to understand...

537
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:42,519
what I'm trying to tell you.

538
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:54,221
Oh, poor daddy.

539
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:13,764
Well, hazel, actually.

540
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,792
Dark hair.
Thick, shiny.

541
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:19,477
Incredible body.
Killer smile.

542
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:23,407
- I think about her all day long.
- Dude, you're in love.

543
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:25,259
You're so smart.

544
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,946
Okay, seriously, and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

545
01:06:28,654 --> 01:06:29,571
you're nuts.

546
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:32,065
I haven't had anyone important
in my life for at least ten years.

547
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:34,076
I finally find someone
that I really, really like,

548
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,282
that I...
that I wanna be with all the time.

549
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:38,942
I've got nothing.
I've got a stuffed animal and a picture.

550
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:42,514
You got a picture?
Give it up.

551
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:46,880
It's not even really a whole picture.
I took of her while she was sleeping, so...

552
01:06:48,745 --> 01:06:50,280
- Oh, myGod...
- Jesus, relax.

553
01:06:50,281 --> 01:06:52,200
When do I get to meet
the future Mrs. Delanay?

554
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:53,359
You? Never.

555
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,453
Excuse me, excuse me,
why are you writing a ticket?

556
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:12,379
- Third Precinct.
- You got that picture?

557
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,773
Hello, skinny face,
lying on my computer.

558
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:19,289
Oooh, she is beautiful.
Clearly out of your league.

559
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,378
It's not for me, it's for Danny.
Remember, the painter?

560
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:24,772
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Much better match.

561
01:07:24,773 --> 01:07:26,403
It's a perfect match.
How long is this gonna take?

562
01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:29,483
Slow down, tiger. You're my
brother-in-law, not my boss.

563
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:31,104
And besides,
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

564
01:07:31,105 --> 01:07:32,064
Sorry, sorry.

565
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,236
You are gonna be the fairy godmother
in the most beautiful love story ever.

566
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,962
Okay? Think about it.

567
01:07:37,963 --> 01:07:40,925
You get the honor of saying you were
the one, who made this all happen.

568
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:43,856
And I get to lose my job
if I get caught.

569
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:50,182
Brian, it's done.
I'll call you when I got something, okay?

570
01:07:50,183 --> 01:07:51,683
Thank you, babe.

571
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:00,415
You'll thank me later.

572
01:08:11,575 --> 01:08:13,918
Hey, I want a trace put on
an incoming transmission.

573
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:31,923
Chicago, third precinct.
Get somebody down there now.

574
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,988
That was such a nice surprise.

575
01:09:18,538 --> 01:09:21,920
- Everyone grows up sometime.
- She's gonna be okay.

576
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:26,227
Yes, Mama.
I think so.

577
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,714
- Uh... excuse me?
- Come with me, please.

578
01:09:45,906 --> 01:09:48,645
That's my computer! Why is she...
why are you all up on my computer?

579
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:50,705
- You have the right to remain...
- You better not mess up my favorites!

580
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,910
We have a base, sir...
Let's try size.

581
01:09:55,582 --> 01:09:57,995
Good. Now...
Let's see hands.

582
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:02,347
Looking good.
Now...

583
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,796
Hm...
nice nose.

584
01:10:07,948 --> 01:10:10,518
Congratulations.
You have a girl.

585
01:10:11,342 --> 01:10:13,743
Print it.
Get it out to all stations.

586
01:10:14,432 --> 01:10:16,893
- And get the mobile unit ready.
- Yes, sir.

587
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:47,056
- It's me.
- Jen?

588
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:48,565
Are you busy?

589
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:50,866
No, no I'm not.

590
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:52,498
Now we do a name.

591
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:54,976
Positioning in progress...

592
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:58,430
I was just
looking out the window and thinking,

593
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,945
- where are you?
- I'm... I'm at home.

594
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:02,481
I was looking out the window too.

595
01:11:02,576 --> 01:11:04,641
So we're looking at
the same star right now, huh?

596
01:11:04,642 --> 01:11:07,045
- Almost there.
- You have a sexy voice on the phone.

597
01:11:07,526 --> 01:11:10,657
- Yeah, you do too.
- We've got it.

598
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:13,712
Okay, we've got.
Give SWAT the location.

599
01:11:15,387 --> 01:11:16,405
Go!

600
01:11:19,254 --> 01:11:21,368
- I'm really glad you called me.
- Me too.

601
01:11:21,753 --> 01:11:24,266
I was literally just looking at a picture
of you, thinking of you,

602
01:11:24,267 --> 01:11:25,130
when the phone rang.

603
01:11:25,226 --> 01:11:26,976
- What picture?
- I took a picture of you...

604
01:11:26,977 --> 01:11:28,031
while you were sleeping
with my phone.

605
01:11:28,032 --> 01:11:31,275
It's really bad, but I just wanted
to have something to remind me of you.

606
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:36,286
- Did you show it to anybody, Danny?
- No. Well actually, to my friend Ryan.

607
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,844
- Who else saw the picture, Danny?
- Nobody. Why?

608
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,420
- Danny, who else?
- Nobody.

609
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,956
I didn't show it to anybody,
what's the big deal?

610
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:52,725
Look, I just took a stupid picture of you
with my phone. I'm sorry.

611
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:53,936
I'm sorry too.

612
01:12:12,672 --> 01:12:15,463
- Let's see what we got
- Special Agent Williams, FBI.

613
01:12:20,013 --> 01:12:20,991
It's clear.

614
01:13:10,644 --> 01:13:12,114
No, ma'am,
everything's under control.

615
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:14,801
I just need you to come with us,
we're evacuating the building.

616
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:29,978
Charges.

617
01:13:49,732 --> 01:13:50,643
Blow it.

618
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,014
She's not here.
Lock down this building. ASAP!

619
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:57,218
- Anything?
- Naw, nothing.

620
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,579
No, wait, wait, wait,
one security camera down.

621
01:15:03,441 --> 01:15:04,801
- A second one down.
- Where?

622
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:05,665
The garage!

623
01:15:05,761 --> 01:15:07,812
- All units, get to the garage.
- Let's go, let's go!

624
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:09,394
Cover all the damn exits.

625
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,429
She's here!

626
01:15:48,364 --> 01:15:49,614
Look everywhere!

627
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:55,537
Under every car, look in every room.
She's here. Find her!

628
01:15:58,911 --> 01:15:59,811
Anything?

629
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:02,114
Come on, check that booth,
she's here.

630
01:16:31,657 --> 01:16:34,055
Tio!
Mama.

631
01:16:58,514 --> 01:16:59,976
Mama.

632
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:03,238
Oh, shit...

633
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:09,857
Emilio!

634
01:17:09,954 --> 01:17:11,009
Emilio!

635
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:33,197
- This won't take long. Please. Sit.
- You think you've been smart.

636
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:39,207
Have you covered all your bases?
'Coz this... this is already over.

637
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,771
- This whole place is wired with webcams.
- You mean these?

638
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:48,124
Talk about covering all my bases:
Your chair is pressure-wired.

639
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:51,443
You move a single inch, and that'll be
the last move you ever make.

640
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:55,207
And given what you know about me,
you know I don't bluff.

641
01:19:00,578 --> 01:19:04,350
I don't know about you.
So I'm just gonna ask...

642
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:07,290
what happened to you,
that you could kill 23 people?

643
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:12,496
Would you believe me if I told you
this wasn't the life I had imagined?

644
01:19:12,907 --> 01:19:16,549
When I was a child,
I wanted to be like you,

645
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:19,220
- on the other side.
- Really?

646
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,354
So what happened?

647
01:19:27,498 --> 01:19:28,937
This how it all went...

648
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:32,365
I was nine when he had
my parents killed,

649
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,143
in front of me.

650
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,813
So all this... the tag killer?

651
01:19:38,814 --> 01:19:42,171
The clues... weren't for us at all,
they were all for him?

652
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:43,644
It was the only way
I could track him down.

653
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:46,139
And you needed us
to put it all in the press?

654
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:49,318
Yes, but it took you
so fucking long.

655
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:50,374
Goddamn.

656
01:19:50,566 --> 01:19:53,822
You had to be really determined,
very focused, huh?

657
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:55,356
Not focused enough.

658
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,643
This morning
he took the last piece of me.

659
01:20:04,411 --> 01:20:07,412
You sent the man a message,
he sent you one right back.

660
01:20:07,509 --> 01:20:09,056
And now
I'm gonna finish it.

661
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:12,191
- Oh, I can't help you.
- Yes you can,

662
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:14,013
he is protected by your government.

663
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:18,091
By a part of my government
that I cannot reach. It's CIA...

664
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,972
and I don't know why,
but I can't get under it,

665
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:21,794
I can't get over it,
you have to believe me...

666
01:20:21,795 --> 01:20:25,174
- I have tried.
- Try harder, Agent Ross.

667
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:31,557
You have a beautiful family.

668
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:33,381
If you go anywhere
near my family,

669
01:20:33,382 --> 01:20:35,108
- I swear to God, I'll...
- Shhh...

670
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:43,892
Now you know what you have to do.
Get me Luis Sandoval.

671
01:20:44,181 --> 01:20:49,282
Because if you don't, you're gonna go
to a funeral, every week.

672
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:55,151
And I will not stop, until you begin to feel
what I've felt all these years.

673
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,750
I'm sorry.

674
01:20:58,190 --> 01:20:59,341
Cataleya.

675
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,737
When your dinner's ready,

676
01:21:05,889 --> 01:21:08,479
the timer in your chair
will have expired.

677
01:21:09,054 --> 01:21:10,524
Don't get up before.

678
01:21:12,923 --> 01:21:13,883
Wait!

679
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,993
Now, you do understand
that I only took this meeting...

680
01:21:29,994 --> 01:21:31,720
out of professional courtesy?

681
01:21:32,008 --> 01:21:33,562
Well, the truth is,

682
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:36,152
- I really can't help you at all.
- Can't, or won't?

683
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:40,637
- It's the same thing, really.
- But in the, uh, spirit of reaching out...

684
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:45,778
Let me put my cards on the table.
I have met this woman.

685
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:48,625
- This tag killer.
- It's a woman?

686
01:21:48,625 --> 01:21:50,108
- Yeah.
- Is she pretty?

687
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:51,644
She got the drop on me in my home

688
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,439
and she told me, that if I don't bring her
the whereabouts of this man, she says...

689
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,972
she's gonna kill a member of my family
every week until I have none left.

690
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:02,607
- Are you kidding me?
- Does it seem to you...

691
01:22:02,608 --> 01:22:04,431
that I would make
something like this up?

692
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:07,948
So why don't you just...
tell me what I should do.

693
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:12,713
Call 911. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

694
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,288
It starts now.

695
01:22:21,195 --> 01:22:22,250
Ross.

696
01:22:29,914 --> 01:22:30,873
It's her.

697
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,212
She says, if you don't give her
exactly what she wants,

698
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,617
she's gonna redecorate your whole office,
with you.

699
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:43,410
Can you please tell her that glass
is temperative resistant...

700
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:46,289
to a direct hit by a 57mm ordinance?

701
01:22:58,649 --> 01:23:00,135
Ten seconds to give up that address.

702
01:23:00,136 --> 01:23:02,630
How can I be sure that if I give her
the address, she won't kill me anyway?

703
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:04,727
She says you can't,
but you can trust me,

704
01:23:04,728 --> 01:23:05,825
if you do not give her
what she wants,

705
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:08,032
you will be the 24th victim
on the hit parade.

706
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:11,343


707
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:45,809
She asks that you keep this coversation
strictly confidential.

708
01:23:14,413 --> 01:23:17,298
- With pleasure.
- What about my family?

709
01:24:26,385 --> 01:24:28,695
- Good morning.
- Who are you?

710
01:24:28,888 --> 01:24:31,132
That's not important.
What's important is...

711
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:34,107
I need the floor plants
to 8-6-7 Magnolia Terrace.

712
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:38,115
If you don't leave my office immediately,
I will call the police.

713
01:24:38,404 --> 01:24:40,404
I really need those floor plans.

714
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:48,187
You will take positions here...
here... and here.

715
01:24:48,476 --> 01:24:51,227
You must expect
the unexpected.

716
01:24:51,324 --> 01:24:54,645
She's like mist under a door.
Like a mouse on the wall.

717
01:24:54,838 --> 01:24:56,351
She will never attack
straight on...

718
01:24:56,735 --> 01:24:59,133
and you will not see her
until it's too late.

719
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,496
She's that invisible.

720
01:25:07,156 --> 01:25:08,307
Let's go!

721
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:38,339
Don Luis...
Don Luis, are you okay?

722
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:42,393
- Get the Mercedes.
- What happened?

723
01:25:42,394 --> 01:25:44,526
- You need to get out of here.
- Leave me alone.

724
01:25:44,911 --> 01:25:46,718
Come on!
Come on, come on.

725
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,756
- Everybody in!
- Let's go! Quick!

726
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:24,073
We have to move.
Hurry!

727
01:26:24,842 --> 01:26:27,688
Come on.
You hide here.

728
01:26:29,074 --> 01:26:30,803
- And wait for my call.
- Okay.

729
01:27:29,796 --> 01:27:32,005
- Did you get her?
- We're checking.

730
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:49,483
I think we got her.

731
01:27:55,335 --> 01:27:56,199
Marco.

732
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:57,446
Marco!

733
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:43,998
Marco!

734
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:02,472
- What the hell is going on?
- I will hold here.

735
01:29:02,473 --> 01:29:03,432
Marco!

736
01:29:31,357 --> 01:29:34,138
You've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time, right?

737
01:29:34,811 --> 01:29:35,770
Yes.

738
01:32:23,188 --> 01:32:24,125
Hurry.

739
01:32:27,462 --> 01:32:32,320
- Marco?
- No. It's Cataleya.

740
01:32:32,992 --> 01:32:34,247
What were you expecting?

741
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:38,372
You have ruined your whole life
trying to kill me, someone like me?

742
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:44,003
I cannot be killed. I do the killing!
And now, it's your turn to be hunted.

743
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:48,593
You will never find me.
But as the day follows night, believe me,

744
01:32:48,882 --> 01:32:52,126
I will find you. And I will kill you.
And you know why?

745
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:53,792
Because I will never be...

746
01:32:53,793 --> 01:32:57,437
- where you want me to be.
- Actually...

747
01:33:00,322 --> 01:33:02,335
you're exactly where I want you to be.

748
01:33:08,075 --> 01:33:09,194
Eat.

749
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:40,070
You should think very carefully.
Is there anything else?

750
01:33:40,071 --> 01:33:41,373
I've already told you everything.

751
01:33:41,374 --> 01:33:43,388
Okay? She... she'd come by
for a couple of hours,

752
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:44,444
and then she'd leave, that's it.

753
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:47,606
Look, it's really late, I'm really tired.
If you are not gonna arrest me...

754
01:33:48,182 --> 01:33:50,716
We don't actually have anything
to charge you with.

755
01:33:51,389 --> 01:33:53,003
- So, can I leave?
- No.

756
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:58,116
- I got a few more questions.
- Can I at least get a cup of coffee?

757
01:33:59,463 --> 01:34:00,319
Yeah.

758
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:04,258
- Cream and sugar?
- Yes, please.

759
01:34:11,494 --> 01:34:13,796
- Hello.
- Hello.

760
01:34:14,085 --> 01:34:18,444
Jen? Thank God. Look, I... I had no idea,
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

761
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:23,337
- I'm fine. Where are you?
- The FBI.

762
01:34:24,585 --> 01:34:27,450
- Danny, you know that they...
- Yeah.

763
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:31,598
- How much time do we have?
- Forty seconds.

764
01:34:32,654 --> 01:34:36,433
- Gives us time for 3 more questions.
- What's your real name?

765
01:34:38,695 --> 01:34:41,743
- Cataleya.
- Like the flower?

766
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:47,581
Yes, like the flower.
Twenty Seconds.

767
01:34:47,773 --> 01:34:49,849
Will my little bird
come back one day?

768
01:34:52,919 --> 01:34:55,029
Leave your window open
and you'll see.

769
01:34:57,064 --> 01:34:58,432
- Hey, Ross?
- Yeah.

770
01:34:58,433 --> 01:35:00,185
We're picking something up
off that guy's phone.

771
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:05,172
- Last question.
- I love you.

772
01:35:08,617 --> 01:35:13,656
Give me that phone. Give it!
Hello? Hello?!

773
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,301
You can go.
