00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SILICONCHIP

3
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,421
Hey, Claire!
Wanna see something great?

4
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:26,173
Who else was there?

5
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:28,509
It's an igloo.

6
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,388
- And?
- I made it.

7
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,388
Yeah, my brother.

8
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:33,889
Hey, Claire?

9
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,353
<i>I can't. We're supposed to go
to my dad's that weekend.</i>

10
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:38,980
The snowplows left some
snow across the street...

11
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:42,942
- and I dug a hole into it.
- Max, go play with your friends.

12
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,758
You, go that way!
You, go that way!

13
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,470
No, don't talk to me like that!
You're just a fence!

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,807
You can go play
with your own fence friends.

15
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:10,351
Now move out!

16
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,836
<i>Hey, Claire, what's up? Are you ready?
- Hey, guys!</i>

17
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,755
<i>...and chose him, okay?
- Yeah!</i>

18
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,975
<i>Claire, is that your brother?</i>

19
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:23,523
<i>Get him!</i>

20
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:31,739
<i>He's so dead!</i>

21
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,204
<i>Max, go away!</i>

22
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:38,956
I got him!

23
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,001
Come on! Come on!

24
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:44,837
<i>Get him!</i>

25
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:08,242
You okay?

26
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:10,788
<i>Come on, guys, let's go!</i>

27
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:12,892
<i>Hey, I'm home.</i>

28
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,609
What's wrong?

29
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:30,284
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo.

30
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,876
She didn't do anything about it.

31
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,297
I'm sorry, honey.

32
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,473
I would have done something about it.

33
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,575
Max, what have you done?

34
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:08,834
<i>¶ I took my lucky break
and I broke it in two, ¶</i>

35
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,880
<i>¶ Put on my worried shoes, ¶</i>

36
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:15,423
No, I don't want to bother you.
Just... just quickly...

37
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:19,890
Can you tell me excatly what Mr. Lasseter
didn't like about the report?

38
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,476
Wha... What am I supposed to do?

39
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,986
No, I'm just tired.
And I'd a rough day here and...

40
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:37,117
I... I cannot afford to lose this.

41
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,419
I know. I know it.

42
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:48,801
But I better get started because
I'd like to turn it in the morning.

43
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,843
No, I hear you. I hear you.

44
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:55,055
And this will be the last time,
I promise, okay?

45
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,432
Thanks.

46
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>¶ My shoes took me down a crooked path ¶</i>

47
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,660
Hey.
- Hi.

48
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,625
I could use a story.

49
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:24,798
Sure.

50
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:30,931
There were some buildings.

51
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,270
There are these really tall buildings.

52
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,482
And they could walk.

53
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,274
Then there were some vampires.

54
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:43,196
And one of the vampires bit
the tallest building.

55
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,700
And his fangs broke off.

56
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:52,290
Then all his other teeth fell out.
Then he started crying.

57
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:56,126
And then all the other vampires...

58
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,214
...said...

59
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:00,510
"Why are you crying?

60
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,971
"Aren't those just your baby teeth?"

61
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:06,014
And...

62
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,188
He said,
"No, those are my grown up teeth. "

63
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,315
And...

64
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:18,031
...the vampires knew that
he couldn't be a vampire anymore.

65
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,241
So they left him.

66
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,374
The end.

67
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,354
And the sun is the center of
our solar system.

68
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,357
It's the reason that
all the planets are here.

69
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,986
It, uh, it's warmth gives the sunlight,
makes our planet livable.

70
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,698
And of course the sun won't
always be here to keep us warm.

71
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:57,036
It, uh, like all things will die.

72
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,206
And when it does,
first it expands.

73
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,832
Enveloping all the surrounding planets,
including earth...

74
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:05,170
...before consuming rapidly.

75
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,383
The sun, after all, is just fuel,
burning ferociously.

76
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:12,763
When it runs out of fuel, well,
it'll be gone.

77
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,432
Well, after that the...

78
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:19,102
...solar system will go dark,
permanently.

79
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,231
I'm sure by that time, the...

80
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:24,775
...human race will have fallen to
any numbers of calamities.

81
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:28,488
<i>War, pollution, global warming,</i>

82
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,531
<i>...tsunamies...</i>

83
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,913
<i>...earthquakes, meteors...</i>

84
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:38,710
<i>Hey, who knows, right?</i>

85
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,165
Mom?
Mom, come up here!

86
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,291
<i>Max, I'm busy.</i>

87
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,421
I rebuit the fort.
You gotta get inside it.

88
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,382
The lava's coming.

89
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:23,387
oh, and it's a rocket ship,
and it's gonna take off.

90
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,563
Want me to save you a seat?

91
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:04,645
You're really... nice.
- Cute.

92
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,024
- No.
- Not really.

93
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:19,914
Hi, sweety.

94
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,251
Claire!?

95
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:27,382
It's almost dinner,
get your stuff off the table, please.

96
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,700
Mom, what is that?

97
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,077
Pate.

98
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,795
Frozen corn?
What's wrong with real corn?

99
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,423
Frozen corn is real, alright?
And get off the chair, please.

100
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:04,632
And go tell your sister
to clear her stuff off the table.

101
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,846
Claire, get your stuff off
the dining room table.

102
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,061
Max, don't pull that now.

103
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:23,533
Max, get off the counter, please.
Get off.

104
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,744
I have a friend here...
you're embarrassing me?

105
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,247
Woman, feed me!

106
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,499
Max, get off.
Get off the counter!

107
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:36,130
Get off the damn counter, Max!
Now! Now!

108
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,882
- I'll eat you up!
- Get down!

109
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:40,511
Get over here!

110
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,345
Stop!

111
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,355
What is wrong with you?
This is not acceptable behavior.

112
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:48,728
You are not acceptable.

113
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,314
No dinner for you, Max.
Go to your room.

114
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,782
- You bit me, kind of hurt!
- Connie, he can't treat you like that.

115
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:59,700
Max, what is wrong with you?

116
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:04,081
- You're out of control!
- Not my fault.

117
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,759
<i>Max!</i>

118
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,135
<i>Max!</i>

119
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,414
Max!

120
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,930
I hate you.

121
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,140
Hello?

122
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:03,470
<i>That's it. Tear them all down.
Tear them down.</i>

123
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:05,931
<i>Burn down!</i>

124
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,439
<i>We've got a few more
to go over here.</i>

125
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,655
Is anyone going to help me?

126
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,200
<i>We liked them.
They were nice.</i>

127
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,705
I mean, this is a problem.
Don't you see this is a problem?

128
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:29,082
- I will...
- No, I'll just do it myself.

129
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:31,169
- Help?
- As usual.

130
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:33,755
Carol, could I talk to you
for a second?

131
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:36,801
- No, Douglas, not right now. I'm busy.
- Okay.

132
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,552
Can you hear me from up here?

133
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,266
And I'm the only one
who cares enough to do this.

134
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,269
<i>Or this!</i>

135
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:48,565
Carol, is this really necessary?
- Ask KW.

136
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,237
- You ask KW if it's necessary.
- She's not here. She left.

137
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:55,948
I, huh, she left!
She left, exactly!

138
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:57,698
That's why it's necessary.

139
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,704
- I'll help.
- Okay.

140
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:02,209
Okay, good.
Come on, come on, here you go.

141
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:06,794
- Thank you.
- Glad to help.

142
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,300
Who else want to lend a hand?
- What do you say, Judith?

143
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:11,635
- Should I help too?
- No, you shouldn't help him!

144
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:14,554
- I just thought it'll make him feel better.
- Yup, good idea, Ira.

145
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:16,391
Go stand in this hut over here
before it gets wrecked.

146
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:19,308
I know, I know, I shouldn't.
- Ira, you're not helping.

147
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:21,063
- Go in the hut.
- I'll stand right over here.

148
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,230
No!

149
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,610
This is crazy!

150
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,449
No, no, it was crazy already.

151
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,534
I'm just eliminating the crazy.

152
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,330
I don't think
the crazy's been eliminated.

153
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,789
Isn't anyone gonna be
on my side anymore?

154
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,213
Yeah, well, I guess not.

155
00:21:44,256 --> 00:21:45,675
Fine.

156
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,387
I'll just be on my own side.

157
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,559
By myself.

158
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,233
Nobody cares.
I'm the only one that cares...

159
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,153
...that we don't stay together.

160
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,824
I'm the only one
who cares about that, so...

161
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,162
- See? I care!
- Carol?

162
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,915
You don't care
and just stand there...

163
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,709
...and whisper to each other
about me,

164
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,877
- like you always do.
- That's true.

165
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:17,339
But I know what I'm doing.

166
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:26,641
Ira, what is it?
- I don't know.

167
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,598
Hello.

168
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,306
See? This guy gets it.

169
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:40,937
Hey, uh, weird little thing...

170
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:42,814
I like the way you destroy stuff.
Good technique.

171
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,026
There's a spark to your work,
that can't be taught.

172
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:46,112
Thanks.

173
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,822
Alright, you see that one over there?

174
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,617
You get that one,
I'll get this one.

175
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:51,785
- See who can do it faster, okay?
- Okay.

176
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,579
Go!

177
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:20,277
What are you doing?
- I... I...

178
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,739
- I'm just helping.
- My smashing our houses?

179
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,244
- These are your houses?
- Yeah.

180
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,957
- What's wrong with them?
- What do your houses look like?

181
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,832
- I bet his houses are funny looking.
- Look, we worked very hard on these.

182
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,174
Then you, sir, showed up
and started "helping. "

183
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:38,549
- Im cold.
- Who are you?

184
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:40,636
Are you one of KW's new friends?

185
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:44,389
- Are you Bob or Terry?
- I don't even know who that is.

186
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:47,099
- Looks like a Bob.
- Thing's are getting crazy here.

187
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:49,310
- This thing's dangerous.
- You're scaring me.

188
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:51,522
You know what I say,
if you've got a problem?

189
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,024
Eat it!

190
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,988
It's the only way to solve
these types of issues.

191
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:56,653
The only way.

192
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,948
- Oh, he's probably got those little bird bones.
- Oh, I hate those.

193
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,661
You've those little bird bones that
are gonna cut up my mouth, do you?

194
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,749
- No, I don't have bird bones.
- You better not!

195
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,668
You better not be difficult to eat.
Did you have even think of that?

196
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:09,254
God, you're selfish!

197
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:11,798
I hope you don't taste
as selfish as your look.

198
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:14,465
- Let's eat it.
- Stop!

199
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:19,430
- Stop!
- Oh, look at him.

200
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:22,477
So delectable... so chewable.

201
00:25:23,228 --> 00:25:25,062
Be still!

202
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,407
- Why?
- Be... because...

203
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:39,082
- Because...
- Why?

204
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,998
Well, because...
you can't eat me.

205
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,003
You didn't know,
that's why I forgive you.

206
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,465
- But never try it again!
- Why not?

207
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,178
- I... I've powers from another land.
- Powers?

208
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:54,222
From ancient times.

209
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,267
Don't make me show you.

210
00:25:57,936 --> 00:26:00,565
- I destroyed these Vikings once.
- Vikings?

211
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:04,736
- What's a Viking?
- Well, they wear horn hats.

212
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:06,320
And they are big.

213
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:08,824
Bigger than all of you.

214
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,662
One time they attacked me
in my ice fortress.

215
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:13,498
They tried to cave in the roof.

216
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,789
But I made it too strong.

217
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:18,711
I told them to be still,
but they didn't.

218
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,756
I conquered them.

219
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,966
I had to make their heads explode.

220
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,634
And then they realized...

221
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,514
...that I knew
all the secrets of the world.

222
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,350
And then you know what happened?

223
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,482
They made me their king.

224
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,444
- A king?
- You were a king?

225
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,903
I knew there was something
special about him, I've told you, guys.

226
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,618
So wait, you exploded their heads?

227
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,536
Oh, come on! Our heads are bigger.

228
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,204
You can't explode big heads.

229
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,916
No, their heads were
bigger than yours, believe me.

230
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:55,299
- But you're so small.
- Small is good.

231
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:58,300
My powers are able to slip
right through the cracks.

232
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:00,804
And what if the cracks are closed up?

233
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,221
Then Ive a re-cracker
which goes right through that.

234
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:06,309
But what if there's some sort of material
that re-crackers can't get through?

235
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,978
Then I've a double re-cracker...

236
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,313
...which can get through anything
in this whole universe.

237
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:13,901
And that's end and there's nothing
more powerful after that ever.

238
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:14,692
Period.

239
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,155
- He has a double re-cracker.
- He does sound powerful.

240
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,283
Yeah! Yeah! But there has
to be some material somewhere.

241
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:21,494
I mean, maybe really
deep underground that...

242
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,331
Quiet!

243
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:24,456
- something...
- Be quiet!

244
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,166
I'm sorry, so...

245
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,756
You were their king...

246
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:32,047
...and you made everything right?

247
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,301
Yeah.

248
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:38,641
Well, you know,
what about loneliness?

249
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:42,435
What he's saying is,
will you keep out all the sadness?

250
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:56,160
I have a sadness shield,
it keeps out all the sadness.

251
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,579
It's big enough for all of us.

252
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:02,336
And I do this to loneliness.

253
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,545
I knew it! I knew it!

254
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,674
When he showed up,
I saw it.

255
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:11,222
Why don't guys ever listen to me?

256
00:28:11,388 --> 00:28:14,347
You're right, Carol.
I didn't see it.

257
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,394
I don't understand.
He doesn't look like a king.

258
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,898
If he could be king,
I could be king.

259
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:22,191
Were you the King
where you came from?

260
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:24,569
Yeah. Yeah, for twenty years.

261
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:28,117
- That's impressive!
- That's incredible, right?

262
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:31,538
Looks like we found our king.

263
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,915
- You're a king, right?
- Yeah.

264
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,169
Yeah, I am.

265
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:41,005
- Oh, I'm so relieved.
- Sorry, we were gonna eat you.

266
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,256
We didn't know you were a king.

267
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:43,924
- That was insane!
- Yeah! Yeah, I mean...

268
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:45,428
Oh, my god, it's KW!

269
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:46,263
- What?
- What?

270
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:47,515
Oh, hi, KW!

271
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,768
KW, good to see you.

272
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:52,644
I thought you were with your new
best friends, Bob and Terry.

273
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,732
What are you guys doing?

274
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,691
- Who is that?
- KW, get in here, you gotta hear this.

275
00:28:57,775 --> 00:28:59,405
- We finally got a king.
- That's true.

276
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,114
- A very impressive one.
- Yeah, KW, we got a king.

277
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,535
You and me could go for a walk
and I'll tell you about it, anytime.

278
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,998
You can carry me like a little baby.

279
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,669
Yeah, anyway I don't know
if I'm sticking around.

280
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,544
I just came back to...

281
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,009
...to get that one stick I left here.
Anyone see it?

282
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,305
I'll help find it, KW.
I'm good at finding sticks.

283
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:26,352
KW, he's very powerful.
- Stop, stop, don't push her.

284
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:29,563
She'll figure it out for herself.
Just leave her be, okay?

285
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:33,026
King.
King, this way your Majesty, please.

286
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:41,493
Look. He's gonna make us happy, Judy.

287
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:42,914
Yeah.

288
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:45,750
But happiness isn't always
the best way to be happy.

289
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:49,087
- Judith, stop.
- He's small for a king.

290
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,299
- Am I nuts? He's small.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

291
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:53,384
- Alexander!
- Sorry!

292
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,066
I like it better
when we have a king.

293
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:10,406
I like Carol better
when we have a king.

294
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,988
Hey, what happened to our houses?

295
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:16,454
They fell down.

296
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,218
Are those... other kings?

297
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:34,016
They were here before we got here.
I never saw them.

298
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:36,477
I've never even... noticed them.

299
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,821
You okay?

300
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:47,865
Yeah.

301
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:55,584
You are now the king.

302
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,879
And you'll be a truly great king.

303
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,007
Oh, look at...
Looks good on him. Look!

304
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,677
- He looks great. Our king!
- He looks perfect!

305
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,470
- He looks perfect!
- We have a king.

306
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,890
<i>Fresh king!</i>

307
00:31:08,723 --> 00:31:10,102
<i>I know this part</i>

308
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,187
<i>King! King! King!</i>

309
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,230
Hey King!
What's your first order of business?

310
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,281
Let the wild rumpus start!

311
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:23,533
Perfect answer!

312
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,292
Come on!

313
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,337
Come on, King.

314
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:40,969
Come on, KW,
believe me.

315
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:58,825
Guys, follow me.

316
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,171
What?

317
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:21,924
You're funny looking.
That's all.

318
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:30,312
Hey, king, king, king!
Watch this!

319
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:43,160
Hey, jumping guy!
Jumping guy!

320
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:45,745
Hey, mister!

321
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:48,791
Wait up!

322
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:55,842
Hey, jumping guy! Hey!

323
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:58,345
Hey, king, watch this!

324
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,275
Alright, tree, let's settle this later.

325
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:14,696
Look, everyone wants to be
friends with the new guy.

326
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:17,492
Well, this is our family.

327
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:19,912
I hope you can see how excited
they're to have a king.

328
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:22,456
Sometimes they have an odd way
of showing it, I mean...

329
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:25,002
They act weird, you know?
And...

330
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,213
It can hurt other people's feelings.

331
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,965
Ira, my love? Come here.
- What?

332
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:33,218
Oh, that's just Judith and Ira,
they are in love.

333
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:39,143
What are you thinking?

334
00:34:41,686 --> 00:34:43,521
Watch me! Look!

335
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:45,191
That's Alexander.

336
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:47,570
Look, I hate this tree.

337
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,992
Oh, he just wants attention.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

338
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,450
<i>Seventy seven!</i>

339
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,287
Seventy eight!

340
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:56,872
No, wait.
No, no, that was...

341
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,373
That's Douglas.

342
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:00,333
I count on him for everything.

343
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:03,714
If I was stranded on a desert island
and I could only take one thing..

344
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:04,758
...it would be Douglas.

345
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:07,176
- We can share him if you want?
- Yeah, he's good.

346
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:08,803
I might need one of those.

347
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:11,181
Douglas, no!
No, no, Stop!

348
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:13,894
That's not the way I want you to do it.
Here, I'll show you.

349
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:16,146
<i>How did that happen?</i>

350
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,940
<i>It's an accident.
I don't know how that happened.</i>

351
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,821
We haven't formally met.

352
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,320
I'm Ira.

353
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,284
I put the holes in the trees,
maybe you saw those?

354
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:29,745
Or maybe not.

355
00:35:29,955 --> 00:35:32,248
Anyways... it's what I do.

356
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:34,584
They aren't really important like...

357
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,960
...things you do.

358
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:38,423
Oh, and this is Judith.

359
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,799
You don't really need to know me.
I'm kind of a downer.

360
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,054
King, that's not true.

361
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,516
Hey, let me see your face.

362
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,433
You can introduce me
to the king if you want...

363
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:48,809
Here, let me see your face.

364
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:53,313
Oh, what's that?
Don't worry, let me see it.

365
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,041
Good shot, Douglas.

366
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,255
<i>You almost got me!
Almost got me!</i>

367
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:17,845
We'll get him next time, won't we?
Yes, we will.

368
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,306
Hey, what are you doing?

369
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,734
Is she the one you're mad at
when you're smashing stuff?

370
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:29,942
Yeah.

371
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:33,113
No, no! No...

372
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:36,158
I thought she said,
she wasn't gonna come back.

373
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:40,247
- Well, looks like she's back now.
- Yeah.

374
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,915
Yeah, I hope so.

375
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:45,918
I'm gonna get her!

376
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:47,713
Don't, don't, she doesn't like
that kind of thing.

377
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,092
Come back!
Come back, here!

378
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,010
<i>Ira, my dear, come here.</i>

379
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:54,470
- Hey, king!
- King, I wouldn't recommed that.

380
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,019
Stop it!

381
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:03,316
Hey, stop it.

382
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:06,110
Go, pick someone else's nose.

383
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:08,905
Max, look out!

384
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,283
Gotcha!

385
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,002
Alexander, get over there
and be social.

386
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,384
Let's be like this forever!

387
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,224
This is really me.

388
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,684
He's started things off right,
our king.

389
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,688
- Well, this guy get things done.
- Yeah.

390
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:38,399
- That was great.
- Yeah, that was.

391
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:39,860
That was fun!

392
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:42,028
- We forgot how to have fun.
- That's true, Carol.

393
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:44,657
- Even I didn't.
- No, no, you didn't, Carol.

394
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:46,159
KW, your toe's are in my ear.

395
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:47,661
Good, you're keeping it warm.

396
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:51,123
- Hey, who's on my face?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Carol.

397
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,458
Let me move.

398
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,003
Oh, I like this.

399
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:57,921
- Let's be like this forever.
- The king having a problem?

400
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,716
My foots stuck under this fat guy.

401
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:04,178
There.

402
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:05,474
Thanks.

403
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,349
- I'm KW.
- I'm Max.

404
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,851
I know.

405
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:16,821
Hey, so are you gonna stay?
They all want you to.

406
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:18,822
Well... it's complicated.

407
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:21,616
I don't even know
how everything got this way.

408
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:24,830
Things seem better now, though.

409
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:27,126
Yeah, well, they are.

410
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:29,919
Okay, King.

411
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:32,923
Hey, who are Bob and Terry?

412
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,594
They're really good friends of mine.

413
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:38,721
No, I don't even know how to
describe them, they're just...

414
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:41,058
...different from everybody here.

415
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:43,143
Just different.

416
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:47,357
- Well, do you like them more than...
- You ask a lot of questions.

417
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:51,069
So what's your story?
Why did you come here?

418
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:56,162
Well... I'm an explorer,
and I travel a lot.

419
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:58,911
- And... I travel by sea...
- Right.

420
00:38:58,995 --> 00:39:00,455
I used to travel by air.

421
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:03,127
So obviously,
you have no home or family?

422
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:07,548
I have one of those but...

423
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,011
- Did you ate them all?
- No!

424
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:14,387
No, I just bit one of them,
that's all and...

425
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:16,683
...they went crazy.

426
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:21,148
And...

427
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,654
I don't like frozen corn.

428
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:29,367
I'm sorry.
That's why you left?

429
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:33,914
They act like I'm a bad person.

430
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,960
- Well, are you?
- I don't know.

431
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:41,004
I don't know.

432
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:45,803
Well, I'm glad you came.

433
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,847
It'll be good to have someone around
who doesn't eat everybody.

434
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,185
I mean, you just bite everyone,
the biters aren't so bad.

435
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,520
Eaters are the one's that
I just can't stand.

436
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:57,066
I have no plans to eat anybody.

437
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,151
Alright... good.

438
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:02,990
Good night.

439
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:13,877
Good night, KW.
- Good night.

440
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,173
- Good night, Ira.
- Good night.

441
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:19,093
- Good night, Douglas.
- Good night, Carol.

442
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:22,262
- Good night, Judith.
- Good night.

443
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:25,266
- Good night, Judy.
- Good night, darling.

444
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:27,645
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, Alex.</i>

445
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,396
- Good night, King.
- Good night.

446
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,442
- Oh, good night, King.
- Hey, good night, King.

447
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:35,361
Oh, this is nice.

448
00:40:36,447 --> 00:40:38,032
Good night, everybody.

449
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:40,951
Everybody, sweet dreams.

450
00:41:12,614 --> 00:41:14,199
I didn't want to wake you up.

451
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:16,659
But I really want to
show you something.

452
00:41:18,328 --> 00:41:20,459
- Okay.
- And on the way...

453
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,418
I can show you your kingdom.

454
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:24,921
This is all yours.

455
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:26,882
You are the owner of this world.

456
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:29,550
Everything you see is yours.

457
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:31,679
Oh, except...

458
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,931
...that hole over there,
that's Ira's.

459
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,267
I mean, the tree is yours
but the hole is Ira's.

460
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:37,937
But everything else is yours.

461
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,273
Except that rock over there,
that's not yours.

462
00:41:40,355 --> 00:41:42,192
That little rock next to the big rock.

463
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,487
But everything else in the kingdom,
except for that stick...

464
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,866
...that little stick right there,
that's not yours.

465
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:53,789
I want you to be king forever, Max.

466
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:57,500
Yeah... definitely.

467
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,554
This part of your kingdom
is not so good.

468
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,303
Why?

469
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:12,270
Well, look, this used to be all rock,
and now it's sand...

470
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:13,939
...and then one day
it's gonna be dust.

471
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:16,649
And then the whole island
will be dust and...

472
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:20,778
Then I don't even know
what comes after dust.

473
00:42:27,247 --> 00:42:29,079
Carol?
- Hm-hmm.

474
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:31,710
Did you know the sun
was gonna die?

475
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,628
What?

476
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,717
I've never heard that.

477
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:45,725
Oh, come on...

478
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:48,521
...that can't happen.

479
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:54,529
You're the king.
And look at me... I'm big.

480
00:42:55,696 --> 00:43:00,619
How could guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun, hm?

481
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,805
Carol, what's that?
- Oh, it's that dog.

482
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,062
Don't feed it,
it'll just follow you around.

483
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:34,492
Carol, wait up for me!

484
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:15,667
<i>¶ Hideaway ¶</i>

485
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:20,213
<i>¶ Well they'll seat us in the sun ¶</i>

486
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:27,971
<i>¶ By the way ¶</i>

487
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:32,397
<i>¶ Know you've always been the one ¶</i>

488
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:37,025
Did you make this?

489
00:44:37,901 --> 00:44:39,738
Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:42,240
It's very good.

491
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:50,750
We were gonna make
a whole world like this, but...

492
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:53,128
Everyone used to come here...

493
00:44:54,713 --> 00:44:56,296
But now..

494
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,095
Do you know what it feels like
when all your teeth are...

495
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:03,432
...falling out really slowly and...

496
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:06,978
...you don't realize and
then you notice that...

497
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:09,230
...well, they're really far apart.

498
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:13,569
And then one day...

499
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:17,701
...you don't have any teeth anymore.

500
00:45:20,203 --> 00:45:23,749
- Yeah.
- Well, it was like that.

501
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:28,169
Alright, put...
put your head right here.

502
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:30,465
Right here.

503
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,271
Alright, now watch.

504
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:06,133
<i>I wish I could live in there.</i>

505
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,968
<i>Yeah.</i>

506
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:13,184
It's gonna be a place where only
the things you want to have happen...

507
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:14,853
...would happen.

508
00:46:15,351 --> 00:46:16,767
Yeah.

509
00:46:17,436 --> 00:46:19,358
I guess it does not gonna happen,
I'll just...

510
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:21,442
...probably end up eating my feet off.

511
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:32,955
Carol, we can totally
build a place like that.

512
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:38,170
- Really?
- We're gonna start with the perfect fort.

513
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,800
And then we're gonna
build the city around it.

514
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:42,967
Because, we gotta be realistic,
I mean...

515
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,056
We need to start
with the perfect fort...

516
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,432
...and then we're gonna
build the underground complex,

517
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,477
...that's gonna tie everything together.

518
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,393
I like your brain, Max.

519
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:55,941
Hey, I'm not gonna
eat off my feet anymore.

520
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:58,738
- Why?
- Max is gonna build a fortress.

521
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:02,159
Yeah, it's gonna be as tall as
twelve of you and six of me.

522
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:05,370
And only we can get in.
We can make an ice cream parlor.

523
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:07,957
A swimming pool with a bottom
that's a trampoline!

524
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,167
Hey, where were you?
We... we were just here.

525
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:12,669
And anyone who gets in there,
that we don't want there...

526
00:47:12,712 --> 00:47:14,088
...will get their brains cut out.

527
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:17,592
- The building will do it automatically.
- How does it know which brains to cut off?

528
00:47:17,675 --> 00:47:19,263
Okay, so there will be a tree,

529
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:21,474
...but it's a fake tree,
that's a tunnel.

530
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:32,277
So anyways, it's not a tree.
It's a tunnel.

531
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:35,362
And it will lead you into the fort
through a compartment.

532
00:47:35,656 --> 00:47:37,659
Ira, do you wanna be
in charge of the tunnels?

533
00:47:37,742 --> 00:47:40,454
- Because you can make great holes.
- Wow! Wow!

534
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:43,458
- I don't want my brains cut out!
- This fort is already making me happy.

535
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:45,083
Does anybody ever hear me?

536
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:49,049
We'll take care for each other,
and we'll all sleep together in a real pile.

537
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:50,548
What do you think?

538
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:53,468
I don't think anything like this
ever works, really.

539
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,929
- But if it did...
- Fine.

540
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:57,391
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know anything.

541
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,391
But I do like sleeping in a real pile.

542
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:02,104
Carol, will you be
in charge of building it?

543
00:48:03,563 --> 00:48:05,568
You should definitely be in charge, Carol.

544
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,822
- You're the only one who can pull it off.
- Yeah, well, you're right but, uh...

545
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,035
KW, don't you think that
Carol should build it?

546
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:16,454
Yeah, he's the only one who can.

547
00:48:16,787 --> 00:48:18,208
I'll build it if he doesn't want.

548
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:22,671
- Wow... you really want to do this?
- Yeah.

549
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:25,088
- I think it's a perfect idea.
- Well...

550
00:48:25,297 --> 00:48:27,595
Alright, if you want to do it then...

551
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:29,679
You want me...

552
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,140
I would be honored.

553
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:36,102
- Judy, you would have been good too.
- Yeah.

554
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,780
<i>We gotta put the doorway up here.</i>

555
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:55,835
<i>A little more that way.
A little more.</i>

556
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
Yeah, right there.

557
00:48:56,963 --> 00:48:58,547
<i>¶ Big fun ¶</i>

558
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,466
<i>¶ No sleep ¶</i>

559
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,636
<i>¶ Faces ¶</i>

560
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:04,471
<i>¶ Face me ¶</i>

561
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:08,558
<i>¶ Come on! Save me ¶</i>

562
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:10,729
<i>¶ Hold on ¶</i>

563
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:12,106
<i>¶ Grow ¶</i>

564
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:17,696
<i>¶ All is love,
is love, is love ¶</i>

565
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:19,238
How about here?
You like it here?

566
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,911
Yeah, one more up there,
one more up there...

567
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:24,078
...and then we can have
the other mark over there.

568
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah. A little more this way.

569
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:28,290
Thats five, Carol.

570
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:31,293
And then seven Douglases across
we'll have the other mark.

571
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:32,962
- What you've been eating?
- Rocks.

572
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,048
Rocks? What did I tell you
about eating rocks?

573
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:37,176
- That's six.
- You're getting a little paunch.

574
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:38,055
I know.

575
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,305
Hey, KW.
- Hey, King.

576
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:41,683
How about here?

577
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:44,893
It needs seven Douglas's.
No more and no less.

578
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,775
- Seven chubby Douglases.
- Hey, Carol!

579
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:52,571
It's gonna be part castle, part fort,
part mountain, and part ship.

580
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:54,530
We'll have a laboratory,

581
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:57,742
...so we could build robots
to do stuff for us.

582
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,037
Our own detective agency,

583
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:01,915
and... and our own language.

584
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:05,170
And we'll make a machine
that can take our legs off...

585
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,172
...and that way we can float.

586
00:50:10,426 --> 00:50:11,593
<i>Alright, Carol!</i>

587
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:13,180
You smiled.

588
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:15,973
You can't deny that
this is a good idea.

589
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:17,599
I didn't deny it.

590
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:21,313
I believe part of that idea was mine.

591
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,148
What part?

592
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,861
The part where I said,
'Yeah, good idea. "

593
00:50:42,712 --> 00:50:43,714
I got it!

594
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:45,426
I got it.

595
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:50,473
Judith, that tickles.

596
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:01,194
I like the tunnel, Ira.
- Oh!

597
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,488
Impressive!

598
00:51:02,694 --> 00:51:04,530
Well , thank you, King.

599
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:09,704
Great beams, Douglas.

600
00:51:09,953 --> 00:51:11,249
Strong.

601
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:15,630
Thanks. They're just
the standard beams I always do.

602
00:52:18,953 --> 00:52:20,956
What were you doing
with Carol just now?

603
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,625
Just talking.

604
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,168
Oh, a secret, huh?

605
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:27,881
Well let me ask you something.
How does it work around here?

606
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,887
Are we all the same,
or are some of us better than others?

607
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,220
You like to play favorites, huh, King?

608
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:36,810
No. I like all you guys equally.

609
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:39,853
Don't give me that.
I can see how it is.

610
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:42,231
The King has a favorites,
that's really cute.

611
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:43,859
Stop!

612
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:45,321
Do you have a favorite color?

613
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:47,613
Hey, can I be your favorite color?

614
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:10,516
You know what?

615
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:13,226
You can't do that back to me.

616
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:16,774
If we're upset, your job is
not to get upset back at us.

617
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:19,025
Our job is to be upset.

618
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:22,196
If I get mad and wanna eat you,
then you have to say,

619
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:26,035
"Oh, okay! You can eat me!
I love you!"

620
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,411
"Whatever makes you happy, Judith. "

621
00:53:28,578 --> 00:53:30,874
That's what you're supposed to do.

622
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,880
Come on, Max.
Let's go get those sticks.

623
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,174
Yeah... okay.

624
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,176
I hope you heard me, King.

625
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:45,142
Yeah, he heard you, Judith.
Everyone always hears you.

626
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:51,398
You think you have power, K.W.?
That's not real power.

627
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,111
I'm talking to you!

628
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:58,573
No! Not you!
I'm still talking to K.W.!

629
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:08,000
Don't worry about Judith.
She's...

630
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:09,755
...a downer.

631
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,840
Now you figure it out.

632
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:16,346
Hey, you should talk to
Bob and Terry about it.

633
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:17,637
Come on!

634
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,182
King!

635
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:28,192
Seriously, they're really smart.

636
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:30,528
They have the answers to everything.

637
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:41,321
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm coming!

638
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:52,374
Well, what do you think?

639
00:55:56,424 --> 00:55:58,133
This is Bob and Terry.

640
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:03,139
They love it, when I do this to them.

641
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:06,935
Bob, Terry, this is Max...

642
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:09,562
...he's the biter
I was telling you about.

643
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:13,195
Say hi.

644
00:56:14,026 --> 00:56:15,030
Hi.

645
00:56:16,112 --> 00:56:18,407
He wanted to ask you guys
some advice.

646
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:24,041
Go ahead, they're not judgmental.

647
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,708
You mean just ask them?

648
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:28,920
Yeah.

649
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:31,882
They say it's better for you...

650
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:34,760
...if you can ask the question
in seven words.

651
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:39,767
Okay...

652
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:49,238
How.

653
00:56:49,652 --> 00:56:51,071
Do.

654
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:54,951
I. Make.

655
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:57,870
Everyone.

656
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,336
O...K?

657
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,301
Oh, yeah.
I didn't think of that.

658
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,223
Wow, they really get to the heart
of it, don't they?

659
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,226
Aren't they great?

660
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:19,062
What if they came and
lived with us?

661
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:21,232
Bob, Terry, why don't you
come live with us?

662
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:23,319
We're building something great!

663
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:27,781
Oh, good!
Right, Max?

664
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:32,706
What about Carol?

665
00:57:33,372 --> 00:57:34,958
He's Carol.

666
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:40,046
I can like him and still be friends
with Bob and Terry.

667
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:42,841
<i>¶ Heads up! Heads up!
Heads up! ¶</i>

668
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:47,432
<i>¶ You hold me up
You hold me down ¶</i>

669
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:53,812
<i>¶ Not talking about a holiday ¶</i>

670
00:57:53,895 --> 00:57:57,525
<i>¶ Pretend my feet are running away ¶</i>

671
00:57:57,611 --> 00:58:01,281
<i>¶ Well, if my feet don't touch the ground ¶</i>

672
00:58:01,864 --> 00:58:03,700
Hey, Douglas!

673
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:06,287
Hey, where's Carol?

674
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:10,873
He's in the fort.
Aft section, main chamber.

675
00:58:21,512 --> 00:58:23,808
Carol! Carol!
The fort looks great!

676
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:27,354
Yeah, thanks, we were all working
really hard on it.

677
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,732
- Where have you been?
- Well... I...

678
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:32,484
K.W. took me to see her friends
Bob and Terry.

679
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:36,197
They really wanna meet you.
They may even stay over.

680
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:44,333
Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?

681
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,337
What? K.W. told you about me?

682
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,257
- Hey, guys.
- What did she say?

683
00:58:51,382 --> 00:58:51,966
Really?

684
00:58:52,051 --> 00:58:54,468
Precious little Bob and Terry
get carried.

685
00:58:56,096 --> 00:58:58,724
Excuse me, my voice?
Oh, thank you!

686
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,518
Well, thank you.
You know, sometimes I...

687
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:08,692
I know. I know.
I'm a very lucky man.

688
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,158
Hey, do you guys know any jokes?

689
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,661
Who's there?

690
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,454
Loud interrupting cow...

691
00:59:20,626 --> 00:59:22,212
That's hilarious!

692
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,840
They're amazing, K.W.

693
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:27,132
Max, what's wrong with the fort?

694
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:29,929
I thought you said
it would be automatic.

695
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,262
What?

696
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,308
I thought you said if anybody
got in here we didn't want,

697
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:36,934
...the fort would automatically
cut their brains out.

698
00:59:37,059 --> 00:59:38,231
Carol?

699
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:40,192
Oh, well...

700
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:43,654
I thought that then, but...

701
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:48,952
I kinda decided that if we know them,
they should keep their brains.

702
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,711
Even if we don't know them
that well...

703
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,424
I think you should apologize
to Bob and Terry.

704
01:00:00,756 --> 01:00:02,760
I don't apologize to owls.

705
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,679
Owls are stupid!

706
01:00:05,011 --> 01:00:07,433
Carol, that's hateful.

707
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:09,892
Why did you bring them here?

708
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,899
This place was supposed to be for us!

709
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:18,110
They're not sleeping in our pile!

710
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:27,664
Gee, you're the best king ever.

711
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:29,750
You've changed everything.

712
01:00:53,905 --> 01:00:55,071
Hey, Carol.

713
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:59,533
I don't get
why she likes them so much.

714
01:01:01,706 --> 01:01:04,248
And I couldn't even understand
what they were saying...

715
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:06,170
...all I heard was squeaking.

716
01:01:11,302 --> 01:01:14,258
I couldn't really understand
what they were saying either.

717
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,764
- Really?
- Yeah.

718
01:01:22,354 --> 01:01:24,065
Now everybodys mad at me.

719
01:01:30,281 --> 01:01:32,284
Is there anything you can do to...

720
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,369
You know...

721
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:42,920
There's something I like to do,
that sometimes makes me feel better.

722
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,593
What is it?

723
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,427
Okay, we're gonna have a war!

724
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:53,058
And we are gonna completely
clobber each other!

725
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:57,313
- Clobber each other?
- Yeah, with huge dirt clods.

726
01:01:57,479 --> 01:02:00,108
I used to do it a ton
when I was a little kid.

727
01:02:00,192 --> 01:02:03,443
Yeah, we haven't had a
dirt clod fight in a long time...

728
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:05,529
Yeah, it's the best way
to have a fun together.

729
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:08,992
Yeah, life was simpler back then,
with the dirt clods.

730
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:11,415
- Yeah.
- So who wants to be a bad guy?

731
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:18,422
Okay. I'll pick one then.

732
01:02:19,964 --> 01:02:22,593
- Okay you're a bad guy.
- Yeah, saw that coming.

733
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:25,763
And then...
you're definitely a bad guy.

734
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:28,641
- What? Damn.
- And you can pick one other.

735
01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:30,604
I'm bad... really.

736
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:32,398
- Okay. We pick you.
- No.

737
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:34,817
No, I can't be a bad guy.
I'm the king.

738
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:36,067
I'm a good guy.

739
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:37,945
I'm a bad guy! I'm a bad guy!

740
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,990
- Okay. You can be a bad guy.
- I'm a bad guy!

741
01:02:40,031 --> 01:02:42,118
- Judy, I'm with you.
- Yeah. I heard.

742
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:43,703
And you...

743
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:48,667
- He's with you.
- Am I a good guy?

744
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,294
Yes, of course,
you have the best arm.

745
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:53,090
Hey, where were you?

746
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:56,090
I was just making sure,
Bob and Terry still have their brains.

747
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,177
- K.W.!
- They do.

748
01:02:58,258 --> 01:03:00,555
Hey K.W.,
you wanna be on my team?

749
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:03,058
- We're the bad guys.
- No, no... no, no.

750
01:03:03,141 --> 01:03:05,142
You're with us.
You're a good guy.

751
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:09,231
Hey, come on.
K.W., be a good guy.

752
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:11,653
Okay.
So, you're on my team.

753
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:14,573
You and me and Carol.

754
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,657
Hi, K.W.

755
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,748
So what we are gonna do is
we're gonna try to kill the bad guys...

756
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:26,335
...by beaning them in the head
with these dirt clods.

757
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:29,384
We're gonna try to find
the biggest pieces...

758
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:32,135
You didn't see that coming!

759
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:35,430
- Run!
- Yeah. You'd better run!

760
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:39,059
Hey, wait! We didn't make
the official starting noise!

761
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:43,107
Alright, come on!

762
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,537
Look out for the bad guys!

763
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:01,254
We got them pinned down!
They can't even move!

764
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,424
- Fire on three!
- Okay!

765
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:07,885
One, two, three!

766
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:10,056
You guys are gonna...

767
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,568
Wait, wait... wait, wait!
I have an idea!

768
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:22,904
Come out!

769
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,532
No!

770
01:04:26,284 --> 01:04:27,867
Why not?

771
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:31,582
Because you're gonna hit us
in the head with dirt.

772
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:34,709
Come out!

773
01:04:36,212 --> 01:04:37,631
No!

774
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:39,424
Why not?

775
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,595
Because when I said you were gonna
hit us in the head with dirt,

776
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:42,928
...you didn't say anything.

777
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:46,139
That means you're planning to hit us
in the head with dirt.

778
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:51,688
Man, they really have us figured out.

779
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:53,025
Yeah.

780
01:04:54,232 --> 01:04:56,235
Okay! Let's go!

781
01:04:56,486 --> 01:04:58,070
Charge!

782
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:00,240
Come on!

783
01:05:00,742 --> 01:05:02,868
Ira, help! Get Carol.

784
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,083
Oh, good shot.
I'm gonna get you!

785
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:22,184
Hey, who threw Richard?

786
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,935
Well, he's on our team now.

787
01:05:27,688 --> 01:05:29,985
- Gotcha!
- No animals!

788
01:05:30,652 --> 01:05:32,656
It really hurts. It's hurting!

789
01:05:33,406 --> 01:05:35,115
- Yeah!
- Hold!

790
01:05:42,209 --> 01:05:44,627
- Hey, Douglas. Get the goat.
- Okay.

791
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,546
- Knock his legs out!
- I got it.

792
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,885
That's cheating.
I'm not gonna play anymore.

793
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:52,970
- Alexander, come on!
- Do it again.

794
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:54,472
- Okay.
- Fight with us!

795
01:05:56,682 --> 01:05:58,977
That's... That's not fair.

796
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,688
- Are you crazy?
- You're supposed to get hit, it's a war.

797
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:04,191
That wasn't fair.
Douglas hit me when I was hurt.

798
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:06,278
You can't hit someone,
when they're hurt.

799
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:08,572
- I quit.
- Get back in here right now.

800
01:06:08,614 --> 01:06:10,241
Alex! Count to ten.

801
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:11,785
- Things will be better.
- Alexander, don't you cry!

802
01:06:11,826 --> 01:06:13,954
If I count to ten then
you'll be gone, Ira?

803
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,874
- Don't you dare talk to Ira the way I do!
- Knock it off!

804
01:06:18,043 --> 01:06:19,043
That's my eye!

805
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:20,796
Come on!

806
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:22,922
Look out! Duck!

807
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:27,595
Yeah!

808
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:42,071
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.

809
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,329
What happened?
Somebody stepped on your head?

810
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,121
What are you doing?

811
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:51,750
What?

812
01:06:51,956 --> 01:06:53,542
You stepped on my head!

813
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:55,671
What do you mean?
It's a war!

814
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,338
Douglas just did it.

815
01:06:57,425 --> 01:07:00,258
Yeah, but he did it by accident.
You did it on purpose!

816
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:03,597
And he didn't step on
the face part of my head!

817
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,060
It was a joke.

818
01:07:07,852 --> 01:07:09,268
I was just joking.

819
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:10,938
Sure you were.

820
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:15,153
Like you aren't always looking for
the opportunity to step on my head.

821
01:07:15,361 --> 01:07:17,196
Because that's what you do.

822
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:23,079
Fine, fine.
You know what?

823
01:07:23,328 --> 01:07:26,870
This is exactly why I don't ever wanna
do anything with you anymore.

824
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:28,835
Go ahead.

825
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,171
Step on my head.

826
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,259
No. Forget it. I'm not going
to step on your head...

827
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,300
...just to make you feel better.

828
01:07:40,475 --> 01:07:41,644
Let's go, Douglas.

829
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:44,519
Carol, I think you did
the right thing...

830
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:47,233
...you know,
not stepping on her head.

831
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:13,098
Thanks, Max. But I'm done.

832
01:08:14,306 --> 01:08:16,432
I don't know,
why I came back here.

833
01:08:17,937 --> 01:08:19,937
I'm glad I met you, I guess.

834
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,956
So King. What's going on?

835
01:08:36,206 --> 01:08:39,046
This is how you rule a kingdom?
Everyone fighting?

836
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:42,881
The bad guys feel bad.
Everyone feels bad.

837
01:08:44,885 --> 01:08:48,141
Yeah. I'm still sorta dizzy
and my eyeballs feel loose.

838
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:51,224
Oh, can it, Ira?
Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.

839
01:08:51,348 --> 01:08:52,520
No!

840
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:56,815
Max will bring K.W. back.

841
01:08:57,693 --> 01:08:59,528
He'll keep us all together.

842
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,697
He has powers. He told us.

843
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:04,448
Right, Max?

844
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,494
Show us.

845
01:09:34,902 --> 01:09:37,739
Oh, somebody broke the king.

846
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:39,950
I don't get it.

847
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:42,663
Oh, wait, I do.
It's stupid.

848
01:09:46,584 --> 01:09:48,584
I think he's done now.

849
01:09:49,798 --> 01:09:51,798
That's what we waited for?

850
01:10:37,853 --> 01:10:39,856
Carol?

851
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:59,869
Hi.

852
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:38,831
Is that from the dirt clods?

853
01:12:38,915 --> 01:12:39,915
Yeah.

854
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:43,129
It's from when you had
Douglas hit me.

855
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:48,426
I'm sorry about that.

856
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:54,851
It's okay.

857
01:12:58,897 --> 01:13:01,318
No one really listens to you, huh?

858
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:03,610
Oh, you've noticed.

859
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:07,240
Yeah. I guess you're not...

860
01:13:07,492 --> 01:13:10,119
...used to that being a king and all.

861
01:13:18,753 --> 01:13:21,050
I really messed this place up.

862
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:31,311
Youre not really a king, huh?

863
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,980
You're just regular.

864
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:41,490
I knew it.

865
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:46,788
I don't even know
if there's such a thing as...

866
01:13:47,036 --> 01:13:50,000
...a king who can do
all the things you said.

867
01:13:52,336 --> 01:13:53,629
Look...

868
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,548
I don't care.

869
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:59,888
Just don't ever let Carol find out.

870
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:23,039
Why did you leave us?

871
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:52,576
Hey, Max.

872
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:55,036
What's that?

873
01:14:55,452 --> 01:14:58,290
Well, I was thinking
we needed a place...

874
01:14:59,832 --> 01:15:01,419
...where the king is secret.

875
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:04,340
Like a...
Like a secret chamber for the king.

876
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:06,883
Well, I don't understand... What...

877
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:10,639
Well, you know like a...
like a small place.

878
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:13,349
With a door that's not so big.

879
01:15:14,434 --> 01:15:16,021
I don't know...

880
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:18,854
I didn't picture it with
a secret doors.

881
01:15:23,696 --> 01:15:27,574
What if it were a big place
with big secret doors?

882
01:15:29,327 --> 01:15:33,206
That... That's not really
how it would be done.

883
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:36,669
It's more like... it's like a...

884
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:44,345
About that big?

885
01:15:56,025 --> 01:15:57,736
<i>Everybody, get out here!</i>

886
01:15:59,824 --> 01:16:01,115
<i>Wake up!</i>

887
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:03,660
<i>Everybody wake up!</i>

888
01:16:04,702 --> 01:16:06,287
<i>And get out here!</i>

889
01:16:08,585 --> 01:16:10,168
<i>- Ira, what is that?
- Everybody wake up!</i>

890
01:16:10,209 --> 01:16:11,624
It's Carol.

891
01:16:12,462 --> 01:16:14,048
<i>I knew this was gonna happen.</i>

892
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,467
It's all wrong.

893
01:16:16,843 --> 01:16:18,428
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

894
01:16:18,595 --> 01:16:20,430
<i>Judith, what's happening right now?</i>

895
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:21,974
<i>Judith?</i>

896
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,727
Wake up and come out here.

897
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:24,978
What is it?

898
01:16:25,062 --> 01:16:27,062
- Get out here!
- What's he talking about?

899
01:16:27,231 --> 01:16:28,522
It's wrong!

900
01:16:29,272 --> 01:16:30,441
I can't even look at it.

901
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,027
- What is it?
- The fort.

902
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:34,321
- We gotta tear the fort down.
- What?

903
01:16:34,488 --> 01:16:36,907
- It wasn't supposed to be like this!
- No, Carol.

904
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,828
You said we were all going to
sleep together in a real pile,

905
01:16:39,953 --> 01:16:41,789
...and now you want a secret room...

906
01:16:42,246 --> 01:16:43,541
...and K.W. is gone for good.

907
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,626
And now I have to worry
if the sun is gonna die.

908
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:47,503
- The sun?
- Look at it. It didn't come up!

909
01:16:47,587 --> 01:16:49,423
- It's dead.
- What?

910
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:50,507
- Oh, my God!
- Dead!

911
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:52,553
- Carol, stop!
- It's dead! It's dead.

912
01:16:52,635 --> 01:16:54,928
- You're scaring everybody.
- It's morning.

913
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:57,016
The sun's not dead.
It's just nighttime.

914
01:16:57,057 --> 01:17:00,184
How do you know?
I can't trust what you say.

915
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:02,146
Everything keeps changing.

916
01:17:02,397 --> 01:17:03,816
Alright, come on, Douglas.
We're ripping it down.

917
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:05,903
Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!

918
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:06,986
It was supposed to be a place...

919
01:17:07,068 --> 01:17:09,696
...where only things you wanted
to have happen would happen.

920
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:11,573
Come on, Douglas,
do what I tell you.

921
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:14,746
No! We all live here,
not just you.

922
01:17:15,996 --> 01:17:18,833
It's everybody's.
It's Judith and Ira and everybody.

923
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:19,917
Oh, finally!

924
01:17:19,959 --> 01:17:21,379
You were supposed
to keep us safe.

925
01:17:21,461 --> 01:17:23,463
You were supposed to take
care of us, and you didn't.

926
01:17:23,548 --> 01:17:25,009
- Carol?
- I'm sorry!

927
01:17:25,093 --> 01:17:27,092
- That's not good enough.
- Carol?

928
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:28,843
You're a terrible King!

929
01:17:28,887 --> 01:17:30,472
- Carol!
- What?

930
01:17:31,974 --> 01:17:33,558
He is not our King.

931
01:17:33,643 --> 01:17:34,644
What?

932
01:17:34,937 --> 01:17:36,228
Don't say that.

933
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:38,439
How could you say that?
Don't you dare say that.

934
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:41,152
There's no such thing as a king.

935
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:42,780
Don't you say that!

936
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:44,153
He's just a boy...

937
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:47,909
...pretending to be a wolf
pretending to be a king.

938
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,163
- That's not true!
- He's just like us.

939
01:17:50,621 --> 01:17:52,041
- Why don't I listen to myself?
- No! No!

940
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:53,291
That's not true!

941
01:17:53,332 --> 01:17:57,003
Look, I just went along with it because
I knew you wanted it so much.

942
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:59,716
- Don't say that!
- No! Carol, stop it!

943
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:02,762
Stop it!
What are you doing?

944
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:03,804
- Carol!
- What?

945
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:07,893
- That was my favorite arm.
- Well, I was just holding on to it.

946
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,019
- You pulled away.
- What?

947
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:11,018
- Carol, stop it!
- You lied!

948
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:13,523
- You're out of control!
- I'm not out of control!

949
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:16,443
You were supposed to take
care of us. You promised.

950
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:18,153
I'll eat you up!

951
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:37,845
Come back here!

952
01:18:40,138 --> 01:18:41,433
Carol!

953
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,729
Max!

954
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:46,522
Max!

955
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:52,738
Come on. Come here.

956
01:18:58,202 --> 01:18:59,621
Get in, get inside!

957
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:03,624
Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
I'll hide you!

958
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:21,772
- Hi, Richard.
- Max!

959
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:24,985
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know!</i>

960
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,236
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know!</i>

961
01:19:26,318 --> 01:19:28,030
I can smell him!

962
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,535
I just want to talk to him.

963
01:19:31,618 --> 01:19:34,329
- You're out of control!
- I'm not out of control!

964
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:37,540
<i>- You were gonna eat him!
- No, no... I want...</i>

965
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,042
<i>I wasn't gonna...</i>

966
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:41,216
I dont know... I just said it.

967
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:49,598
Am I as bad as he says I am?

968
01:19:51,184 --> 01:19:52,768
<i>Just go away.</i>

969
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:57,065
<i>I just wanted us all to be together...</i>

970
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,921
Can you believe him?

971
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:24,766
He doesn't mean to be that way, K.W.

972
01:20:30,145 --> 01:20:32,151
He's just scared.

973
01:20:37,194 --> 01:20:39,614
Well, he only makes it harder.

974
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:43,453
And it's hard enough already.

975
01:20:49,419 --> 01:20:51,004
But he loves you.

976
01:20:51,254 --> 01:20:53,256
You're his family.

977
01:20:55,759 --> 01:20:57,179
Yeah.

978
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:00,389
It's hard being a family.

979
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,696
I can't breathe that well in here.

980
01:21:11,903 --> 01:21:13,613
Can you get me out?

981
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:54,331
I wish you guys had a mom.

982
01:22:02,881 --> 01:22:04,886
I'm gonna go home.

983
01:22:30,082 --> 01:22:31,500
Carol!

984
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:44,960
Max.

985
01:23:52,096 --> 01:23:53,515
Well...

986
01:23:54,889 --> 01:23:56,184
Yeah.

987
01:23:58,352 --> 01:23:59,647
Yeah.

988
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:14,498
So whatever happened with you
and the Vikings?

989
01:24:17,168 --> 01:24:19,004
Well, in the end, I...

990
01:24:19,963 --> 01:24:21,548
...had to leave.

991
01:24:21,798 --> 01:24:23,092
Why?

992
01:24:26,804 --> 01:24:29,432
I'm not a Viking or a king or...

993
01:24:31,309 --> 01:24:32,728
...or anything.

994
01:24:35,396 --> 01:24:36,816
So what are you?

995
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,120
<i>I'm Max.</i>

996
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,879
Well, that's not very much, is it?

997
01:25:28,879 --> 01:25:30,465
Hey, Max?

998
01:25:32,259 --> 01:25:33,424
Yeah?

999
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,348
When you go home will you say
good things about us?

1000
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:42,395
Yeah. Bye, Bull.

1001
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,360
Thanks, Max.

1002
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:17,649
You're the first king
we haven't eaten.

1003
01:26:17,814 --> 01:26:19,816
Yeah, that's true.

1004
01:26:25,069 --> 01:26:26,364
See ya.

1005
01:26:27,032 --> 01:26:28,324
Bye, Max.

1006
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:30,244
Bye.

1007
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:31,056
Don't go.

1008
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,765
I'll eat you up, I love you so.
