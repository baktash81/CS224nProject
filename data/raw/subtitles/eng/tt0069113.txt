00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,229
- Engine room, is the chief still there?
MAN: Yes, sir.

2
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,065
- It's the captain, put him on.
MAN: Aye, aye, sir.

3
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,154
CHIEF: Are you making contact?
MAN: Yeah, I'm making contact.

4
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,951
Chief, the captain wants
you on the phone.

5
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,954
Chief here, go ahead.

6
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,791
What's going on? Anything more
you can do with the stabilizers?

7
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,586
Nothing's wrong with the stabilizers
so there's nothing more I can do.

8
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,297
Besides, my hands are full
with this pump!

9
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,176
You know what the trouble is.
It's that bastard Linarcos.

10
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,597
Care to repeat yourself?
He's standing right here.

11
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,933
CHIEF:
Good, I hope he heard me!

12
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,188
All right, Joe, do the best you can
until we clear this weather.

13
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,330
- Where the devil did you come from?
- From my cabin, sir.

14
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,458
Don't you realize it's
dangerous out there?

15
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,628
You said come up anytime.
Robin Shelby...

16
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,963
...remember?

17
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,466
You picked a particularly
fascinating moment to come here.

18
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,135
The waves don't bother you?

19
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,679
I've surfed up to 18 feet.

20
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,809
- But these look more like 30.
- Thirty-five to be exact.

21
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,145
Some get up to 300.

22
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,315
- I find 60 about maximum. Steady up.
MAN: Steady up, sir.

23
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,328
- Bring her up.
- Bring her up, sir.

24
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,913
Hang on!

25
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,678
- All lifelines rigged?
- All except C deck, sir.

26
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,599
When I order all lifelines rigged
it includes C deck. See to it.

27
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,893
Wow, surf's really up.

28
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,603
- Master Shelby.
- Yes, sir?

29
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,023
We'll continue our discussion
another time. Fair enough?

30
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,900
Aye, aye, sir.

31
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,862
That last one almost
broached us, Linarcos.

32
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,908
I warned you. We should've
loaded extra bunkers in Gibraltar.

33
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,370
We are top-heavy and when
that pump is repaired...

34
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,247
...I am taking on more ballast.

35
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,710
- Where next?
- Mr. And Mrs. Rogo, M45.

36
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,598
- Yeah?
- I'm Dr. Caravello. You asked for me.

37
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,475
All morning.

38
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,895
- You the only doctor on this tub?
CARAVELLO: The only ship doctor.

ROGO:
What if somebody was dying?

40
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,235
Oh, my God, who's not dying?

41
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,113
Three-quarters of the
passengers are sick, Mr. Rogo.

42
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,073
We have to take them in rotation.

43
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,493
Use one of these now,
another in 8 hours...

44
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,371
...and remain in bed
until the sea is calm.

45
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,581
Hold it, hold it.

46
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,502
You mean we had to wait all
this time for you to come...

47
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,007
...and give her some pills?
And some crap about staying in bed?

48
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,261
How do you know she's just seasick?
Look at her!

49
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,848
It could be something else.
You didn't even examine her.

50
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,810
Oh, shoot me, Mike.
For chrissake, just shoot me.

51
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,729
ROGO:
You see how sick she is?

52
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,525
I'll tell you what this is.
It's food poisoning, that's what.

53
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,946
How is she gonna swallow pills
when she can't even swallow water?

54
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,283
They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo.

55
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,701
You...

56
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,370
...don't swallow them.

What do you do with them?

58
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,669
I know what to do with suppositories.
Just get them out of here!

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,588
Oh, hon...

60
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,341
Nurse, I think we should
continue with our rounds.

61
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,350
I still think it's food poisoning.

62

- That Martin, he's crazy.
- I like that man.

67
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,021
Of course you like him. Why shouldn't
you? He runs on time like a train.

68
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,856
You and trains.

69
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,401
When, in my whole life,
did I ever run for a train?

70
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,697
Who cried for a week when
they tore down the 3rd Avenue EI?

71
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,866
Yeah.

72
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,453
He's lonely.

73
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,041
That's why he runs,
so you won't notice.

74
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,962
Says here there's a package
tour to the mountain...

75

...where Moses received
the Ten Commandments.

No.

When we finally get to Israel,
we're gonna stay put, no traveling.

We're gonna get to know our grandson.

Just think, he's 2 years old already.
He's talking.

80

We've never even seen him.

81
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,905
Get down on your knees
and pray to God for help...

82
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,783
...and then maybe everything
will work out?

83

Not where I come from.

...in a cold water flat in February.

87
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,007
And icicles would grow
from your upraised palms.

you burn the furniture...

...but you get off your knees.

But realistic.

00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,769
John, use your church for something
more than prayer.

92

you're still ordained.

- The best kind.

...on a map to find out
where I was going.

101

My bishop doesn't know, but he's
given me exactly what I wanted:

102
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,804
Elbow room. Freedom!

103
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:21,894
Real freedom. Freedom to dump
all the rules and all the trappings.

104
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,980
And freedom to discover God
in my own way.

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,901

Nobody will sleep through it.

enough ballast yet to run full ahead.

00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,525

He has a plan for humanity that
stretches beyond our comprehension.

172
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,617
So we can't expect Him to concern
Himself with the individual.

173
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,996
The individual is important
only to the extent...

174
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,666
...of providing a creative link
between the past and the future...

175
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,545
...in his children,
or in his grandchildren...

out from all the people on this boat...

...to sit at the captain's table
on New Year's Eve?

I'll tell you one thing it means.

it might lead to the engine room.
