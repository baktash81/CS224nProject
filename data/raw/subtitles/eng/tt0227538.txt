Carmen, Juni, time for bed.

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,856
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.

5
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,362
- Juni, don't forget to brush--
- I am, I am.

00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,989
All right, all right.

Everything OK at school?

10

Yeah. It's good. It's fine.

"The Two Spies
Who Fell In Love."

15
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,767
Hmm. Wow.

16
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,062
I haven't told that one

You probably remember that
better than I do.

- I'm listening.

OK.

Once upon a time...

21
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,283
there was a man and a woman.

22

he from another.

- He was her mission.
- Correct.

26
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,255
Her mission was to take him out.

dark and confusing times.

were their minds.

38

Those men and women were spies.

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,139
They were masters of disguise.

40
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,267
They could sense danger
a mile away...

41
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,935

The only things spies
were truly afraid of...

45

were other spies--

46
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,327
enemy spies.

47
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,121
So, sometimes,
one spy's mission...

48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,500
was to make
the enemy disappear.

49
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,338
He was the assignment
that changed her life...

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,507
but when the moment
finally came...

51
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,841
to carry out her mission...

52
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,473
she couldn't do it.

53
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,645
He was different
than she expected.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,652
Sure, he was charming
and intelligent...

55
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,824
but he was
unexpectedly honorable...

56
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,325
and it made her realize...

57
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,577
how years of working
with detached emotion...

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,038
had taken its toll.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,874
So they kept contact...

60
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,211
through lunch dates--
very discreet.

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,963
After all,
they were on different sides...

62
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,298
so they could never
be seen together.

63

travels took them.

65

And they fell in love...

66
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,015
and they decided
that, together...

67
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,850
they would embark...

that only the most courageous
and slightly insane need apply.

There's such an amazing

its research...

We all have our reasons, hmm?

567
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,451
There was someone else
on that research team, hmm?

who could rebuild it.

00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,722
I think we all
have uncles like that.

900
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:45,850
"Another fine Machete product."

901
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:50,355
You make the best spy inventions
in the world.

902
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,731
MA CHETE: That's correct.

903
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:54,442
CARMEN: But you sell them
to both sides, good and bad.

904
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:57,278
That's why Dad hasn't spoken
of you in all these years.

905
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,573
JUNI: Ever sell stuff to Floop?

906
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,243
Why?

907
00:54:03,284 --> 00:54:04,369
CARMEN: Our Mom and Dad--

908
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:06,454
your brother--
are his prisoners...

909
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:08,415
and if we don't
do something to help...

910
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:11,501
something really bad's
gonna happen to them.

911
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,044
I don't see why
you won't help him !

912
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:15,880
You think I want to baby-sit
my brother the rest of my life?

913
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,882
"Watch out for Gregorio.
Take care of Gregorio.

914
00:54:17,882 --> 00:54:19,718
"Make sure Gregorio
knows right from wrong."

915
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:20,844
Not anymore.

916
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:24,514
Machete's not responsible
for nobody but Machete.

917
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,726
But that's not what family is.

918
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:30,395
We're just brothers.
Cain and Abel were brothers.

919
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,522
Look how they ended up.

920
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:35,859
Now, the only thing
that will get you...

921
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,029
to Floop's castle fast enough...

922
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,281
is this.

923
00:54:41,364 --> 00:54:42,782
It's tiny.

924
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,452
It's built for one passenger,
but it's fast.

925
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,328
Will you go?

926
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,580
No.

927
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:51,499
- For your brother?
- No!

928
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:54,419
Then how about for us...
your niece and nephew?

929
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:56,713
No.

930
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:06,264
- How about if--
- No! No! A million times no!

931
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:08,266
Pass the pig intestines.

932
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:14,981
I'm not eating that now. Nope.

933
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:18,693
- Can I have a--
- No!

934
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,403
Glass of water?

935
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,739
Thank you for letting us
stay here...

936
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,158
while we ponder
our parents' terrible fate.

937
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,870
If you weren't a Cortez,
I wouldn't be doing this much.

938
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:31,081
So family does mean more to you
than money.

939
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,126
No.

940
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:37,629
Dad misses you, too.

941
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:48,890
Ready?

942
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,433
Let's go.

943
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,440
CARMEN: Now we're talkin'.

944
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:02,278
[Snoring]

945
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,572
[Whispering]
What are you doing?

946
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:06,616
Getting the map
to Floop's castle.

947
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:11,079
Shh. It's just a reflex.

948
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:12,831
Look. He's still asleep.

949
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,958
[Snores loudly]

950
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:20,338
[Snoring]

951
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:28,388
Never send an adult
to do a kid's job.

952
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,811
CARMEN: Oh, yeah.

953
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,569
What can I do to help?

954
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,238
Remember that spy plane
up on the roof?

955
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,198
Yeah.

956
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,367
Start reading.

957
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,619
Oh. Homework.

958
00:56:51,661 --> 00:56:53,121
[Rooster crows]

959
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:55,373
[Groans]

960
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:58,126
[Engines warming up]

961
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:03,965
No!

962
00:57:05,091 --> 00:57:07,969
CARMEN: Hurry up!
He's coming ! He's coming !

963
00:57:10,513 --> 00:57:12,349
JUNI: Good-bye, Uncle Machete!

964
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,725
CARMEN: Thanks for the plane!

965
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:36,956
CARMEN:
OK, so here's the new plan.

966
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:38,500
We get to the castle,
rescue Mom and Dad...

967
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:39,834
then somehow stop Floop...

968
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:41,711
from using the brain
on the robots...

969
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:44,506
before they're sent out
to dominate the world.

970
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:47,425
- Think we can do that?
- How hard could it be?

971
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,761
[Alarms sounding]

972
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:52,931
I didn't do anything.

973
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:57,060
OK. Airspeed--fine.
Altitude--fine.

974
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,813
CARMEN: Autopilot...failing?

975
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:03,274
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.

976
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:05,318
Take control.
We have to go to manual.

977
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:07,237
Now!

978
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:10,073
CARMEN: You were supposed
to read all the instructions!

979
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,160
You skipped a chapter, meathead.

980
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:16,663
Better stop calling me names.

981
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,373
Pull up, booger breath !

982
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,125
Stop it or I'll call you names.

983
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,961
CARMEN: Go ahead.
You got nothin' on me, warthog.

984
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:27,549
Try me...diaper lady.

985
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,761
Aha.
Hope you're wearing one now.

986
00:58:31,803 --> 00:58:34,931
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.

987
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,392
Mom made me swear
not to mention it.

988
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:40,270
So now we're even !

989
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:42,522
CARMEN: Oh, now you've done it!

990
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:45,775
I knew this was gonna happen !

991
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:48,361
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something !

992
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,324
CARMEN: You did that
on purpose, you kamikaze!

993
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,161
JUNI: But now it's balanced!

994
00:58:56,202 --> 00:58:57,537
Landing gear.

995
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,542
No landing gear.
We're gonna crash !

996
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:05,920
CARMEN:
Nope. We're gonna drop.

997
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:07,380
Get your regulator ready.

998
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:28,193
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?

999
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,235
Yeah.

1000
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:33,114
Let's try that cave over there.

1001
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:37,577
CARMEN:
The water's warmer in here.

1002
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,788
JUNI: Oh, I just peed.

1003
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:42,165
- Ecch.
- Sorry.

1004
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:03,937
A Thumb-thumb.

1005
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:05,689
A real live--

1006
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:31,673
What did you do to him?

1007
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,758
Machete's electroshock gumballs.

1008
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,886
It says long lasting.
But I don't trust wrappers.

1009
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:49,024
Come on.

1010
01:00:56,948 --> 01:00:59,617
CARMEN:
Over here. Juni, come on.

1011
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:05,248
What are you doing?

1012
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,875
World's smallest cameras.

1013
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:10,295
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.

1014
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:13,631
- Sweet.
- Thanks.

1015
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:18,428
Thumb-thumbs and Fooglies
coming up the south hall.

1016
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:22,599
Got an idea?

1017
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,225
Yeah.

1018
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:38,823
JUNI: Agent Donnagon?

1019
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:42,702
[Speaking backwards]

1020
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:44,996
Where's my mom and dad?

1021
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:49,125
[Speaking backwards]

1022
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,418
Thanks.

- I got it.
- What'd he say?

1024
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:56,633
I'll play it backwards.

1025

DONNAGON:
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.

1026
01:01:58,968 --> 01:02:00,428
See if they know
where the Brain room is.

1027
01:02:04,307 --> 01:02:05,725
Uh-oh.

1028
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,144
Thumb-thumbs--everywhere.

1029
01:02:08,186 --> 01:02:09,646
Let's see if they like bubbles.

1030
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:24,911
We'll be back for you,
fellow agents.

1031
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,454
Sknaht!

1032
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,415
[Jabbering excitedly]

1033
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:30,500
MINION ON P.A.:
All robots please report...

1034
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:34,504
to docking bays four, five,
and six for immediate loading.

1035
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:37,048
This is the ventilator shaft
here.

1036
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,218
CARMEN: But the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.

1037
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,971
How do we get there undetected?

1038
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:56,735
[Whispering] I think
they've gotten smarter...

1039
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:57,986
since the last time we met.

1040
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,404
Intruder.

intruder, intruder,
intruder, intruder...

1043
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:14,044
- Can you make it?
- I think so.

1044
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,546
Come on. Come on !

1045
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:21,176
- Carmen !
- Find Mom and Dad !

1046
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:33,271
I hope this leads
to the dungeon.

1047
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:42,822
FLOOP: You there.

1048
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:46,910
What's that on your hands?

1049
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,749
FLOOP: Warts, aren't they?

1050
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,292
Oh, great.

1051
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:57,420
From sweaty hands sprout warts.

1052
01:03:57,462 --> 01:04:00,423
FLOOP: Do you know why
you have sweaty hands?

1053
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,592
From being scared all the time.

1054
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,389
You don't look
very scared to me.

1055
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:10,975
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents...

1056
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:15,146
made psycho robot children,
and swallowed up my sister.

1057
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:16,981
But I didn't want any of that.

1058
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:20,902
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?

1059
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,617
You watch my show?

1060
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:29,411
More than you know.

1061
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,583
Alexander Minion.

1062
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,794
Agent Cortez.

1063
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,796
Wonderful to see you again.

1064
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,549
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1065
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:44,551
He was on
the Third Brain Project...

1066
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:47,053
until I noticed
he was trying to inject...

1067
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,889
his own ideas into the system.

1068
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:51,641
I turned him in.

1069
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:54,227
He was thrown out of the OSS.

1070
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:58,398
MINION: I'm afraid I'm not
nearly the artist Floop is.

1071
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,066
But not to worry.

1072
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:02,736
I have something else in mind.

1073
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:09,200
What do you think you're going
to accomplish by doing this?

1074
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:10,952
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...

1075
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:14,372
I've always been methodical,
goal oriented.

1076
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:15,832
Psychotically so.

1077
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:18,335
I'm not afraid of you, Alex.

1078
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,503
So I think it's refreshing...

1079
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:23,381
to every once in a while...

1080
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,884
have some fun.

1081
01:05:25,925 --> 01:05:27,469
MINION: Oh, and don't worry
about your little brats.

1082
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,554
They'll still be able
to see you.

1083
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:32,932
Every weekday morning
between 7:30 and 8:00.

1084
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,690
CARMEN: Aah !

1085
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:42,275
Uhh !

1086
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,949
[Clanking and whirring]

1087
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:08,718
I trust this time Floop
will have a success to show us.

1088
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,347
The Fabulous Floop is away
on other business, sir.

1089
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:14,182
Your army is complete.

1090
01:06:14,224 --> 01:06:17,227
The ultimate destructive force
is now within your grasp.

1091
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:20,355
I'll believe that when I see it.

1092
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,112
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.

1093
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:31,700
It's good to be back, Alex.

1094
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,660
Let's never have children.

1095
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:37,497
- So Minion is the evil one.
- Yes.

1096
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,499
FLOOP: But I will be blamed.

1097
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,543
You have every reason
to be disappointed in me.

1098
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:44,546
So what would you do if you
could shut this thing off...

1099
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:46,047
and get out of here?

1100
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,842
It's impossible. It can only be
turned off from the outside.

1101
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:51,511
Just suppose.

1102
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:54,055
I'd stop Minion.

1103
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:56,433
FLOOP: I'd stop
the robot army and hope...

1104
01:06:56,474 --> 01:06:58,143
that the world would forgive me.

1105
01:06:58,226 --> 01:06:59,519
[Gagging]

1106
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:02,397
You're my hero, Floop...

1107
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:06,151
so I'm gonna help you,
then you're gonna help me.

1108
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:09,279
- Minion must be stopped.
- Just one thing.

1109
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:13,324
My show--what does it need?

1110
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:15,785
I know it needs
something desperately...

1111
01:07:15,827 --> 01:07:17,996
but I can't figure it out.

1112
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,789
Maybe you can?

1113
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:22,375
It needs children.

1114
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:25,587
Hold still.

1115
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:38,683
Now let's stop Minion.

1116
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:42,312
Must be stopped.
Must be stopped !

1117
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,234
This one's for my sister!

1118
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,739
Oh, Juni.

1119
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,366
Hola.

1120
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,372
Carmen? Juni?

1121
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:03,541
- Mom !
- Mom ! Aah !

1122
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,168
That's my Fooglie!

1123
01:08:06,419 --> 01:08:08,922
The one I drew.

1124
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:14,636
It's dad.

1125
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,179
You're here!

1126
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:20,392
- What's he doing here?
- He's OK. He's OK.

1127
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:22,686
INGRID: How did you get here?

1128
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,943
Mom, I've been skipping school,
going places...

1129
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,403
taking ferry rides...

1130
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:33,571
in the city...

1131
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:41,204
INGRID:
It's OK. It's OK. I know.

1132
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:42,747
We'll talk about it
when we get home.

1133
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:45,166
- Running off to Belize.
- What? You went where?

1134
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,544
You're right. Let's just talk
about this when we get home.

1135
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:49,045
No, no, no, no.

1136
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:51,715
You can tell me
everything now, OK?

1137
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:54,050
Is that where you want to be,
free from your family?

1138
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:55,635
Hey!

1139
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,348
I used to. Not anymore.

1140
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,312
You turned my dad
into a Fooglie?

1141
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,480
No, I didn't.

1142
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:11,484
But I might be able
to change him back.

1143
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,080
[Squeaking]

1144
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,712
MINION: Gentlemen...

1145
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:33,798
your army marches to meet us
as we speak.

1146
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,592
MINION: Your faith
and your patience...

1147
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,302
have meant more than you know.

1148
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:40,347
I speak for Mr. Floop
when I say that the value...

1149
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,058
we place on partnership is--

1150
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:45,060
FLOOP: Minion! This is Floop.

1151
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,020
Please report
to the robotics lab at once.

1152
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,481
We have huge, major, big-time
problems with the robots.

1153
01:09:49,522 --> 01:09:52,192
LISP: I thought you said
Floop wasn't here.

1154
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:53,735
He's not.

1155
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:57,405
FLOOP: A problem, Mr. Minion,
as in mucho grande problemo.

1156
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:58,948
I'm gonna...

1157
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,825
just be a moment.

1158

FLOOP: Minion!

01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,875
Floop?

1160
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,044
Where are you?

1161
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:13,046
FLOOP: Behind you.

1162
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,841
What do you think you're doing?

1163
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:18,385
You're supposed to be in line
with the others.

1164

[Using Minion's voice] You're
supposed to be with the others.

- Stop that.
- Stop that!

- Stop that this instant!
- Stop that this instant!

Stop that right now!

1168
01:10:27,894 --> 01:10:29,604
Or what?

01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:32,440
No.

Clever boy you've got there,
Cortez. Very clever indeed.

1171

Yes.
He gets that from his mother.

in exchange for your daughter?

01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:56,756
I am going to show you
what happens...

1177
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,717
when you cross the line
and involve family.

1178
01:10:58,758 --> 01:11:02,220

nice and comfortable.

We have to keep the army
from leaving the castle.

1188
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:43,345
Our only chance is to get
to the control room...

1189
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:45,597
and hope that their missions
have not been programmed.

1190
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:46,848
And what if they have?

1191
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,559
Then there's no one on earth
who can stop them.

1192
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:53,563
- One at a time.
- Go. Go.

1193
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:01,946
Left, left, left, left!

1194
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:04,824
That way.
Where's Mom and Dad?

from here?

- Can't you remove it?
- We can't take 500 brains out!

1201
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:22,133
- So don't. Just reprogram it.
- That would take weeks!

1202
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:24,594
- Just two words.
- A binary switch. Of course.

1203
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:27,097
So they would define
right as wrong...

1204
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:30,100
And wrong as right. Come on.

1205
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:31,685

Oh, don't worry.
I think it's reversible.

1216
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,520
Careful.

They're stronger
and smarter now.

1218

known you were behind this.

to your children.

their allowance.

now would be a good time...

1234
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:37,394
to see a demonstration of your
wonderfully demonic children.

1235
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:38,561
Certainly.

1236
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:48,655
Argh !

1237
01:14:55,453 --> 01:14:57,747
Your parents
were so easy to capture...

1238
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:59,416

1239
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:02,210
Poor little Juni.

1240
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:05,171
Defenseless and weak.

1241
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:14,347
You're a worthless
little squirt.

1242
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:19,602
Juni! Don't listen to her.
You're not worthless!

1243
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,647
You figured out
how to get us here.

1244
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:26,151
You helped Floop realize
he was good, not bad.

1245
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:28,695
You talked to the Fooglies
and saved Mom and Dad.

1246
