1
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,388
"So, even though he wanted
to do a lot as President,

2
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:18,758
"he died of pneumonia
after only 32 days.

3
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,561
"So, we can all learn
from William Henry Harrison

4
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:23,830
"to wear our coats
and wash our hands,

5
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,698
"so we have
better immune systems.

6
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,633
"The end."

7
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,108
Good job, Annie.

8
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:38,111
Okay, Annie B.,
your turn.

9
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:41,881
You sure there's time?

10
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,383
I don't wanna keep
anyone from vacation.

11
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,416
Just get up here.

12
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,289
- Where's your essay?
- Up here.

13
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,258
And it's more of
a performance piece.

14
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,193
Here we go.

15
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:56,496
My president is
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

16
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,798
He was elected in 1932,

17
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,733
when almost everyone was poor.

18
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,368
So, pretty much just like now,

19
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,790
but without the Internet.

20
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,374
Everyone except the front
row, you be the poor people.

21
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:11,878
You're hungry and mad. So,
growl and stomp your feet.

22
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,180
Grr! Grr-grr!

23
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:17,117
Grr! Grr-grr!

24
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:21,287
Front row, good news,
you're the rich people.

25
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,322
Laugh and clap like you're
better than everybody.

26
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,258
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

27
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,859
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

28
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:33,295
But FDR didn't like it that everyone
was poor, so, he gave them all jobs.

29
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,311
He called it the New Deal.

30
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:38,704
Work hard, and you get rich.

31
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:41,274
So, when I tap you, you're rich.

32
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,419
He had people build
roads and got paid.

33
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,513
Cut down trees and got paid.

34
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,216
Made it easy to buy a house,
go to college.

35
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,585
Soon, the whole country
was happy.

36
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,020
But don't worry, rich people.

37
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,442
You're still better than everyone
because you get even richer!

38
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:03,796
Good job, Annie.

39
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,266
Have a good vacation, everyone!

40
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,835
- You gonna make it in time?
- I always do.

41
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:10,937
We'll cover for you.
Good luck.

42
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,872
Luck's for suckers.

How many of you guys want
some free Stacks phones, huh?

63
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:55,573
I can't hear you!

64
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,524
Any reservations for Bennett?

65
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,059
Honey, I told you.

66
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,063
If anyone I think could even
remotely be your parents walk in,

67
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,398
I'm gonna let you know.
And I mean remotely.

68
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,002
Name's Bennett, Senate,
Pomegranate, black, white, other.

69
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,770
I'll let you know.

70
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:27,359
- I'm guessing you're gonna wait anyway.
- Yep.

71
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,794
Get your free Stacks phone.
Never drop a call.

72
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:53,099
Thanks, thanks. Cool.

73
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,767
Free Stacks phone. Okay?

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,801
Thank you.
Thank you.

75
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,636
All right.

76
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,139
And there we are, ma'am. Free Stacks phone.
Never drop a call.

77
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,842
I'm totally gonna vote
for you for mayor now.

78
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,778
Yeah, well, you know what?
This isn't a campaign event.

79
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,079
But I would totally love that.

80
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,349
- Oh!
- Mmm-mmm! Mmm-mmm!

81
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:13,452
Okay, that's it.
We're done. Thanks.

82
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:14,019
Hose me down.
I feel like I'm on fire.

83
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,521
Yeah.

84
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:16,714
You should clean your tongue.

85
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:18,657
You kissed a few babies.
You don't want to catch colic.

86
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,127
- You know what? You're right.
- Oh! Will!

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,095
You shake 500 hands, and you
tell me how you feel, huh?

88
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,563
Feel like a zookeeper.

89
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:26,263
- Marry me, Will!
- Okay, sure.

90
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,456
Sorry.

91
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:53,159
It's okay. I just
come for the cannoli.

92
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,593
I'll see you next Friday?

93
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,626
You know it.

94
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,139
Hey, girl.
How'd it go?

95
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:09,108
- Nah.
- Eh.

96
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,609
- Can I?
- Sure.

97
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,011
As long as you
give those to my lady.

98
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,045
Thanks.

99
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:41,140
Freeze!

100
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:44,743
I said freeze, you little rat.

101
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:46,679
I know you heard me.

102
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:47,712
Get over here.

103
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,572
These are from Lou.

104
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,487
They look like they're from Lou.

105
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,288
I'll tell him you loved them.

106
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,124
You think the world wants
a smart-mouthed little girl?

107
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:02,061
No, they don't,
or you wouldn't be here.

108
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,696
And the only reason you are here

109
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,533
is because I get $157
a week from the state.

110
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,735
Which, believe me,
is not worth it.

111
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,539
I should put a leash
on you, you little...

112
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:14,807
You're so pretty.

113
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,778
I used to be a bright star.

114
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,814
I was in the biggest
band in the world,

115
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,716
C+C Music Factory.

116
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,951
About to go on
<i>Arsenio Hall Show.</i>

117
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:28,254
September 16th, 1991.

118
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,955
But I was too good for them!

119
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:32,191
Fired me right before
I went out on stage.

120
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,792
You have a very pretty voice.

121
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,381
I will die with that secret!

122
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,535
Hey, you little monster, I wasn't
done with you! Get back here!

123
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,902
I haven't told you how I was
almost one of Hootie's Blowfish.

124
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,575
How did I get here?

125
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,746
- Did you find them?
- Nah, but it's okay.

126
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:54,914
- So sorry.
- Sorry, Annie.

127
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,882
Shh! The witch
will hear us.

128
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,635
They're never gonna
be at that restaurant.

129
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,618
Be quiet, Pepper.
Yes, they are.

130
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:01,220
You be quiet, Isabella.

131
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:03,293
Annie's never gonna find her family.
None of us are.

132
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,657
Don't say that.

133
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,858
Don't listen to her, Mia.

134
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,827
You're gonna get adopted.
I promise.

135
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,998
You keep saying that. I'm almost 13.
No one wants a teenager.

136
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:15,476
Yes, they do. We all
have families somewhere.

137
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:17,236
Can you read your note again?

138
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,737
Okay.

139
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,773
Oh, God.
For the millionth time?

140
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,642
Yeah, read it, Annie.
But quietly.

141
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,081
They went to Domani's,
ordered two cannolis,

142
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:30,550
and wrote me this note.

143
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,185
"Please take care of our baby.

144
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,920
"Her name's Annie.

145
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:37,122
"We'll be back to get her soon.

146
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:42,695
"There's half a locket around her
neck, and we have the other half,

147
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:45,965
"so when we come for her, you'll
know that she's our girl."

148
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:46,998
Can I see it?

149
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,606
They're gonna come back for all of us.
I promise.

Wake up, rats.

187
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:49,014
Get out of bed!

188
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,349
It's so early.

189
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,251
And it's Saturday.

190
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,887
Thanks for the time and date. Now,
over to Stormy for the weather.

191
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,522
It's raining!

192
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,423
The city called.
They're coming to inspect.

193
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,292
You gotta go and clean
this whole place up!

194
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,327
Aren't they supposed to give
a couple days' notice?

195
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,400
Aren't I supposed to be
married to George Clooney?

196
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,265
Get out of bed
and start cleaning!

197

198
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,770
Exactly, girlfriend.
Exactly.

199
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:14,406

200
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,142
I hate her so much.

201
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:20,342
And if you find any loose change
over a nickel, it's mine.

202
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,881
I was having the best dream.

203
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:26,318
I was ice-skating
on real, live ice.

204
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,153
Save your dreams for good stuff.

205
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:30,422
Like shopping with
an unlimited credit card.

206
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:32,057
Or swimming in candy.

207
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,159
Or flying to the moon
in a rocket ship.

208
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,061
All things that
will never happen.

209

Now, clean like your life depends on it.
'Cause it does!

349
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,391
That's probably one of my
satisfied customers right there.

350
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:42,327
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
This is terrible.

351
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,229
Do you really think a
businessman can run the city?

352
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:47,365
At Stacks Mobile, I made a cell
network that never drops a call.

353
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,568
As mayor,
I'm gonna make a government

354
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:52,938
that never drops a citizen.

355
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,807
Yeah, as long as those citizens
live below 96th Street.

356
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,311
You're lucky you can't vote yet, <i> mija.
</i> Politicians are all liars.

357
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,413
What dates should
I change these to?

358
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:04,002
One week for the milk.
Two weeks for the juice.

359
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,616
You need to smile more.
You only smiled four times.

360
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:07,819
Is that right?
Really?

361
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,255
Voters respond 23% more
favorably to full-teeth smiles.

362
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:12,257
Yeah. How about
thumbs up, huh?

363
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,292
Uh, Sixteen percent better
if you give them a single.

364
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,493
Thirty-eight percent if you
shoot them the double.

365
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:16,962
Why do I get the feeling like
I'm wasting my time here?

366
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:18,496
Am I gonna win, or not?

367
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:19,698
'Cause this seems
like a waste of time.

368
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,499
You hired me to win.
You're gonna win.

369
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,335
- Put this on.
- Why? I'm already dressed.

370
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,936
- How you doing?
- Here.

371
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,705
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I gotta feed the hobos?

372
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:28,340
Don't say "hobos."
Say "bums."

373
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:30,008
For some crazy reason,
everybody thinks

374
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,744
you're a rich elitist that can't
relate to regular people.

375
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:35,457
Oh, so the girl from Oxford is trying
to tell me how to keep it real.

376
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
I'm telling you if you
want a chance at this,

377
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,583
you're gonna have to remember
where you came from.

378
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:40,318
Okay, Gatsby?

379
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:42,587
Compliment them on the
food, but not too much.

380
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,888
- Oh, I ain't eating this food.
- You're gonna eat the food.

381
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,458
And you're gonna like it, but
you're not gonna love it, okay?

382
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:47,859
We don't want to seem
like we're pandering.

383
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:49,261
I don't eat hobo food.

384
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:50,572
All right. That's good.

385
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,799
How we doing, folks?
Starving?

386
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,268
How do you sleep at night?

387
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:58,403
Silk sheets and Ambien.

388
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,214
Look at all
these handsome faces!

389
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:02,741
There you go.
All right.

390
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,576
And here we go.
God bless.

391
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:07,546
Bet you never had mashed
potatoes, Mr. Stacks.

392
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:11,750
Are you kidding me?

393
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:13,023
Why, my grandmother made some of

394
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:15,520
the best
mashed potatoes in Queens.

395
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:18,556
You know, that's where I'm from.
Born and raised.

396
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:21,059
On the playground's where
I spent most of my days.

397
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,327
And look at this.

398
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,730
It's not amazing, but it ain't terrible.
Look at this, huh?

399
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:27,032
Mmm-mmm!

400
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:32,891
Went down the wrong pipe.

401
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,943
This is disgusting.

402
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,412
Look, it's terrible.

403
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,723
Oh, God.
You're a child.

404
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:51,290
Well, how do you
guys think that went?

405
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:54,959
Nash, you saw it. Would you vote
for me if you didn't work for me?

406
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,528
No, sir.

407
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,784
Thank you for your honesty.
You're fired.

408
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,767
That didn't take long.

409
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,037

00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,208

- Not really.

413
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,016
Maybe this is
a blessing in disguise.

414
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,951
Just because you can run for mayor,
doesn't mean that you should.

415
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,953
We already discussed
this is great for my profile.

416
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:22,954
It's going to grow the company.

417
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:26,391
Plus, the city needs me.

418
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:28,860
All right.
Take it easy, Batman.

419
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:30,829
You let all your employees
talk to you like this?

420
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,564
The ones that make
me billions, I do.

421
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:34,733
You make me mayor, you can
say anything you want.

422
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,034
Hey!

423
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:39,704
Oh, no. Not again.

424
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,139
Nash. Why we stopping?

425
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,542
Sorry, Mr. Stacks.
Uh, I'll fix it.

426
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:57,687
Next!

427
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,092
I'd like to get
my records please.

428
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,161
You'll need DOH
form number 4380...

00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,563

430

by a parent or a...

433
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,572
Guardian. Bam.

434
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:23,648
It's all there.

435
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,757
Are you going to stare
at me the whole time?

436
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,790
Sorry.

437
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:50,075

about the environment.

You know, that

- I'm gonna go walk.

00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,023
What?

493
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,357
- Where's he going?
- I wanna be alone.

494
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,992
We don't really have time.

495
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:29,127
I know how to
walk down the street!

496
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,428
I'll text you directions!

497
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:31,763
Don't need them.

503
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,477
- Get it!
- I told you to stop!

504
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,286
Try to hit it!

505
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,388

All right, kick it! Kick it!

508
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:04,382
- Stop! Leave it alone!
- See how scared it is!

509
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,164
Leave it...

510
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,102
- Watch where you're going, kid!
- Are you okay?

511
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,004
- Let's get out of here!
- You could've got run over.

512
00:28:13,037 --> 00:28:15,315
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. You be careful.

513
00:28:15,973 --> 00:28:18,696
- Why're you running?
- Gets me to places quicker.

514
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:23,882
Little kids.
Kids with germs.

515
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:35,893
How was the library?

516
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:37,161
Educational.

517
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:39,063
Well, I have some
more education for you.

518
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,966
I told the inspector I don't
wanna foster you anymore.

519
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,202
As of next week, you're
somebody else's problem.

520
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:45,837
Did they say who?

521
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,439
Not a who, sweetie.
A what.

522
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:49,908
Group home.

523
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,075
Okay.

524
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:56,956
Maybe that'll teach you to
stop running your mouth.

525
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:05,523
So, where are we
with our new phones?

526
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:08,760
- Well, we've got the battery up to 150 hours.
- That's not a week.

527
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:11,513
I said I need the charge to last
a week, Grace. Specifically.

528
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,464
At the moment, unfortunately, the phone
is burning up in people's hands.

529
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,199
What?

530
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:17,955
<i>That's what I told Mom.
And she says to me, she...</i>

531
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,139
<i>You burned me!</i>

532
00:29:21,172 --> 00:29:22,140
Don't worry.
She signed a waiver.

533
00:29:22,173 --> 00:29:23,541
<i>You burned me!</i>

534
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:24,542
What up, Guy-O?

535
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:27,845
<i>You're up. Five points
in the polls.</i>

536
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:30,181
Really? They liked that he
vomited on a homeless man?

537
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,116
<i>Uh, no, Grace.
They liked the fact that</i>

538
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:33,851
<i>he saved a little girl
from getting hit by a van.</i>

539
00:29:33,884 --> 00:29:37,188
<i>Some guy recorded it, put it
on the Internet. Check it out.</i>

540
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,123
<i>"Oh, I'm a little girl who
doesn't see where I'm going.</i>

541
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,125
<i>"Well, look! I bumped
into the future</i>

542
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,794
<i>"mayor of New York
who just saved my life!"</i>

543
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,329
<i>This is fantastic, Will.</i>

544
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,330
<i>I'm telling you. It's the
most human thing you've done</i>

545
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:47,498
<i>this entire campaign,
all due respect.</i>

546
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:49,000
None taken.

547
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,501
You didn't tell me
you saved a little girl.

548
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:51,335
You didn't tell me anything.

549
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:52,603
Like Batman.

550
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:55,006
<i>Hey, listen to me.
You gotta capitalize on this.</i>

551
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,407
- Of course we do.
- <i> You invite her to lunch.</i>

552
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,575
- No.
- <i> See how she's doing.</i>

553
00:29:57,608 --> 00:29:58,676
<i>Snap a few pics.
The press'll eat this up.</i>

554
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,112
- Do we know who she is?
- <i> That's the best part.</i>

555
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,880
<i>She's a foster kid from Harlem.</i>

556
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:03,881
- Hmm.
- <i> Did you hear what I said?</i>

557
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:05,917
<i>Foster kid! Harlem!</i>

558
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,152
Your undereye vein is bulging.

559
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,154
- <i> I'm gonna go get her.</i>
- No. I'm gonna let Grace go get her.

560
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:11,355
- What? Why?
- <i> What? That's a terrible idea!</i>

561
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:13,057
Do you actually
want 5-hour ENERGY

562
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,525
to go over there and
scare this little child?

563
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:15,893
I don't even know
what this is about.

564
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:17,528
Grace, please.
For me, Grace. Please.

565
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,863
- Thank you.
<i>- Will, let me go to Harlem.</i>

566
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:20,298
<i>Please. Don't send her.</i>

567
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,833
They will whoop
your ass in Harlem.

568
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,267
<i>- Don't shut me off.</i>
- Thank you.

569
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
<i>Don't shut me off!</i>

570
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:29,440
<i>Yeah.</i>

571
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:33,044
Is that Colleen Hannigan?

572
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:40,885
I was wanting to talk to you
about a girl in your care.

573
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:42,286
Annie.

574
00:30:46,357 --> 00:30:50,094
I work for William Stacks and he would
love to take Annie out for lunch.

575
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,295
Why?

576
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:54,165
They ran into each other yesterday.
She didn't tell you?

577
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:55,600
No.

578
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,969
We didn't have a chance to, uh,

579
00:30:58,002 --> 00:31:01,072
have our girl-talk
jawbone last night.

580
00:31:01,105 --> 00:31:02,907
Annie!

581
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,543
So you said he ran
into her, huh?

582
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:10,314
'Cause I noticed that her neck
did seem a little whiplash-y.

583
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:13,317
We are happy to make a donation
to the charity of your choice.

584
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,486
Gosh! There's so
many to choose from.

585
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,154
There is.

586
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:17,988
Let's see, Save the
Whales, of course.

587
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,957
And Clean Water,
but you can't have

588
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,093
whales without water.

589
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:25,897
Gosh. You know what? Just make it
out to "cash." I'll divvy it up.

590
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,266
- Perfect.
- Annie!

591
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,634
You know, she's such an angel.

592
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,002
We don't inherit the Earth,

593
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:32,403
we borrow it from our children.

594
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:33,571
It's a lovely sentiment.

595
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:35,239
Oh! There she is.

596
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,607
Hi, Annie. I'm Grace.

597
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,944
I work for Mr. Stacks, the gentleman
that you ran into yesterday.

598
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,145
He'd like to
invite you to lunch.

599
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:43,247
I promise we
won't keep you long.

600
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,225
You can keep me
as long as you want.

601
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,928
- No way!
- Is this for real?

602
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:59,096
- This car's as big as a subway!
- You're so lucky!

603
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,564
It's incredible.

604
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:01,677
Oh, my gosh. I want that!

605
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,234
Oh, my gosh!

606
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,136
Help yourself to
whatever you want.

607
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:06,270
No way. Really?

608
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:07,305
Sure.

609
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,607
Give me this!
Give me this! I want this!

610
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,142
Oh, my God!

611
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,410
I want that one!
I want that!

612
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,666
This is crazy! My God!

613
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:16,280
Kids love candy, huh?

614
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,217
Hey, Annie! Maybe I
should come with you

615
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,287
and make sure that everything's
USDA Grade A awesome, huh?

616
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,455
I'm good. Thanks.

617
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:26,057
Bye, Annie!

618
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,458
- Bye!
- Later.

619
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,769
- Thanks!
- Oh, my gosh.

620
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,962
Hey, gorgeous!

621
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:32,697
How does it feel to
have a famous kid?

622
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,198
What are you talking about?

623
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:35,533
It's Annie!

624
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:36,701
Your Annie!

625
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:42,106
Hey, you wanna go out tonight?
I got my dance pants on.

626
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,075
I haven't hit
that rock bottom yet.

627
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:45,942
I love it when
you throw me shade!

628
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,289
- Here, Lou.
- It's okay. She likes me.

629
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:54,118
Oh, my God, this is so good.

630
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,454
Mr. Stacks would like to take some
pictures with you, if that's all right.

631
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:58,456
I guess so. Why?

632
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:00,191
People wanna know
that you're okay.

633
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:01,359
What people?

634
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:02,670
Everybody who saw that.

635
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:06,698
Whoa, my hair's gigantic.

636
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,467
We can listen to
whatever you like.

637
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,469
Can you put on talk radio?

638
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:13,170
Are you sure you don't
wanna listen to music?

639
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:16,340
I love talk radio.
It calms me.

640
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:19,210
So do I. I loved it
when I was a little girl.

641
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:21,579
I used to think that
they were all my friends.

642
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:25,282
Sorry, that sounded very sad.

643
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:27,084
Sorry.

644
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,353
I have a lot of friends,
so don't worry about me.

645
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:32,623
I mean, so I work a lot. I do. And
I could have some more friends.

646
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:35,092
But how many friends
do you really need?

647
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,361
I mean, if you were
my parents asking me,

648
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,764
"Are you fulfilled and
are you happy, Grace?"

649
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,232
That's a whole different
conversation, right?

650
00:33:41,265 --> 00:33:42,700
But we're not
having that conversation.

651
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:46,136
And, frankly, it's really not your
position to ask me that at all. So...

652
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:47,336
Okay.

653
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:58,149
There she is. Our own
Little Orphan Annie.

654
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:02,120
Foster kid.

655
00:34:09,526 --> 00:34:10,526
She's here.

656
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:16,034
Hey, this is the one, right?
All right. Let's get this.

657
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,470
Slow your roll.

658
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,392
- Excuse me?
- Can we eat first? It was a long drive.

659
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:24,275
Yeah, yeah. Go, go.

660
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:27,711
Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's eat.
We got time for that.

661
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:29,346
All right.

662
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:33,117
So, how are you
feeling from yesterday?

663
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:36,320
So, what's the hustle?

664
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:38,789
What makes you think there's a hustle?
There's no hustle.

665
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,267
- Come on, come on.
- Uh...

666
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,095
I'm 10. I'm not an idiot.

667
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:45,763
I never said you were...

668
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:48,365
An idiot. Or 10.

669
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,503
Truth of the matter is,
I don't know how old you are.

670
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:54,576
- Ten.
- Well, now we know that you're not an idiot.

671
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:56,407
But there are a lot of
people out there that are

672
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,808
and when they saw
that photo of us,

673
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,176
they thought that I would
make a great mayor.

674
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,678
Why?

675
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,780
Why? Because I'm a...

676
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:04,748
I'm a rich guy.
I saved an orphan.

677
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:07,485
I'm not an orphan,
I'm a foster kid.

678
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:08,853
And you didn't save me.

679
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,286
Oh, I didn't save you?
I didn't just

680
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,522
push you out of
the way of a van?

681
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:13,124
Why don't I call that
van back and have him

682
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:14,269
finish up what he...

683
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,661
You know what?

684
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,254
The more we're seen together, the
better it is for my campaign.

685
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:20,798
Wait. That's how
a mayor gets elected?

686
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:21,966
Yes. Insane, isn't it?

687
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,888
I bet if I moved in with you,
you'd become president.

688
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:27,205
Move in with me?

689
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,474
This is not that kind of party.

690
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,230
That's it.
That's it. That's it.

691
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:36,380
I think he wants to
tell you something.

692
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:39,416
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
Annie coming to live with you.

693
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:40,717
What?

694
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:43,888
From what I understand, it's
very crowded where you live.

695
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,223
How'd you like some more space?

696
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:48,759
Is that something
that you might like?

697
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:50,494
Living with the richest
guy in the world?

698
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:52,329
Yeah, that's something
I might like.

699
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:53,397
Great. Perfect.

700
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,865
Guy. What are
you talking about?

701
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:57,301
Listen to me. It'll
only be for a few weeks.

702
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,336
Then she'll go back
to wherever she came from.

703
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:02,373
Taking in a foster kid, that's an
automatic 15 point jump in the polls.

704
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,641
- Guaranteed.
- You want me to play Daddy?

705
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:06,544
It's easy. All I need
is a bed and meals.

706
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:08,579
You don't have to
do anything else.

707
00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:11,549
And you get $157 a week.

708
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:15,419
Do I look like
I need $157 a week?

709
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,455
Everybody needs
an extra $157 a week.

710
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,724
You're not really
thinking about doing this?

711
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:22,360
You want photos, right?

712
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:25,229
I'm sure there's
easier ways to get photos.

713
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,374
Not with me in them.

714
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:28,799
Smile.

715
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:31,669
Mr. Stacks!

716
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:32,970
Are you really doing this?

717
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:34,205
Yeah, won't even
know she's there.

718
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:35,673
It's like having a turtle.

719
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,208
I wonder if she has her shots.

720
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,743
- How was your lunch?
- What's your name?

721
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:41,579
Her name is Annie, and she'll be
staying with Mr. Stacks for awhile.

722
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:42,846
He's going to adopt you?

723
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,516
No, no, no. I have parents.

724
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:48,186
This is just temporary.
If he gets approved.

725
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,921
- What now?
- Next.

726
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:53,824
I need a temporary
guardian approval, please.

727
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:58,629
There is a six-week waiting period
and you need form NYS 84-...

728
00:36:58,662 --> 00:36:59,864
Sweet Lord.

729
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,435
Hi.

730
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:05,468
Bam.

731
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,337
You know, I don't normally
do the site visits,

732
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:12,910
but I've taken such
a liking to young Annie.

733
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:16,247
I forget sometimes, you
know, why I got into this.

734
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:20,584
It's for my files.

735
00:37:20,617 --> 00:37:24,451
So, does the guardian have "adequate
income to provide basic shelter"?

736
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:31,627
I'm just gonna go
ahead and check that box.

737
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:35,933
Come on in.

738
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:42,706
<i>...about $95 per share
in cash and stock.</i>

739
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,943
<i>...detonated
an explosive while fire...</i>

740
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,016
Whoa.

741
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,851
Oh, yeah, whoa.

742
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:56,020
Hey, is there a
co-temporary guardian?

743
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,022
No.

744
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:00,924
Would you like a
co-temporary guardian?

745
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:02,517
Why don't I take
these guys on a tour,

746
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:03,761
and you can get back to work.

747
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:04,928
Best idea of the day.

748
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,017
I'll come with you.

749
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:09,366
Will. Will, Will!

750
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:12,903
Okay, so the state says
that you must have at least

751
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:15,306
one water source in...

752
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,041
Check.

753
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:20,511
And a window that's... Okay.

754
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:25,382
And then at least one
chair per 10 persons.

755
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:27,051
And I think the <i> Starship
Enterprise</i> is gonna count.

756
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,473
I'm gonna check that box.

757
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:30,421
How does it do this?

758
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:32,022
It's a smart house.

759
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:34,825
So, it recognizes your voice and
then adjusts itself accordingly.

760
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:36,794
It's like a friend.

761
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:39,930
I consider it a friend. But I have
real friends that aren't robots.

762
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:41,699
Let's forget this conversation

763
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:44,735
and the previous conversation
and start afresh.

764
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:46,804
Got that? Great.

765
00:38:46,837 --> 00:38:50,541
I'm gonna record your voice now,
Annie, and it'll be in the system.

766
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:52,910
So, just say
something into this.

767
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:53,944
What should I say?

768
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:54,979
Anything.

769
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:58,316
I think I'm gonna like it here.

770
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:01,685
Got it.

771
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:04,121
Great. It's all yours.

772
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:05,723
Have a go.
And I'll be back.

773
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:08,726
Ma'am?

774
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:11,862
Excuse me. You are not
allowed to go in there.

775
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,931
- This is very nice.
- Are those halogen bulbs?

776
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:16,066
Ma'am.

777
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,433

my entire country.

- Bam.
- Stacks phones?

- What?

856
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,995
Ma'am, wanna move away
from the car, please?

00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:06,663

00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:08,265
Oh, really,
you're gonna spray me?

859
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:09,833
You think you're better than me?

860
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:10,934
Is that what it is? You think
you're better than me?

861
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,270
I do. I do think
I'm better than you.

862
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:14,859
- Hey, Miss Hannigan.
- What?

863
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:19,076
I just wanna thank you for
everything you've done for me.

864
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:21,011
You think your life
is a fairy tale?

865
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:23,313
There is no happily ever after.

866
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,015
And the worst thing is
to get a little taste

867
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:27,618
of something good
'cause it never lasts.

868
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,820
And then all you can
taste from then on out is

869
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:30,854
not that taste.

870
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:32,956
Huh?

871
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,958
Shh. Just let her talk when
she gets like this, remember?

872
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:36,627
Shut up!

873
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,663
Colleen Hannigan! H-bomb!
Like me on Facebook!

874
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:40,998
I don't like you in Harlem.

875
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,833
Why would I like you
on Facebook?

876
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,369
Come on, rats, let's go!

877
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:46,970
- Inside!
- Bye, Annie.

878
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:48,105
Bye.

879
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:49,640
What was that?

880
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:51,241
Don't worry about it.

881
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:53,110
All right, Nash,
we can take off.

882
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:55,045
- I can't, there's a truck.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

883
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:57,681
Bogey on your left, Nash,
bogey on your left. Steady.

884
00:43:57,714 --> 00:43:59,249
No, thank you. I'm not
looking for companionship.

885
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:01,318
- What is it with this neighborhood?
- No, that's Lou.

886
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:03,129
- You know her name?
- It's a he.

887
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:05,288
Hey, girl.

888
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:06,823
Hey. I got you something.

889
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:08,659
No, thanks.
Those things are evil.

890
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:10,694
They steal your
private information

891
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:13,330
so that big business can spy
on you and crush your soul.

892
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:14,798
Really?

893
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:16,433
I'm happy for you though, <i> mija.</i>

894
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:18,402
Getting off the block.
Take care.

895
00:44:18,435 --> 00:44:19,736
Bye, Lou.

896
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:22,339
Stay warm, Mr. Stacks.

897
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:24,274
Sorry. He just
doesn't like you.

898
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:27,411
A lot of people don't like me.
That's why we're doing this.

899
00:44:27,444 --> 00:44:29,680
Don't worry, I got a game face.

900
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,348
Let's take some photos.

901
00:44:51,895 --> 00:44:54,395
<i>My opponent wants
to be mayor for two reasons.</i>

902
00:44:54,404 --> 00:44:57,908
<i>To feed his ego, and bolster
his business interests.</i>

903
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:01,945
<i>And now he coincidentally takes
in a foster kid? Come on.</i>

904
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:04,214
<i>Don't pee in my ear
and tell me it's hot rain.</i>

905
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:06,383
<i>Are you saying Annie
is a political move?</i>

906
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,639
<i>I'm surprised he
hasn't gotten a dog yet.</i>

907
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,319
Are you sure I can have one?

908
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,196
- No.
- Yes.

909
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,198
Look, kids love dogs.

910
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:23,366
Come on, they see them on the
street and they all go, "Aw."

911
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:25,235
- Am I right?
- Hello.

912
00:45:25,268 --> 00:45:26,436
You know, women do
the same thing.

913
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:27,871
Hello.

914
00:45:27,904 --> 00:45:28,904
Hello.

915
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:33,810
What about that one?

916
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:38,248
She was separated from her pack too early.
She just needs a little love.

917
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:41,184
Don't pick that one, it's
licking its own hoo-hah.

918
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:42,919
Hey, girl, we found each other.

919
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,756
I'll never leave
you again, I promise.

920
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:47,224
Annie,
what are you gonna name it?

921
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:48,492
She's like a hurricane.

922
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:50,394
Sandy. Her name's
gonna be Sandy.

923
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:57,834
I told you. Ow!

924
00:45:57,867 --> 00:45:58,468
<i>Annie, will you
take a picture with us?</i>

925
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,770
<i>Um, sure.</i>

926
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:03,138
Thanks, Annie.

927
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:07,911
She really likes you.

928
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:43,881
Look.

929
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:57,461
Hey.

930
00:46:59,229 --> 00:47:00,864
Something wrong?

931
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:03,834
Couldn't sleep.
So quiet up here.

932
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:05,502
- What you doing?
- I'm working.

933
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:06,870
This late?

934
00:47:06,903 --> 00:47:08,305
Always.

935
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:09,573
When do you have fun?

936
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:11,074
This is fun.

937
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:12,576
I haven't been to Disneyland,

938
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,278
but I don't think they
have a paperwork ride.

939
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:17,380
Look, if you're hungry, there's not
a lot of food here. Only takeout.

940
00:47:17,413 --> 00:47:18,549
Fridge.

941
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:20,851
Cool.

942
00:47:20,884 --> 00:47:22,319
Knock yourself out.

943
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,589
You don't have a cook?
Or like a million servants?

944
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:27,257
Nope, I don't.
I like to be alone.

945
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,226
So why do you
need all this space?

946
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:32,229
'Cause I like to be alone
with a lot of space.

947
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:37,868
Look, I think people surround
themselves with other people

948
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,169
just so they can feel loved.
I don't believe in that.

949
00:47:39,202 --> 00:47:40,937
I believe the people
that actually love you,

950
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:42,539
you can count them on one hand.

951
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,239
You know you're making a fist.

952
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:47,944
Whatever.

953
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:49,379
Where are your people?

954
00:47:49,412 --> 00:47:53,516
Wow, you ask a lot of questions,
little one. My people aren't around.

955
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:54,651
You don't want new ones?

956
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:56,186
I'm good.

957
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:58,521
You know what?
I am hungry.

958
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:00,323
I can make a meal
out of anything.

959
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:02,392
Pick five ingredients.

960
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,494
- I don't want to.
- Come on, this'll be fun.

961
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:05,528
Annie, listen,
I don't have time...

962
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,564
Not work, but almost as fun.

963
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:14,471
All right. Fusilli, pancetta,
steak, pomegranate,

964
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:16,506
truffle,
sun-dried tomatoes.

965
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:18,074
I've only heard of
two of those things.

966
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:19,609
Google it.

967
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:21,378
Okay, where are
your pots and pans?

968
00:48:21,411 --> 00:48:22,546
Pots and pans.

969
00:48:25,148 --> 00:48:26,249
I know.

970
00:48:26,282 --> 00:48:27,284
- Cool.
- Cool.

971
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,959
Put some in there.

972
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:36,992
Eh...

973
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:39,362
Put in some carrot?

974
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,229
You're not gonna
chop that carrot?

975
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:45,535
You lactose-intolerant?

976
00:48:45,568 --> 00:48:46,904
I'm kid-intolerant.

977
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,040
How's your cholesterol?

978
00:48:50,073 --> 00:48:51,274
It's good right now.

979
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:54,642
I'm gonna go downstairs and get
some supplies. See you later.

980
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:57,568
Orange you glad I'm back?

981
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:00,493
The sixth ingredient
is my jokes.

982
00:49:02,752 --> 00:49:04,721
Order up.

983
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,754
- Are we really doing this?
- Cheers.

984
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,596
You gotta be kidding me.

985
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:15,332
Sorry, it's gross.

986
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:18,477
But you gotta learn to stop spitting.
You're not a camel.

987
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:21,504
Guy has this crazy idea
that I should take you

988
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:23,006
to a movie premiere
tomorrow night.

989
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,074
A movie premiere?

990
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:26,509
Yes.

991
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:27,610
Can I bring my friends?

992
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:29,379
There's more of you?

993
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:30,981
More photos. Click, click.

994
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:34,351
All right. More photos.

995
00:49:34,384 --> 00:49:35,384
More photos.

996
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,420
- It's worse the second time.
- Yeah.

997
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,078
This is kind of like a bunk bed.

998
00:50:00,443 --> 00:50:01,678
Morning, Annie.

999
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:02,767
Good morning, Nash.

1000
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:06,082
I know this sounds crazy,
but do you guys

1001
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:07,584
spy on people with your phones?

1002
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:09,185
Why?

1003
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,052
I really need to
find some people.

1004
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:13,321
Come with me.

1005
00:50:14,257 --> 00:50:16,393
Come on, you got it.
There you go.

1006
00:50:18,528 --> 00:50:20,597
Stacks Mobile Control Center.

1007
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,699
We can trace every call,
every data transmission

1008
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:25,368
made on every carrier
over the past 20 years.

1009
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,370
- Whoa.
- Mmm-hmm.

1010
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:29,406
People shouldn't be
scared of governments.

1011
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:32,108
They should be scared
of cell phone companies.

1012
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,864
- Check for Bennett.
- Checking.

1013
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:37,213
Whoa.
That's a lot of Bennetts.

1014
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,049
Can you please
go back six years?

1015
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:40,471
Around the 26th Precinct.

1016
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:44,521
It'll take a bit,
but we'll let you know.

1017
00:50:44,554 --> 00:50:45,554
Thanks.

1018
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:59,302
Oh, my God!

1019
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:00,637
Did Hannigan catch you?

1020
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,372
No, she's passed out.

1021
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:04,239
Things that make
you go glug-glug.

1022
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,111
Uh, Mr. Stacks,
who are you wearing?

1023
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:09,546
Armani.

1024
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:11,614
Annie, who are you wearing?

1025
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:13,283
This is my friend Isabella's,

1026
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:16,486
and this I think
I found somewhere.

1027
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:17,821
Annie, how'd you
like the French toast

1028
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:19,155
you had for breakfast
this morning?

1029
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:20,824
Wait. How'd you know that?

1030
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:23,326
You tweeted it.
@annie4realz

1031
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,694
I started you a Twitter account.

1032
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:27,664
1.3 million

1033
00:51:27,697 --> 00:51:30,166
You get it? "4realz."

1034
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:32,302
Because she's "for reals."

1035
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:33,636
All right.

1036
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:35,072
You get it, right?

1037
00:51:36,205 --> 00:51:38,608
Hey! Stacks Phones!
Never drop a call.

1038
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,210
And, uh, vote for me, too.

1039
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:46,716
Things happen for a reason.

1040
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,718
Says the boy who doesn't have to
go home to the moon every night.

1041
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:49,786
Then don't go.

1042
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,456
<i>You know it's not my choice.</i>

1043
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:54,858
What the hell is happening?

1044
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:56,326
Her moon tears are running out.

1045
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:57,415
Of course they are.

1046
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:00,530
<i>Then I'll make it my choice.</i>

1047
00:52:00,563 --> 00:52:01,865
Did you just grab yourself?

1048
00:52:01,898 --> 00:52:03,466
Shh.

1049
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:04,901
<i>You're buzzing.</i>

1050
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:06,803
<i>- It's your phone.
- Oh.</i>

1051
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:08,204
Hey, it's one of our phones.

1052
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:09,873
<i>It's time.</i>

1053
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:11,341
That cost us $500,000.

1054
00:52:11,374 --> 00:52:12,642
What?

1055
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,577
Product placement.
It's the only thing

1056
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,479
that's keeping
the movie business afloat.

1057

1060
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,394

1061
00:52:31,427 --> 00:52:34,631

we will attack.</i>

1062
00:52:34,664 --> 00:52:35,765
<i>Thanks, Sakana.</i>

1063
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:36,933
What is going on?

1064
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:38,468
The fish are going
to attack the moon.

1065
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:40,270
But they should attack already.

1066
00:52:40,303 --> 00:52:41,471
There's not gonna be enough
time for Kyle and Saffron

1067
00:52:41,504 --> 00:52:43,393
to get away from
the Luna Monsters.

1068
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:48,711
Attack, Sakana, attack!

1069
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:50,580
Shh!

1070
00:52:50,613 --> 00:52:51,613
Quiet.

Sakana!

1075
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:07,497
Sit down.

1076
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:11,701
I can't believe
Sakana told on them.

1077
00:53:11,734 --> 00:53:13,503
Of course you can. You can't
trust the fish people.

1078
00:53:13,536 --> 00:53:14,671
Gwarklark warned them.

1079
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:15,905
I think she was bluffing.

1080
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,807
Nah, it was a warning. They
come back in the next movie.

1081
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,908
There's a next movie?

1082
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:20,410
There're four more.

1083
00:53:20,443 --> 00:53:21,945
Shut up!

1084
00:53:21,978 --> 00:53:23,513
- Whoa!
- Cool!

1085
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:27,850
I gotta get back to work.

1086
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:29,219
You can't stay for the party?

1087
00:53:29,252 --> 00:53:31,521
No. I haven't worked
in two hours

1088
00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:32,956
and three of my men
think I'm dead.

1089
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,357
I'm alive.

1090
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:35,792
You've worked enough.

1091
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:38,881
If your building gets any
taller it's gonna hit the sun.

1092
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:42,051
You got this crazy way
of turning a no into a yes.

1093
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:43,933
How do you do that?

1094
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:48,271
I think when people say no, they're
just really scared of saying yes.

1095
00:53:48,304 --> 00:53:50,273
Well, I'm not scared. No!

1096
00:53:50,306 --> 00:53:51,841
- Please!
- No!

1097
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:53,610
- Please.
- Yes.

1098
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:55,578
- Yes!
- Come on!

1099
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,280
Uh... Uh.
Uh, listen. I don't know.

1100
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:59,036
- Well, okay.
- This is amazing.

1101
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,919
Mr. Stacks! Will!

1102
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,689
I can't believe how
long you've been here.

1103
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:41,482
We're gonna be late
for the Jets-Giants game.

1104
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,293
You're doing
the ceremonial coin flip.

1105
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:45,628
And remember, they're both
New York teams,

1106
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:48,064
so, heads or tails, you gotta
be equally happy and sad.

1107
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:49,532
You're right.

1108
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:50,900
You go, I'll stay
here with the kids.

1109
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:52,335
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1110
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:53,980
All right, come on, let's go.

1111
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,673
What is that?

1112
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:02,979
Look, Tessie!

1113
00:55:09,118 --> 00:55:11,387
- Can we make one more stop?
- Shh.

1114
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,389
- Sure.
- Don't wake up Hannigan.

1115
00:55:13,422 --> 00:55:14,924
- Bye!
- Bye, girls!

1116
00:55:21,063 --> 00:55:22,999
You come here every Friday?

1117
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:25,035
It's the only day
they serve cannoli.

1118
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,459
And that's all
you've got to go on?

1119
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:34,744
Do you think you'll remember
what they look like?

1120
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:36,479
I think I'll just know.

1121
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,395
What are you doing still up?

1122
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,978
Where did you get
all of this stuff?

1123
00:56:09,011 --> 00:56:11,581
Where'd you get it?
Where'd you get it?

1124
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,584
We went with Annie to the movies,
and we got candy and soda,

1125
00:56:14,617 --> 00:56:16,853
and we went ice skating,
and Mr. Stacks is so cool,

1126
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:18,054
and I got fish earrings.

1127
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:19,589
Nice, Tessie.

1128
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:21,457
I can't keep a secret.
I got fish earrings.

1129
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,592
Pack it up.
It's going back.

1130
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,993
- Why?
- Because you don't deserve it.

1131
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,396
Yes, we do.
It's from our friend.

1132
00:56:26,429 --> 00:56:30,099
She's not your friend.
And neither is Mr. Stacks.

1133
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:32,732
They're all just a bunch of parasites
who suck the life out of you

1134
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:33,870
and move on once
you're not the shiny

new object in
the Factory anymore.

1136
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:37,006
You're being mean.

1137

1138
00:56:39,742 --> 00:56:42,479
Now pack it up!
You look ridiculous.

1203
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:13,823
Whose voice is that?

1204
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:15,258
I don't know.

1205

1207
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:24,000
Michael J. Fox? It's over.
We're finished.

1208
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:26,268
If Michael J. Fox endorses
him, then I'll vote for him.

1209
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:27,381
Listen to me,
Michael J. Fox

1210
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:28,171
is not as great
a guy as you think.

1211
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:29,472
Oh, no, no.
Come on, he's a saint.

1212
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:31,641
- I hear there's a tape.
- Forget it. I don't wanna hear it.

1213
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:33,042
- You've plateaued.
- Michael J. Fox.

1214
01:00:33,075 --> 01:00:36,012
Pay attention.
Follow the little green dot.

1215
01:00:36,045 --> 01:00:37,980
- That's you there.
- I don't need a pointer to read a graph.

1216
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:40,883
Well, read this. Annie's taken
you as far as she can, okay?

1217
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:42,118
But it's not over.

1218
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:43,386
How bad do you want this?

1219
01:00:43,419 --> 01:00:44,220
I don't start things
I can't win.

1220
01:00:44,253 --> 01:00:46,656
Well, how far are
you willing to go?

1221
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:49,189
Or should I say, how far
do you want me to go?

1222
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:52,128
I pay you a lot of money

1223
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:54,001
for you not to ask me
those types of questions.

1224
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,831
Okay, Guy-O?

1225
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,301
Rat-a-tat-tat,
message received, boss.

1226
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,040
- Good morning.
- Made you breakfast.

1227
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:39,809
You made me breakfast.

1228
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:46,148
Hey, I was thinking maybe you would
wanna go in to work with me today.

1229
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:47,917
- Cool.
- That'd be cool?

1230
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,485
- I'll go make us drinks.
- All right.

1231
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:51,887
- Don't let your food get cold.
- Mmm!

1232
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,391
Okay.
I won't. This is amazing.

1233
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:58,494
Oh...

1234
01:01:58,527 --> 01:02:00,996
Annie, you really
outdid yourself.

1235
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:03,265
Annie, this is a triumph, honey.

1236
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:06,068
You got me eating
this thing up like a dog.

1237
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:07,203
Oh! Mmm!

1238
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:08,471
This is good. What is it?

1239
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:12,007
Mmm, paprika, mmm, oregano.

1240
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,044
What is... Mmm, mmm!
What is that, Gouda cheese?

1241
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:17,466
You wanna know what's Gouda?
This breakfast.

1242
01:02:23,318 --> 01:02:24,721
Cool, a helicopter!

1243
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:28,324
Yeah.

1244
01:02:28,357 --> 01:02:31,093
- Oh! Make sure you duck!
- Why?

1245
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,571
I don't know. They always
duck in the movies!

1246
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:36,466
Hop on up.

1247
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:41,337
All right. Here we go.

1248
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:42,972
Do you get airsick?

1249
01:02:43,005 --> 01:02:45,107
Don't know. I've never
been in the air before.

1250
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,196
- Ah.
- I threw up on the swings once.

1251
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:51,981
Annie, we're gonna
do a cell tower check.

1252
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:53,115
Make sure they're all working.

1253
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:54,817
You do that yourself?

1254
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,350
Yep, told you work was fun.

1255
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,197
Gilbert, let's roll.

1256
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,270
You'll be all right.

1257
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:10,566
You wanna know the secret to
"Never drop a call"?

1258
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:11,801
Not really.

1259
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:15,204
Yes, yes, I do.
Desperately.

1260
01:03:15,237 --> 01:03:16,572
Good.

1261
01:03:16,605 --> 01:03:19,175
See, we have five times

1262
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:21,310
as many cell towers
as the other guys.

1263
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,279
But we hide them in plain sight.

1264
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:24,757
Like right there. You see?

1265
01:03:27,316 --> 01:03:28,484
No.

1266
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:29,986
It's in her crown.

1267
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:34,156
Yeah!

1268
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,560
That's so cool.

1269
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:42,431
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1270
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:45,000
How'd you do this? How'd you
become king of the world?

1271
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,235
Well, I wouldn't
say king of the world.

1272
01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:47,970
But I work my butt off.

1273
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:50,439
The harder I work,
the more opportunities I get.

1274
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:52,842
See, you gotta play the cards
that you've been dealt,

1275
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,044
no matter how bad the cards are.

1276
01:03:55,077 --> 01:03:56,846
What if you
don't have any cards?

1277
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:58,981
Then you bluff.

1278
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:01,116
See, that's what
I love about this city.

1279
01:04:01,149 --> 01:04:02,417
No matter who you
are or what you are,

1280
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:05,840
you just gotta want it bad enough,
and work with what you got.

- Grace.
- Hmm?

1332
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,060
What's our presence
past 96th Street?

1333
01:06:25,093 --> 01:06:27,296
Um, well, we're mostly
focused below,

1334
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:28,397
but I've been saying for
a while we should try...

1335
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,199
No, but I had it this way.

1336
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:32,434
Let me do this. I've got it.

1337
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:34,003
I know what I'm doing.

1338
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,704
Miss Farrell?

1339
01:06:35,737 --> 01:06:38,040
- Oh. It arrived. Thanks.
- What's that?

1340
01:06:38,073 --> 01:06:40,275
I bought a dress for Annie to
wear to the event tonight.

1341
01:06:40,308 --> 01:06:42,177
It's gorgeous. I just
need you to tie the bow

1342
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,078
and make sure that the satin...

1343
01:06:43,111 --> 01:06:44,380
- I tie the bow?
- Yeah.

1344
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:46,048
- I'm dressing her?
- You just have to tie the bow.

1345
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:48,283
No, I...
What kind of bow?

1346
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:49,685
- It's just a simple bow.
- Like a slipknot?

1347
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:50,753
'Cause you know I
didn't take Boy Scouts.

1348
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:52,354
It's very easy, Will.

1349
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:54,523
- And have the satin facing out.
- The satin?

1350
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:55,591
- Yeah.
- I knew a girl named Satin.

1351
01:06:55,624 --> 01:06:57,760
I'm sure you did.
You don't need to elaborate.

1352
01:06:57,793 --> 01:06:59,228
Satin and bows is
not necessarily my...

1353
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,030
You know what?
I'll come over.

1354
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,132
- Yeah, I mean, either way.
- Great.

1355
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:05,277
- She's gonna look gorgeous.
- Mmm-hmm.

1356
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:49,745
Annie.

1357
01:07:51,646 --> 01:07:53,649
You did not...

1358
01:07:53,682 --> 01:07:55,717
- You didn't see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

1359
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,121
Good. Good. 'Cause I... Well, I don't know.
I thought I saw you...

1360
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:01,757
Nope! Here the whole time.

1361
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,124
What were you guys doing?
Just hanging out?

1362
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:05,761
Hi.

1363
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:07,329
Evening.

1364
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:08,364
Wow.

1365
01:08:09,164 --> 01:08:11,266
Uh, Grace, you look great.

1366
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:15,370
Oh, please.
You look handsome, lovely.

1367
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:16,504
- No.
- Yes.

1368
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:19,641
This is old. This is my grandmother's.
It's nothing.

1369
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:21,176
Your grandmother is hot.

1370
01:08:21,209 --> 01:08:23,712
I mean, not that I've... I've never
seen your grandmother. I'm not...

1371
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:24,813
I'm saying that
the dress is nice.

1372
01:08:24,846 --> 01:08:26,482
Well, you're sweet.

1373
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:29,384
You look good.

1374
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:31,420
So do you.

1375
01:08:31,453 --> 01:08:34,189
Let's go and get you dressed.
Let's go!

1376
01:08:34,222 --> 01:08:36,592
Oh, oh, her dressed.
I was already dressed.

1377
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:37,759
- Come on!
- Yes.

1378
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:38,894
Come on.

1379
01:08:38,927 --> 01:08:40,096
Yeah. Get some...

1380
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:49,471
Ready?

1381
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:51,407
Yes. I'm very excited.

1382
01:08:57,512 --> 01:09:00,749
Oh, Annie, it's gorgeous.
You're just gorgeous.

1383
01:09:00,782 --> 01:09:04,219
I can't believe it.

1384
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:06,588
All right, ladies, let's go. Let's go.
We're running late.

1385
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:08,891
Annie! Wow.

1386
01:09:08,924 --> 01:09:11,760
I know, right? I've never
seen a bow this big.

1387
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:14,196
Yes, and I noticed that you put the
satin on the outside of the bow.

1388
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:15,264
That's a very
interesting choice.

1389
01:09:15,297 --> 01:09:16,932
You know what? Get out of here.
We're not done yet.

1390
01:09:16,965 --> 01:09:18,800
You know what? When did
this stop being my house?

1391
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,302
- Out!
- Okay, fine.

1392
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:22,304
You know what?
You're changing everything.

1393
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:24,606
As a matter of fact,
this used to be a Basquiat.

1394
01:09:24,639 --> 01:09:26,742
Now it's a dog
and a deer in a meadow.

1395
01:09:26,775 --> 01:09:28,553
Why is that combination so cute?

1396
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:33,415
Come on.
Let's do your hair.

1397
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,450
Why aren't you
and Mr. Stacks together?

1398
01:09:35,483 --> 01:09:38,654
That's a complicated question.

1399
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:41,323
Not really.
Do you like him?

1400
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:43,358
Well, you know,
I work for him. You know,

1401
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:45,260
liking him doesn't
really come into play.

1402
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:46,395
Okay.

1403
01:09:46,428 --> 01:09:47,863
I mean, is he my friend? Yes.

1404
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,532
Do I find him attractive?
Sure.

1405
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:53,635
And not just in the physical sense.
But he is very good-looking.

1406
01:09:53,668 --> 01:09:56,672
He's got lovely shoulders
and a great, chiseled face.

1407
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:59,241
Lovely lips. Good hair.

1408
01:09:59,274 --> 01:10:00,842
I wouldn't bank
on the hair, sister.

1409
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:03,245
Well, I'm far too busy
to be bothered

1410
01:10:03,278 --> 01:10:05,547
with anything like that
anyway, so...

1411
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,283
That sounds like something
Mr. Stacks would say.

1412
01:10:08,316 --> 01:10:11,353
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1413
01:10:11,386 --> 01:10:12,821
When my friend Pepper
liked this boy at school,

1414
01:10:12,854 --> 01:10:14,623
she punched him in the face.

1415
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:18,327
She got suspended, but they
play in the park together now.

1416
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,829
Sometimes I'd like to punch
Mr. Stacks in the face.

1417
01:10:20,862 --> 01:10:22,664
I'm just meaning punching.
That's it.

1418
01:10:22,697 --> 01:10:25,634
I just want to punch him.
He's annoying.

1419
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,645
Thanks for doing this, Will. Your
name's gonna look great up there.

1420
01:10:36,678 --> 01:10:39,414
Now, you sure the Guggenheims are
okay with me taking their name off?

1421
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,836
You gave me 100 million
reasons not to care.

1422
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:44,586
Did they find anything
on my parents?

1423
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:47,256
No, not yet. And we dug real deep.
I'm sorry.

1424
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:48,991
Thanks for trying.

1425
01:10:49,024 --> 01:10:50,926
Annie!

1426
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:52,794
Annie, come on! Annie, Annie!

1427
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,599
<i>New Yorkers face challenges
every single day.</i>

1428
01:10:57,632 --> 01:10:59,968
<i>Challenges that
seem insurmountable.</i>

1429
01:11:00,001 --> 01:11:02,371
<i>We all tell ourselves
"no" a lot.</i>

1430
01:11:02,404 --> 01:11:04,373
<i>We say,
"No, I won't get that job,"</i>

1431
01:11:04,406 --> 01:11:07,342
<i>or, "No, I can't
afford college."</i>

1432
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:08,810
<i>Unless it's you, Franklin,</i>

1433
01:11:08,843 --> 01:11:11,566
<i>coming from the mean streets
of Martha's Vineyard.</i>

1434
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,380
Hey! Yeah.

1435
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:17,586
<i>Let's change
those noes to yeses.</i>

1436
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:22,024
<i>Because when we say no, we're
actually just scared to say yes.</i>

1437
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:24,726
<i>So, let's start
saying yes to ourselves,</i>

1438
01:11:24,759 --> 01:11:26,871
<i>and let's say yes
to a brighter future.</i>

1439
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:33,502
<i>Now, many of you know that I've had
a visitor staying with me recently.</i>

1440
01:11:33,535 --> 01:11:36,505
<i>She only knows
the word "yes." Annie?</i>

1441
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:37,639
Hmm?

1442
01:11:37,672 --> 01:11:38,873
<i>Could you come up, please?</i>

1443
01:11:38,907 --> 01:11:41,343
Go on. You'll be great.
Go on, darling.

1444
01:11:41,376 --> 01:11:43,279
<i>Swallow your shrimp, Annie.</i>

1445
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:49,684
<i>Now, Annie,
I don't wanna embarrass you.</i>

1446
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:52,554
<i>I just want everyone to see what the
future of our city is all about.</i>

1447
01:11:52,587 --> 01:11:54,089
<i>Now, do you have
anything you want to say</i>

1448
01:11:54,122 --> 01:11:57,459
<i>to these good people that are
just oozing with liberal guilt?</i>

1449
01:11:57,492 --> 01:11:59,528
<i>Except for you, Senator.</i>

1450
01:11:59,561 --> 01:12:01,830
<i>I know you're trying
to build that fence.</i>

1451
01:12:04,999 --> 01:12:07,836

01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,672

- Annie.

- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

1522
01:16:03,805 --> 01:16:04,739
Young lady,
you're have to tell me

1523
01:16:04,772 --> 01:16:05,932
what's going on with you now!

1524
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,810
No, I don't!
You're not my dad.

1525
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:11,213
Wow.

1526
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:17,286
Well, I know that.
I know I'm not your dad.

1527
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:21,676
But I would like to know
what's going on with you.

1528
01:16:24,225 --> 01:16:25,561
I can't read.

1529
01:16:27,553 --> 01:16:29,331
What do you mean you can't read?

1530
01:16:29,364 --> 01:16:31,166
I've watched you read, Annie.

1531
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,068
Maybe you were just nervous.

1532
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:34,879
Sorry I ruined
your shrimp event.

1533
01:16:36,738 --> 01:16:37,806
What happened?

1534
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:40,141
I don't know.
She freaked out.

1535
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:42,944
Hey, what were you two
talking about earlier?

1536
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:46,247
She asked me to help her find her
parents, but it was a dead end.

1537
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,360
Even asked some of
my old buddies on the force.

1538
01:16:48,383 --> 01:16:49,317
There's nothing on that kid.

1539
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,719
Her parents.

1540
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,688
Genius.

1541
01:16:53,721 --> 01:16:55,123
Annie, what's wrong?

1542
01:16:55,156 --> 01:16:56,224
Get back!
Hey, hey, get back!

1543
01:16:56,257 --> 01:16:58,026
- Grace!
- Get back!

1544
01:16:58,059 --> 01:16:59,794
- Nash!
- Hey!

1545
01:16:59,827 --> 01:17:00,628
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Make room!

1546
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:01,830
She's a kid.
Get back. She's a kid.

1547
01:17:01,863 --> 01:17:03,098
Come on.

1548
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:04,600
Get back. She's a kid!

1549
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:17,779
Who is it?

1550
01:17:17,812 --> 01:17:20,035
<i>It's Guy Danlily.
I work for Will Stacks.</i>

1551
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:30,992
Come in.

1552
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:49,242
Hello there.

1553
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:52,080
Uh, Colleen Hannigan?

1554
01:17:52,113 --> 01:17:53,715
That's my maiden name.

1555
01:17:53,748 --> 01:17:56,526
But I'm not married to it,
if you know what I mean.

1556
01:17:57,085 --> 01:18:00,656
Can I buy you another drink?

1557
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:04,893
So, if he wins,
I get paid a fortune.

1558
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:07,028
More than anything
I've ever been paid combined.

1559
01:18:07,061 --> 01:18:08,129
Why so much?

1560
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:10,832
It's like getting paid
long odds on a dark horse.

1561
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:13,835
Do you know how hard it is
to get Will Stacks elected?

1562
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:15,748
"Never drop a call."
What does that even mean?

1563
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:17,072
Everybody texts now.

1564
01:18:17,105 --> 01:18:19,307
There have been worse
politicians than him.

1565
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,476
I know.
I got them elected.

1566
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:24,045
Schwarzenegger, Kim Jong-Il,
that blood diamonds guy.

1567
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:26,448
- What?
- But I'm over it.

1568
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:27,801
I'm tired of being the cockroach

1569
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:29,818
everybody needs,
but treats like a...

1570
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:30,919
Cockroach?

1571
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:32,087
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

1572
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,440
This is my last roll
at the table.

1573
01:18:33,454 --> 01:18:34,989
Get paid and get out.

1574
01:18:35,022 --> 01:18:37,926
There's no such thing
as a way out. Trust me.

1575
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:40,495
There's always a way out.
Trust me.

1576
01:18:40,528 --> 01:18:44,251
And in this particular case, it's
all about finding Annie's parents.

1577

80% surge in the polls for sure.

1589
01:19:23,504 --> 01:19:26,241
We talked about this already.
They don't exist.

1590
01:19:26,274 --> 01:19:27,876
We'll make them exist.

1591
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:30,378

1593

and miraculously show up
right before the election.

1594
01:19:34,115 --> 01:19:36,117

01:19:37,585 --> 01:19:40,155

Okay, we're not
doing that right now.

That's fine.
YOLO, YOLO. That's fine.

1618
01:20:46,354 --> 01:20:47,889
To easy street.

1619
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:02,370
I've been telling her she can do

1620
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:04,205
anything she wants
to do in this city,

1621
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:06,461
and come to find out
she can't even read.

1622
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,910
How does that happen?

1623
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,413
A lot of kids get lost, Will.
A lot of people get lost.

1624
01:21:12,446 --> 01:21:14,048
Well, it's unacceptable.

1625
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:15,470
We gotta get her a tutor.

1626
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,418
For her, though, right?

1627
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:18,971
- Not just for the press.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1628
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:20,055
For her.

1629
01:21:22,123 --> 01:21:24,225
What?

1630
01:21:24,258 --> 01:21:26,961
I can feel you smiling with
those Britisher-than-thou lips.

1631
01:21:26,994 --> 01:21:29,063
Your secret's
safe with me, Batman.

1632
01:21:29,096 --> 01:21:31,366
- What secret?
- That you care about her.

1633
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,635
I care about the kids
that are in New York City.

1634
01:21:33,668 --> 01:21:35,070
And Annie.

1635
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:39,007
Well, she lives in New York.

1636
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,542
So, therefore, she's cared for.

1637
01:21:41,575 --> 01:21:43,011
- It's a blanket...
- Mmm-hmm.

1638
01:21:43,044 --> 01:21:45,378
She's within the structure
of the whatever.

1639
01:21:56,691 --> 01:21:58,059
Annie?
Where you going?

1640
01:22:00,294 --> 01:22:03,364
Thanks for everything.
Sorry I messed up last night.

1641
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:05,566
Hope you can still be mayor.

1642
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:07,877
What are you talking about?
Get back here.

1643
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:11,472
It's okay.
I'm good at this part.

1644
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:14,561
I've had a lot of practice
getting kicked out of places.

1645
01:22:15,443 --> 01:22:16,611
Oh, Annie.

1646
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:21,416
Listen, put your bag down.
You're not going anywhere.

1647
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:22,517
Sandy's gotta go.

1648
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:24,152
Stop it.

1649
01:22:24,185 --> 01:22:25,353
You and Sandy are staying here,

1650
01:22:25,386 --> 01:22:27,188
and I don't care
what happened last night.

1651
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:30,024
No, I mean Sandy's gotta go.

1652
01:22:30,057 --> 01:22:32,660
No, I mean...
Oh, Sandy's gotta go. Okay.

1653
01:22:32,693 --> 01:22:34,429
Well, is it, uh,
champagne or gelato?

1654
01:22:34,462 --> 01:22:36,030
What?

1655
01:22:36,063 --> 01:22:38,619
Is it Mountain Dew
or is it just plain old doo?

1656
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:40,568
Is it lemonade
or chicken nuggets?

1657
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,036
We should... I should go.

1658
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:43,749
Now I wanna go because
my bladder's full.

1659
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:45,707
Come on, let's go.

1660
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,442
I saw you sign your name.

1661
01:22:47,475 --> 01:22:49,610
That's all you
gotta know how to do.

1662
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:52,046
But what about your teachers?
How is this possible?

1663
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:54,449
I'm good at hiding it.

1664
01:22:54,482 --> 01:22:56,284
Okay, at home. They
didn't catch it at home?

1665
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:58,319
"At home"?

1666
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:00,288
How come you didn't
tell anybody about this?

1667
01:23:00,321 --> 01:23:01,589
It's not like the whole world

1668
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:03,491
wants a foster kid
to begin with.

1669
01:23:03,524 --> 01:23:05,059
And plus, it's embarrassing.

1670
01:23:05,092 --> 01:23:06,704
I didn't want anyone to know.

1671
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,666
You know what?

1672
01:23:13,401 --> 01:23:14,901
I wanna show you something.

1673
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:23,378
This is good here.

1674
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:25,646
- Where are we?
- Queens.

1675
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,282
Do I need my passport?

1676
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:32,351
Truth is, Annie,
everybody's got something

1677
01:23:32,353 --> 01:23:34,188
that they don't want
anybody to know.

1678
01:23:34,388 --> 01:23:35,388
Including me.

1679
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:38,393
For me, this is it.

1680
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:41,029
This is my family.

1681
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,232
Can you see them right now?

1682
01:23:44,265 --> 01:23:47,135
No, I don't.
I see them in my mind.

1683
01:23:47,168 --> 01:23:49,103
Like this part
of the track right here?

1684
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:51,739
This is where my father
worked 20 hours a day.

1685
01:23:51,772 --> 01:23:53,661
Work, and work,
and work, and work.

1686
01:23:54,141 --> 01:23:56,311
And then, uh, he died.

1687
01:23:57,678 --> 01:23:59,014
I was 12 years old.

1688
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,815
What was he like?

1689
01:24:00,848 --> 01:24:02,817
I don't know.
I barely knew him.

1690
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:05,086
He was always working.

1691
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,423
And that's why I felt like
if I worked hard enough,

1692
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:12,112
then that'd probably
bring me closer to him.

1693
01:24:12,526 --> 01:24:16,297
And that's why I developed this.

1694
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:18,066
Well,

1695
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:22,337
now, you got this.

1696
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:31,813
Yeah, all right, Annie.
You know, this pollen

1697
01:24:31,846 --> 01:24:33,566
or something's got
my eyes all scratchy.

1698
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:35,283
Let's walk this way.

1699
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:37,039
We can see where the trains go.

1700
01:24:40,688 --> 01:24:44,459
It's so good to see you
after all these years!

1701
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:50,098
Yo, suit. No cuts, no butts, no coconuts.
You gotta sign in.

1702
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:51,566
- For what?
- The auditions.

1703
01:24:51,599 --> 01:24:52,734
Audition?

1704
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,570
Oh, my God!

1705
01:24:55,603 --> 01:24:56,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

1706
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:00,608
Oh! "We've been trying
so hard to find you!"

1707
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:02,777
- Where is she?
- Back there. Why?

1708
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:04,245
Wait!

1709
01:25:04,278 --> 01:25:06,247
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1710
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,280
Wait!

1711
01:25:07,915 --> 01:25:10,318
That's an interesting choice.

1712
01:25:10,351 --> 01:25:13,888
"Oh, darling girl! It's so good to
see you after all these years!"

1713
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:16,157
"We've been trying
so hard to find you,

1714
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:18,192
"and then we saw pictures of you

1715
01:25:18,225 --> 01:25:20,761
"with the nice man
running for mayor."

1716
01:25:20,794 --> 01:25:23,531
"Let's sing our special song
only us three know."

1717
01:25:23,564 --> 01:25:24,765
Locket!

1723
01:25:43,562 --> 01:25:44,785
What the hell is this?

1724
01:25:44,818 --> 01:25:46,621
A disaster.

1725
01:25:46,654 --> 01:25:48,523
You're garbage.
You're pitchy.

1726
01:25:48,556 --> 01:25:49,657
- Next!
- Come on.

1727
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:51,626
- I really like the script.
- David Kramer says hello!

1728
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:53,128
- Out!
- That hack.

1729
01:25:54,261 --> 01:25:55,730
What are you doing?

1730
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:58,299
You told me to find two
people to play her parents.

1731
01:25:58,332 --> 01:25:59,834
I meant some friends
or some neighborhood toughs.

1732
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:01,636
Not open auditions.

1733
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:03,905
These are callbacks.
I know, right?

1734
01:26:03,938 --> 01:26:04,939
And why are they singing?

1735
01:26:04,972 --> 01:26:06,574
People love musicals.

1736
01:26:06,607 --> 01:26:09,777
Bursting into song for no apparent reason.
It's magical!

1737

1739
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:14,282
Okay. You're done.

1740
01:26:14,315 --> 01:26:17,552
I'll take care of finding the parents.
You don't do anything.

1741
01:26:17,585 --> 01:26:18,825
I'll call you when I need you.

1742
01:26:18,852 --> 01:26:21,352
- But...
- No buts. We're running out of time.

1743
01:26:29,396 --> 01:26:30,396
Oh!

1744
01:26:34,835 --> 01:26:36,437
- Touch the sign!
- I did it!

1745
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:42,910
You ever see Casper the
Friendly Ghost throw up?

1746
01:26:42,943 --> 01:26:44,179
No.

1747
01:26:49,407 --> 01:26:51,019
Would you like a marshmallow?

1748
01:26:51,052 --> 01:26:53,775
Psych! How about a graham cracker?
You son of a...

1749
01:26:57,258 --> 01:26:58,759
You make me laugh.

1750
01:27:09,436 --> 01:27:12,807
Hey, Grace. Uh, let
me ask you something.

1751
01:27:14,975 --> 01:27:20,314
Exactly how hard would it be
to become a foster parent?

1752
01:27:20,347 --> 01:27:22,625
<i>And not temporarily either.
More like a...</i>

1753
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:26,587
Well, you know,
permanent situation.

1754
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,556
You mean, adopt Annie?

1755
01:27:28,589 --> 01:27:30,525
Yeah, well,
whatever the word is.

1756
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:32,894
That's the word, Will.

1757
01:27:34,295 --> 01:27:35,363
Then, uh...

1758
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,431
Yeah.

1759
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:02,623
Sandy.

1760
01:28:02,656 --> 01:28:04,926
We slept in the bed.

1761
01:28:06,393 --> 01:28:08,296
Which one do you prefer, Will?

1762
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,398
- Hmm?
- Uh, red.

1763
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:14,535
It's been two hours.
I don't think

1764
01:28:14,568 --> 01:28:16,504
she's completely learned
to read yet.

1765
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:17,857
Yeah, well,
not completely, but...

1766
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:19,874
Will! Will!

1767
01:28:19,907 --> 01:28:21,275
We got our game changer.

1768
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:23,744
Every election needs a game changer.
We got our game changer.

1769
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:25,913
- Stop saying "game changer."
- Annie's parents.

1770
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:29,058
They saw her picture, and they called us.
It's a miracle.

1771
01:28:29,258 --> 01:28:32,486
"Game changer." Apparently, they've
been looking for her for years,

1772
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:33,788
but she's not in the system.

1773
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:35,589
How do they know
she's their daughter?

1774
01:28:35,622 --> 01:28:36,657
Well, they know
everything about her.

1775
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,793
They know about the locket,
the note,

1776
01:28:38,826 --> 01:28:40,928
and oh, yeah, I ran a DNA test.

1777
01:28:42,029 --> 01:28:43,498
Boom goes the dynamite.

1778
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:48,768
DNA test.

1779
01:28:51,739 --> 01:28:53,774
All right, but don't tell her.

1780
01:28:53,807 --> 01:28:56,444
I wanna meet them
before Annie finds out.

1781
01:28:56,477 --> 01:28:57,311
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1782
01:28:57,345 --> 01:28:58,879
I mean, you should
totally be the one

1783
01:28:58,912 --> 01:29:00,848
who tells Annie that
we found her parents!

1784
01:29:00,881 --> 01:29:02,383
You found my parents?

1785
01:29:03,897 --> 01:29:05,953
Yes, honey, we did.
Well, we think so.

1786
01:29:05,986 --> 01:29:07,221
Really?

1787
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:10,424
Uh, yeah. We're gonna meet them
at a place called the Domani.

1788
01:29:10,457 --> 01:29:11,425
- That's where the note is from!
- No way!

1789
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,903
I knew they'd come for me.

1790
01:29:15,496 --> 01:29:16,864
Uh...

1791
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:20,901
I'm happy for you, Annie. I know
this is what you always wanted.

1792
01:29:20,934 --> 01:29:22,490
And it's all because of you.

1793
01:29:30,077 --> 01:29:34,548
I can't believe I'm gonna see my parents.
I'm kind of freaking out.

1794
01:29:40,988 --> 01:29:42,456
Annie! Annie! Over here!

1795
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:44,045
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

1796
01:29:44,992 --> 01:29:46,460
Very happy for you.

1797
01:29:46,493 --> 01:29:47,495
Thanks.

1798
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:49,664
Annie, The Reunion.

1799
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,135
- Annie.
- My girl.

1800
01:29:56,637 --> 01:29:58,573
Is it a match?
Let's see, huh?

1801
01:30:01,675 --> 01:30:03,144
It's a match.

1802
01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:05,613
We thought
we'd lost you forever.

1803
01:30:05,646 --> 01:30:06,847
Me, too.

1804
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,649
We fell upon hard times.

1805
01:30:08,682 --> 01:30:10,050
We just felt it was best for
someone else to look after you.

1806
01:30:10,083 --> 01:30:11,485
I figured.

1807
01:30:11,518 --> 01:30:13,187
I've never
forgiven myself for it.

1808
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:15,055
But when we
got back on our feet,

1809
01:30:15,088 --> 01:30:16,991
well, we just
couldn't find you, kid.

1810
01:30:17,024 --> 01:30:19,493
But the angels were looking out.

1811
01:30:19,526 --> 01:30:21,028
- Where do you live?
- New Jersey.

1812
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:23,097
Ooh.

1813
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,499
But we're moving
to Brazil for my job.

1814
01:30:25,532 --> 01:30:26,467
I think you're gonna
like it there.

1815
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,568
Cool.

1816
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:29,136
Okay, let's get started.

1817
01:30:29,169 --> 01:30:31,038
Everything is, uh, in order.

1818
01:30:31,071 --> 01:30:34,875
We have the DNA test
signed by the judge.

1819
01:30:34,908 --> 01:30:37,645
Now, we just need
signatures of the parents.

1820
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:39,345
- That's you guys.
- That's us.

1821
01:30:41,148 --> 01:30:43,551
Ma'am, sign right there.

1822
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,487
Hey. Remember me from before?

1823
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,522
- You know what, I do.
- That's right.

1824
01:30:48,555 --> 01:30:50,558
I didn't know that you were
Annie's foster mom.

1825
01:30:50,591 --> 01:30:52,593
- Amongst other things.
- I know.

1826
01:30:52,626 --> 01:30:53,861
She said that
you're a very good singer.

1827
01:30:53,894 --> 01:30:55,129
What'd she say?

1828
01:30:55,162 --> 01:30:57,598
"Oh!
She's a really good singer."

1829
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:58,566
No, she didn't do
any of that. She just said

1830
01:30:58,599 --> 01:31:01,044
you have a very nice voice,
and she liked it.

1831
01:31:01,969 --> 01:31:03,438
- She did?
- Yep.

1832
01:31:04,705 --> 01:31:07,141
Said it made her feel
good about herself.

1833
01:31:08,642 --> 01:31:09,844
Thank you, Rodney.

1834
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:12,213
The guardian of record.

1835
01:31:12,246 --> 01:31:14,549
That's you, stretch.
Come on. Right here.

1836
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,052
You sure about this?

1837
01:31:18,085 --> 01:31:19,954
That this is gonna win
you the election? Yeah.

1838
01:31:19,987 --> 01:31:22,690
No. Annie.

1839
01:31:22,723 --> 01:31:25,192
You don't pay me
to worry about her.

1840
01:31:25,225 --> 01:31:29,730
And the current temporary
guardian, William Stacks.

1841
01:31:31,064 --> 01:31:32,600
Mr. Stacks, we meet again.

1842
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:35,503
That is a very big pen.

1843
01:31:37,638 --> 01:31:39,006
Thank you.

1844
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:42,843
Okay. Well, according
to the State of New York,

1845
01:31:42,876 --> 01:31:46,080
you are officially reunited.

1846
01:31:46,113 --> 01:31:47,215
- Yay!
- Great!

1847
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:51,719
- We'll pick you up at 4:00.
- Great.

1848
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:55,223
All right.

1849
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:57,691
What were they like?

1850
01:31:57,724 --> 01:31:59,126
Hey! Hey, hey, wait!

1851
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,262
How did you do the DNA test?

1852
01:32:01,295 --> 01:32:03,130
You can do anything with money.

1853
01:32:03,163 --> 01:32:06,033
Well, who are those people, and
what's your plan with her, anyhow?

1854
01:32:06,066 --> 01:32:08,135
Don't worry about it.
She served her purpose.

1855
01:32:08,168 --> 01:32:09,637
What does that mean?

1856
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:11,605
That they'll hold her
for a while

1857
01:32:11,638 --> 01:32:13,307
then dump her back in the
system till after the election.

1858
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,142
No harm, no foul.

1859
01:32:15,175 --> 01:32:17,311
You can't do that to her. I mean,
she's still a little girl.

1860
01:32:17,344 --> 01:32:20,147
What do you care? Look, just go
home and keep your mouth shut.

1861
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:22,316
Hey! You can't
talk to me like that.

1862
01:32:22,349 --> 01:32:24,652
I know things about you.

1863
01:32:24,685 --> 01:32:26,287
Well, if you know
what's good for you,

1864
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,223
you'll go home,
and keep your mouth shut.

1865
01:32:30,993 --> 01:32:33,327
Mr. Stacks! Has it
helped you in the polls?

1866
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,665
Hey, folks, Mr. Stacks is thrilled
for Annie and her family.

1867
01:32:37,698 --> 01:32:41,035
Never drop a citizen.
Vote Stacks for mayor.

1868
01:32:41,068 --> 01:32:44,204
Annie! Annie! Did you enjoy seeing them?
How was it?

1869
01:33:00,888 --> 01:33:02,256
We're gonna miss you, Annie.

1870
01:33:02,289 --> 01:33:03,324
Yeah.

1871
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:08,237
We can finally get those
bubbles out of the apartment.

1872
01:33:11,064 --> 01:33:12,064
Yeah.

1873
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,344
Warm enough?

1874
01:33:23,377 --> 01:33:25,613
Yeah. Are you?

1875
01:33:28,048 --> 01:33:29,048
Yeah.

1876
01:33:31,351 --> 01:33:32,787
Is it dusty in here?

1877
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:35,188
Nah.

1878
01:33:35,222 --> 01:33:36,824
<i>The</i> New York Post
<i>reports Will Stacks</i>

1879
01:33:36,857 --> 01:33:38,859
<i>reuniting Annie with her parents</i>

1880
01:33:38,892 --> 01:33:41,362
<i>has pushed him into a dead
heat in the race for mayor.</i>

1881
01:33:41,395 --> 01:33:45,366
<i>He was once trailing
by as much as 30 points.</i>

1882
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:47,968
Hey, baby. So, I haven't seen
you in here for a minute.

1883
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:49,036
To what do I owe this pleasure?

1884
01:33:49,069 --> 01:33:50,104
Take it easy.

1885
01:33:50,137 --> 01:33:52,239
How you doing?

1886
01:33:52,272 --> 01:33:54,808
Not super awesome.

1887
01:33:54,841 --> 01:33:56,810
You want me to
make you a sandwich?

1888
01:33:56,843 --> 01:33:58,510
How about if I make you a key?

1889
01:34:00,383 --> 01:34:02,383
You ever do anything
that you thought

1890
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:04,985
was really a good idea
at the time,

1891
01:34:05,018 --> 01:34:07,221
but then after, it's
like you're not so sure.

1892
01:34:07,254 --> 01:34:08,922
Yeah.
Putting up that key sign.

1893
01:34:08,955 --> 01:34:11,511
I don't know the first thing
about making keys.

1894
01:34:11,803 --> 01:34:14,192
What's the matter, sweetie?
What did you do?

1895
01:34:14,194 --> 01:34:16,917
'Cause, whatever it is,
you know I'm here to help.

1896
01:34:18,465 --> 01:34:21,735
Why are you so nice to me,
the way I treat you?

1897
01:34:21,768 --> 01:34:25,546
Because under all that bitter, there's
a sweet lady with a big heart.

1898
01:34:27,174 --> 01:34:29,619
She's just been gone
for a while. That's all.

Guys, I need your help.

01:38:08,295 --> 01:38:09,496
- Hey.
- Hey.

1946
01:38:12,098 --> 01:38:15,135
Gotta give this back to you.
It won't work in Brazil.

1947
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,408
Yeah, we're not in Brazil yet.

1948
01:38:16,436 --> 01:38:19,640
We're in Ecuador,
Bolivia, Colombia...

1949
01:38:19,673 --> 01:38:21,041
Actually, southern Colombia.
Now, Bogota,

1950
01:38:21,074 --> 01:38:22,576
that's a tough place
to penetrate.

1951
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:24,498
Yeah, I've heard that
about Bogota.

1952
01:38:27,213 --> 01:38:28,482
Made you something.

1953
01:38:28,515 --> 01:38:29,884
Really?

1954
01:38:34,154 --> 01:38:37,991
That's me, that's Sandy,
and that's you.

1955
01:38:38,024 --> 01:38:40,027
I copied "Stacks" from my phone.

1956
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:46,100
I'm gonna miss you.

1957
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,275
- Annie.
- Hi.

1958
01:38:55,308 --> 01:38:57,210
- You ready?
- We're gonna go straight to the airport, kid.

1959
01:38:57,243 --> 01:38:58,144
Okay.

1960
01:38:58,178 --> 01:39:00,180
It's been great
getting to know you, Annie.

1961
01:39:00,213 --> 01:39:02,583
You're such
a special little girl.

1962
01:39:05,142 --> 01:39:07,254
You should punch
Mr. Stacks in the face

1963
01:39:07,287 --> 01:39:09,454
so you can go play
in the park together.

1964
01:39:10,056 --> 01:39:11,992
Then you'll have a real friend.

1965
01:39:12,025 --> 01:39:13,260
That was between us!

1966
01:39:13,293 --> 01:39:14,528
- Okay?
- Okay.

1967
01:39:14,561 --> 01:39:16,029
I'd like to help you out.

1968
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:21,034
No, thank you.
We don't believe in handouts.

1969
01:39:21,067 --> 01:39:23,623
Only hand ups. And you've
already given us one.

1970
01:39:27,007 --> 01:39:28,208
Bye, Annie.

1971
01:39:31,177 --> 01:39:32,346
Never slow your roll.

1972
01:39:32,379 --> 01:39:33,379
You neither.

1973
01:39:36,683 --> 01:39:37,685
Whoa!

1974
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:39,954
What a cute dog.

1975
01:39:41,488 --> 01:39:43,123
- Come on.
- Bye.

1976
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:45,993
Bye.

1977
01:39:51,364 --> 01:39:53,633
Goodbye, Annie.

1978
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:57,204
The press is eating this up.
We're gonna crush.

1979
01:39:57,237 --> 01:40:01,208
Goodbye, Harold Gray, you
pathetic, nonprofit do-gooder.

1980
01:40:06,313 --> 01:40:08,281
Grace, where are we
with that phone battery?

1981
01:40:08,314 --> 01:40:09,349
What?

1982
01:40:09,382 --> 01:40:12,085
A full week on one charge,
where are we with that?

1983
01:40:12,118 --> 01:40:14,221
- We're close.
- Close is not good enough.

1984
01:40:14,254 --> 01:40:17,357
- Well, we don't have the...
- We've already wasted enough time.

1985
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:19,668
I'm gonna go call
the research department.

1986
01:40:28,134 --> 01:40:29,301
Knock them dead, kid.

1987
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:33,439
Bye, Annie!

1988
01:40:46,553 --> 01:40:49,356
Will? I hate
seeing you like this.

1989
01:40:49,389 --> 01:40:50,557
Grace, I'm fine.
Let's just...

1990
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,590
Mr. Stacks, I think
you're gonna wanna hear this.

1991
01:40:52,592 --> 01:40:54,127
Annie's in trouble.

1992
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,595
- What?
- Those weren't her real parents.

1993
01:40:55,628 --> 01:40:57,197
What? What is happening?

1994
01:40:57,230 --> 01:40:58,698
Ignore her, 'cause
she's clearly insane.

1995
01:40:58,731 --> 01:41:00,801
Watch your mouth, <i> chango.</i>

1996
01:41:00,834 --> 01:41:03,503
Look, I did something terrible,
and I'm really sorry.

1997
01:41:03,536 --> 01:41:05,272
What do you mean those
aren't her real parents?

1998
01:41:05,305 --> 01:41:08,141
He had them take her somewhere.

1999
01:41:08,174 --> 01:41:09,342
I can't believe
I danced with you!

2000
01:41:09,375 --> 01:41:10,215
You danced with him?

2001
01:41:10,243 --> 01:41:12,345
I was desperate.
He was a little handsy.

2002
01:41:12,378 --> 01:41:14,347
- Where is Annie?
- What have you done?

2003
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:15,449
Where's Annie?

2004
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:18,052
Is it cold in Brazil?

2005
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:21,088
Just be cool.

2006
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:22,422
She's asking questions.

2007
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,404
Do you collect ashtrays?

2008
01:41:25,425 --> 01:41:26,460
No.

2009
01:41:27,527 --> 01:41:29,863
- Art?
- No.

2010
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:31,798
- Do you play piano?
- Just shut up.

2011
01:41:31,831 --> 01:41:33,567
Where are we going?

2012
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,569
We're just taking you
someplace for a little bit.

2013
01:41:35,602 --> 01:41:37,170
Just relax.

2014
01:41:37,203 --> 01:41:39,148
You're not my
real parents, are you?

2015
01:41:40,907 --> 01:41:42,409
Sit back. Sit still.

2016
01:41:42,442 --> 01:41:43,276
What are you doing?
Stop that.

2017
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:44,444
Let me go!

2018
01:41:44,477 --> 01:41:46,146
When Mr. Stacks
finds out about this...

2019
01:41:46,179 --> 01:41:47,781
Stacks doesn't need you anymore.

2020
01:41:47,814 --> 01:41:49,648
Why do you think
we're taking you?

2021
01:41:50,683 --> 01:41:52,719
You work for Mr. Stacks?

2022
01:41:52,752 --> 01:41:54,454
He wouldn't do this.

2023
01:41:54,487 --> 01:41:57,491
Yeah, well, I guess
he has enough photos.

2024
01:42:01,528 --> 01:42:03,363
Mr. Stacks did this?

2025
01:42:10,003 --> 01:42:12,706
Call my guy at the FBI.
I want to get everyone on it.

2026
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:14,174
I got it.

2027
01:42:14,207 --> 01:42:15,408
I'm already on with the police.

2028
01:42:15,441 --> 01:42:16,710
I didn't think anything
like this could happen.

2029
01:42:16,743 --> 01:42:18,545
How could you not know
who has her?

2030
01:42:18,578 --> 01:42:20,514
I got a guy who takes care
of these kinds of things.

2031
01:42:20,547 --> 01:42:22,149
It keeps our hands clean.
Trust me.

2032
01:42:22,182 --> 01:42:24,016
I can't trust you.
You took Annie.

2033
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:41,700
Hey!

2034
01:42:42,402 --> 01:42:43,503
Hey, look!

2035
01:42:43,536 --> 01:42:44,905
It's me! Annie!

2036
01:42:46,606 --> 01:42:47,707
- Hey, girl!
- Help!

2037
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:48,775
Get her. Grab her.

2038
01:42:48,808 --> 01:42:50,243
Sit, sit, sit still.

2039
01:42:50,276 --> 01:42:51,278
Don't touch me!

2040
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:52,311
Sit still!

2041
01:42:56,883 --> 01:42:58,652
Everybody, listen up.

2042
01:42:58,685 --> 01:43:01,621
- Check every call within a 10-mile radius.
- On it.

2043
01:43:01,654 --> 01:43:03,256
I knew they could do that!

2044
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:05,358
Someone just posted a picture
of Annie on Twitter.

2045
01:43:05,391 --> 01:43:07,427
- Where?
- 54th and 6th.

2046
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,429
Another one on an Annie blog.
It looks like she's waving.

2047
01:43:09,462 --> 01:43:10,907
- 57th and 6th.
- Let's go.

2048
01:43:12,432 --> 01:43:14,968
Hey. You do this,
and everyone will know.

2049
01:43:15,001 --> 01:43:17,604
Forget about being mayor. It'll
destroy your whole business!

2050
01:43:17,637 --> 01:43:18,838
I don't care.

2051
01:43:18,871 --> 01:43:20,607
You're making a huge mistake.

2052
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:21,975
Think about everything
you've worked for.

2053
01:43:22,008 --> 01:43:23,510
That everything means nothing.

2054
01:43:23,543 --> 01:43:25,345
You're fired.

2055
01:43:25,378 --> 01:43:26,712
- You! Talk to him.
- Ow!

2056
01:43:27,614 --> 01:43:29,559
You're the only one
he'll listen to.

2057
01:43:32,452 --> 01:43:34,421
It's not 'cause she likes you.

2058
01:43:34,454 --> 01:43:36,323
She's got these pointy little...

2059
01:43:38,424 --> 01:43:39,659
Oh!

2060
01:43:39,692 --> 01:43:42,362
Nice chopper! What
is this, a Bell 429?

2061
01:43:42,395 --> 01:43:43,730
What?

2062
01:43:43,763 --> 01:43:46,333
What, a guy like me
can't know about helicopters?

2063
01:43:46,366 --> 01:43:48,835
I don't know anything about helicopters!
It's written right here.

2064
01:43:48,868 --> 01:43:49,836
Gilbert, let's go.

2065
01:43:49,869 --> 01:43:50,971
Roger that.

2066
01:43:51,004 --> 01:43:52,560
- Who's Roger?
- Who's Roger?

2067
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,777
Is anyone else dizzy?

2068
01:44:02,482 --> 01:44:03,550
Look! It's Annie!

2069
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:04,518
Help.

2070
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:06,720
Another picture on Instagram.
65th and 10th.

2071
01:44:06,753 --> 01:44:08,588
Head west, Gil.

2072
01:44:16,596 --> 01:44:18,465
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey!

2073
01:44:18,498 --> 01:44:19,599
Hold her still.

2074
01:44:24,771 --> 01:44:26,573
We'll find her, Will.

2075
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,229
Just posted on
the George Washington Bridge.

2076
01:44:30,429 --> 01:44:32,070
She's waving.
She's doing it on purpose!

2077
01:44:32,078 --> 01:44:33,280
Head uptown, Gil.

2078
01:44:42,922 --> 01:44:44,524
There she is!

2079
01:44:45,692 --> 01:44:46,893
Don't lose them.

2080
01:44:51,932 --> 01:44:54,601
On an Annie blog! She's
heading to the State Park.

2081
01:44:54,634 --> 01:44:55,835
They're headed into the park.

2082
01:44:55,869 --> 01:44:59,203
Gilbert, don't make me come up
there and fly this helicopter.

2083
01:45:01,974 --> 01:45:03,310
There they are!

2084
01:45:03,343 --> 01:45:05,412
- Annie! Annie!
- Annie!

2085
01:45:05,445 --> 01:45:07,168
I don't think she can hear you.

2086
01:45:14,387 --> 01:45:16,923
What? It's the cops.

2087
01:45:27,133 --> 01:45:29,803
Oh, no. It's Stacks.

2088
01:45:29,836 --> 01:45:31,448
Why would he be following us?

2089
01:45:40,113 --> 01:45:41,113
- Watch it!
- Whoa!

2090
01:45:41,881 --> 01:45:42,982
Watch out!

2091
01:45:46,853 --> 01:45:48,688
- Annie!
- Annie.

2092
01:45:56,829 --> 01:45:58,941
- Gil, let's land this!
- Cut them off.

2093
01:46:00,733 --> 01:46:02,602
I really hope
we find Annie soon.

2094
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:06,071
No!

2095
01:46:07,774 --> 01:46:08,774
Annie!

2096
01:46:09,709 --> 01:46:10,844
Get them!

2097
01:46:10,877 --> 01:46:12,412
NYPD, hold it!

2098
01:46:14,781 --> 01:46:15,781
Annie!

2099
01:46:16,649 --> 01:46:17,784
Annie, are you okay?

2100
01:46:17,817 --> 01:46:19,552
I'm fine. We even now?

2101
01:46:19,585 --> 01:46:21,141
- What?
- Want another photo?

2102
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:27,127
- It's not like that, honey.
- It's exactly like that.

2103
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:29,529
You don't care about me. I was
just an opportunity to you.

2104
01:46:29,562 --> 01:46:31,097
- No, that's not true.
- It is true.

2105
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:33,800
You did all this to me
so you could be stupid mayor!

2106
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,468
No... Listen,
you gotta trust me!

2107
01:46:35,501 --> 01:46:37,181
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anybody!

2108
01:46:37,203 --> 01:46:39,573
- No!
- Just let me go!

2109
01:46:40,475 --> 01:46:42,809
Listen, I'm sorry for
what happened to you.

2110
01:46:42,842 --> 01:46:44,077
I can't look you in the eye

2111
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:46,146
and tell you that I didn't know
that something was going on.

2112
01:46:46,179 --> 01:46:49,015
But I did not know that those
people weren't your parents.

2113
01:46:49,048 --> 01:46:50,384
You gotta believe me.

2114
01:46:54,454 --> 01:46:55,510
This is you, Annie.

2115
01:46:58,658 --> 01:46:59,693
It's you.

2116
01:47:03,696 --> 01:47:05,165
Oh, wait, wait.

2117
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:06,133
Sir! Sir.

2118
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:08,802
I officially withdraw
from this mayoral race.

2119
01:47:10,937 --> 01:47:14,808
I think that this city deserves
someone better than I am.

2120
01:47:14,841 --> 01:47:16,643
I wanna take time out
to concentrate

2121
01:47:16,676 --> 01:47:18,711
on things that really
matter to me the most,

2122
01:47:18,744 --> 01:47:21,078
and that's this
amazing little girl, Annie.

2123
01:47:22,815 --> 01:47:23,850
Because...

2124
01:47:28,488 --> 01:47:29,823
Oh, It's kind of dusty.

2125
01:47:34,093 --> 01:47:36,196
No, it's not dusty.

2126
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:37,697
I'm crying.

2127
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:40,867
That's my family.

2128
01:47:41,934 --> 01:47:43,036
Thank you.

2129
01:47:57,817 --> 01:47:59,540
I need one more thing from you.

2130
01:48:00,586 --> 01:48:03,623
You are always on the hustle.
What is it now?

2131
01:48:04,924 --> 01:48:06,626
Stop playing games.

2132
01:48:11,831 --> 01:48:12,998
Oh, yeah, I got this.

2133
01:48:14,767 --> 01:48:15,935
You all right?

2134
01:48:15,968 --> 01:48:17,737
I'm fine.

2135
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,673
Grace, listen,
I've always had a problem

2136
01:48:20,706 --> 01:48:23,040
with realizing what's
right in front of me,

2137
01:48:23,543 --> 01:48:26,045
and, well, I'm learning.

2138
01:48:26,078 --> 01:48:28,412
Would you like to
go out to dinner with me?

2139
01:48:28,614 --> 01:48:29,614
What?

2140
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:33,753
I mean, without you,
I can't function.

2141
01:48:33,786 --> 01:48:35,675
That just doesn't mean
work either.

2142
01:48:36,324 --> 01:48:37,991
You're right about everything.

2143
01:48:38,024 --> 01:48:39,659
You're right about the phone,
you're right about Guy,

2144
01:48:39,692 --> 01:48:40,560
you're right about
this mayoral race,

2145
01:48:40,593 --> 01:48:41,761
