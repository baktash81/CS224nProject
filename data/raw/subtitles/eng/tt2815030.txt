1
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,745
Morning, Lee.

2
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,415
What's in the package?

3
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,592
Curtain rods.

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,266
Good morning. Hello?

5
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,592
<i>And here is the President
of the United States.</i>

6
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,221
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

7
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,223
<i>We can...
And there's Jackie.</i>

8
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,179
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

9
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,606
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

10
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,525
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

11
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,695
<i>as the President and
the first lady pass by.</i>

12
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,194
<i>There is Lyndon Johnson
and Lady Bird passing by.</i>

13
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,514
Thank you, sir.

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,523
<i>Thank you for seeing
me, Mr. Snyder.</i>

15
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,985
My name is Lee Oswald, and I've come
to renounce my American citizenship.

16
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,442
Why would you do that?

17
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,985
I'm a Marxist.

18
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,160
You're a Marine, for God's sakes.
Marines don't defect.

19
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,242
I've seen enough of
democratic society,

20
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,872
of capitalistic society.

21
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,875
My mother worked her whole life
making profits for capitalists.

22
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,878
They push you down and they
never appreciate who you are.

23
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,044
Have a seat.

24
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,016
How old are you?

25
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,140
Twenty. 20 years and 13 days.

26
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,688
You're young, you're confused,
you're hurt, you're angry.

27
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,187
This is not an emotional decision.

28
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,939
I have studied Marx.

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,698
You don't even know
what life is like here.

30
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,150
In six months you're
gonna regret what...

31
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,198
I've told the Soviets
that I know things.

32
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,110
I had a very
high-security clearance.

33
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,867
I was a radar technician for
the United States government.

34
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,782
I am valuable.

35
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,711
You'd be a traitor. I believe
that what I'm doing is right.

36
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,505
And now the Soviets will see that
I'm serious. This will show them.

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,084
Mr. Oswald, when something like
this is done, it can't be undone.

38
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,919
No one ever listens to me.

39
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,179
Nobody believes me.

40
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,388
Now, I've made my decision,
and I'm through.

41
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,647
Well, if you're serious, you take
a few days and you come back.

42
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:56,404
A reporter, a young woman,
very attractive, asked me,

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,615
"Senator Kennedy, how did you
get to become a war hero?"

44
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,998
And I told her that it
was completely involuntary.

45
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,249
They sunk my boat.

46
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,330
They're ready for you, Jack.

47
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,181
This was supposed to be Joe.

48
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,273
He was the oldest.

49
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,855
Father always thought
it would be Joe.

50
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,034
And he was shot down,
and we were all,

51
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,320
stunned.

52
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,698
Cut into the way things
were supposed to go.

53
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,004
Never supposed to be me,

54
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,671
but it is.

55
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,005
It was always supposed to be you.

56
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,509
Are you ready?

57
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,326
I am today announcing
my candidacy

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,778
for the presidency
of the United States.

59
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,491
<i>The very first returns are now
beginning to pour in substantially,</i>

60
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,667
<i>and those in just a moment.</i>

61
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,413
<i>So first of all, let us
go to our summary board.</i>

62
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,293
Bobby's got Lyndon
on the phone for you.

63
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,971
How's it going in there, Kenny?
It's close.

64
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,598
We knew it would be.

65
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,267
It's gonna come down to
Illinois, Texas and California.

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,436
Well, we're gonna need Texas.

67
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,109
How is he? Is he jolly?

68
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,731
It's Lyndon.

69
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,736
Hello, Lyndon.
<i>I see we're winning in Pennsylvania,</i>

70
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,443
but what the hell
happened to you in Ohio?

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,737
Well, how's it going
down there?

72
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,035
Well, I'm happy to tell you,

73
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,867
Texas is gonna be close,
but safe.

74
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,668
Well, all right. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

75
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,087
Swear to God, Jack.
Swear to God.

76
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,886
If that's all it takes
to make you president

77
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,464
is to make that son of a bitch Lyndon
Johnson vice president, then so be it.

78
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,675
It's the best deal
we ever made.

79
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>Gradually throughout the
night, he's widened that lead.</i>

80
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,055
<i>He's about a half million
ahead right now.</i>

81
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:32,018
<i>In Connecticut, Kennedy
took that state by 9:00.</i>

82
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,986
<i>He rode up a very, very big...</i>
Jack, look at that!

83
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,825
You've won Connecticut.
You're president now.

84
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,114
No, no, no.
But look at the lead you've got!

85
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,991
Well, yeah, sure,
in the Northeast,

86
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,994
but we need to wait till the
Midwest and then the West.

87
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,626
It's gonna be a long night.

88
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,800
Well, tell me in the morning
who wins, Mr. President.

89
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,097
Don't say that!

90
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,897
So, my fellow Americans,

91
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:19,447
<i>ask not what your country
can do for you.</i>

92
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,697
<i>Ask what you can do
for your country.</i>

93
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,946
Dance.

94
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,825
Would you dance?

95
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,664
Marina.

96
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,000
Lee.

97
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,598
No, I'm not Chinese.
I'm American.

98
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,770
And my coworkers at the
radio factory call me Alik.

99
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,939
Marina.
A beautiful Russian girl.

100
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,920
I wanted to study in Moscow, but
they sent me to this horrible place.

101
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,592
I like it better now.

102
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,395
May I...

103
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,396
May I kiss you?

104
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,216
Mr. President.

105
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,059
I'm sorry, but we got
a major problem in Cuba.

106
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,518
<i>The invasion
of Cuba has created</i>

107
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,980
<i>a highly delicate and difficult
situation for the United States.</i>

108
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,316
<i>Cuba has said that
the invasion was mounted</i>

109
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,527
<i>from Florida and
from Guatemala.</i>

110
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,988
<i>The United States has denied
this, so has Guatemala.</i>

111
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,665
<i>Castro knew the
battle plan beforehand,</i>

112
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,086
<i>prepared an ambush and assigned himself
a prominent role in the battle.</i>

113
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,625
Right now, the rebels are
pinned down here, on the beach.

114
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,179
Castro himself is there.
Castro? On the beach?

115
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,131
In a T-34 tank.

116
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,435
I speak for the joint chiefs,
and I think CIA agrees as well,

117
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,105
it is imperative that the United
States provide air support.

118
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,392
Well, I don't want the United
States involved in this.

119
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,021
We are involved in this.

120
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,854
We trained these rebels.
You approved the mission.

121
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,985
And you told me
the plan would work.

122
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,113
You told me those men will be
met by anti-Castro forces.

123
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,328
And where are they?
Are they there?

124
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,789
Mr. President, are you aware there will
be significant casualties sustained?

125
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,293
We need to act, and
we need to act now.

126
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,552
<i>Beaches were not prepared
by air or artillery bombardment.</i>

127
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,257
<i>Those able to move beyond the beaches
were trapped in swamp or high growth</i>

128
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,465
<i>which was burned off,</i>

129
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,394
<i>and the fire forced them out one by one
into the hands of Castro's forces,</i>

130
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,812
<i>prisoners of war, dupes of
the United States government.</i>

131
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,479
Jack?

132
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,950
Jack, what is it?

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,075
Jack, it's me.
You can talk to me.

134
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,169
It's a catastrophe.

135
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:30,175
The one hour of air support
that I ordered got screwed up.

136
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,796
The two units didn't connect because
of a one-hour time difference.

137
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,223
These incompetent son of a bitches,
they can't even tell time!

138
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,057
I don't know why I ever
listened to them.

139
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,888
You couldn't have known.
The President should know.

140
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,853
How could I be so stupid?

141
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,191
Jack, you're being too hard on yourself.
But they said it.

142
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,361
They said I was
too young, too soft...

143
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,616
About communism.

144
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,865
And I told them I was ready.

145
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,741
And they trusted me.

146
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,324
They still do.

147
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,544
There are men dying
on those beaches,

148
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,413
right now.

149
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,257
I'm supposed to be the most
powerful man in the world,

150
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,050
and I...

151
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,214
I'm impotent.

152
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,722
Well, I'll tell you what.

153
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,893
This is the last time anyone's gonna
make a decision like that for me.

154
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,522
<i>And here on the
beaches around the Bay of Pigs,</i>

155
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,230
<i>the invasion floundered and the
search for scapegoats began.</i>

156
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,070
<i>The issue has been sharpened
further by disclosure</i>

157
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,243
<i>of the President's
behind-the-scenes role.</i>

158
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:43,157
The record will reflect that we at State
opposed the plan as a grave mistake.

159
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,083
That's the most meaningless
bullshit I ever heard.

160
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,836
You people are so anxious
to cover your own asses,

161
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,255
all you want to do is dump
this on the President.

162
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,175
Well, you bright fellows
got my brother into this.

163
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,675
Only three months into office
and now, thanks to you,

164
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,930
the President of the United States is
regarded as a paper tiger by the Russians.

165
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:08,189
Well, there's an old saying

166
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,063
that victory has
a thousand fathers,

167
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,110
but defeat is an orphan.

168
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,444
The responsibility's mine.

169
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,535
I am the president.

170
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,963
I didn't do nothing to you.

171
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,147
Spy! American spy!

172
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,779
Spy!

173
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,880
You're back, like a bad penny.

174
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,340
Told you you'd regret it.

175
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,305
It's not what I thought
it would be.

176
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,974
And it's so damn cold.

177
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,975
I don't think I can take
another winter here.

178
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,062
Can you guarantee me there'll be
no legal proceedings against me?

179
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,394
I don't see why there would be.

180
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,444
Ironically, because
you failed to return,

181
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,272
you never officially
renounced your citizenship.

182
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,948
Can I bring my wife Marina?

183
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,613
Your wife's a Russian. She'll require an
exit visa from the Soviet authorities.

184
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,823
I want to bring my wife
back to the United States.

185
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,712
You're gonna love America, Mama.
I promise you.

186
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,554
English no good,
have no clothes.

187
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,646
You're gonna be fine.
And they'll love you there.

188
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,348
And we'll be happier
there, I promise.

189
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,650
Alik, you like little bird.

190
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,692
Where you happy?

191
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,695
A wife belongs with her husband,
and a baby with her father.

192
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,653
Junka needs her papa.

193
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,381
But, I would say that
being president is a fine job.

194
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,548
It's a fine job.

195
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,302
I get to walk to work
and the pay is nice.

196
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,516
You look so beautiful.

197
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,872
Would you tell Mrs. Baldridge
that we are on our way down?

198
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,429
Yes, Mr. President.

199
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,529
Mr. Oswald.
Please!

200
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,527
Mr. Oswald, are you a communist?

201
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,233
Yes, basically.

202
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,160
Although I hate the USSR,
I do believe that Marxism

203
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,364
can exist under
different circumstances.

204
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,040
Why did you go to the
USSR, Mr. Oswald?

205
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,742
I went as a mark of protest

206
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,328
against American political
policies in foreign countries.

207
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,542
I'm working.

208
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,879
Go finish packing.

209
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,929
Go mind the baby then. Go.

210
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,394
Mr. Oswald, are you
a communist?

211
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,020
No, of course not.

212
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,274
Mr. Oswald, why have you chosen
to come back to America?

213
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,606
I have lived under
both systems.

214
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,448
I have sought the answers.

215
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,824
Thank you, Mr. Oswald.
You are a true patriot.

216
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,203
His name is Oswald?

217
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,206
Lee Harvey Oswald.

218
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,996
I have to wonder what he
was really doing in Russia

219
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,127
and why the hell the State
Department let him come back.

220
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,628
How'd he end up in Dallas?

221
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,710
He's from here,
his mother's here.

222
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,387
I interviewed her
two years ago after he left.

223
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,057
"My poor misunderstood boy"
and all that.

224
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,885
What'd he do, change his
name to Oswaldovitch?

225
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,895
Mr. Oswald? I'm John Fain.
I'm an agent with the FBI.

226
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,148
I was told there'd be no
charges brought against me.

227
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,481
There are no charges. I'm
just asking a few questions.

228
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,566
I expected questions
from reporters.

229
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,576
There weren't any reporters.

230
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,743
Why did you go to Russia
in the first place?

231
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,164
Mr. Oswald?

232
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,507
It's just something I did.

233
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,510
Did you go to Russia
because you're a communist?

234
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,714
I don't really want to talk about
the past. I mean, I'm here now.

235
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,764
Are you now or have you ever
been a communist?

236
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,092
I've never had a card.

237
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,102
When you went to Russia,

238
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,556
your mother told
the State Department

239
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,142
you were some sort
of secret agent.

240
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,778
Are you?

241
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,900
A secret agent?

242
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,357
Are you involved with
an intelligence agency?

243
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,785
You're FBI.
Yes.

244
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,455
And you don't know.

245
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,425
Lee?

246
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,761
Oh, my God. It's as hot
in here as it is outside.

247
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,471
You live in this?

248
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,643
Oh! This is horrible.

249
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,156
How can you raise my granddaughter
in a horrible place like this?

250
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,408
<i>Nyet, nyet.</i>

251
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,031
Why don't you speak English yet?

252
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,159
You moved here,
you should speak English.

253
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,708
Mama, Mama,
what are you doing here?

254
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,243
Oh, I brought groceries,
I brought diapers.

255
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
How did you find us?

256
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,412
Why is it so hot in here?

257
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,668
I didn't want you coming here.

258
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,045
Oh, you can't live here.
You're moving back in with me.

259
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,969
No, Mama, I told you
we're not moving in with you.

260
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,596
And what are you wearing? Married
women don't wear shorts that short.

261
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,973
Ooh, she is a sour girl,
that one.

262
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,862
I brought a bassinette.
It's in the trunk.

263
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,933
Why don't you go out
and get it?

264
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,142
No, Mama,
I don't want you here.

265
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,853
I don't want you
meddling in our lives.

266
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,938
Well, I can drive you around
to look for a job.

267
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,273
I found a job!

268
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,108
Oh, well, I can help
with the baby.

269
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,488
I don't want your help.

270
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,912
You understand? That's why we moved.
To get away from you.

271
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,228
That's why I joined
the Marines.

272
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,872
Now you stop that. You don't
talk to me like that.

273
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,537
Where are you going?

274
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,418
I'm going to check
on my wife and daughter,

275
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,966
and when I come back,
I want you gone.

276
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,010
Lee, you finally came
back home to me,

277
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,713
don't let that woman
take you away from me again.

278
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,264
You're it!

279
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,442
Oh, Mrs. Kennedy.

280
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,237
I'm sorry.
The pool is closed.

281
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,367
Closed?

282
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,619
Yes, closed, Mrs. Kennedy.

283
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,504
Oh, no!

284
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,545
I see.

285
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,094
You have a woman problem.

286
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,107
Judith Campbell?

287
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,271
Edgar tells me in my capacity
as Attorney General

288
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,982
and as much as my capacity
as your brother, I imagine,

289
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,739
that you're having an affair
with Judith Campbell.

290
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,996
Who is also having an affair
with Sam Giancana.

291
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,032
Sam Giancana is a mobster.

292
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,208
I'm aware of who Sam is.

293
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:11,502
Jesus Christ, Jack. I'm investigating
Sam Giancana for racketeering!

294
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,546
The press has been very good about
looking the other way when it comes to...

295
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,715
But this is dangerous.

296
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,520
All right.

297
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,438
Is there anything else?

298
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,442
No Judith Campbell.

299
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,523
No Giancana.

300
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,863
No mob.

301
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,959
Mr. Oswald.

302
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,711
I've already answered
all your questions.

303
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,010
Would you mind talking with us again?
Just a few minutes.

304
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,851
Well, my wife and
daughter are inside, so.

305
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,303
We don't need to disturb them.

306
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,180
We'll just talk here.

307
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,027
We learned that you contacted the
Russian Embassy in Washington.

308
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,741
You mind telling us why?

309
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,240
My wife is a Russian citizen.

310
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,359
She's supposed to let the
embassy know where she is.

311
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,410
Is that all? What do
you mean, is that all?

312
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,867
Did you talk to any Soviet
intelligence officers?

313
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,452
About what?

314
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,087
About American imperialism?

315
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,757
About inequality for Negroes?
What?

316
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,962
What I want to know, Lee, is are
they asking you to spy for them?

317
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,932
Is that why they
let you come back?

318
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,009
Is that why they
let you bring Marina

319
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,094
and your daughter, June?

320
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,440
Are you a Russian spy?

321
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,024
Why would anyone
discuss spying with me?

322
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,523
I mean, you're the big, bad FBI.
Shouldn't you know?

323
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,233
Ain't you got
bigger fish to fry?

324
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,364
Think of the state that our
country is in at the moment.

325
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,196
You come here to harass me in front
of my home? Look where I live.

326
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,327
Get out.
Come on. Let's go.

327
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,092
Your verdict?
I don't know. He's a jerk.

328
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,261
Insolent, arrogant.

329
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,590
You tell me. Would you
choose this guy as a spy?

330
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,760
I don't see how
he's a security risk.

331
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,222
I say we close it.

332
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,978
This could be your
last case, John.

333
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,568
Lee Oswald. Then I'm done.

334
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,936
Twenty and out.

335
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,986
FBI.

336
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,198
In Russia it's KGB.
Here it's FBI.

337
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,450
What is that?

338
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,206
Where did you get
the money for that?

339
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,830
I told you not to let
her in this house.

340
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,258
How can I say no?

341
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,757
Marina, you just do what I say.
You understand? That's it.

342
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,885
You just do as I say.
I'm the man in this house.

343
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,225
You're not a man.
You're a little boy.

344
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,521
They're afraid of me. They're the
FBI, and they're afraid of me.

345
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,020
Everyone afraid of Alik.

346
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,818
They've been following me
and persecuting me.

347
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,525
It's good. I take Junka,
we go see people.

348
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,904
It's good for baby.

349
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:27,985
Ah!

350
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,164
You don't need to go out there.

351
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,287
Don't open that door.
Don't let them in.

352
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,705
You understand?

353
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,335
I'm the man of this house.

354
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,756
Not gonna be no peace.

355
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,933
You're watching me?

356
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,396
Then I'm watching you, too.

357
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,813
Good morning, Mac.
It's not so good, Mr. President.

358
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,740
Our U-2 spy planes have confirmed
that the Russians have placed

359
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,068
offensive nuclear
missiles in Cuba.

360
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,163
Hello, Jack.
Isn't this a nice surprise?

361
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,419
Just wanted to hear your voice.

362
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,624
Jack, is something the matter?

363
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,596
Jackie, why don't you come
back to the White House.

364
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,717
Yes, of course.

365
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,771
<i>At a Pentagon
briefing here this evening,</i>

366
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,358
<i>we were shown pictures taken
by a high-flying U-2 plane</i>

367
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,980
<i>of two types of missiles,</i>

368
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,188
<i>some of them already
installed in Cuba</i>

369
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,523
<i>and pointed at
the US heartland.</i>

370
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,031
<i>One group of missiles
with a range of 1,200 miles,</i>

371
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,159
<i>the other group
with ranges up to 2,500 miles.</i>

372
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,874
<i>And there was a broad hint,
they do have nuclear warheads.</i>

373
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,796
<i>We have increased the number of planes
in our air defense along the East Coast,</i>

374
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,671
<i>and we have placed all US forces
around the world on an alert status.</i>

375
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,048
I say we launch a full-scale
attack and invasion.

376
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,721
B-52s out of Barksdale.

377
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,890
What, and start
a war with Russia?

378
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,344
You really want to risk
an all-out nuclear war?

379
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,730
In a matter of days, those missiles
will be operational. We have to act.

380
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,432
I will not be pushed.

381
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:25,065
Not by Khrushchev,
not by you or anyone else.

382
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,819
One thing's for certain, I'm not gonna
allow nuclear missiles in our backyard.

383
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,365
I want to see a limited
military option.

384
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,067
I want to hear something
out of State.

385
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,245
You haven't said a word
the whole meeting.

386
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,287
I want options in 40 minutes.

387
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,247
What's happening?

388
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,499
We're in a fix.

389
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,226
I have 40 minutes before
I have to start again.

390
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:02,023
I keep thinking about
Khrushchev in The Kremlin.

391
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,646
He's in the same position I am.

392
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,352
Anti-spasmodic.

393
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,105
He doesn't want to back down.

394
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,026
I don't want to back down.

395
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,990
Hydrocortisone.

396
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,120
I have to find a way
for him to back down.

397
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,209
And testosterone.

398
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,958
And not lose face.

399
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,712
You'll find a way.

400
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,716
You'll find a way.

401
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,224
What if I don't?

402
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,688
<i>Men and women the
world over hang on the news</i>

403
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,482
<i>as it is uncertain
what the future holds.</i>

404
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,982
<i>All of the Western Hemisphere,
from Hudson Bay to Lima, Peru,</i>

405
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,314
<i>are within the range
of the missiles in Cuba.</i>

406
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,905
<i>In these troubled times,
America braces for disaster.</i>

407
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,531
Please don't send
me away to Camp David.

408
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,751
I just want to be with you.

409
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,753
Even if there isn't room
in the bomb shelter,

410
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,251
I just want to be on the lawn
when it happens.

411
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,211
I just want to die with you.

412
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,684
Everybody's gonna like it.
Everybody's Russian.

413
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,438
All your nosy Russian friends.

414
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,602
George tried to get you a job.
He's nice to invite us.

415
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,107
You're the one
they invited, not me.

416
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,739
All right. I'll be good.

417
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,615
There they are!
Marinitchka!

418
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,200
Lee!
George.

419
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,958
Hurry. The President
is about to start his speech.

420
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,999
Quiet, please.

421
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,545
Ready in...

422
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,509
Five, four, three, two...

423
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,431
<i>Good evening, my fellow citizens.</i>

424
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,556
This government, as promised,

425
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,234
has maintained the
closest surveillance

426
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,733
of the Soviet military buildup

427
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,564
on the island of Cuba.

428
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,365
Within the past week,

429
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,490
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

430
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,623
that a series of
offensive missile sites

431
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,080
is now in preparation

432
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,203
on that imprisoned island.

433
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,919
<i>The purpose of these bases
can be none other</i>

434
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,502
<i>than to provide
nuclear strike capabilities</i>

435
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,845
<i>against the Western Hemisphere.</i>

436
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,178
<i>To halt this offensive buildup,</i>

437
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:46,854
<i>a strict quarantine on all
offensive military equipment</i>

438
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,397
<i>under shipment to Cuba
is being initiated.</i>

439
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,895
A quarantine? That's illegal.

440
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,193
<i>All ships of
any kind bound for Cuba,</i>

441
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,896
<i>from whatever nation
or port will,</i>

442
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,575
<i>if found to contain
cargoes of offensive weapons,</i>

443
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,741
<i>be turned back.</i>

444
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,864
The Soviets have every
right to be there,

445
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,790
and Cuba has every right to defend
itself against the United States.

446
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,119
But why would Russia
be so foolish as to provoke?

447
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,421
No, no. Kennedy is the one
who's provoking this.

448
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,666
I think Kennedy is doing a good job.
On civil rights, yes.

449
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,376
But he is wrong on Cuba.

450
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,929
Your Cubans are just as greedy and
hypocritical as your Russians.

451
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,674
You fled one failed
cause for another.

452
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,762
Cuba is the last great hope for
Marxism, unless Kennedy destroys it.

453
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,138
Well, I grant you this much.

454
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,771
Your hero Fidel is the underdog,
and I like underdogs.

455
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,226
This is why I like you, Lee.

456
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,191
Kennedy needs to
keep out of Cuba.

457
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,449
Or what? What will you
and your underdogs do to him?

458
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,162
Lee!
I'm playing with you, huh?

459
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,493
I am serious!

460
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,168
Something has to be
done to protect Cuba.

461
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,293
<i>Cuba has to be the
point of the crisis.</i>

462
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,425
<i>There might be shooting
among the ships at sea.</i>

463
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:07,013
<i>If invasion is undertaken, the Russians
have said that they would retaliate.</i>

464
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,349
<i>We have said if there's rocket
fire from Cuba, we will retaliate.</i>

465
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,228
<i>The shooting war could
start tomorrow over Cuba.</i>

466
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,564
How could Khrushchev do that?

467
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,397
Last night, he sent you a cable
saying he'd pull those missiles out.

468
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,357
And now this
public announcement

469
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,409
demanding we pull
our missiles out of Turkey.

470
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,784
He's already given in.
Now he wants to make deals?

471
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,959
What if you just ignore this?

472
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,463
He's under pressure.

473
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,637
The Kremlin won't let him back down.

474
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,342
And I'll be goddamned if I'm
gonna engage in a quid pro quo.

475
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,559
You. Just you.

476
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,520
You go to the Soviet
Ambassador and you tell him

477
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,149
that I have accepted
Khrushchev's original offer.

478
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,816
It just might work, Jack.

479
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,363
I hope to God it does.

480
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,627
<i>Just yesterday,
we were on the brink of</i>

481
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,876
<i>nuclear war with the
Soviet Union.</i>

482
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,753
<i>Today, we can
all breathe easier.</i>

483
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,382
<i>Nikita Khrushchev today did
precisely what President Kennedy</i>

484
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:28,182
<i>has been asking him to do
ever since this crisis began.</i>

485
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,769
<i>He ordered the dismantling of
Soviet missile bases in Cuba</i>

486
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,064
<i>and the return of the rockets
to the Soviet Union.</i>

487
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,407
Maybe tonight's the night
I should go to the theater.

488
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,401
Marina!

489
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,158
Marina!

490
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,904
I want you to take my picture.

491
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,330
Where do you find <i>pistoleti?</i>

492
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,749
I got it in the mail.
Here. Come here.

493
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,910
Come here. Take it.
Come, come, come.

494
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,586
Take my picture.

495
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,794
I want you to take this for Junie
to remember her papa by sometime.

496
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,336
All right. Then send
it to the papers.

497
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,513
To show them I'm ready
for anything. Take it.

498
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,392
Wind that little thing, and you're gonna
push that little lever down. Okay?

499
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,640
This?
Yeah.

500
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,099
Hold on.

501
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,911
George, you've heard of this
General Edwin Walker?

502
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,037
Of course.

503
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,370
He's the crazy racist John Bircher who
caused all that trouble at Ole Miss.

504
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,081
And now he wants the United
States to invade Cuba.

505
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,383
He's going all over the
country attacking communism.

506
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,630
And Castro.

507
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,296
You know, Walker lives
right here in Dallas.

508
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,557
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.

509
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,305
Really?

510
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,598
What if someone killed Hitler
before he came to power?

511
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,311
I ask you, how many lives
could have been saved?

512
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,655
Anybody who bumps that bastard off
will be doing the world a favor.

513
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,903
Who's hungry?

514
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:37,488
<i>I would betray the confidence
reposed in me by the American people</i>

515
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,119
<i>if I had not warned you
of the menace of communism</i>

516
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,498
<i>and the peril facing
this nation today.</i>

517
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,839
<i>Mr. Oswald, why did
you shoot General Walker?</i>

518
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,344
<i>General Walker wanted to invade
Cuba and overthrow Castro.</i>

519
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,597
<i>He was a racist who was a
threat to civil rights.</i>

520
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,561
<i>Mr. Oswald, what do you say to those
who will call you a murderer?</i>

521
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,145
<i>In time, they will see that I stopped
a dangerous man on his rise to power.</i>

522
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,026
<i>They will see me as a hero,
as a hunter of fascists.</i>

523
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,949
<i>And long after I'm gone,
they will remember this day</i>

524
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,530
<i>as the day that changed
the world forever.</i>

525
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,208
<i>Thank you, Mr. Oswald.
You are a true...</i>

526
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,206
Alik?
This is my office.

527
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,249
I know it's late. You can't come
in here. Leave me alone.

528
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,967
Who's got you, June bug?

529
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,519
June bug! Cutie, cutie!
Cutie, cutie! Who's got you?

530
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,894
That's right. Come here.
Papa's got you.

531
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,480
There you are.

532
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,530
Papa's gonna be president someday.
President?

533
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,572
Well, I could be
in 20 years or so.

534
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,704
How you be famous, huh?

535
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,874
How you be president
if you don't do anything?

536
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,292
How do you think
Kennedy became president?

537
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,578
His daddy bought it for him.

538
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,663
'Cause money buys everything here.
You know that.

539
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,425
Very handsome.
Hey!

540
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,807
You know you're not supposed
to say that about other men.

541
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,765
Well, if not me, then your
brother will be president.

542
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,617
<i>I left you as much
money as I could.</i>

543
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,694
<i>$60 on the second of the month.</i>

544
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:46,458
<i>You and the baby can live for another
two months using $10 a week.</i>

545
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,542
<i>If I'm alive and
taken prisoner,</i>

546
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,871
<i>the city jail is located
at the end of the bridge,</i>

547
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,673
<i>through which we always passed
on going to the city.</i>

548
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,375
<i>This is the key to the mailbox</i>

549
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,053
<i>which is located in the main post
office in the city on Ervay Street.</i>

550
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,130
<i>You will find the mailbox
in the post office</i>

551
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,309
<i>which is located four blocks from
the drugstore on that street.</i>

552
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:07,137
<i>I paid for the box last month,
so don't worry about it.</i>

553
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,606
<i>Send the information as to what
has happened to me to the embassy</i>

554
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,104
<i>and include
newspaper clippings,</i>

555
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,982
<i>should there be anything
about me in the newspapers.</i>

556
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,781
<i>I believe that the embassy
will come quickly</i>

557
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,817
<i>to your assistance
on learning everything.</i>

558
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,449
<i>I paid the house rent on the
2-D, so don't worry about it.</i>

559
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,452
<i>Recently I also paid
the water and gas.</i>

560
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,080
<i>The money from work
will possibly be coming.</i>

561
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,832
<i>Certain of my documents
are in the small blue valise.</i>

562
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,833
<i>The address book can be found on the table
in the study, should you need the same.</i>

563
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,419
<i>The Red Cross will also help you.
Red Cross in English.</i>

564
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,095
<i>You can either throw out or give
my clothing, etcetera, away.</i>

565
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,768
<i>However, I prefer that you
hold on to my personal papers.</i>

566
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,119
I did it.

567
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,380
I shot General Edwin Walker.

568
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,051
I just killed a very dangerous man.

569
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,386
Police here?

570
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,438
Why?
Why you shoot a man?

571
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,401
To show that I'm ready.

572
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,070
To show everyone.

573
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,742
And now, people will
think I'm a hero.

574
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,833
<i>And now
we bring you a special report.</i>

575
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,011
<i>We have just learned that there
has been an assassination attempt</i>

576
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,930
<i>on the life of General Edwin A.
Walker of Dallas.</i>

577
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,885
<i>Walker was sitting at a desk in his home
when a bullet came through his window.</i>

578
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,845
<i>The bullet narrowly
missed Walker.</i>

579
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,680
<i>According to federal
authorities,</i>

580
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,233
<i>a neighbor witnessed two men in
an alley behind Walker's house</i>

581
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,185
<i>get into their cars
and drive away.</i>

582
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,066
Walker...
You're kidding me.

583
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,277
You're kidding me! Two men?

584
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,116
Two men.

585
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,281
The FBI is stupid!

586
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,036
God damn it.

587
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,922
Alik?
I had him.

588
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,928
He must have moved his head at the last
minute. My aim was perfect. I know it.

589
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,505
God damn it.

590
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,362
Damn it, damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it, damn it.

591
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,733
I was happy to see that in the
end it worked out for you down there.

592
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:12,785
What happened?

593
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,664
Well, the party's been going to
hell over the last six years.

594
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:21,081
I don't mean to throw any stones at
the man, but Daniel. Price Daniel.

595
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,962
Well, we have no leadership.

596
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,752
But we've made inroads
with that since the election.

597
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,007
No, you've done all right.

598
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,757
Except that they've got a lot of
organization on that side of the party.

599
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,308
This is true.

600
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,385
Well, the way
I see it, it looks like

601
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,809
it could very well
come down to Texas again,

602
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,604
and we're gonna need the money and
the votes and we do something for it.

603
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,276
What's the plan?

604
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,445
Well, I defer to the governor.

605
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:50,198
Maybe I can host a
dinner in Austin.

606
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,244
The three of us on a tour.

607
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,331
We do Austin,
San Antonio and Dallas.

608
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,785
No, not Dallas. You lost the hell
out of Dallas by 60,000 votes.

609
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,122
I lost by 20,000.
They just murdered all of us.

610
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,624
That's why we're
gonna change that.

611
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:05,841
What looks good, Kenny?

612
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,464
Dallas isn't safe.

613
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:12,098
Housewives came out of their houses to
spit on me during the '60 campaign.

614
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,185
November. Say a week
before Thanksgiving.

615
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,387
All right.
Let's book it.

616
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,489
Marina.

617
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,573
Marina, goddamn it,
where are my guns?

618
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,243
Nixon's in town.
I want to have a look.

619
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,076
Why need gun for look?

620
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,751
Promise me you'll
never shoot no more people.

621
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,337
Okay, I promise.

622
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,966
Promise me you'll get job.

623
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,566
Every time I get a job, the damn
FBI tells them I'm a communist.

624
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,968
No! It's not good here.

625
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,849
Why? Why you bring us here?
Dallas no good.

626
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,100
Well, maybe I'll go
to New Orleans.

627
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,027
Maybe they won't follow me there.
I'll get a job down there.

628
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,109
Okay.

629
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,578
Is better.

630
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,998
Alik.

631
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,286
I promise.

632
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,414
I promise, Mama.

633
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,931
Yes.

634
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,479
Thank you.

635
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,321
Fair play for Cuba? Tell the President
to keep his hands off Cuba.

636
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:01,124
Fair play for Cuba.

637
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,624
Fair play for Cuba?

638
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,872
I ask you, what do you
know about Cuba?

639
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,419
I'm recruiting for the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

640
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,168
I'm from Cuba.
I know Cuba.

641
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,834
Our homeland was taken from us
by a communist dictator.

642
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,756
The Cuban people want
Castro as their leader.

643
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,258
No, he's a killer. He sent
our children to execution.

644
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,806
Give me those!

645
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,724
This man is a communist!
I have rights!

646
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,051
He's an agent of Castro!

647
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,268
Go back to Cuba!

648
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,562
You FBI?

649
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,982
I asked specifically
to speak to an FBI agent.

650
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,191
Yes.

651
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm Agent John Quigley.

652
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,903
This is supposed
to be a free country.

653
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,954
I was arrested for exercising
my right to free speech

654
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,703
and I've been here
all night long.

655
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,955
I understand that you
and the other three men

656
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,627
were charged with
disturbing the peace.

657
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,204
I did not disturb the peace.

658
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,964
I was attacked for my beliefs.

659
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,167
You're pro-Cuba?
Pro-Castro?

660
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,594
I belong to
Fair Play for Cuba, yes.

661
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,635
And who is AJ Hidell?

662
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,638
Hidell. He issued that
membership card to me.

663
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,388
Mr. Hidell is the president
of the committee.

664
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,183
Hidell is name you make up.

665
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,069
You tell FBI Hidell
rhyme with Fidel?

666
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,023
Tell FBI you want
name our baby Fidel?

667
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,444
All you do all day,
pass out Cuba paper.

668
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,909
Still no job.
Only Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.

669
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,329
You know, Cuba
not care about you.

670
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,409
Marina!

671
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:34,174
Look at you. Great man,
genius, and no one knows it.

672
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,296
You're going back to Texas.

673
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,303
You call that friend of yours, the
one you gave the Russian lessons to.

674
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,554
Tell her to come
get you and Junie.

675
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,510
Ruth? You no like Ruth.

676
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,313
She'll take care of you
till the baby comes.

677
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,206
Marina, as soon as
you get back to Dallas...

678
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,496
When you get back to...

679
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,663
<i>I need to go
to Cuba immediately.</i>

680
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:38,731
I have to.

681
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,863
I am sorry, but as I explained,
you will need a Soviet visa.

682
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,203
You're not listening to me.

683
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,409
I need you to make
an exception.

684
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,992
I've proven my support
of President Castro.

685
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,919
Mr. Oswald, I am telling you,
it will take four months.

686
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:57,296
No, I don't have enough money to
stay in Mexico for four months.

687
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,343
Then go back to the United
States, and you wait.

688
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,509
I'm being harassed in the United States.
I am sorry, Mr. Oswald.

689
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,761
I'm being persecuted
and followed by the FBI

690
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,842
because of my support
of President Castro,

691
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,429
your leader who they have
sought to overthrow.

692
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,932
Don't you care about your own country?
Go home, Mr. Oswald.

693
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,483
I don't have a home.

694
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,064
That's not my home.

695
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,589
<i>The dramatic miracle
of birth and a fight for life</i>

696
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,922
<i>takes place at the Otis Air
Force Base Hospital on Cape Cod</i>

697
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,008
<i>as Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy
bears a premature son.</i>

698
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,803
<i>The baby, the first to be born to
a White House family in 68 years,</i>

699
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,641
<i>was the object of worldwide attention
during his dramatic fight for life.</i>

700
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:27,924
You all right?

701
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,435
Yes, of course.

702
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,348
I'm all set. My car will
take me to the airport.

703
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,037
Oh, Jackie.

704
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,752
I was so stupid.

705
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,715
Jack.

706
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,636
I already lost two.

707
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,009
I wasn't ready to
lose another one.

708
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,219
It's not your fault.

709
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,315
God called him back,

710
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,060
our baby Patrick.

711
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,826
We had him for two days.

712
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,658
He was a beautiful baby.

713
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,747
And he fought so hard.

714
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,005
Like a Kennedy.

715
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:55,011
Well, you'll go away
for two weeks,

716
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,687
get out on the water,
enjoy the Greek Islands.

717
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,518
I want you to rest.

718
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,940
And... Look at me.

719
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,278
I want you to be very careful
around that Onassis character.

720
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,033
And then I want you
to come back to me.

721
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,540
Of course I will.

722
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,875
The one thing
I could never bear

723
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,967
would be to lose you.

724
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,476
You say you just found
a job here in Dallas?

725
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,100
Yes, ma'am, that's right.
Are you married?

726
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,479
No.

727
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,732
I mean, yes, I was, ma'am.

728
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,072
Well, this will be your room, Mr...

729
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,692
Mr. Lee you said?

730
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,320
That's right. Lee.
OH Lee.

731
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,364
Well, make yourself comfortable.

732
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,786
<i>I contacted the CIA.
Said he visited the Cuban Embassy</i>

733
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,462
<i>and maybe the
Soviet Embassy as well.</i>

734
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,005
What is he, some kind of spy?

735
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,502
<i>They don't know what he is.</i>

736
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,005
<i>They think he may have gone back
to Dallas. They're not sure.</i>

737
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,054
All right, well, I'll try
to find this Oswald fellow.

738
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,812
Ruth Paine?

739
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,523
Yes. Can I help you?

740
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:35,199
Hi. I'm Special Agent James Hosty,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

741
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,913
I'm looking for Lee Oswald.

742
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,041
Do you mind if I come in?

743
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,868
Yes, please come in.

744
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,586
Thank you.

745
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:51,301
Their friend George introduced us,
and Marina and I became friends.

746
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,134
So when she and Lee
had their problems,

747
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,974
I went down to New Orleans and brought
her back here to have her baby.

748
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:59,302
And Mr. Oswald is still
in New Orleans?

749
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,638
No. He lost his job there,
so he came back.

750
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,314
He's living here?
No, I won't allow that.

751
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,773
And Marina won't either.

752
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,977
He keeps some of his things
out in my garage,

753
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,937
and he comes weekends
to see his girls.

754
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,647
But Marina doesn't
want him here.

755
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:12,989
Do you know where he is?

756
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,659
I should think he's at work.
Where does he work?

757
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,362
At the Texas School
Book Depository.

758
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:21,491
Marina, this is FBI Agent Hosty.

759
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,041
FBI?

760
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,706
No, he's not here to harm you.

761
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,254
No. No, our job is
to protect people.

762
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,637
You find Oswald?

763
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:47,692
Sort of. I know where he's working,
but I don't know where he's living.

764
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,519
He'll show up sooner or later.

765
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,139
I missed you, kid.

766
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,392
I missed you, too.

767
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,733
Maybe you'll come
on the road with me?

768
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,900
Come to Texas,
help me with the campaign?

769
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,733
Of course I will, Jack.

770
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:41,283
I'll campaign with you
anywhere you want.

771
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,580
Good. We'll be back on the 25th, in
time for John Junior's birthday.

772
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,979
Excuse me.

773
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,603
Mister?

774
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,771
Is that a 6.5 Italian carbie?
Yeah.

775
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,943
And is that
a four-power scope?

776
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,775
Yes, it is.

777
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,114
You'll get that good. Just a
little more practice is all.

778
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,616
Now, what did I tell you
about the chamber?

779
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,779
You always got to empty it
when you lay the gun down.

780
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,294
Alik?
What?

781
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,052
Junka wants to know why her papa
hasn't played with her today.

782
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,221
All right, okay. I'll be
there in just a minute.

783
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,217
We wouldn't have this problem
if Ruth would let me live here.

784
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,847
Just mind your
business, Marina.

785
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,150
Go.

786
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,671
What do you say, Jack?
Hey, Harry, how are you?

787
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,514
Mike.

788
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,266
I volunteered to
work the parade

789
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,142
so I can get a good look
at President Kennedy.

790
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,516
Who wants to see that traitor?
He should be shot.

791
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,683
Hey, I like Kennedy. How can
you say something like that?

792
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,685
I mean, in my own place,
about our beloved president.

793
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,029
And the both of them, the
President and Mrs. Kennedy.

794
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,606
I love them.
I love them both.

795
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,903
Hey. Hey, TORY!

796
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,450
What the hell's wrong
with you, huh?

797
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,119
Can't you see my friends
need some drinks here?

798
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,196
What are you, blind?
I'm sorry, Mr. Ruby.

799
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,204
Don't apologize. Just take
care of my pals here, okay?

800
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,876
Come on, let's go.
Chop chop.

801
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,339
Air Force One arrives
at Love Field at 11:40 a.m.

802
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,877
The President and First Lady will
be met by Johnson and Lady Bird,

803
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,632
Governor Connally and his wife.

804
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,385
We allow a few minutes
for the receiving line.

805
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,512
So around noon, the motorcade
leaves the airport.

806
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,889
We stay about 30 miles
an hour out by the airport.

807
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,471
So, it's downtown
around 20 minutes later.

808
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,728
Now, the parade will travel
down Main Street here.

809
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,859
We slow to 15 miles an hour

810
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,983
so the crowds can get
a good look at Lancer.

811
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:23,282
These tail buildings on either
side, this is like a canyon.

812
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,015
There's more than 20,000 windows
along this parade route.

813
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,573
We'll be sitting ducks.

814
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,873
We have to assume the President's car
will be open, unless it's raining.

815
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,201
Here at Dealey Plaza,
we make a right on Houston.

816
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,251
Can't we avoid this?

817
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,375
There's a 120-degree
turn onto Elm.

818
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,255
It's gonna slow the
motorcade down to a crawl.

819
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,838
No. The only way under the
Stemmons Freeway is from Elm.

820
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,759
This town makes me nervous.

821
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,178
You know Dallas is the murder
capital of the country.

822
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,009
We did a thorough check of
active threats to the President.

823
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,016
There are none in Texas.

824
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,972
We checked with the FBI.
Nothing came up.

825
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,274
Yeah. Let's pray for rain.

826
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,311
<i>The city
of Dallas is busy preparing</i>

827
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,037
<i>for the President
and First Lady's visit.</i>

828
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,448
<i>We don't have
all the details yet,</i>

829
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,651
<i>but we do know that the
President and First Lady</i>

830
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,295
<i>will drive through downtown on the
way to the Dallas Trade Mart,</i>

831
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,201
<i>where the President
will give a speech.</i>

832
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,498
<i>We'll keep you updated
as we learn more.</i>

833
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:02,081
Frazier, can I get a ride
home with you after work?

834
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:04,258
Yeah, of course,
like I told you.

835
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,835
You can get a ride
any time you want.

836
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:12,262
Hey, Lee, you don't see your girls
till Friday. It's Thursday.

837
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,809
I just gotta pick up
some curtain rods.

838
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,688
Hi.

839
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,153
Alik.

840
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,732
I'm lonesome for my girls.

841
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,697
You only come weekends,
not now.

842
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,915
Mama, please don't be that way.

843
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,709
Please, Mama. I miss you.
I miss our girls. I'm lonely.

844
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,255
You're always lonely, Alik.
We can start over, you know?

845
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,159
We can. I promise you, I'll
be so different this time.

846
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,960
You never different.

847
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,554
Please. I can be.
For you, I can be.

848
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,390
I'll buy you that washing
machine that you always wanted.

849
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:57,969
<i>Nyet.</i>

850
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,570
Mama, I'm begging you.

851
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,945
If you say no to me again,
I'm gonna...

852
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,287
This is the last time
that I will ever ask you.

853
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,997
Please.

854
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:30,048
If Ruth says yes,
you can stay tonight.

855
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,423
But I won't return to you.

856
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,380
It's raining, Mr. President.

857
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,925
It's too bad.
Thank you, George.

858
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:59,174
Have you seen this?

859
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:03,186
Yeah. We're headed
into nut country today.

860
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,775
Ah! My favorite.

861
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,322
I know.

862
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,031
Those rich Texas society women,
they're gonna eat you up.

863
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,780
If it's so important
I look good,

864
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:24,241
why do I have to be blown
around in a motorcade

865
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,247
with you and Governor
Connally first?

866
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,125
I am so glad that you are here.

867
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,377
It's so much better
when you're here.

868
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,009
'Cause the one thing
I couldn't bear

869
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,962
would be to lose you.

870
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,619
Morning, Lee.

871
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,497
What's in the package?

872
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,621
Curtain rods.

873
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,373
I wish it would just rain
or quit altogether.

874
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,672
If it's raining in Dallas, we'll
want a bubble top on the limo.

875
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,381
They say it's going
to clear up.

876
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,430
Okay. If it does, no bubble.

877
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,136
Well, be sure to get that in.

878
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,937
Good morning, Lyndon.
Mr. President.

879
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,982
<i>The Presidential
party will leave</i>

880
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,651
<i>Fort Worth on a quick
flight to Dallas,</i>

881
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,027
<i>where the motorcade will travel through
downtown on their way to the Trade Mart.</i>

882
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,909
Good morning!

883
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,701
<i>This crowd started gathering
out here quite early this morning</i>

884
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,753
<i>to ensure a good vantage point.</i>

885
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,047
<i>Air Force Number One,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

886
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,295
<i>carrying the President
of the United States.</i>

887
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,004
You gonna watch the parade?

888
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,181
Yeah. I want to
see the President.

889
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,684
<i>There's Mrs. Kennedy,
and the crowd yells.</i>

890
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,017
<i>And the President
of the United States.</i>

891
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:19,318
<i>The President, now
partially obscured behind his wife...</i>

892
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,276
Yes, she is.
She's beautiful.

893
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,863
Mrs. Kennedy coming along
behind him, grinning ah the while.

894
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,719
Boy, ain't you coming downstairs?
It's lunchtime.

895
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:49,928
No, sir.

896
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,195
The President now
in with the First Lady,

897
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,656
<i>and the motorcade
begins to move out.</i>

898
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,164
It cleared up.

899
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,084
Should be here pretty soon now.

900
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,401
<i>Here comes the first
car with Police Chief Jess Curry</i>

901
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,349
<i>and Sheriff Bill Decker.</i>

902
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,476
<i>And here is the President
of the United States.</i>

903
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:36,183
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

904
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,313
Here they come!

905
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,144
<i>We can...
And there's Jackie.</i>

906
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:41,070
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

907
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,615
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

908
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,489
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

909
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,787
<i>as the President and
the First Lady pass by.</i>

910
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:54,084
<i>There are people absolutely looking from
every window here in downtown Dallas.</i>

911
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,378
<i>It was a wonderful welcome
as the President</i>

912
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,626
<i>and Jacqueline Kennedy
passed our point.</i>

913
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,507
Here they come!

914
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,638
The President of the United States.

915
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:14,347
<i>And what a crowd and what a
tremendous welcome he's getting now.</i>

916
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,397
<i>We can... And there's Jackie.</i>

917
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,316
<i>She's getting just
as big a welcome.</i>

918
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,860
<i>And the crowd is
absolutely going wild.</i>

919
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,734
<i>This is a friendly crowd
in downtown Dallas</i>

920
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,736
<i>as the President and the
First Lady pass by.</i>

921
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,468
The shots came from the roof.
Clear the way!

922
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,447
Hold it!
Hold it right there!

923
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,491
You know this man?
Yeah, he works here.

924
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,499
I saw him right up there,
one window from the top.

925
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,917
- He had a rifle in the window.
- Slow down. Can you describe him?

926
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,671
White. 5'10", I guess.
160, 170 pounds.

927
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,548
How old?
Thirty, I'd say.

928
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,547
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

929
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,179
You'll excuse the fact
that I'm out of breath,

930
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,931
but about 10 or 15 minutes ago,

931
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,353
a tragic thing, from all
indications at this point,

932
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,850
has happened in
the city of Dallas.

933
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,274
Mrs. Kennedy.

934
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:49,028
Mrs. Kennedy, please let
us help the President.

935
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,699
You know he's dead.
Leave me alone.

936
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,578
Mrs. Kennedy.

937
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,327
Here.

938
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:16,560
<i>I heard three loud
shots, seemingly from right over my head.</i>

939
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,928
<i>Reports are in.</i>

940
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,475
<i>We now have heard
from two witnesses</i>

941
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:25,402
<i>who saw a man in the window of the
building above the route holding a gun.</i>

942
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,449
Yeah, this is Bobby.

943
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,490
<i>Bobby, this is Director Hoover.</i>

944
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,406
<i>The President has been shot.</i>

945
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,230
<i>Here is a bulletin from CBS News.</i>

946
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,932
<i>In Dallas, Texas,</i>

947
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:50,646
<i>three shots were fired at President
Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.</i>

948
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:54,904
<i>The first reports say that President
Kennedy has been seriously wounded</i>

949
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,404
<i>by this shooting.</i>

950
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,579
<i>Repeating, President Kennedy
has been shot</i>

951
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,407
<i>by a would-be assassin
in Dallas, Texas.</i>

952
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,757
Governor Connally has been
taken upstairs for surgery.

953
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,585
Well, how's the President?

954
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,511
It looks bad.

955
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,473
He's still...

956
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,602
Somehow he's still breathing.

957
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,064
The doctors are with him.

958
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:30,019
I'm in your hands, Kenny.
What should I do?

959
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,197
I...

960
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,160
I'll let you know as soon as
I hear about the President.

961
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,155
Taxi!

962
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,544
500 North Beckley.

963
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,544
What the hell?

964
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,219
I wonder what all the uproar is.

965
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:15,442
I want to be with my husband.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Kennedy.

966
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,148
I want to be with my husband.
You can't.

967
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:19,450
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

968
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,074
I'm going to get into that room.
No...

969
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,668
<i>The suspect in the
shooting at Elm and Houston</i>

970

975
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,521
<i>of the condition of the President.</i>

976
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,831
You sure are in a hurry.

977
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,847
Eternal rest grant unto him

978
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:27,393
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

979
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,146
May he rest in peace.
Amen.

980
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,492
Captain Fritz,
I've taken a head count.

981
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,864
We have one employee missing.

982
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,200
<i>His name is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

983
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,134
They want to
perform an autopsy.

984
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,478
I'm not leaving without him, Kenny.
We have to take him home.

985
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,932
I know.
They can't have him.

986
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,234
I'm taking my husband
home with me.

987
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:22,194
Okay, we'll call a mortuary.
We'll get a casket.

988
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,026
We can get someone to bring you a
change of clothes from the plane.

989
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,203
No. No.

990
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,500
I want them to see
what they've done to Jack.

991
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,418
He's gone.
Dear God.

992
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,592
We need to get you out of here.

993
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,093
What about Mrs. Kennedy?

994
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,800
She won't leave the President.

995
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,806
I won't leave without
Mrs. Kennedy.

996
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:53,263
I'll take her back
with me on the plane.

997
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,271
Mr. President,

998
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,733
can we release the
news to the press?

999
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:08,073
No, Id better get back to the plane
before you announce it.

1000
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,328
<i>From Dallas, Texas,

Look, I'm just walking.

1012

Sir, right now! I need
you to step to the car.

Thank you, sir.
Where you headed?

1014
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,769
I'm just walking through
the neighborhood. That's all.

1015
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:58,937

1016
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,190
<i>Alik Adell.</i>

1017

Can I see your hands, please?

1018
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,315
All right, sir. I'm gonna need you
to step to the front of the car.

1019
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,485
Right here. Sir, I need
to see your hands.

1020
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,366
I need to see your
hands, sir, right now.

1021
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:15,788
Sir, I need...

1022
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,399
- Hello. Police operator?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

1023
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,149
<i>There's been a shooting. There's
been a shooting. An officer's been shot.</i>

1024
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:48,855
What's your location?
Where's the officer?

1025
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:51,111
<i>10th Street between
Marsalis and Beckley.</i>

1026
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,988
<i>It's a police officer.
Somebody shot him.</i>

1027
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,749
Excuse me, sir. Sir!

1028
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,725
<i>Hosty. Jim, they think the
shooter is Lee Oswald.</i>

1029
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:21,472
<i>Did you hear that?
Hey, hey! Quiet down, will you?</i>

1030
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,769
No, I didn't hear that. What's the name?
Lee Oswald.

1031
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,912
This is it. It's all over now.

1032
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,833
He's got a gun!

1033
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,291
Hold him down. Hold him
down. Secure him!

1034
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:51,629
I'm not resisting.

1035
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,718
Got him?

1036
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,046
I am not resisting arrest.

1037
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:57,223
All right, everyone.
Listen up. Listen up.

1038
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,050
I need somebody to
get a search warrant,

1039
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,852
go out to this address and
pick up a man named Oswald.

1040
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,474
Lee Oswald?

1041
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,814
That's the bastard
that shot Officer Tippit.

1042
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,517
What?
Captain, I'll save you the trip.

1043
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,819
We've got him right next door.

1044
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:18,903
There he sits.

1045
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,752
They're saying
I shot a police officer.

1046
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,579
What's your name?
I didn't shoot anyone.

1047
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,914
Where do you work?
All I did was

1048
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,089
bring a gun into a theater.
That's all.

1049
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:33,839
I asked you where you work.
And this...

1050
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:36,341
This is what your police force did to me.

1051
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,263
Sir?

1052
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,771
This is Special Agent
James Hosty of the FBI.

1053
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,564
I know who you are.

1054
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,982
You're the man that's
been accosting my wife.

1055
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,567
You leave her alone, you son of a bitch.
Hey, hey. Hold on.

1056
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,240
I asked her some
questions is all.

1057
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,363
You have any questions,
you can ask me.

1058
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,495
Understand?
Leave her alone. Ask me.

1059
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,082
Matter of fact, I have a
lot of questions for you.

1060
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:10,375
Let's begin with Mexico City.

1061
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:15,214
I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm done talking to him.

1062
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,214
FBI's the reason I've lost
every job I've ever had.

1063
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,887
Goddamn FBI was following me.

1064
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,101
Hey, hey.
That's enough, boy.

1065
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,933
Your boss says you left the
building without permission.

1066
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,153
There was just so
much excitement

1067
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:39,279
that I didn't think there was gonna
be any more work today, so I left.

1068
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,447
I went to the movies.

1069
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,743
Miss Paine, we're with the Dallas
County Sheriff's Department.

1070
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,749
Mind if we have a look around?

1071
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,521
Last time you saw your
husband was yesterday?

1072
01:19:54,547 --> 01:19:55,115
Da.

1073
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,084
What time was that?

1074
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:01,389
He came in the evening,
and he stayed last night.

1075
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,680
Can... Does he have
to touch that?

1076
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,956
The kids are sleeping in there.

1077
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,513
Did you see him this morning?
<i>Nyet.</i>

1078
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,014
Does she speak English?
What?

1079
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:08,895
Does your husband own a rifle?
No, he doesn't.

1080
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,182
Excuse me. That is
personal property. Okay?

1081
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,437
Can you please put the...

1082
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,065
<i>Da.</i> Yes.

1083
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,111
In the garage?
The garage!

1084
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,954
Here?

1085
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,345
Hey, Jack, I was just headed
over to the Carousel.

1086
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,515
It's closed. Closed for the
whole weekend in honor of...

1087
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,843
I keep thinking about
Mrs. Kennedy.

1088
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,973
The poor woman's going to have
to come back here for a trial.

1089
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,226
She's gonna have
to go through all...

1090
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,773
You okay, Jack?

1091
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,601
Yeah. No... Yeah, yeah.

1092
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,361
Get a look at that creep yet?

1093
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,782
No, but I think they're bringing
him out for the press pretty soon.

1094
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,359
Thanks, Harry.

1095
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,664
That's him! Did you kill
the President, Mr. Oswald?

1096
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,582
I'd like some
legal representation.

1097
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:17,790
These police officers have
not allowed me to have any.

1098
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,218
I... I don't know
what this is all about.

1099
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,259
Did you kill the President? No, sir,
and people keep asking me that.

1100
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,682
Did you shoot the President?
I work in that building.

1101
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,259
Were you in the
building at that time?

1102
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,265
Naturally, if I work
in the building, yes, sir.

1103
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:31,766
Did you shoot the President?

1104
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,974
No, they're taking me in because of
the fact I lived in the Soviet Union.

1105
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,151
Sir!
I'm just a patsy.

1106
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,503
No, no, they treatin' me fine.

1107
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,928
Alik...

1108
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,308
Why? Why would you do this?
This is a mistake.

1109
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:17,016
This is all a mistake.
I'll have a trial.

1110
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,526
I'm gonna show 'em all.

1111
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,658
You mustn't worry
about me, Mama.

1112
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:28,236
Come on. Get up.
I'm gonna be fine.

1113
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,573
You kiss Junie and
Rachel for me? Hmm?

1114
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:47,509
Oswald is being transported
this morning to the county jail.

1115
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,215
Here he comes now.

1116
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:53,644
Captain Fritz, is this the man you
believe killed President Kennedy?

1117
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,938
I think we have the right man.

1118
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,191
Okay, you wait
right here, Sheba.

1119
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,978
Here we go!

1120
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,569
There he is! There he is!

1121
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:24,352
<i>The man who shot Lee Oswald has been
identified as Jack Ruby. R-U-B-Y.</i>

1122
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,820
<i>He runs a place in Dallas
called the Carousel Club,</i>

1123
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,148
<i>which is a kind of
a strip joint and nightclub.</i>

1124
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,858
<i>Here comes Oswald.</i>

1125
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:34,787
<i>He is ashen and
unconscious at this time.</i>

1126
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:36,738
<i>Now being moved in.
He's not moving.</i>

1127
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:41,164
<i>The accused assassin of the President
and slayer of Officer Tippit,</i>

1128
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:46,090
<i>24-year old Lee Harvey Oswald,
also went to his grave today</i>

1129
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,543
<i>in a secret, almost unattended
funeral at Fort Worth.</i>

1130
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:53,847
<i>The shooting,
which forever sealed his lips</i>

1131
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:57,847
<i>and may have prevented police
from ever getting the full story</i>

1132
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:03,023
<i>of what was behind the assassination
of the President of the United States.</i>

1133
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,188
We don't have any pallbearers.

1134
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,736
Come on, boys.

1135
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,615
So now he is a legend,

1136
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,877
when he would've
preferred to be a man.

1137
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:11,333
<i>Jack used to love to listen to the album
from the Broadway musical Camelot.</i>

1138
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:16,430
<i>King Arthur and Lady Guinevere.</i>

1139
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:20,305
He'd listen to it at night
before falling asleep.

1140
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,308
He loved the final line.

1141
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,234
<i>"Don't let it be forgot</i>

1142
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,813
<i>"that once there was a spot,</i>

1143
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,776
"for one brief shining moment,

1144
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,156
"that was known as Camelot."
