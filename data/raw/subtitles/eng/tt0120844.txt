1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,600
There he is! Let's get him.

2
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
<i>Area 7 to Command. We could</i>
<i>use another survey team out here. </i>

3
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,100
Ensigns McCauley and Gilles,
assist edaphology team in area 7.

4
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,100
<i>Acknowledged. </i>

5
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,900
Admiral Dougherty is waiting
for this. Transmit it to the ship.

6
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,200
<i>Alert! </i>
<i>Area 12! </i>

7
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,300
<i>- The android is out of control. </i>
- Report.

8
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,300
<i>He's headed toward the village. </i>
<i>We're trying to stop him. </i>

9
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,000
Over there!

10
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
Magnify.

11
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,900
Hold your fire.

12
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,500
What is it?

13
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,200
Base to Commander Data.

14
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,000
<i>Re-routing microhydraulic</i>
<i>power distribution. </i>

15
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,900
<i>- Regulating thermal overload. </i>
- Data, report immediately!

16
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,900
<i>Transferring matrix functions. </i>
<i>Engaging secondary protocol. </i>

17
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,900
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

18
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,200
All field units,
intercept the android.

19
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Artim, it's all right.

20
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Get inside, now.

21
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,500
Everyone get inside now.
Back to your homes.

22
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,500
Secondary protocol is active.

23
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,100
- They can see him.
- Stop him, now!

24
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! Stand down!

25
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Who are they?

26
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,700
It's an M-class planet.
Population 300 million.

27
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,600
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-chin chef-faw.

28
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,400
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

29
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,300
- My collar size hasn't changed.
- Of course not!

30
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,900
Our guests
are eating the floral arrangements.

31
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,100
- No cocktails before dinner?
- My God! Are they vegetarian?

32
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,900
Does the chef have a dressing
that goes well with chrysanthemums?

33
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,300
<i>Captain Picard, Command wants</i>
<i>to know our ETA at the Goren system? </i>

34
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,700
- The Goren system?
- Some territorial dispute.

35
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,100
If we delay our trip to Hanoran II,
it'll put us in the monsoon season.

36
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,300
Captain...

37
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,900
- The diplomatic corps is busy.
- So we get to put out another fire.

38
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,700
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

39
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,500
Deck 10.

40
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,900
Remember, they're not
as advanced as we are.

41
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,400
- They've just achieved warp drive.
- Now they're a protectorate.

42
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,300
With the Borg and the Dominion,
we need all the allies we can get.

43
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Captain on deck.

44
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,600
- Regent Cuzar likes to dance.
- Can she mambo?

45
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,600
- Very funny.
- The Captain cuts quite a rug.

46
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
<i>La Forge to Picard. I need to talk</i>
<i>to you before the reception. </i>

47
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,100
- Mr Worf! What are you doing here?
- I was at the...

48
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,200
- He's late. Can it wait?
<i>- I don't think so... </i>

49
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,200
- Tell him to come up here.
- The Captain wants you to join us.

50
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>There's a communiqué from</i>
<i>Admiral Dougherty about Data. </i>

51
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Yew-chin chef-faw, Regent Cuzar,
welcome aboard.

52
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Captain Picard, I welcome you
in the tradition of my people.

53
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,000
We are so honoured to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

54
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,100
- We have a dance later.
- I look forward to it.

55
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,200
- Counsellor...?
- Nice bead work.

56
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,800
Captain, Admiral Dougherty is aboard
a Son'a ship in sector 4-4-1.

57
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,100
He's requesting Data's schematics.
He doesn't say why.

58
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,800
Data was only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for a week.

59
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,400
Geordi, set up a secure com-link
to the Admiral.

60
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,300
Hars Adislo. We met at the
Nel Bato conference last year.

61
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Did you read my paper
on thermionic transconductance?

62
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,200
Would you excuse me?

63
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,800
<i>He's not acknowledging</i>
<i>any Starfleet protocol. </i>

64
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,300
- What precipitated this behaviour?
<i>- I don't know. Now he has hostages. </i>

65
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,400
We could be there in two days.

66
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>That's not a good idea. Your ship</i>
<i>hasn't been fitted for this region. </i>

67
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>- There are environmental concerns. </i>
- Such as?

68
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,800
<i>We're studying various anomalies. </i>
<i>They call this area the Briar Patch. </i>

69
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,500
<i>We've had trouble</i>
<i>even getting a signal to you. </i>

70
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,500
<i>Just get me Data's schematics. </i>
<i>I'll keep you informed. </i>

71
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,700
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

72
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,700
Send the Admiral Data's schematics.

73
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Report to the galley and tell
the chef to skip the fish course.

74
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,100
I'd like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows.

75
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm going to ask Worf
to delay his return to DS9.

76
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,300
We can stop by Sector 4-4-1
on our way to the Goren system.

77
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,100
- They are in opposite directions.
- Are they?

78
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,400
I should never have let you
talk me into that duck blind.

79
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Federation procedures have made this
more difficult than it needed to be.

80
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,700
We have to protect the planet's
population from unnecessary risk.

81
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,000
Planet's population?
600 people!

82
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,100
If you want to avoid unnecessary
risks, leave your android at home.

83
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,800
<i>- We are approaching the planet. </i>
- Take us into a high orbit.

84
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,000
Lie down, the girls
will take 20 years off your face.

85
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,400
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me.

86
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,500
You deny yourself every benefit
this mission has to offer.

87
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Such benefits are to be shared
with <i>all</i> the people of the Federation.

88
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,700
- Report!
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

89
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,700
Raise shields.

90
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes.

91
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,900
- The vessel has broken off pursuit.
- Visual contact.

92
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,900
That's our ship.

93
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,500
We're about to lose
communications with Starfleet.

94
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,300
You got everything from Command?

95
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I have all files on the duck-blind
mission and the Son'a.

96
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,800
You have two days
to become experts.

97
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Mr Worf, we need a plan
to safely capture Data.

98
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,100
La Forge has modified this tricorder
with one of Data's actuation servos.

99
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,700
Its range is only four metres,
but it will shut him down.

100
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,800
Good to have you back.

101
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,900
Slow to one third. Take us in.

102
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,200
Half a century ago,
they conquered two primitive races

103
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,200
and integrated them into
their culture as a labour class.

104
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,500
The Son'a have produced quantities
of the narcotic ketracel-white.

105
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Their ships are rumoured to be
equipped with outlawed weapons.

106
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,200
- Why are we involved with them?
- Good question.

107
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
- You haven't done that in a while.
- What?

108
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
- What you're doing to my neck.
- What's that?

109
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,900
<i>Bridge to Commander Worf. </i>

110
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,300
<i>- Worf! </i>
- Captain.

111
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,300
I don't know how they do it on DS9.
Here we still report for duty on time.

112
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>- Sorry, sir. I'm on my way. </i>
- We'll skip the court martial.

113
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,200
When was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors?

114
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,800
- Two months ago.
- They don't sound right.

115
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,700
They are out of alignment
by 12 microns. You could hear that?

116
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,100
When I was an ensign, I could
detect a 3-micron misalignment.

117
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,000
The Son'a ship with Adm. Dougherty
has entered tracking range.

118
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,600
Straighten your baldric.
On screen.

119
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,100
<i>Captain, I wasn't expecting you. </i>

120
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,600
This is important to the Enterprise.

121
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,800
<i>Data attacked us in the mission</i>
<i>scout ship, yesterday. </i>

122
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,500
<i>Ru'afo and I have decided</i>
<i>to send in an assault team. </i>

123
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,700
Worf and I are working out
tactical plans...

124
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,200
Your android has turned
dangerously violent.

125
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,300
My ship has been damaged.
He must be destroyed.

126
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,900
<i>I know what Data means to Starfleet, </i>
<i>but our crew are in danger on the planet. </i>

127
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:31,100
If our attempt to capture Data fails,
I will terminate him.

128
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain and his friend.

129
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,600
<i>All right, you have 12 hours, then</i>
<i>I want you out of the Briar Patch. </i>

130
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,700
<i>We'll head out to the perimeter</i>
<i>to call for Son'a reinforcements. </i>

131
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,400
- Understood.
<i>- Good luck, captain. </i>

132
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,900
<i>Dougherty out. </i>

133
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:10,900
- We're not picking up any ships.
- Try a wide-band covariant signal.

134
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,000
The rings must be
masking his approach.

135
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,200
The metaphasic radiation from the rings
is in a state of extreme flux.

136
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,700
<i>Come out, come out</i>
<i>wherever you are... </i>

137
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,900
- Sir?
- That's something my mother...

138
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
Hold on.

139
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,200
Open all hailing frequencies.
Data, this is Captain Picard.

140
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,400
Please respond.

141
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,300
If we fire tachyon bursts,
he'll have to reset his shields.

142
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,900
- Then we can beam him out.
- Make it so.

143
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,100
- Direct hit. His shields are down.
- Beam him out.

144
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,200
- He's using a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

145
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
That will shake him.

146
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,400
- Scanners are off-line.
- Start evasive manoeuvres.

147
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,900
He can fly a ship and anticipate
our tactics. His brain is functioning.

148
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,600
We know how he responds to threats.
I wonder how he would respond...

149
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
Do you know Gilbert & Sullivan?

150
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,400
No, I've not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members.

151
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,000
They're composers,
from the 19th century.

152
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,600
Data was rehearsing "HMS Pinafore"
just before he left.

153
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,800
<i>A Brltish tar is a soaring soul</i>
<i>as free as a mountain bird</i>

154
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,600
<i>His energetic fist should be ready</i>
<i>to resist a dictatorial word</i>

155
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,400
Sing, Worf.

156
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>- His nose should pant</i>
<i>- And his lips should curl</i>

157
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,600
<i>- His cheeks should flame</i>
<i>- And his brow should furl</i>

158
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
<i>- His bosom should heave</i>
<i>- And his heart should glow</i>

159
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,700
<i>And his fist be ever ready</i>
<i>for a knockdown blow</i>

160
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,700
<i>His nose should pant</i>
<i>and his lips should curl</i>

161
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,000
<i>His cheeks should flame</i>
<i>and his brow should furl</i>

162
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,800
<i>His bosom should heave</i>
<i>and his heart should glow</i>

163
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,200
<i>And his fist be ever ready</i>
<i>for a knockdown blow</i>

164
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,500
Prepare the docking clamps.

165
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
<i>His eyes should flash</i>
<i>wlth an inborn fire</i>

166
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,600
<i>His brow wlth scorn be wrung</i>

167
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,700
<i>He never should bow down</i>
<i>to a domineering frown</i>

168
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
<i>Or the tang of a tyrant tongue</i>

169
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,800
<i>- His heart should stamp</i>
<i>- And his throat should growl</i>

170
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>- His hair should curl</i>
<i>- And his face should scowl</i>

171
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,400
<i>- His eyes should flash</i>
<i>- And his breast protrude</i>

172
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,700
<i>And this should be</i>
<i>his customary attitude</i>

173
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,700
<i>His foot should stamp</i>
<i>and his voice should drop</i>

174
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>His hair should curl</i>
<i>and his face... </i>

175
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,600
If we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

176
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm not letting go of him.

177
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,800
- We must stabilise.
- All power to inertial dampers.

178
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,800
- The auto-sequencer is damaged.
- Transfer control to manual.

179
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Auto-sequencer realigned.
Engaging stabilisers.

180
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,600
- Damping field established.
- Maximum power.

181
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,300
Now, Mr Worf.

182
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Commander Data is safely in custody.

183
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,000
- Captain, Subahdar Gallatin.
- Lt. Curtis, Dougherty's attaché.

184
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,300
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

185
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,400
They have incredible
mental discipline and perception.

186
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,500
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.

187
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,500
Dr Crusher and Counsellor Troi.

188
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,800
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.

189
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
As you wish. I would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

190
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,400
This village is a sanctuary of life.

191
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,100
Prepare the hostages for transport.

192
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,400
They should be quarantined
before joining the ship's population.

193
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,800
We believed they were being held
against their will.

194
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,400
It's not our custom
to hold anyone against their will.

195
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,000
The android told us they were our
enemies, and that more would follow.

196
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,500
Are you our enemy?

197
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,200
Non-interference in other cultures
is my people's prime directive.

198
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Your directive apparently doesn't
include spying on other cultures.

199
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,200
The android is a member of my crew.
Apparently, he was taken ill.

200
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,000
We were unable to repair the phase
variance in his positronic matrix.

201
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,600
The captain finds it hard to believe
we possess such technical skills.

202
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Not applying our technological
abilities is a matter of choice.

203
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,500
Creating a machine to do man's work
takes something away from man.

204
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,800
At one time, we explored the galaxy,
just as you do.

205
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,300
- You have warp capability?
- Capability, yes.

206
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,300
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

207
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I apologise for our intrusion.

208
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,300
Because they have warp capability,
the consequences will be minimal.

209
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,500
<i>Terrific job. Now pack your bags</i>
<i>and get the hell out of there. </i>

210
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,100
<i>- How's Data? </i>
- La Forge is doing the diagnostic.

211
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,500
<i>I'll read the paperwork tomorrow. </i>
<i>Rendezvous with us</i>

212
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,700
<i>to transfer crew and equipment</i>
<i>on your way out. </i>

213
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:22,100
- You're not finished here?
<i>- Just a few loose ends to tie up. </i>

214
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Come in.

215
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,500
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

216
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,300
- I need a little counselling.
- That's a first.

217
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,800
Do I lie down, or what?

218
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Whatever makes you comfortable,
but it isn't a therapeutic posture.

219
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,200
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?

220
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,300
Why don't you try lying down?

221
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,100
You're in quite a mood today.
Did you just come down here to play?

222
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,500
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.
- I believe you.

223
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,700
- I'm not sleeping well.
- Dr Crusher can help.

224
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,400
What I need
I can't get from Dr Crusher.

225
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,500
Can two people go back in time
and fix a mistake they've made?

226
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,400
On this ship, anything's possible.

227
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,200
Yuk!

228
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,000
- I never kissed you with a beard.
- I kiss you, and you say "yuk"!

229
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,800
I reconstructed Data's neural net
and replaced these memory engrams.

230
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,400
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

231
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,100
There's no doubt about it.
That's why Data malfunctioned.

232
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,300
But the Son'a claimed they didn't fire
till after he malfunctioned.

233
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,000
I don't believe it happened that way.

234
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
Why would they fire on him first?

235
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,900
All I know is that he functioned normally
until he was shot.

236
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,500
His ethical and moral subroutines
then took over.

237
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,000
So he still knew the difference
between right and wrong.

238
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,100
The system prevents anyone from
taking advantage of his memory loss.

239
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,200
Yet he attacked us
and told the Ba'ku we were a threat.

240
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,700
- Are the implants bothering you?
- No, I'm just tired.

241
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,300
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.

242
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,800
I seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

243
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,100
There they are.

244
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What's the last thing you remember?

245
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,700
<i>- His nose should pant... </i>
- From the mission.

246
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,700
I was gathering
physiometric data on the Ba'ku.

247
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,000
I followed some children into the hills.

248
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,100
Artim, where were you
the day the android appeared to us?

249
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,600
- In the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?

250
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,200
There is no reason to fear me. I am
operating within normal parameters.

251
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,300
They fixed me.

252
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,600
- The boy is afraid of me.
- It's nothing personal.

253
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,100
- These people rejected technology.
- I am technology personified.

254
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,700
That young man has never seen
a machine that walks and talks.

255
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,600
<i>Bridge to Riker. </i>

256
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,200
- Can I get back to you, Worf?
<i>- It's Admiral Dougherty. </i>

257
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Patch him through.
Yes, Admiral?

258
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,400
- Why haven't you left orbit?
<i>- Picard is still on the surface. </i>

259
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>He wants to find out</i>
<i>why Data malfunctioned. </i>

260
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,600
His future at Starfleet
depends on it.

261
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Remind the Captain
his 12 hours are up.

262
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,900
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Dougherty out. </i>

263
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,200
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

264
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,200
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

265
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,400
I won't need any more
genetic manipulation

266
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,600
if our Federation friends will
allow us to complete this mission.

267
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,600
Tricorder functions are limited
due to kelbonite deposits in the area.

268
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,100
How about a passive radiation scan?

269
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,300
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

270
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Can he breathe underwater?

271
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,900
Data doesn't breathe.

272
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,900
- Won't he rust?
- No.

273
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,600
Captain!

274
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,100
I believe I know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

275
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,200
The vessel
is clearly Federation in origin.

276
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,500
"Just a few loose ends
to tie up!"

277
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,500
- We're not interested in this.
- I am.

278
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,600
- It would be wiser...
- I'm going with you.

279
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,100
It is a holographic projection.

280
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,700
Incomplete, I might add.

281
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,200
This is a computer-driven image
created by photons and forcefields.

282
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,900
I know what a hologram is.

283
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,000
Why would anyone want
to create one of our village?

284
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,900
If you were following the children
and discovered this ship...

285
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,700
I may have been shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

286
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,700
Why would they duplicate this village
except to deceive the Ba'ku?

287
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,400
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

288
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,700
You'd fall asleep in your village

289
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,800
and wake up
on this flying holodeck.

290
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,500
Transported en masse,
and in a few days

291
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,100
relocated on a similar planet
without ever realising it.

292
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,900
Why would the Federation
wish to move the Ba'ku?

293
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,400
I don't know.

294
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,500
Computer, end program.
De-cloak the vessel.

295
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,700
Help!

296
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,100
I can't swim.

297
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,200
Don't panic.

298
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,900
I've been shot at on a ship
that has come to abduct us.

299
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,700
What's there to panic about?

300
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,500
For water landings, I am designed
to serve as a flotation device.

301
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Did the hostages mention
anything about a cloaked ship?

302
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

303
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,200
- Have you been in a fight?
- No, it is a gorch.

304
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,300
A pimple, sir.

305
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,000
Well... it's hardly noticeable.

306
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,200
- Smooth as an android's bottom.
- I beg your pardon?

307
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,600
- Dougherty noticed we haven't left.
- We're not going anywhere.

308
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,600
Deck 5.

309
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Klingons never do anything small.

310
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,700
- Dr Crusher asked to speak to you.
- Picard to Crusher.

311
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,100
The Son'a hostages
declined to be examined.

312
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
- And our people?
- They're fine.

313
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,900
In fact they're better than fine.
Improved muscle tone, high energy.

314
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,000
Very well, Doctor.

315
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't release the Son'a officers
until I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

316
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,300
Commander, may I...?

317
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Computer, music.

318
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,100
- Not that, something Latin.
<i>- Specify. </i>

319
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,800
The mambo.

320
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,700
That's more like it.

321
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,400
How old are you?

322
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,100
Our solar system was on the verge
of self-annihilation.

323
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,600
Technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

324
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,800
A small group of us
set off to find a new home.

325
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,100
A home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

326
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,600
- That was 309 years ago.
- And you haven't aged since then.

327
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,500
I was a lot older when we arrived,
in terms of my physical condition.

328
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,900
There's a metaphasic radiation
coming from the planet's rings.

329
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
It regenerates
our genetic structure.

330
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,000
- You must have noticed the effects.
- We've just begun to.

331
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,200
- I suppose you're 75.
- No, I'm 12.

332
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,700
The radiation won't affect him
until he reaches maturity.

333
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:25,100
What you have here is more valuable
than gold-pressed latinum.

334
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,400
That's the reason someone may be
trying to take your world from you.

335
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,600
The android was right.

336
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,300
If it wasn't for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

337
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,500
- How can we defend ourselves?
- If we fight, we become like them.

338
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,000
- We lose everything we are.
- It may not come to that.

339
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,700
The architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret.

340
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,400
Not only from you,
but from my people, as well.

341
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,300
I don't intend to let them.

342
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,500
We've always known that to survive
we had to remain apart.

343
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,200
It hasn't been easy.

344
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,600
Many of the young people want
to know more about the offland.

345
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,600
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

346
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Most of my people would
sell their souls to slow life down.

347
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,600
But not you?

348
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,000
There are days.

349
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:42,300
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander.

350
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,500
In defence of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

351
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,600
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

352
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:00,800
You give me more credit than
I deserve. Of course I'm tempted.

353
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,300
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world

354
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:13,100
involve the forced relocation
of one people to satisfy another.

355
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,500
I had hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes,

356
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,300
but it seems
that some of us haven't.

357
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,900
- Extraordinary craftsmanship.
- It's the work of students.

358
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

359
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,700
In 30 or 40 years
some of them will become artisans.

360
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,900
Apprenticing for 30 years...

361
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Did your people's mental discipline
develop here?

362
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,500
More questions.
Always the explorer.

363
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,600
- If you stay, that will change.
- Will it?

364
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,400
You stop reviewing the past,
stop planning for tomorrow.

365
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Let me ask you a question:

366
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,200
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

367
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,500
When time seemed to stop, and you
could almost live in that moment?

368
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,900
Seeing my home planet from space,
for the first time.

369
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,900
Yes, exactly.

370
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

371
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,000
You explore the universe.

372
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,600
We discovered that a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself.

373
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,400
Full of powerful forces.

374
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,900
Most people aren't aware enough
of the <i>now</i> to even notice.

375
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,400
I wish I could spare
a few centuries to learn.

376
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,900
It took us centuries to learn that
it doesn't have to take that long.

377
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,400
There's one thing
I don't understand.

378
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,900
In 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

379
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,900
I haven't got around to it yet.

380
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,100
I wonder if you're aware
of the trust you engender.

381
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,800
- It's unusual...
- For an offlander?

382
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
For someone so young.

383
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,400
- Geordi?
- Captain.

384
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,400
There wasn't anything wrong
with my implants.

385
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,600
There was something right
with my eyes.

386
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,000
Dr Crusher found that the cells
around my optic nerve had...

387
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
...started to regenerate.

388
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,200
It may not last.
And if it doesn't...

389
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,900
...I just wanted, before we go...

390
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,800
You know, I've never seen a sunrise.

391
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,400
At least not the way you see them.

392
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,800
Come.

393
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,900
Am I to understand
that you're not releasing my men?

394
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,300
We found the holoship.

395
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,200
- Let the captain and me...
- No!

396
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,600
This entire mission has been one
Federation blunder after another.

397
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Return my men, or this alliance will
end with your ship's destruction.

398
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,900
You're looking well, Jean-Luc.
Rested.

399
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,700
I won't let you move them. I will
take this to the Federation Council.

400
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,400
I'm acting on their orders.

401
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,800
To abandon our prime directive?

402
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:52,600
These people are not indigenous.
They're not meant to be immortal.

403
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,400
We'll be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

404
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,000
Who the hell are we to determine
the course of evolution?

405
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
There are 600 people there.

406
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,900
The regenerative properties of
this radiation could help billions.

407
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:15,000
The Son'a can collect metaphasic
particles from the planet's rings.

408
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,100
- The planet is in Federation space.
- Our planet, their technology.

409
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,700
A technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?

410
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:34,700
- Partners.
- Our partners are petty thugs.

411
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,800
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

412
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:47,100
Warp drive created a Romulan empire.
We can handle the Son'a.

413
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,200
We probably said the same
about the Romulans.

414
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,900
Lifespans will be doubled. An entire
new medical science will evolve.

415
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,300
Your chief engineer has the use
of his eyes for the first time.

416
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,500
Will you take that away from him?

417
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,000
With the whole Briar Patch, why
does it have to be this one planet?

418
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,300
The concentration in the rings
makes it work.

419
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,000
They'll inject something into
the rings and start a reaction.

420
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:26,700
- The planet will be uninhabitable.
- Delay them, let us study it.

421
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,300
Our best scientific minds
can't find any other way to do this.

422
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,300
The Son'a can establish a separate
colony on the planet until we do.

423
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,900
It would take ten years' exposure
to reverse their condition.

424
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,500
Some of them
won't survive that long.

425
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,000
And who would want
to live in the Briar Patch?

426
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,900
The Ba'ku.

427
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,800
We are betraying the principles upon
which the Federation was founded.

428
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,000
It's an attack upon its very soul.

429
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
And it will destroy the Ba'ku.

430
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,600
Cultures have been destroyed
in every forced relocation in history.

431
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,500
Jean-Luc,
we're only moving 600 people.

432
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,600
How many people does it take
before it becomes wrong?

433
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,500
1,000?
50,000?

434
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,100
A million?
How many people does it take?

435
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,300
You'll proceed to the Goren system,
and release the Son'a officers.

436
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,600
File whatever protests you wish to.

437
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
By the time you do,
this will all be done.

438
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,700
Gallatin!

439
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,800
The righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

440
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,500
- Any problems on the surface?
- No, sir.

441
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,200
- But it wasn't easy being among them.
- I'm sure.

442
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,700
Just don't forget
what they did to us.

443
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,700
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

444
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
We needn't bother
with a holoship any more.

445
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,400
Get the holding cells ready.

446
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,800
I'm going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of ours.

447
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,100
Re-routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise.

448
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,600
However, the transporter
is rarely used after 02:00 hours.

449
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,600
- Going out for a spin?
- Seven tons of explosives.

450
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,400
Tetryon pulse launchers
and isomagnetic disintegrators.

451
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,600
- A hunting trip?
- Return to your quarters.

452
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,000
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.

453
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,900
How can I look at a sunrise, knowing
what my sight cost these people?

454
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Exposure could stimulate rebellious
instincts common to youth

455
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,500
which would affect everyone's
judgement... except mine.

456
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,600
What do you think we should do?

457
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,100
Saddle up.
Lock and load.

458
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,400
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited.

459
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,500
Ourjob is to keep
the planet inhabited.

460
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,500
We'll show what's happening here.
Make the Council <i>see</i> the Ba'ku.

461
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,900
Then it won't be so easy
to turn a blind eye to their suffering.
