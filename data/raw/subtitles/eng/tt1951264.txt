the moment you revealed

79
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,641
those poison berries in the arena.

80
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,184

81
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,812

00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,855
he would have blown you

But here you are.

84
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,485
I expect you can guess where he is.

Yes, I think so.

86

After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do

87

but to let you play out
your little scenario.

88
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:32,537
And you were very good.

89
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,248
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

90
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,250
Impressive. Truly.

91
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,461
You convinced the people in The Capitol.

92
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,924
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

93
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,510
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

94
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,096
people viewed your little
trick with the berries

95
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:52,890
as an act of defiance.

96
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,017
Not as an act of love.

97
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,728
And if a girl from
District 12 of all places

98
00:07:57,937 --> 00:08:01,107
can defy The Capitol
and walk away unharmed,

99
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,567
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

100
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,570
What is to prevent, say,

101
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,572
an uprising?

102
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,700
That can lead to revolution.

103
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,784
And then, in a fraction of time,

104
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,995
the whole system collapses.

105
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,871
It must be a fragile system,

106
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,040
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.

107
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,876
Yes, it is, indeed.

108
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,503
But not in the way you imagine it.

109
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,046
How should I imagine?

110
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,300
You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.

111
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:31,512
This town of yours reduced to ashes.
Imagine it gone.

113

as if it had never
existed, like District 13.

in The Games, Miss Everdeen.

Tell me.

123
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,589
At what point did he
realize the depth of your

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,508
indifference towards him?

125
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,677
- I'm not indifferent.
- Don't lie!

126
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,763
You promised.

127
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,435

on their kill list.

Brutus and Enobaria.

948

What's with her teeth?

949
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,900
She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.

950
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,318
She's committed. I'll give her that.

951
00:54:38,485 --> 00:54:41,821
Wiress and Beetee. Not
fighters, but brilliant.

952
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,449
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

953
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,492
He won his Games by electrocuting

954
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:47,786
six Tributes at once.

955
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:50,330
The Morphlings. Masters of camouflage.

956
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,750
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

957
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,419
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:03,259
Yes. He won his Games at 14. Youngest ever.

00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,428
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

962
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:08,180

She volunteered for Annie.

970
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:24,864
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

971
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:28,493
If he's trying to protect her in any way,
it exposes him.

972
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,453
A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.

973
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:32,955
I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.

she goes, she goes quickly.

Well, it's better than hunting them down.

Yeah, why not?

we both know what happens next.

I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1846
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,475
What if they don't either?

1847

What if all of us refuse to shoot first?

1848

We might still end up dead.

1849

that same mistake again.

After The Games,

1999
02:14:44,494 --> 02:14:46,288
they sent in hovercrafts.

2000
02:14:49,332 --> 02:14:51,918
And they started dropping firebombs.

2001
02:14:56,131 --> 02:14:57,591
They're not in 12?

2002
02:14:59,968 --> 02:15:01,803
There is no District 12.

2003
02:15:03,471 --> 02:15:04,806
It's all gone.
