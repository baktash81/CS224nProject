1
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:46,414
<i>My grandfather, King George-</i>

2
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,717
<i>he take'em me walkabout...</i>

3
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,883
<i>teach me blackfella way.</i>

4
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,623
<i>Grandfather teach'em me</i>
<i>most important lesson of all.</i>

5
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,856
<i>Tell'em story.</i>

6
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:05,868
<i>That day I down the billabong.</i>

7
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,207
<i>King George-he teach me how</i>
<i>to catch'em fish using magic song.</i>

8
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:17,040
<i>See, I not blackfella.</i>
<i>I not white fella either.</i>

9
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,608
<i>Them white fellas call me mixed-blood...</i>

10
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,419
- <i>half-caste-</i>
- Yea!

11
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,958
<i>creamy.</i>

12
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,961
- <i>Hyah!</i>
- <i>I belong no one.</i>

13
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,055
<i>That day I see'em them white fellas.</i>

14
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:34,828
<i>They were pushing</i>
<i>them cheeky bulls across the river...</i>

15
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,803
<i>onto Carney land.</i>

16
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:45,908
<i>King George angry at them white fellas.</i>

17
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:51,976
<i>King George say</i>
<i>them white fella bad spirit.</i>

18
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:54,680
<i>Must be taken from this land.</i>

19
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,342
<i>Shh.</i>

20
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,391
Coppers.

21
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,266
<i>Them coppers come take me away.</i>

22
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:20,239
<i>They want to put me</i>
<i>on that Mission Island.</i>

23
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:24,937
<i>Make me into a white fella.</i>

24
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:30,006
<i>But they're not coppers.</i>

25
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,877
Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.

26
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,448
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

27
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,518
<i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>

28
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:46,532
<i>The strangest woman I ever seen.</i>

29
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,864
<i>She's not from this land.</i>

30
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:57,104
<i>This land my people</i>
<i>got many names for...</i>

31
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:59,168
<i>but white fellas call it...</i>

32
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:02,939
<i>Australia.</i>

33
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,852
<i>But this story not begin that day.</i>

34
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:13,291
<i>This story begin a little while ago</i>
<i>in a land far, far away.</i>

35
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,557
<i>That land called England.</i>

36
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:25,429
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.

37
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:28,907
<i>But the offer from</i>
<i>this "Cattle King,"Mr. Carney...</i>

38
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:31,308
is only one-sixth
of what it was once worth.

39
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,312
We need the money, Ramsden.

40
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,905
But Maitland
is just about to muster the fats.

41
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,280
What?

42
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,319
Get the-the big cows ready for market.

43
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,320
<i>Ramsden, you and I both know...</i>

44
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:45,552
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under...

45
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:48,254
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows.

46
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:51,195
At least not of the animal variety.

47
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:53,460
Lady Ashley,
I-I do think that's a bit harsh.

48
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,594
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.
- Lady Ashley!

49
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,503
<i>What do you intend to do?</i>

50
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,768
I intend to travel
to this cattle station...

51
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,537
sell it...

52
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,135
and bring Maitland home myself!

53
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:09,705
<i>But, Lady Ashley, it's Australia.</i>

54
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,680
<i>Darling Sarah, I implore you, do not travel.</i>

55
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:15,813
<i>Outbreak of war imminent. Stop.</i>

56
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:19,689
<i> Maitland, your concern</i>
<i>regarding war duly noted. Stop.</i>

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,728
<i>Have plan concerning cattle.</i>

58
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:24,229
<i>Sale to King Carney not necessary.</i>

59
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:27,790
- <i>Need more time. Stop.</i>
- <i> Nonsense. Stop.</i>

60
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:32,237
<i>Expect contract for sale of station</i>
<i>to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.</i>

61
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:35,469
<i>Cannot meet you. Stop.
Am mustering. Stop.</i>

62
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,909
<i>Have sent trusted man. Stop.</i>
<i>The Drover. Stop.</i>

63
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:42,638
The Drover?

64
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:56,726
<i>Drover, you boong lover.</i>

65
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,699
Any of you other Carney boys
want to have a go?

66
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,605
Come on, fellas.
Don't let fear stand in your way.

67
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,112
I'll have ya.

68
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:19,450
Hey! No boongs in here!

69
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,887
He's not in the pub, Ivan.

70
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,692
<i> Go on.</i>

71
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:32,198
<i>Run after your boong friend, 'cause as far</i>
<i>as this town's concerned, you</i> are <i>a black.</i>

72
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,700
You work with them,
you eat with them...

73
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,702
and you sleep with them.

74
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,738
Oh, crikey.

75
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,741
When you see her, wave your hat.

76
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,021
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

77
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,516
I hate coming to town.

78
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:06,226
Lady Sarah Ashley.

79
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,134
A genuine aristocrat
living right here in Darwin.

80
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,966
Administrator, we're at war.

81
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,506
Oh.

82
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:15,439
<i>As the officer...</i>

83
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,171
<i>in charge of livestock purchases</i>
<i>for the armed forces-</i>

84
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:21,408
- She's quite a looker.
- <i>I fail to see...</i>

85
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:24,348
what Lady Sarah Ashley...

86
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,445
<i>has to do with Carney's stranglehold</i>
<i>of the beef industry.</i>

87
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,820
<i>Her husband, Lord Ashley...</i>

88
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,985
claims he's mustering fats
at Faraway Downs.

89
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:36,029
- <i>Faraway Downs?</i>
- Faraway Downs.

90
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:39,122
The only cattle station
in the whole of the north...

91
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,794
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.

92
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,705
- Lord Maitland Ashley
is mustering on Faraway Downs?

93
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:46,965
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,635
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil?
- <i>No. Yeah.</i>

95
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,305
And now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat.

96
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,214
<i>Doesn't look like they're gonna sell</i>
<i>Faraway Downs to me, Neil.</i>

97
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,218
Ah, she won't last.

98
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:03,222
A delicate English rose withers
in the outback. Hmm.

99
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,621
You with me?

100
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,023
If you must know, I am to be met-

101
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:10,154
by my husband's trusted man,
a Mr. Drover.

102
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,663
The bloody Drover?

103
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,663
Bring it. Yes.

104
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:20,229
Move it.

105
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:24,505
Look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome.

106
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:27,877
My fiancÃ©, Neil Fletcher,
manages Faraway Downs.

107
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,073
Good day.

108
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:35,311
A bit pale.

109
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,483
Not a bad-looking sheila,
but what's the story on the luggage?

110
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,391
Wants to settle down
in the outback, does she?

111
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:46,398
<i>If she stays and Lord Ashley manages to</i>
<i>get his cattle down onto that wharfthere...</i>

112
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,697
<i>then we've got a competitor</i>
<i>for the army contract, Neil.</i>

113
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,934
<i>Carney's control of every</i>
<i>cattle station in the north...</i>

114
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:57,909
jeopardizes the supply of <i>beef</i>
to our troops.

115
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,675
But it's a poor war that doesn't make
a decent patriot rich, so...

116
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:05,115
<i>I don't want a single beast</i>
<i>from Faraway Downs...</i>

117
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:08,677
to set a hoof on that wharf.

118
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,393
- You with me, Neil?
- Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.

119
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,094
<i>What about the missus?</i>

120
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:24,103
No, I've arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route.

121
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,402
Give her a taste of the outback.

122
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,534
No!

123
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:35,373
- <i> Who's taking her?</i>
- The Drover.

124
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:41,820
The Drover?

125
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,824
<i>Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.</i>

126
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,296
I'm Sarah Ashley.

127
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,839
My husband, Lord Ashley...

128
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,272
has sent a trusted man to collect me.

129
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,775
<i>A, uh-A Mr. Drover.</i>

130
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:08,772
It seems as if he has been waylaid.

131
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,512
No women.

132
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,110
Ladies' lounge next door.

133
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:17,645
<i>The hen parlor's thataway, my dear.</i>

134
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,692
No wonder your establishment is empty.

135
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:24,689
Good day.

136
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,865
Oh! Oh!

137
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:33,104
You can take him!

138
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,605
No!

139
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,734
Oh! No, no!

140
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,896
<i>No, not my bags. Not my-</i>

141
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,963
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

142
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,607
<i>Here.</i>

143
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,617
Welcome to Australia.

144
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:25,190
<i>Drover take Mrs. Boss to Faraway Downs...</i>

145
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,556
<i>in a great, big, fancy truck.</i>

146
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:31,859
<i>He even let her sit in his special seat.</i>

147
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,891
<i>She even drinks</i>
<i>Drover's own water bottle.</i>

148
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,163
<i>That's it.</i>

149
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,865
<i>They get along like a burnin' house.</i>

150
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,931
<i>Now, Magarri-he sit'em up top.</i>

151
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,000
<i>And Magarri's cousin Goolajbaloong-</i>

152
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,046
<i>he come along for the ride.</i>

153
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:49,581
- Oh!
- <i>They make'em friends right away.</i>

154
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,241
Water.

155
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,512
Oh.

156
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:55,453
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.

157
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,690
"Trusted man."
Typical of my husband.

158
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,696
Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.

159
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,062
Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.

160
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:10,125
- Employee?
- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

161
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,228
- Lady, I'm not an employee.
- <i> Really?</i>

162
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,297
So you're just driving me
all the way out to Faraway Downs...

163
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,536
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you?
- No.

164
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,704
Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?

165
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,078
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

166
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,208
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.

167
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,482
I'm a drover, right? I move
the cattle from "A" to "B."

168
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,991
<i>All right? I work on commission.</i>
<i>No man hires me, no man fires me.</i>

169
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,457
- Oh-
- Everything I own...

170
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,393
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.

171
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:41,264
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

172
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,564
- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.

173
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:45,901
Definitely not for everyone.

174
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,907
Most people like to own things.
You know, land, luggage, other people.

175
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,911
<i>Makes them feel secure.</i>
<i>But all that can be taken away.</i>

176
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:56,415
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-

177
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:58,610
is your story.

178
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,676
Just tryin' to live a good one.

179
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:04,212
Yes, yes. An adventure story.
Mmm. You sound just like my husband.

180
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,153
Oh!

181
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,459
Oh, they're kangaroos!

182
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,761
- <i>Big reds.</i>
- Oh! Lovely.

183
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,199
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

184
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:18,294
<i> I've never seen a kangaroo.</i>
<i>Beautiful, jumping.</i>

185
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:20,362
- <i> Yeah, they're jumping.</i>
- Oh!

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,931
Oh, it's beautiful.

187
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:26,342
- <i>Uh-</i>
- Oh! Look at them jumping!

188
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,554
Ah!

189
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,184
Mr. Drover.

190
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,851
Hey, Miss Boss.

191
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:16,361
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?

192
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,727
- Mr. Drover.
- Yeah?

193
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:21,198
- There's only one tent.
- That's right.

194
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,079
For the four of us?

195
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,430
Well, you know, it gets
pretty chilly here at night.

196
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,871
We, uh-We like to bunk up together,
eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?

197
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:30,239
Nice and close, you know.

198
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:36,838
Oh!

199
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,907
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.

200
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,044
We're just having a laugh.

201
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:45,114
Never really slept in a tent in our life.
We just bunk around the fire, you see?

202
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:48,217
- See, we're not really used to, um-
- A woman?

203
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:51,525
<i>I suppose you think I should be</i>
<i>back in Darwin at the church fete...</i>

204
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:53,759
<i>or the ladies'. uh, whatever you call it.</i>

205
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,427
Well, I will have you know
that I am as capable as any man.

206
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:02,934
Guests. We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.

207
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,103
But now you mention it, I happen to
quite like the women of the outback.

208
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:08,909
But they're mostly native women.

209
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:10,472
Aboriginal women.

210
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,644
<i>They're very easy to, uh-</i>

211
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,154
to get along with, if you try.

212
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,816
<i># Whoa, babe</i>
<i>something is bothering me #

213
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,151
Go!

214
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,389
- <i>Ho!</i>
- Him always punctual.

215
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:31,432
Get out of here!

216
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:34,371
- <i> What's that?</i>
- Your accountant.

217
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,343
<i> Hey, Drover!</i>
<i>He's your bloody problem now!</i>

218
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,402
<i>See you, Drover!</i>

219
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,978
Kippelly Flymm.

220
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:51,455
- Kippelly Flynn.
- I'm sorry. What was your name again?

221
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:55,688
Lipelling Klymm, mi- mila- milady.

222
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:57,821
Kipling Flynn.

223
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:00,856
Thanks.

224
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,872
<i>How long till we reach Faraway Downs?</i>

225
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:11,877
<i> Oh, we've been on it</i>
<i>for the last two days.</i>

226
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:17,942
- Drover! Hey, Drover!
- <i>Yeah, love. How you doing?</i>

227
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,417
<i>Good. Aren't you gonna stop</i>
<i>and have a rest for a while?</i>

228
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,955
Nah, gotta make a delivery.
Put the kettle on.

229
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,991
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss.
- Okay.

230
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,584
See you soon.

231
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,027
- She's easy to get on with.
- Ah, she's trouble, that one.

232
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,031
- See you later!
- <i>Bye!</i>

233
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:36,034
You and my husband
share an interest.

234
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,729
An interest? Really?

235
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:41,535
Come on. We all know the real reason
that my husband is out here.

236
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,543
Oh. Right.
You mean the breeding. Yeah.

237
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,909
- Breeding?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

238
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,073
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.

239
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:51,083
I have this idea,
which, uh-which he loves.

240
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,745
You might be quite excited
about it too, actually.

241
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,551
Now, I'm a brumby man,
but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...

242
00:17:57,624 --> 00:17:59,353
<i>has really caught my eye.</i>

243
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:01,985
I got to admit.
She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.

244
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:05,326
Gorgeous creature.

245
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:11,737
<i>I've always wanted to mate an English</i>
<i>thoroughbred with a bush brumby.</i>

246
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:15,740
<i>I mean, it'd be magic, wouldn't it?</i>
<i>Magic.</i>

247
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,867
- <i>Imagine that combination.</i>
- Don't. Don't you say another word.

248
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,742
- I know what you're implying.
- You've thought about it, too, haven't you?

249
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:22,940
Capricornia-You- Poppycock!

250
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,779
- What are you talking about?
- Poppycock!

251
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:37,696
Coppers.

252
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:41,359
- What are you talking about?
- You-You want-

253
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:47,439
- You want to have it on with me.
- What? What was that?

254
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:49,441
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.

255
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:51,636
<i>Just like you have it on with</i>
<i>that poor girl you're exploiting...</i>

256
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,872
and-and-and God knows how many others.

257
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,312
What are you talking about?

258
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,818
- You got a filthy mind, lady.
- You're an animal!

259
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:04,914
I wouldn't have it on with you
if you were the only tart left in Australia.

260
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:06,754
- Animal! You are a-
- Believe me, I wouldn't-

261
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,259
<i>You-</i>

262
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,322
<i>Oh!</i>

263
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,800
Oh!

264
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,132
<i>What was that?</i>

265
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,366
- Stay in the car.
- No, no.

266
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:24,239
Get your hands off me.

267
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:28,345
For once in your life,
do as you're bloody told.

268
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:47,798
<i>There she is.</i>

269
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:52,071
Faraway Downs.

270
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:05,906
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

271
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:08,715
- <i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

272
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:27,131
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!

273
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm so sorry.

274
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,831
<i>My family has had the honor of serving...</i>

275
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,630
the owners of Faraway Downs
for three generations.

276
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,263
<i>We know how hard this land can be.</i>

277
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,206
<i>But Lord Maitland Ashley-he-</i>

278
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,209
he never gave up.

279
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:41,940
The only thing that could stop this decent
and courageous man was a spear...

280
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:45,973
<i>from a murderous black,</i>
<i>the so-called King George.</i>

281
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,919
<i>And he will be brought to justice.</i>

282
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:52,219
<i>Let us now pray for Maitland Ashley...</i>

283
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,886
<i>that his soul may enter peacefully</i>
<i>through the gates of heaven.</i>

284
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:08,801
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin
first thing in the morning.

285
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.

286
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,638
Watch the, um-

287
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,879
I can't understand what my husband
would have seen out here.

288
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:22,948
Yeah, this land has a strange power.

289
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:06,824
<i>That first night, when the sun go to sleep...</i>

290
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:11,393
<i>King George tell me</i>
<i>this land be healed.</i>

291
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:16,465
<i>He tell'em me that woman-</i>
<i>that far, far away woman-</i>

292
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:19,340
<i>she be like the rain.</i>

293
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:23,508
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I'm gonna sing her to me.</i>

294
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:28,713
<i> Make the land sing.</i>

295
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:14,095
I let you see me now.

296
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,225
Who are you?

297
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:18,395
I Nullah.

298
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:20,371
How did you get in here?

299
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:23,306
I make myself invisible...

300
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:25,537
with <i>gulapa</i> magic!

301
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:36,519
What do you want?

302
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:40,025
That <i>balanda</i> Fletcher
been curse to this place.

303
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:44,525
<i>But you like Rainbow Serpent.</i>

304
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,829
You <i>mien-muk.</i>

305
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,893
<i>You heal this land, so I sing you to me.</i>

306
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:56,239
Like I sing a fish to me.

307
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:09,183
<i>I sing, too...</i>

308
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,816
when Mama and Fletcher...

309
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,451
make wrong-side business.

310
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:18,087
Wrong-sided business?

311
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:20,632
You know.

312
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,634
Laying down and tickling.

313
00:25:22,702 --> 00:25:26,468
- Oh, my goodness.
- Me and you secret.

314
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:29,872
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?

315
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,274
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...

316
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,370
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.

317
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:36,711
Maitland? I- I-

318
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:39,273
<i>I mean, Lord Ashley?</i>

319
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:41,786
Yeah. He plenty funny.

320
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:46,484
So that's why I took him down the billabong,
shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.

321
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,528
Come here. Look'em. Look.

322
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,654
Get pushed across that river...

323
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,665
over to Carney land.

324
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,462
The bulls.

325
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,729
<i>"Billabong"?</i>

326
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:59,930
<i>That's where Maitland was killed.</i>

327
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:02,201
<i> But, Mrs. Boss, that spear was-</i>

328
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,139
Please don't.

329
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,007
Don't make'em that policeman
take away my boy.

330
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,243
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.

331
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:13,183
He say you see me,
you send me to the Mission Island.

332
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:16,312
To that lock-lock.
Throw away bloody key.

333
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,558
Please, missus! Quick!

334
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,185
I make us invisible.

335
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:48,101
- Mrs. Boss.
- Oh! Oh. It's you.

336
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,172
Last night, I show you-

337
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,342
Hyah!

338
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:54,852
where-

339
00:27:56,589 --> 00:27:58,614
Yeah.
She's a beautiful day, isn't she?

340
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:01,955
How was your sleep? Restful?

341
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,154
I wouldn't say so, no.

342
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,790
Yeah, now, the boys are-
the boys are just finishing up.

343
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:10,324
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob
of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.

344
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,336
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?

345
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,331
Billabong.

346
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:16,271
Mr. Fletcher...

347
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,140
<i>tell me about the big,</i>
<i>fat cows that cross the river...</i>

348
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,145
down at the "billabalong,"
or whatever you call it.

349
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,875
Near the billabong?
No, that's Carney property over there.

350
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:25,439
Our cattle don't cross the river.

351
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:27,850
- Apparently they do.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

352
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,444
Who-Who says they do?

353
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:32,514
That little boy there.

354
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:42,561
<i>Oh, you mean the little half-caste fella?</i>

355
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:45,035
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.

356
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:48,835
<i>Come and tell Mr. Fletcher</i>
<i>what you told me last night.</i>

357
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,800
Yeah, come on, Nullah.

358
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:55,204
- <i> Yes.</i>
- They're funny ones.

359
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:05,715
Now...

360
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,919
did you see big, fat cattle
crossing Marmont River?

361
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:13,488
<i>Or were they just Carney cattle on</i>
<i>the other side of the river having a drink?</i>

362
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,836
<i>Them just Carney cattle, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

363
00:29:18,904 --> 00:29:21,702
- I been lookin' myself.
- Yeah?

364
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:30,111
Ah, you tell great, big,
tall stories, don't ya, eh?

365
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:34,278
<i> It's all right, Mr. Fletcher.</i>
<i>I'm sure the boy just made a mistake.</i>

366
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:36,719
<i> All right.</i>
<i>We best get going, Lady Ashley.</i>

367
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:41,021
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen.
Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.

368
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:44,062
- Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher.
- Look. I understand.

369
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,892
You barely slept.

370
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,956
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go.

371
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,233
Yeah. Well, that old windmill
hasn't turned in years.

372
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:54,602
He's a sweet little boy.
I don't think he meant any harm.

373
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,699
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies.
They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.

374
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,802
<i>That's why the, uh, government</i>
<i>sends them to the mission.</i>

375
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,747
<i>They all tell bloody monstrous lies.</i>
<i>Yeah. And the next one, quick.</i>

376
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,750
<i>Come on. We haven't got all day.</i>

377
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:07,649
<i>I no bloody liar!</i>

378
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:12,218
<i>He liar! He say this not work!</i>

379
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:26,633
Fletcher liar!

380
00:30:27,673 --> 00:30:29,903
- <i>No! Leave him alone!</i>
- Nullah!

381
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,443
- Fletcher!
- I curse you!

382
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:35,344
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

383
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:38,850
- Please!
- Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!

384
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,148
I curse you!

385
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,484
Leave him alone!

386
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:46,456
<i>Mr. Fletcher!</i>

387
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:49,323
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Fletcher!

388
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,492
<i> Get off my property.</i>

389
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,467
You no longer work for me.

390
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,937
<i> If I go, my men go with me.</i>

391
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,965
There won't be a single bloody beast in the
stockyard to start the drove in the morning.

392
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:08,104
<i>You heard what I said.</i>
<i>Get off my property!</i>

393
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,114
- Yeah?
- <i>Go!</i>

394
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:12,707
Now!

395
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:17,949
You're the boss.

396
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,058
<i>Flynn, get in the car.</i>

397
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,060
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.

398
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:25,187
Bunchemup, grab the gear.
Pack it up.

399
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,562
<i>I'll see you in Desperation Creek</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

400
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:35,266
Bloody old fool.

401
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:47,013
Carney's gonna get this property.

402
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:50,078
Been a pleasure working for ya.
Real pleasure.

403
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:51,884
<i>Yeah.</i>

404
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:21,916
<i> That strange woman-</i>
<i>she fire'em that Fletcher.</i>

405
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,521
<i>He can't hurt Mama no more.</i>

406
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:39,802
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>we call her... Mrs. Boss.</i>

407
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,369
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?

408
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:49,846
I don't know. All crazy.

409
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:52,816
- White fella, blackfella- all crazy.
- Crazy.

410
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:06,263
<i> Mr. Flynn.</i>

411
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,466
- Milady.
- Don't get up.

412
00:33:11,904 --> 00:33:14,304
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

413
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,673
This, uh, ledger...

414
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:26,810
which, um, Fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband...

415
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,911
is a tale of decline and ruin...

416
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:33,583
redolent of the great Gibbon.

417
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,093
There is, however, another...

418
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,459
kept for the benefit...

419
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,328
of Mr. Carney...

420
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,860
<i>in which is recorded</i>
<i>all the unbranded...</i>

421
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,929
fat cattle...

422
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:52,306
- siphoned off across the river and into his herd.
- <i>## </i>

423
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:54,607
And the boy.

424
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,172
<i>He's Fletcher's son, isn't he?</i>

425
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,482
As with all things Fletcher,
it's impossible to prove anything.

426
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:05,148
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...

427
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:08,193
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself...

428
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,061
Fletcher's chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

429
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:15,999
I'm going to the authorities,
and I will be telling them-

430
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:18,730
- Carney <i>is</i> the authority here.
- Are you suggesting...

431
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:22,865
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it's worth?

432
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:27,969
<i>I'm suggesting that you continue</i>
<i>to do what your husband set out to do.</i>

433
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,080
Drove.

434
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:35,152
Drove the cattle to Darwin.

435
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,986
Would you mind?

436
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,218
I need a drink.

437
00:34:41,293 --> 00:34:44,126
My lady, drove.

438
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:47,256
Drove the cattle to Darwin,
sell them to the army...

439
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,232
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.

440
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,099
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs
back on its feet.

441
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:54,230
You go back to London.

442
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:56,399
You're sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

443
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:58,443
That's what Maitland
said he was doing.

444
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,276
And there's no reason
why you can't do the same.

445
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,291
<i>There is just one small problem.</i>

446
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:18,388
Having dismissed Fletcher,
there's no one to muster the cattle.

447
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,975
Hyah! Hyah!

448
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:35,712
<i>Flynn! Mrs. Boss!</i>

449
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:37,976
<i>It's the Drover!</i>

450
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:53,763
Drover! Drover!

451
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:55,823
Hyah!

452
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,803
Hyah!

453
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:11,111
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!

454
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,174
Teach me how to
break them brumbies!

455
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,844
- See any boys in there?
- <i>No.</i>

456
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,015
Goolaj, go see if they're
out in the top paddock.

457
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,958
- Mr. Drover!
- <i>Just get the bloody brumbies in there.</i>

458
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:24,587
- I'll find out what the hell's going on.
- Teach me to break them horses.

459
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:26,790
- Fill the water trough, son.
- I need to speak to you!

460
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:29,459
<i>Where the hell are</i>
<i>all the bloody stockmen, eh?</i>

461
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:32,526
- That's what I need to speak to you about.
- Where's Fletcher?

462
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:36,267
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him.
- Dismissed?

463
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,003
- Yes.
- Wa- Hang on. What about the cattle?

464
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,068
Well, it beggars belief,
but as he was leaving...

465
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:44,775
he deliberately let the cows out of
the, uh- I don't know-whatever you call it...

466
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,976
and they ran off!

467
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:49,043
Damn! Do you realize, woman,
what you've done?

468
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,681
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me.
Thank you very much!

469
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:53,691
- Don't take that tone with you, huh?
- No.

470
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,727
I'm asking you, woman,
do you know what you've done?

471
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:59,025
I won't get another drove this late in the season.
You've cost me my living.

472
00:36:59,097 --> 00:37:02,362
- Can't you just round them up?
- Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!

473
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:05,494
- Yes. You just go get them.
- 1,500 head of cattle-

474
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:05,721
Oh!

475
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:08,835
Scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men.

476
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:10,966
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.

477
00:37:11,043 --> 00:37:13,534
Mr. Drover,
I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...

478
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:14,977
on moral grounds.

479
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,378
Moral grounds?

480
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:19,611
<i>You're at that again, are ya?</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

481
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,846
He wanted to, uh, exploit you, did he?

482
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,649
- Fancy you, did he?
- What?

483
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:24,295
Stop it. I -

484
00:37:24,296 --> 00:37:26,919
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you?

485
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,755
- Please.
- Huh?

486
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,728
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.

487
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:34,925
<i>They were pushing the best</i>
<i>of the unbranded cattle...</i>

488
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,903
across the river
onto Mr. Carney's property.

489
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,531
They were stealing!

490
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,211
- There's no surprises there.
- No, he's a bad man.

491
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,113
All right, all right.
But look. You can't prove it, right?

492
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:53,242
- Well-
- <i>You can't.</i>

493
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:57,584
And you can't win against Carney.
So just take my advice, lady.

494
00:37:57,656 --> 00:38:01,888
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell
back to England as quickly as possible.

495
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,861
That way you'd make everybody happy,
especially me.

496
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:10,802
So you're just going to walk away?

497
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:12,962
I learned a long time ago
not to fight other people's wars.

498
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:15,598
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!

499
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:18,575
Please, please, please!
Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!

500
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:21,203
Please. I-

501
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:24,874
Listen. You said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a-

502
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,212
with a bush brumby.

503
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,650
<i>If you agree to help me, I-</i>

504
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:32,149
I will give you my Capricornia.

505
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:46,827
And how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men, huh?

506
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:52,967
Oh, crikey.

507
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,308
<i>Mum was a drover's boy for Fletcher.</i>

508
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,076
<i>Bandy was a drover's boy</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

509
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,517
<i>Some white stockmen like to have</i>
<i>an Aboriginal woman on the drove...</i>

510
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:03,520
to keep 'em company at night.

511
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,148
<i>They shave their heads,</i>
<i>make 'em look like boys...</i>

512
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,852
<i>and work 'em like any other stockman</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

513
00:39:08,927 --> 00:39:10,861
That's, uh-What do you call it?

514
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,762
- Exploiting them.
- Exploiting, yes.

515
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,701
Anyway, we're still in trouble.

516
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:21,705
We gotta have seven good riders at least,
and the most I can count is five.

517
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:23,832
- What have we got? We've got me-
- You.

518
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:26,173
- Magarri.
- Yeah, Magarri!

519
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:27,677
- Goolaj-
- Great.

520
00:39:27,746 --> 00:39:30,544
We got Daisy. Nice ride.
And, uh, Bandy. Good work.

521
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:33,311
<i>Oh. What about Mr. Sing Song?</i>
<i>Mr. Sing Song, ride horse?</i>

522
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:36,047
- Hey. Don't look at me.
- Sing Song, me real good cooker.

523
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:38,351
Cook's wagon at best.
We got five, right? It's not enough.

524
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,357
We need two more experienced riders.

525
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,519
I did that run once back in 1935...

526
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,613
with Magarri, Dingo Jones
and the Drongo brothers-

527
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:46,325
Drongo brothers.

528
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:49,834
- true knights of the outback.
- Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?

529
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:51,732
- I can.
- I won't carry a drunk.

530
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:52,997
But don't.

531
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:55,005
<i>I ride'em real bloody good!</i>

532
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:58,565
I drove those no-good cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

533
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:02,204
- All right. Five and a quarter.
- Six and a quarter.

534
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,975
<i>What?</i>

535
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:06,574
Lady, this ain't trotting
in Kensington Gardens.

536
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:11,213
<i> Mr. Drover, I could show you</i>
<i>a thing or two about horses.</i>

537
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:14,725
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses,
there's nothing you can show me.

538
00:40:14,793 --> 00:40:18,160
- Bring the horse.
- You can't be serious.

539
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,323
Bring the horse.

540
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:22,389
Oh, this should be interesting.

541
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:27,594
<i>Move along! Move along!</i>
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

542
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,230
Move along!

543
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,104
Rah! Rah!

544
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:33,406
- What are you doing?
- <i>Shoo! Shoo!</i>

545
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:36,538
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!

546
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:39,379
- Lady Ashley-
- Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.

547
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:41,385
Rah! Rah!

548
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:43,944
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

549
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:47,617
Oh! It's easy.
Stubborn things. Silly cows.

550
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:50,525
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing?
- Come on.

551
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,758
You're scattering them all over the place.
Get up the back there, up the tail.

552
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:59,764
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't let 'em break away.

553
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:02,204
Go on.

554
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,444
Run, you cows! Move, you cows!

555
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:13,211
We're trying to get the cows up there.

556
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,952
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley.
- I've got him! I've got him!

557
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:21,292
I think we're doing pretty well.

558
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:26,397
You crazy- take all this stuff.

559
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:28,455
Where you think you going?
Shanghai?

560
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,660
A lady never knows
what she might need.

561
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:53,149
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!

562
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:56,489
- Coppers! Coppers!
- <i>Tank! Run! Tank.</i>

563
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,086
Tank, Nullah! Tank!

564
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:02,730
<i>Bandy, coppers!</i>

565
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:05,497
Hurry up!

566
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:24,566
Turn 'em loose.

567
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:27,483
<i> Go on. Get out.</i>
<i>You two, check the east side.</i>

568
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:30,357
<i>Move, move! Hurry up!</i>

569
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,699
<i>Daisy's in the tank.</i>

570
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:47,870
Shh!

571
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,381
Bandy, tea. Tea.

572
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,111
<i> Where's the creamy?</i>

573
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,026
<i>Trackers.</i>

574
00:43:14,506 --> 00:43:15,837
<i>Nullah.</i>

575
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:28,211
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan
of the Northern Territory Police.

576
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,959
Grab the float.

577
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:46,228
I can't begin to tell you,
Lady Ashley, how the...

578
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:49,467
tragedy which befell
your late husband has...

579
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,171
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized
man and woman in the Northern Territory.

580
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:04,118
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...

581
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:06,953
that the suspect, King George,
will be brought to justice.

582
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:11,519
But surely a witch doctor could conceal
his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?

583
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:14,588
Makes no difference.
It's only a matter of time.

584
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:42,690
Shh!

585
00:44:52,504 --> 00:44:56,634
Oh, incidentally, I met up with
your former manager, Neil Fletcher.

586
00:44:56,708 --> 00:45:00,667
He informed me that there's a half-blood
Aboriginal child out here somewhere.

587
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:04,875
I thought we might pick him up
and put him in the good hands of the church.

588
00:45:06,618 --> 00:45:09,018
I will be sure to look out for him.

589
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,947
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.

590
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:18,858
<i>Get 'em in the back, Constable. Let's go.</i>

591
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:35,670
<i>They're in the tank!</i>

592
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:36,907
<i>Drover!</i>

593
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:40,747
<i>Drover, help them! Quickly!</i>

594
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:46,717
Mama!

595
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,884
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.

596
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,698
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

597
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:28,098
<i>Daisy! Daisy!</i>

598
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:30,293
Daisy! Daisy!

599
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:37,205
<i>Daisy! Daisy.</i>

600
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:40,267
<i>Daisy!</i>

601
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,848
Daisy.

602
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,643
When someone dies
in the Aboriginal culture...

603
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:55,481
you're not supposed to
say their name again.

604
00:47:58,423 --> 00:48:00,653
He needs motherin'.

605
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:02,886
Mothering?

606
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,952
<i>Yep.</i>

607
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:09,523
<i>You're a woman,</i>
<i>so, go on, get down there.</i>

608
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,333
I'm, uh- I'm not, uh, uh-

609
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,703
What?

610
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,801
Good with children.

611
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:24,006
Oh. Huh.

612
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:45,459
<i>Nullah.</i>

613
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:50,438
I wanted to extend my condolences.

614
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,772
Go away.

615
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:19,897
Would you, uh-
Would you like to hear a story?

616
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:22,701
What story?

617
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:29,270
Uh, well, it's, uh- it's called-

618
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:39,416
- It's called <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
- What's a wizard?

619
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,459
Well, a wizard is a sort of...

620
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:43,926
magic man.

621
00:49:45,096 --> 00:49:47,223
<i>Gulapa.</i>

622
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:53,337
<i>Mama say I gulapa.

623
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,571
- I magic man.
- Really?

624
00:49:57,642 --> 00:49:59,906
I wizard man.

625
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,748
We can't say
Mama's name no more.

626
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:12,979
No. Well-

627
00:50:13,057 --> 00:50:16,151
Uh, anyway, there's a girl...

628
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:18,752
and there's a dog.

629
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,630
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff!
And there's a tornado-

630
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,965
- Well, no. It's a- In the film, it's a twister.
- Who twister?

631
00:50:26,037 --> 00:50:29,598
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person.
It's like a big-Whoosh!

632
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,767
- Like a storm.
- Like the wet?

633
00:50:31,843 --> 00:50:34,277
Like the wet.

634
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:38,645
Anyway,
the story takes place in a, um-

635
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:41,446
well, a faraway land...

636
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:43,510
called Oz.

637
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:47,047
- This good story.
- Oh, well-

638
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:51,027
- Got song?
- Yes, yes. Lots of songs.

639
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:52,562
I like song.

640
00:50:54,132 --> 00:50:56,123
You sing'em me,
I learn'em song.

641
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,691
No, no, no. No.

642
00:51:00,071 --> 00:51:02,232
No.

643
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:07,436
Well, I- Uh, some.

644
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,844
- I'll sing a little.
- Good.

645
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:14,715
# Somewhere over the, uh-
the rainbow #

646
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,878
- Rainbow Serpent?
- Yes.

647
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,787
That bloody good. Keep going.
You funny singer, but good song.

648
00:51:19,857 --> 00:51:23,224
Oh.
# Somewhere #

649
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:30,360
#There's some birds and they-#

650
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:32,493
- Uh- Oh-
- Keep going. Come on.

651
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:37,598
# Someday I'll wish upon a- a star #

652
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:39,609
#And #

653
00:51:41,112 --> 00:51:43,706
- Come on. Sing more.
- Uh-Yes.

654
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:47,911
#Wake up where the clouds
are far behind #

655
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:51,921
# Dreams really do come #

656
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:55,618
#True ##

657
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:59,686
Oh!

658
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:03,456
Dreaming song.

659
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:06,903
<i>Mrs. Boss...</i>

660
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:10,270
we gotta get those no-good, cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

661
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:13,140
That's right.

662
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:15,577
That's what dreaming songs
tell us, Mrs. Boss.

663
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:19,314
We've got to get those
no-good, big, bloody bulls...

664
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,317
into that metal ship.

665
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:31,517
I'm sorry. I thought he could-
I thought he could do it.

666
00:52:31,596 --> 00:52:35,054
Yeah, well, people don't change,
Miss Ashley.

667
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:47,477
Twister. Twister!

668
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:55,819
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady!
- Well done!

669
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:58,446
<i>Well done, Kipling!</i>

670
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,285
Hey!

671
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:03,088
Flynn Kipling! Yea!

672
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,027
Hey, hey!

673
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:09,123
- Welcome! Welcome!
- <i>Hey, Nullah!</i>

674
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,361
All right.

675
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:14,632
<i>Well, Mr. Drover, I believe</i>
<i>we have the appropriate number.</i>

676
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:17,299
- The appropriate number, huh?
- Yes.

677
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,208
Well, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

678
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:23,770
I run the show.
Everybody does exactly...

679
00:53:23,848 --> 00:53:25,782
as she's told.

680
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,613
- Understood?
- Understood.

681
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,119
No matter your experience
or your age, you pull your weight.

682
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,616
Yes, boss.

683
00:53:35,693 --> 00:53:38,787
And above all,
the Drover's law: no grog.

684
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:41,661
Now...

685
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:44,462
if there's a rush and the cattle
are stampeding towards you...

686
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:47,402
it's not much good prancing
and dancing about on your show pony.

687
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:50,463
There's only one thing cattle fear
more than a man on a horse...

688
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:53,442
and that's a man standing
on his own two feet...

689
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:56,002
staring 'em right between the eyes.

690
00:53:57,448 --> 00:54:00,349
Now, you sure you mob
are still up for it?

691
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:01,510
Mm-hmm.

692
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:06,983
You can count on us.

693
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:09,049
Oh, crikey.

694
00:54:10,428 --> 00:54:13,693
Well, we're what we are.

695
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:16,130
Gotta get to Darwin
before the ship sails.

696
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,191
Let's get cracking.

697
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:20,169
The rest of you jokers follow me.

698
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:22,228
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

699
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:25,298
I'll get the gate.
Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.

700
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:32,714
There, mate. Push 'em over.
Don't let 'em go down there.

701
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:37,581
- That's it.
- Get 'em up!

702
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:40,954
- Whoo!
- <i>Hyah!</i>

703
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:43,152
Get up there!

704
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,738
<i>So we start cracking them whips...</i>

705
00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:01,938
<i>and driving them cheeky bulls</i>
<i>all the way across the land...</i>

706
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:05,973
<i>to that place they call'em Darwin.</i>

707
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:12,752
All right.
We'll push 'em straight across here.

708
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,222
Ho!

709
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:20,085
Very good. Keep 'em movin'.
Nice and steady.

710
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,266
<i> Go on!</i>

711
00:55:24,335 --> 00:55:25,461
- <i>Go on!</i>
- Hyah!

712
00:55:25,536 --> 00:55:26,969
<i>Keep 'em moving.</i>

713
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:31,802
Giddyup! Giddap!

714
00:55:36,414 --> 00:55:39,850
<i> While the war rages on</i>
<i>in Europe, the Japanese are on the march.</i>

715
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:42,477
<i>There are reports of an alliance</i>
<i>between the warmongers...</i>

716
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:45,386
of Germany, Italy and Japan...

717
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:49,449
which threatens to expand World War II
to the shores of Australia.

718
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:52,325
<i>This is a war of the air,</i>
<i>but on the ground...</i>

719
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:55,832
<i>the War Office will announce</i>
<i>who has won the army's contract...</i>

720
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,630
<i>to supply good Aussie beef to the troops.</i>

721
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:01,000
Couple of days
won't make any difference, Captain.

722
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:03,005
Might as well sign
the contract now, eh?

723
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:05,906
I wouldn't be too sure of that,
Mr. Carney.

724
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:11,004
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle,
1,500 head, crossing the Marmont River.

725
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:14,778
Marmont River?
That's Faraway Downs.

726
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:18,913
Are you, uh, running cattle
out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?

727
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:21,014
Uh, no, no.
I don't work there anymore.

728
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:24,458
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving
the cattle herself.

729
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:27,827
Someone must be helping her.

730
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,794
That's right, Neil.
Someone must be helping her.

731
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:47,812
<i>When Mrs. Boss first come to this land...</i>

732
00:56:47,885 --> 00:56:49,819
<i>she look but she not see.</i>

733
00:56:55,593 --> 00:56:59,689
<i>Now she got her eyes open</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

734
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:14,543
<i>Some places got spirits.</i>

735
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,580
<i>White fellas don't know.</i>

736
00:57:17,615 --> 00:57:19,913
<i>Some places no good to go.</i>

737
00:57:33,397 --> 00:57:36,298
You gonna sing'em
them cattle tonight?

738
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:40,804
No, Nullah. Not me.
I'm the orchestra.

739
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:43,635
That's why I always carry this-

740
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:47,768
the famous J. Albert & Son
boomerang harmonica.

741
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:49,779
Can you play that rainbow song?

742
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:56,345
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs
of the hit parade here.

743
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,058
<i>I like that rainbow song.</i>

744
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:12,591
<i>It's all about the dreaming.</i>

745
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,661
<i>Gulapa</i> not teach me that yet.

746
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:16,501
Who's <i>gulapa?</i>

747
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:20,101
He's my grandfather, King George.

748
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:25,505
King George... is your grandfather?

749
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:27,744
<i>He teach me sing a fish song.</i>

750
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:29,752
<i>He teach me sing down fear.</i>

751
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,450
<i>Fear, evil spirit, wild beast.</i>

752
00:58:34,525 --> 00:58:36,823
Gulapa <i>teach me plenty songs.</i>

753
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:39,954
<i>Gulapa</i> teach me
that day down the billabong.

754
00:58:48,973 --> 00:58:51,874
Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?

755
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:54,809
<i>Goolaj and Magarri singing the cattle.</i>

756
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,812
Just keeps them calm at night.

757
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,283
<i>We do it in shifts. Those boys will</i>
<i>finish up in a couple hours. So, Bandy-</i>

758
00:59:01,352 --> 00:59:02,876
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- You show Mrs. Boss...

759
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:05,046
- <i>how it's done, all right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

760
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:08,091
Sing Song, you and me are gonna
serenade 'em till 3:00, and, uh...

761
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:12,026
the safest shift is predawn, so that's
the boy soprano and his orchestra.

762
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:14,621
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up.
- Yes, boss.

763
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:16,689
All right.
Everybody get some shut-eye.

764
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:19,167
Uh, Mr. Drover...

765
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:23,036
I really don't think it's appropriate
to work a child of Nullah's age like that.

766
00:59:23,107 --> 00:59:25,667
<i>Now, I am more than willing</i>
<i>to take his shift.</i>

767
00:59:25,743 --> 00:59:28,473
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough.
- <i>No.</i>

768
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:31,480
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners.
- <i> Oi, oi, oi. Steady on.</i>

769
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:34,483
<i>I'm</i> talking.
Look. Just relax, will ya?

770
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,485
The boy's gotta pull his weight
like everyone else.

771
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,714
When I was his age,
I was manning outstations.

772
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:41,349
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover.
- That's right.

773
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:44,417
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.

774
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,423
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?

775
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:50,194
Yes, boss.

776
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:52,735
- <i>Night, boss.</i>
- 3:00 a. m?

777
00:59:52,803 --> 00:59:55,567
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night.
- Night, Mrs. Boss.

778
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:58,403
Oh. Good night.

779
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:00,500
Good night, Sing Song.

780
01:00:00,577 --> 01:00:02,850
<i>You're on the 12:00 shift.</i>
<i>I suggest you get some sleep.</i>

781
01:00:02,851 --> 01:00:03,842
<i> Night, Bandy.</i>

782
01:00:03,914 --> 01:00:05,882
- <i>Night, Nullah.</i>
- <i> Good night, Flynn.</i>

783
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:08,440
Night, Nullah.

784
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:10,583
<i>Night-night, Jedda.</i>

785
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:32,708
Lord Ashley was killed
by a glass-tipped spear.

786
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,641
Are you sure?

787
01:00:34,712 --> 01:00:36,577
You and me secret.

788
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:17,286
Rush! Rush!

789
01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:24,823
<i>They're heading towards the cliff face!</i>

790
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:26,624
<i>A stampede! Where's Nullah?</i>

791
01:01:26,697 --> 01:01:30,360
Get on your horse
and stay with Goolaj.

792
01:01:30,434 --> 01:01:34,461
<i>Come on. Split up and circle the herd</i>
<i>before they go over the edge!</i>

793
01:01:34,538 --> 01:01:36,870
Sing Song, pack the camp.
Get the hell out of there!

794
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:47,515
<i>Head them off!</i>

795
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:53,549
Don't let them split!

796
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:58,717
Get in the front!

797
01:02:05,803 --> 01:02:08,169
Hyah! Hyah!

798
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:12,197
<i> Good boy! Come on!</i>
<i>Pull them round! Pull them round!</i>

799
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:19,013
Nullah!
You're too close to the edge!

800
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:22,051
<i>Courage, my boy! Courage!</i>

801
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:25,054
Well done, my boy!

802
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:37,923
<i>Nullah!</i>
<i>We have to turn the herd!</i>

803
01:02:47,277 --> 01:02:49,438
Hyah!

804
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:51,447
Hey, hey!

805
01:02:51,515 --> 01:02:54,382
Never fear, Flynn is here!

806
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:58,080
- Yeah, Flynn!
- Hyah!

807
01:03:14,638 --> 01:03:15,866
Flynn!

808
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:30,911
Flynn!

809
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:37,793
Nullah, run!

810
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:17,829
Nullah!

811
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:54,564
<i>Nullah!</i>

812
01:04:54,638 --> 01:04:56,663
<i>Nullah!</i>

813
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,971
Oh! Oh.

814
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:05,040
Oh.

815
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:07,515
It's all right. You're safe.

816
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,053
I've got you.

817
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:13,715
You're safe.

818
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,781
You're safe with me.

819
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:24,890
I'll stay with you.

820
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:40,212
Hey.

821
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:42,979
How's the little fella?

822
01:05:43,053 --> 01:05:45,886
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah.

823
01:05:47,391 --> 01:05:52,886
I have a feeling I might not be able
to complete the next lesson.

824
01:05:58,235 --> 01:06:01,261
Right, old mate.
I'm gonna get you some water, huh?

825
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:06,571
Water's the last thing I want
at this moment in my life.

826
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:11,205
Under the wagon-
a bottle of Poor Fella.

827
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:15,047
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.

828
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:18,884
Of course, mate. Of course.

829
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:22,049
If you'd all share a drop.

830
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:26,124
It would be a terrible shame
to waste it.

831
01:06:31,535 --> 01:06:35,403
The spear- Nullah told me.

832
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:41,068
A glass-tipped spear.

833
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:43,772
Tell milady I'm sorry.

834
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,083
I was a coward.

835
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:36,160
We lost just about everything,
except for a few swags and tins of beef.

836
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:38,167
And this.

837
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:45,202
I can't believe I was so insistent
upon bringing these...

838
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:47,209
silly things.

839
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:51,709
It was Fletcher who did this,
wasn't it?

840
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:56,846
The last thing Flynn told me
before he died was that-

841
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,821
<i>that your husband was killed by a-</i>

842
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:02,051
by a glass-tipped spear...

843
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,923
like the ornamental ones
in the homestead.

844
01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:08,431
<i>Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.</i>

845
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,193
King George is from Arnhem.

846
01:08:10,267 --> 01:08:13,566
<i>Fletcher was trying to make it</i>
<i>look like King George.</i>

847
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:17,368
- Fletcher.
- It can't be proved.

848
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,374
<i>Sorry.</i>

849
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:24,444
Maitland-

850
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:46,462
We can't let them win.

851
01:08:47,938 --> 01:08:49,872
We won't.

852
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:04,786
Get 'em up!

853
01:09:06,156 --> 01:09:08,920
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

854
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:35,773
They pushed on during the night.

855
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:38,742
Maybe that little creamy
has got the blackfella magic.

856
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:39,583
Shut up, Bull!

857
01:09:41,458 --> 01:09:44,950
They're gonna need more than magic
to get 'em to Darwin.

858
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:57,030
Hey, Nullah.

859
01:09:57,107 --> 01:10:00,304
Nullah, after you're done, I need you
to help hobble these horses. All right?

860
01:10:00,377 --> 01:10:02,311
Yes, boss.

861
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:06,808
<i>I never thought I'd see this day.</i>

862
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:10,649
- We're gonna break the Drover's law.
- I plenty old enough too!

863
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,520
Yes, you are, and that is why you
are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.

864
01:10:14,591 --> 01:10:17,219
All right?

865
01:10:17,294 --> 01:10:19,990
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding.
- Good girl, Jedda. Here.

866
01:10:22,432 --> 01:10:24,195
To the memory of the gentleman.

867
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:28,135
- To the gentleman.
- To Flynn!

868
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:45,183
I'd say one more before dinner.

869
01:11:00,937 --> 01:11:02,871
- Let's dance.
- No.

870
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:04,668
- Come on!
- No. No.

871
01:11:04,741 --> 01:11:07,073
Come on. Please?

872
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:09,668
- No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.

873
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:12,340
You put your hands on my shoulders.

874
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,011
And you step back.

875
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:23,584
- Back. No, no.
- Oh, back. Sorry.

876
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,651
- I'm a bad teacher.
- Stop!

877
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:27,890
You don't drink much, do you?

878
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:29,898
No.

879
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:33,959
<i>I'll give it a go. Come on.</i>
<i>I can do it. I can do it. All right?</i>

880
01:12:16,813 --> 01:12:19,577
<i>Now you do wrong-side business?</i>

881
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:21,344
Uh-

882
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:24,182
<i>No, mate. No.</i>
<i>We're just having a dance here.</i>

883
01:12:25,889 --> 01:12:30,019
- <i>Ceremonial dance?</i>
- Uh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.

884
01:12:30,093 --> 01:12:33,756
Fox dance?
You gonna teach me that dance?

885
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,492
- Uh, you're a bit too young for her, mate.
- <i> Nullah!</i>

886
01:12:36,566 --> 01:12:40,662
Get down from that tree now!
Got bad spirits up there.

887
01:12:40,737 --> 01:12:43,205
You're in big trouble.

888
01:12:45,556 --> 01:12:48,635
<i> Come on, Nullah.</i>
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

889
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:51,271
<i>You know better</i>
<i>than to go up in the tree.</i>

890
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:54,475
<i>Have you ever fallen</i>
<i>into wrong-side business?</i>

891
01:12:56,986 --> 01:13:00,217
Uh, yeah.

892
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:03,818
- Oh.
- Yeah. I was married once.

893
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:07,056
- Really?
- Mmm. To a lovely girl.

894
01:13:10,567 --> 01:13:13,559
That was before I went off to war.

895
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:22,210
And what happened?

896
01:13:25,648 --> 01:13:27,809
Well, I marched off
for Mother England...

897
01:13:27,884 --> 01:13:31,752
and by the time I came back,
she was sick...

898
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:34,585
with T.B.

899
01:13:34,657 --> 01:13:39,617
But back then, the hospitals
wouldn't treat, um, blacks.

900
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:48,137
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.

901
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:55,767
Do you have children?

902
01:13:58,648 --> 01:14:01,583
- No.
- Well, that's a shame.

903
01:14:02,685 --> 01:14:05,051
I think you would have
made a great father.

904
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:11,592
- You?
- No.

905
01:14:13,296 --> 01:14:15,856
I can't.

906
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:18,560
Oh.

907
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,262
That's too bad.

908
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:29,909
You would have made a great mother.

909
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:40,021
Well, good night.

910
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:44,216
- Good night.
- Yeah.

911
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:20,125
- Water no good, boss.
- No.

912
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:21,925
Might be Carney boys
already been here, eh?

913
01:15:21,998 --> 01:15:24,660
There has to be water
some other place.

914
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:26,759
- Next bore is five days.
- There has to be water.

915
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:29,100
You can be sure Fletcher
will have been there as well.

916
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:33,342
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>
- What?

917
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:37,277
There's water three days' ride away.

918
01:15:37,347 --> 01:15:39,474
<i>We'd have to cross the Kuraman.</i>

919
01:15:39,549 --> 01:15:43,918
<i>The Kuraman?</i>
<i>That's Never-Never Land. No.</i>

920
01:15:43,987 --> 01:15:47,013
- We've got to try.
- We can't.

921
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,354
- We've got to try.
- No one has drove the Never-Never.

922
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:51,825
There's nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.

923
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:55,796
You get caught out there,
you're gonna lose more than your cattle.

924
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:02,900
I'm sorry.

925
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:06,708
Boss!

926
01:16:06,776 --> 01:16:08,710
<i>Look!</i>

927
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,534
<i>He a wizard.</i>
<i>He gonna sing for us.</i>

928
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:45,277
Sing?

929
01:16:45,348 --> 01:16:48,181
He can find his way anywhere.

930
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:51,687
<i>The ancestors created songs for everything.</i>

931
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:54,723
<i>For every rock and tree.</i>

932
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:59,023
<i>They're all linked,</i>
<i>so when</i> gulapa, <i>the magic man...</i>

933
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:02,758
<i>sings them in order, he'll sing us to water.</i>

934
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:04,959
<i>Even across the Never-Never.</i>

935
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:17,610
<i>And we went on for three days.</i>

936
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:22,846
<i>Every day drier-hotter.</i>

937
01:17:22,919 --> 01:17:25,251
<i>All that dead land.</i>

938
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,313
<i>Then come that big dust storm.</i>

939
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:35,594
Keep driving into the wind!

940
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,825
<i>Nullah, stay close to me!</i>

941
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:44,305
<i> Them cattle stop moving.</i>
<i>Magarri and Goolaj stop moving.</i>

942
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:46,534
<i>We all stop moving.</i>

943
01:17:49,946 --> 01:17:52,847
I'm <i>gulapa.</i>

944
01:17:52,915 --> 01:17:56,476
I magic man. I wizard man.

945
01:18:10,366 --> 01:18:12,926
<i> Dead. All of them.</i>
<i>That's what he said.</i>

946
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:15,994
<i>The pilot swooped down</i>
<i>to get a closer look.</i>

947
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:19,405
Dead as doorposts they were.

948
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:23,036
- It's a real tragedy.
- How terrible!

949
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:25,103
<i>And on the eve of the ball too.</i>

950
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:27,547
What were they doing in the Kuraman?

951
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:31,120
<i>Nothing personal, Captain...</i>

952
01:18:31,187 --> 01:18:35,681
but I got a business to run,
and you got an army to feed.

953
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:38,124
So let's not muck about.

954
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:44,730
I suppose it's not a real war
unless someone's making a profit.

955
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:50,300
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil?
- Yeah, we're right to go.

956
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:54,332
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's
gonna put pen to paper.

957
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:58,506
All hail the king. Yeah.

958
01:19:10,326 --> 01:19:13,056
<i> Where'd he come from?</i>

959
01:19:13,129 --> 01:19:15,495
Oh, look.

960
01:19:15,565 --> 01:19:18,932
Hello, little sweetie.

961
01:19:41,524 --> 01:19:44,357
What the bloody hell is that?

962
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:55,864
Gentlemen!

963
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,768
I'm Sarah Ashley,
owner of Faraway Downs.

964
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:05,712
<i>We are making delivery of 1,500 head</i>
<i>of prime F.D. branded shorthorns.</i>

965
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:08,443
<i>We will require a holding yard.</i>

966
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:11,077
- We're full.
- Says who?

967
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:14,554
- The owner.
- You must be Mr. Carney.

968
01:20:14,624 --> 01:20:16,854
Too right, love.

969
01:20:18,394 --> 01:20:20,419
<i>Lady Ashley, I'm Emmett Dutton.</i>

970
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:22,487
I'm the officer in charge
of livestock purchases.

971
01:20:22,565 --> 01:20:27,468
We will accept 20% less than what
the Carney Cattle Company is asking.

972
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:31,165
No can do, love.
You're late. The contract's signed.

973
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:35,074
This contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.

974
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:40,349
Load the bloody cattle now!

975
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,074
We've got to load the cattle
on the ship before Carney.

976
01:20:43,152 --> 01:20:45,985
- Get off your backsides!
- You drive 'em straight down the wharf.

977
01:20:46,055 --> 01:20:48,990
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle
in the yard.

978
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:54,490
Load the bloody cattle now!

979
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:58,998
- Drover!
- Hyah!

980
01:21:02,505 --> 01:21:04,632
Load!

981
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,205
You blokes, load!

982
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:16,044
Hyah!

983
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:19,144
Hey, Bull!
Open the bloody crush!

984
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,019
Come on!
Close that flamin' gate!

985
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:39,368
You missed the boat, sunshine.

986
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:42,741
<i>Yeah. Good luck, Drover, you drongo!</i>

987
01:21:42,812 --> 01:21:44,803
Over here, Drover.

988
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,059
Hyah!

989
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:17,002
<i>Drover!</i>

990
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:19,809
Push 'em straight down the wharf!

991
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:24,843
Hah!

992
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,219
Hyah!

993
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,964
Hyah!

994
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:41,562
<i>Hyah!</i>

995
01:22:43,806 --> 01:22:47,105
<i> There are cattle being</i>
<i>driven down the wharf.</i>

996
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,906
My husband must have
a problem with the loading.

997
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:53,278
<i>They're not Carney cattle.</i>

998
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:57,985
- Mmm?
- It's Lady Ashley.

999
01:23:00,623 --> 01:23:02,557
Get out of the way!

1000
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:05,093
<i>Looks like, uh,</i>
<i>we've got a bit of competition...</i>

1001
01:23:05,161 --> 01:23:07,721
back in the meat business.

1002
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:19,338
Now that's it!

1003
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:22,138
Hyah! Ho!

1004
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:32,744
Ho! Push them up!

1005
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,951
- Hyah!
- Cheeky bulls down the wharf!

1006
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:41,656
Cheeky bulls down the wharf,
Mrs. Boss!

1007
01:24:07,022 --> 01:24:09,889
- Hyah!
- <i>Get him down the wharf. That's it, Nullah.</i>

1008
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:13,053
<i>Get him up, Nullah.</i>

1009
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:16,360
I got the last big, bloody, cheeky bull
in the big, bloody metal ship.

1010
01:24:16,432 --> 01:24:18,229
All right!

1011
01:24:19,335 --> 01:24:22,702
<i>Yea! Yea!</i>

1012
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:29,903
Lady coming through.
There's a lady coming through.

1013
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:36,347
Two Poor Fella rums, Ivan.

1014
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:39,080
Shut up!

1015
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:42,147
No women.
Ladies' lounge next door.

1016
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:49,164
<i>She's no lady, Ivan. She just drove</i>
<i>a mob of cattle across the Never-Never.</i>

1017
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:52,530
She deserves a drink like any man.

1018
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,001
Too bloody right.

1019
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:57,937
Too bloody right.

1020
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:11,545
I never drink Poor Fella alone.

1021
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:21,722
Crikey!

1022
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:23,924
<i>One, two, three!</i>

1023
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:27,867
<i># Where's that jolly jumbuck</i>
<i>you've got in your tucker bag #

1024
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:30,997
<i># You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me ##</i>

1025
01:25:31,073 --> 01:25:34,236
I didn't want to see a single beast
from Faraway Downs...

1026
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:37,279
set a hoof on that wharf, Neil.

1027
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:40,474
But that's what happens
when you send a boy to do a man's job.

1028
01:25:40,549 --> 01:25:43,143
Now, find out if she's going
to the ball tomorrow night.

1029
01:25:43,219 --> 01:25:45,210
I'll take care of it myself.

1030
01:25:57,233 --> 01:26:01,067
<i>So everybody get what they want.</i>

1031
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:03,127
<i>Everybody happy.</i>

1032
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:06,538
<i>Mrs. Boss is gonna sell Faraway Downs...</i>

1033
01:26:06,609 --> 01:26:09,407
<i>and go back to England.</i>

1034
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:11,412
Shh.

1035
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,141
That's it. Good girl.

1036
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:16,651
<i>Drover, he get'em that horse,</i>
<i>Capricornia.</i>

1037
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,653
That's it. Good girl.

1038
01:26:18,721 --> 01:26:22,157
<i>Everybody happy, except for me.</i>

1039
01:26:24,994 --> 01:26:27,485
<i>'Cause I not white fella.</i>

1040
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,793
<i>I not blackfella either.</i>

1041
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,856
<i>Me half-caste.</i>

1042
01:26:33,202 --> 01:26:35,796
<i>Creamy.</i>

1043
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:37,964
<i>Me belong no one.</i>

1044
01:26:48,017 --> 01:26:50,383
Good girl.

1045
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:54,149
<i>Back, back, back. Back. Good.</i>

1046
01:26:56,125 --> 01:27:01,563
<i>Easy, easy. Good, good. That's it.</i>

1047
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:09,537
That's a good girl. That's it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1048
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:13,706
You really do have a gift with horses.

1049
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:18,377
Up. Up.

1050
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:22,341
You look different.

1051
01:27:22,418 --> 01:27:27,117
I've agreed to be patroness at the ball
at Government House tomorrow night.

1052
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:29,157
Yeah? And?

1053
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:33,661
Drover, I-

1054
01:27:33,729 --> 01:27:36,163
I'm going to finish
what Maitland set out to do...

1055
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:40,031
and I am going to bring
Faraway Downs back to life.

1056
01:27:40,102 --> 01:27:42,070
I don't follow you.

1057
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:44,332
Well, this is perfect.
I'm going to need a manager.

1058
01:27:46,775 --> 01:27:50,267
Well, I thought that...

1059
01:27:50,346 --> 01:27:53,338
it would be a good job for you.

1060
01:27:56,352 --> 01:27:58,877
Anyway, I almost forgot something.
I got a suit for you.

1061
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:02,014
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Don't do that.
- Do what?

1062
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:04,423
The thing you do
when you get a head full of ideas.

1063
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:07,394
- Like crossing the Kuraman?
- <i>Come on, mate.</i>

1064
01:28:07,463 --> 01:28:11,797
You don't know what you're talking about.
Running a station? Manager?

1065
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:15,132
I'm a drover. All right?
No man hires me, no man fires me.

1066
01:28:17,206 --> 01:28:19,800
- So you don't want to go to the ball?
- Ball?

1067
01:28:22,444 --> 01:28:24,378
Sarah.

1068
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:28,980
I'm as good as black to that mob up there.

1069
01:28:29,051 --> 01:28:33,317
I mix with dingoes, not- not duchesses.

1070
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:39,386
They keep out of my way,
and I keep out of theirs.

1071
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:41,452
That's the way it is.

1072
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:45,364
Just because it is
doesn't mean it should be.

1073
01:28:51,774 --> 01:28:53,765
But that's the way it is.

1074
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:06,420
<i>Cheer up, little fella.</i>

1075
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:09,753
You and that Chinaman gonna take me out
on a big night at the pictures.

1076
01:29:09,825 --> 01:29:11,759
How?

1077
01:29:11,827 --> 01:29:14,352
<i>You can't take half-caste</i>
<i>to picture show.</i>

1078
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:18,799
- Coppers take him!
- He won't be half-caste.

1079
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:21,927
He got every right to be there.

1080
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:25,029
We use magic.

1081
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:28,972
You got every right to be there.

1082
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:36,480
'Cause you're a special boy.

1083
01:29:36,552 --> 01:29:38,884
He's a special boy.

1084
01:29:38,954 --> 01:29:42,685
<i>Nobody gonna stop you</i>
<i>from going. Nobody.</i>

1085
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:45,386
<i># Somewhere #

1086
01:29:45,461 --> 01:29:48,794
# Over the rainbow #

1087
01:29:48,864 --> 01:29:53,858
#Way up high #

1088
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:59,067
<i># There's a land that I heard of#</i>

1089
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:02,304
<i># Once in a lullaby #

1090
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:10,711
# Somewhere over the rainbow #

1091
01:30:10,786 --> 01:30:14,586
# Skies are blue #

1092
01:30:15,891 --> 01:30:18,587
<i># And the dreams #

1093
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,652
<i># That you dare to dream #

1094
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:26,667
<i># Really do come true ##</i>

1095
01:30:31,907 --> 01:30:33,932
<i>How good of you, Lady Ashley...</i>

1096
01:30:34,009 --> 01:30:37,274
to take an interest
in Dr. Barker's work on the mission.

1097
01:30:37,346 --> 01:30:41,077
Well, actually, Administrator,
my interest is of a more personal nature.

1098
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:43,674
I must say, Lady Ashley-

1099
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:46,220
- Smashing.
- Would you excuse me?

1100
01:30:46,288 --> 01:30:48,882
Amongst the leading lights of Darwin.

1101
01:30:48,957 --> 01:30:51,858
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to Dr. Barker.

1102
01:30:51,927 --> 01:30:53,918
- Sarah?
- Ah, Captain Dutton.

1103
01:30:53,996 --> 01:30:57,397
Lady Ashley, I'll leave you
in the capable hands of the captain.

1104
01:30:57,466 --> 01:31:00,697
I'm sure he would be happy
to introduce you to Dr. Barker.

1105
01:31:00,769 --> 01:31:03,329
- I want to talk to you.
- Her husband barely in the grave...

1106
01:31:03,405 --> 01:31:05,430
and there she is
cavorting with the captain.

1107
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,498
- His mother has passed away.
- And that dress.

1108
01:31:07,576 --> 01:31:10,306
Yes.
Bidding should go through the roof.

1109
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:13,246
He is a little boy.
He needs someone to look after him.

1110
01:31:13,315 --> 01:31:15,749
- Sarah-
- I'm desperate to speak to Dr. Barker.

1111
01:31:15,817 --> 01:31:19,275
I'm going to adopt him. It's only a matter
of time before they take him away.

1112
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:22,687
Adopting an Aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize.

1113
01:31:22,758 --> 01:31:26,489
Neil! Come on.
I want to talk with Lady Ashley.

1114
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:28,723
Yeah. No. We will later, love.

1115
01:31:28,797 --> 01:31:32,198
I don't mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight. I won't be jealous.

1116
01:31:32,267 --> 01:31:36,431
- She's an inspiration.
- Yeah, she's full of surprises.

1117
01:31:36,505 --> 01:31:39,531
But surely, Doctor, life on the station
with people who care for these children...

1118
01:31:39,608 --> 01:31:42,304
is far better than life
on a government institution.

1119
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:44,777
Oh. The auction.

1120
01:31:44,846 --> 01:31:47,974
Our gracious patroness, Lady Ashley!

1121
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,109
<i>Bravo!</i>

1122
01:31:50,185 --> 01:31:52,176
<i>Now, for the auction of the first dance-</i>

1123
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:56,691
The mixed-race children must be dislocated
from the primitive, full-blood Aborigine.

1124
01:31:56,758 --> 01:32:00,319
- Do I hear a first bid? Please.
- Five pounds here.

1125
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:03,262
- <i>Five pounds! </i>
- How else are we to breed the black out of them?

1126
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:07,428
I bid more than that for a dance with Mrs. Allsop!
Remember, it's for the mission.

1127
01:32:07,502 --> 01:32:10,938
Has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this?

1128
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,975
- Lady Ashley, please.
- For the war effort, do I hear 20 pounds?

1129
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:17,842
It's a fact of science that the Aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring.

1130
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:21,872
- Fifty pounds!
- <i>Fifty pounds!</i>

1131
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:24,111
- Seventy pounds!
- Ninety-five!

1132
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:27,314
No mother forgets her child, Dr. Barker.

1133
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:30,449
- Lady Ashley!
- This is most inappropriate.

1134
01:32:30,525 --> 01:32:32,686
100!

1135
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:36,857
- That is a new record.
- We can't very well ask their fathers, can we?

1136
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:39,730
- How dare you?
- Going once!

1137
01:32:39,801 --> 01:32:43,134
- Or perhaps we should.
- Going twice!

1138
01:32:43,205 --> 01:32:45,469
- <i>After all, they're right here in this room.</i>
- That's a lie!

1139
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,236
<i>500 quid!</i>

1140
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,380
<i>500 pounds!</i>

1141
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,145
<i>Well, indeed.</i>

1142
01:32:57,219 --> 01:32:59,153
If it isn't the man who-

1143
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:01,746
<i>almost single-handedly...</i>

1144
01:33:01,823 --> 01:33:04,189
<i>made the Australian beef industry...</i>

1145
01:33:04,259 --> 01:33:07,422
<i>what it is today.</i>

1146
01:33:07,496 --> 01:33:11,762
<i>Mr. King Carney</i>
<i>of the Carney Cattle Company.</i>

1147
01:33:15,937 --> 01:33:19,168
For the benefit of the missions.

1148
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:26,072
<i>Well, there's nothing more to say...</i>

1149
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:28,946
but let the king take his prize.

1150
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:38,421
- <i>Can I get a picture, please? Smile.</i>
- Ah.

1151
01:33:43,732 --> 01:33:46,166
Let me say, Lady Ashley,
just how sorry I was...

1152
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:48,668
to hear of your husband's death...

1153
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:51,262
at the hands of that wild savage.

1154
01:33:51,339 --> 01:33:53,273
A savage, yes, Mr. Carney...

1155
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:58,244
but you and I both know that my husband
was not killed by an Aborigine.

1156
01:33:58,313 --> 01:34:00,372
No, I did not know that.

1157
01:34:00,449 --> 01:34:03,145
Perhaps you should ask Mr. Fletcher.

1158
01:34:05,487 --> 01:34:09,287
- Are you making an accusation?
- Not one I can prove.

1159
01:34:09,357 --> 01:34:12,554
In business, I've been fortunate.

1160
01:34:12,627 --> 01:34:15,221
<i>In family, a little less so.</i>

1161
01:34:15,297 --> 01:34:18,994
I'm prepared to go to 75,000 pounds.

1162
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:22,127
This is not about the money, Mr. Carney.
There is a little boy.

1163
01:34:22,204 --> 01:34:24,570
There is a-

1164
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,507
There are people who are living-
living on the station...

1165
01:34:28,577 --> 01:34:30,568
for whom I am responsible.

1166
01:34:30,645 --> 01:34:32,510
And who will take care of them?

1167
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:36,278
A cattle station is like a country.

1168
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:39,912
And you have no one to look after it.

1169
01:34:39,988 --> 01:34:42,320
Now, I can offer protection...

1170
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:47,089
to every man, woman and child.

1171
01:34:47,162 --> 01:34:49,096
And child?

1172
01:34:50,766 --> 01:34:52,996
You will do that?

1173
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:56,526
How can I keep you at your word?

1174
01:34:56,605 --> 01:34:59,665
I'll put it in the contract.

1175
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:02,801
<i> King Carney and Lady Ashley.</i>
<i>That was a marvelous treat.</i>

1176
01:35:05,213 --> 01:35:09,445
<i>No one can close a deal</i>
<i>more quickly than King Carney.</i>

1177
01:35:10,519 --> 01:35:13,386
<i>Now, the raffle for the war effort.</i>

1178
01:35:13,455 --> 01:35:16,049
The last flying boat...

1179
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:18,718
leaves tomorrow because of the war.

1180
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:28,994
Will I tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract?

1181
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:34,064
<i>But the true blue Australian man</i>
<i>like King Carney is-</i>

1182
01:35:45,187 --> 01:35:47,155
Inform your lawyer-

1183
01:35:47,222 --> 01:35:48,655
Uh-

1184
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:11,508
<i>Inform your lawyer that Faraway Downs</i>
<i>is no longer for sale.</i>

1185
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:21,922
Fox-trot!

1186
01:36:55,323 --> 01:36:57,416
Here you are.

1187
01:36:57,492 --> 01:37:01,155
Well, you didn't think I was gonna
waste my dance lesson, did you?

1188
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,130
Let's really give the bastards
something to talk about, huh?

1189
01:37:07,202 --> 01:37:10,501
Oh, crikey.

1190
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:15,334
She's invited that man.

1191
01:37:16,378 --> 01:37:18,608
- Hey, Doris.
- Get you a drink, Drover?

1192
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,615
Beer would be good.
Hello, love. Nice dress.

1193
01:37:33,295 --> 01:37:35,559
- All right.
- Fox dance?

1194
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,621
- Fox dance.
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:42,200
- Back. Back.
- Step.

1196
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,204
- Step.
- Sorry.

1197
01:38:06,962 --> 01:38:08,953
Let's clear out of here.

1198
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:28,678
- There it is. First storm of the wet.
- Ahh.

1199
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:32,576
What's it like?

1200
01:38:32,654 --> 01:38:34,212
It's beautiful.

1201
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:36,257
There's millions of birds.

1202
01:38:36,324 --> 01:38:40,658
Creeks turn into rivers,
dry plains into lakes.

1203
01:38:40,729 --> 01:38:44,426
Faraway Downs
will be reborn as an island-

1204
01:38:44,499 --> 01:38:46,660
green and flowering
and fat with life.

1205
01:38:46,735 --> 01:38:48,896
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Quick, quick, quick!

1206
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:51,461
We'll be cut off
from the rest of the world!

1207
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:55,407
- Sarah.
- Mm-hmm?

1208
01:38:55,477 --> 01:38:58,412
In the dry- I'll be gone, droving.

1209
01:39:08,289 --> 01:39:10,814
But right now it's raining.

1210
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:33,480
<i>Can you help me?
Can you help me?</i>

1211
01:39:33,548 --> 01:39:35,607
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be helped any longer.</i>

1212
01:39:35,683 --> 01:39:38,932
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1213
01:39:38,933 --> 01:39:39,517
I have?

1214
01:39:39,587 --> 01:39:41,555
But why didn't you tell her before?

1215
01:39:41,623 --> 01:39:43,614
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

1216
01:39:44,993 --> 01:39:47,052
My darling Cath!

1217
01:39:47,128 --> 01:39:49,756
Daddy!

1218
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:11,118
Hey, Drover.

1219
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:36,510
Maitland Ashley met his death...

1220
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:40,275
at the hands of a wild savage, did he?

1221
01:40:40,348 --> 01:40:43,545
You're not part of any plan
concerning this family.

1222
01:40:43,618 --> 01:40:45,609
Nothing's in your name...

1223
01:40:45,687 --> 01:40:49,817
and if anything should happen to
my darling Cath, you lose everything.

1224
01:41:00,568 --> 01:41:04,231
There's no place like home.

1225
01:42:41,869 --> 01:42:45,464
<i>Just like Drover say,</i>
<i>that rain make everything come alive.</i>

1226
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:49,201
<i>That land, it grow green and fat...</i>

1227
01:42:49,277 --> 01:42:52,678
<i>and we all go back to Faraway Downs.</i>

1228
01:42:53,982 --> 01:42:56,974
<i>Mrs. Boss happy. Drover happy.</i>

1229
01:42:57,051 --> 01:43:00,111
<i>Even that copper Callahan happy.</i>

1230
01:43:00,188 --> 01:43:02,782
<i>Mrs. Boss say he likes her tea so much...</i>

1231
01:43:02,857 --> 01:43:06,122
<i>it gives him a blind eye-</i>

1232
01:43:06,194 --> 01:43:08,458
<i>make me invisible, keep me safe.</i>

1233
01:43:10,465 --> 01:43:12,456
<i>I hear for the first time...</i>

1234
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:14,763
<i>that thing called...</i>

1235
01:43:14,836 --> 01:43:17,100
<i>Christmas.</i>

1236
01:43:27,215 --> 01:43:30,309
<i>Then the rain, it stops.</i>

1237
01:43:31,886 --> 01:43:35,822
<i>And that Drover, he go droving.</i>

1238
01:43:38,459 --> 01:43:42,418
<i>That Mrs. Boss,</i>
<i>she always misses Drover.</i>

1239
01:43:42,497 --> 01:43:45,660
<i>But I know he's gonna come back.</i>

1240
01:43:54,876 --> 01:43:56,867
Whoo! Yeah!

1241
01:44:01,449 --> 01:44:03,679
<i> King George</i>
<i>tell me you gotta be looking out.</i>

1242
01:44:03,751 --> 01:44:08,313
<i>'Cause that croc,</i>
<i>he always watching, he always waiting.</i>

1243
01:44:28,776 --> 01:44:30,835
Hah! Get up!

1244
01:44:38,519 --> 01:44:41,079
<i>That Fletcher, he the new king now.</i>

1245
01:44:50,965 --> 01:44:55,299
Emmett, why didn't you radio?
I'm so glad you're here.

1246
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,133
Would you get some tea, Bandy?

1247
01:45:01,209 --> 01:45:03,541
<i>Geez, you done the place up nice.</i>

1248
01:45:03,611 --> 01:45:06,808
I hope you don't mind.
Bandy let me in.

1249
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:11,585
My father would have been proud.

1250
01:45:11,652 --> 01:45:13,586
It's bloody beautiful.

1251
01:45:13,654 --> 01:45:17,488
<i>Geez, I bet you got all the mod cons.</i>

1252
01:45:17,558 --> 01:45:19,958
What do you want?

1253
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:25,566
What I've always wanted-
Faraway Downs.

1254
01:45:25,633 --> 01:45:27,567
Bandy, call the men.

1255
01:45:27,635 --> 01:45:29,762
Bunchemup, Mr. Fletcher needs
to be escorted off the property-

1256
01:45:29,837 --> 01:45:32,431
Callahan won't be having
any more cups of tea.

1257
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,767
I will though. Cup of tea.

1258
01:45:35,843 --> 01:45:39,244
<i>Thanks, Bandy.</i>
<i>You know how I like it. Yeah.</i>

1259
01:45:40,348 --> 01:45:43,078
It's all right, Bandy.

1260
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:45,517
<i>You know, these days,</i>
<i>I can pull a few strings.</i>

1261
01:45:45,586 --> 01:45:48,282
I can probably bring your creamy in,
if you like.

1262
01:45:48,356 --> 01:45:52,258
Or... I can talk to Dr. Barker
and get you guardianship.

1263
01:45:52,326 --> 01:45:54,954
- I will never sell you my land.
- <i>Your land?</i>

1264
01:45:55,029 --> 01:45:57,896
My family worked this property
for three generations.

1265
01:45:57,965 --> 01:46:00,456
My father died
making people like you rich.

1266
01:46:00,535 --> 01:46:02,765
<i>Faraway Downs belongs to me.</i>

1267
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:09,508
Just like... you believe
the little creamy belongs to you.

1268
01:46:10,912 --> 01:46:13,142
<i>I'll pay you what it's worth.</i>

1269
01:46:13,214 --> 01:46:16,980
Can use the money, go south,
get the little one an education.

1270
01:46:17,051 --> 01:46:19,519
I'll go to the highest levels
of government, to the High Court.

1271
01:46:19,587 --> 01:46:21,521
Beyond this country, if I have to.

1272
01:46:21,589 --> 01:46:23,784
An unmarried woman,
living with the likes of the Drover?

1273
01:46:23,858 --> 01:46:28,022
I will tell your wife he is your son!

1274
01:46:28,095 --> 01:46:30,962
That would be a mistake.

1275
01:46:34,802 --> 01:46:36,736
Kimberley spear.

1276
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:41,173
Glass-tipped.

1277
01:46:42,643 --> 01:46:44,941
Real collector's items.

1278
01:46:46,614 --> 01:46:50,812
<i>Oh! You're missing one.</i>

1279
01:46:50,885 --> 01:46:54,480
<i>Anyway, I was just out here,</i>
<i>checking on all the properties.</i>

1280
01:46:54,555 --> 01:46:57,820
Might do a little
buffalo hunting later. Yeah.

1281
01:46:57,892 --> 01:47:00,122
Oh.

1282
01:47:00,194 --> 01:47:03,129
Did you hear about the king?

1283
01:47:03,197 --> 01:47:06,496
Terrible accident. Yeah.

1284
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:08,660
<i>Very dangerous place out here,</i>
<i>even for locals...</i>

1285
01:47:08,736 --> 01:47:10,829
<i>like the Drover and the little creamy.</i>

1286
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:13,169
<i>You with me?</i>

1287
01:47:13,241 --> 01:47:15,266
Anyway...

1288
01:47:15,343 --> 01:47:18,369
you ought to think about it, Lady Ashley.

1289
01:47:18,446 --> 01:47:22,280
After all, pride's not power.

1290
01:47:30,057 --> 01:47:32,355
The Drover mustn't know.

1291
01:47:33,461 --> 01:47:36,191
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

1292
01:47:36,264 --> 01:47:39,392
Drover! It's the Drover!

1293
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:48,975
Hey! Yah!

1294
01:48:04,058 --> 01:48:06,117
Come on, you two! Wake up!

1295
01:48:06,193 --> 01:48:08,491
Come on!

1296
01:48:08,563 --> 01:48:11,464
- Come on. Wake up! We got brumbies to break.
- All right, all right.

1297
01:48:23,844 --> 01:48:28,440
Yeah, break him. Ride that brumby!
Ride him! Ride him!

1298
01:48:28,516 --> 01:48:33,920
Yea, Drover! Ride him!
Yeah, Drover! Drover!

1299
01:48:35,823 --> 01:48:38,621
- You a man, Drover?
- Yeah, I try to be.

1300
01:48:38,693 --> 01:48:41,253
Sometimes man
got to get away from woman.

1301
01:48:41,329 --> 01:48:43,263
Maybe.

1302
01:48:43,331 --> 01:48:46,459
- That's why you go droving.
- I go droving 'cause that's my job.

1303
01:48:46,534 --> 01:48:49,435
If you don't go droving,
you not a man.

1304
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,974
All right, boys. That'll do.

1305
01:48:55,042 --> 01:48:56,976
Bring 'em down
to the back paddock, will you?

1306
01:48:57,044 --> 01:48:59,103
King George tell me
I gotta go walkabout.

1307
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:03,378
If I a man, I gotta go walkabout.
Learn'em be a man.

1308
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:06,819
Yeah.

1309
01:49:06,887 --> 01:49:10,118
Listen, it's up to Mrs. Boss
what you do, all right?

1310
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:12,989
<i> Come on inside, boys.</i>
<i>It's time for dinner.</i>

1311
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:15,324
<i>I'm coming. Jedda, come on!</i>

1312
01:49:15,396 --> 01:49:17,387
Come on, Jedda.

1313
01:49:22,136 --> 01:49:25,435
<i>One day, Captain Dutton came and visit us.</i>

1314
01:49:25,506 --> 01:49:28,771
<i>He tell Drover</i>
<i>about the big army drove.</i>

1315
01:49:28,843 --> 01:49:29,724
<i>## </i>

1316
01:49:29,725 --> 01:49:31,971
And we need
the best stockmen possible.

1317
01:49:32,046 --> 01:49:35,345
- It may take six months or so.
- Overland.

1318
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:38,214
Absolutely not. You just got back.

1319
01:49:46,227 --> 01:49:48,752
What's wrong?

1320
01:49:48,829 --> 01:49:52,094
I'm just not used to people
making decisions for me. That's all.

1321
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:55,567
<i>I was just expressing an opinion.</i>

1322
01:49:55,636 --> 01:49:58,537
Captain Dutton was telling me about
this wonderful School of the Air.

1323
01:49:58,606 --> 01:50:01,734
It's conducted all across the country.

1324
01:50:01,809 --> 01:50:04,573
He wants to go walkabout
with King George.

1325
01:50:04,645 --> 01:50:07,671
That's ridiculous.
He's a little boy. It's not safe.

1326
01:50:07,748 --> 01:50:11,878
<i>He'd be safer in Arnhem Land than</i>
<i>he would be hanging around here.</i>

1327
01:50:11,952 --> 01:50:14,443
- I thought you said-
- <i>You can't change him, Sarah.</i>

1328
01:50:16,123 --> 01:50:18,455
I thought you said
it had nothing to do with you.

1329
01:50:18,526 --> 01:50:20,585
It doesn't.

1330
01:50:20,661 --> 01:50:24,427
<i>It's just sooner or later,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to let that boy go.</i>

1331
01:50:26,767 --> 01:50:29,031
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

1332
01:50:29,103 --> 01:50:32,732
<i>If he doesn't go through ceremony,</i>
<i>he'll have no country.</i>

1333
01:50:32,807 --> 01:50:35,435
He'll have no story, no dreaming.

1334
01:50:37,144 --> 01:50:39,135
And he'll be all alone.

1335
01:50:43,084 --> 01:50:45,575
<i>This big army drove-</i>

1336
01:50:45,653 --> 01:50:48,713
- Let's have dinner, shall we?
- <i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

1337
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:53,013
Time to go walkabout, Mrs. Boss.

1338
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:57,850
- You belong here.
- No, Mrs. Boss.

1339
01:52:33,427 --> 01:52:36,658
<i>Sarah, I gotta go.</i>

1340
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:38,664
Sarah!

1341
01:52:40,134 --> 01:52:42,068
<i>Drover!</i>

1342
01:52:43,437 --> 01:52:45,905
Drover!

1343
01:52:48,642 --> 01:52:50,906
He's not down at the billabong!

1344
01:52:50,978 --> 01:52:52,476
Then he's gone walkabout.

1345
01:52:52,477 --> 01:52:55,711
He wouldn't have just left
without saying good-bye.

1346
01:52:55,783 --> 01:52:58,684
Get the pack horse ready.
We're going up to Punctuation Point.

1347
01:52:58,752 --> 01:53:00,686
- Sing Song?
- <i>Yes?</i>

1348
01:53:00,754 --> 01:53:03,450
- Tin food. We're going after him.
- You're not listening.

1349
01:53:03,524 --> 01:53:06,322
- What?
- <i>Sarah, he's gone on walkabout!</i>

1350
01:53:06,393 --> 01:53:08,224
Oh, come on, Drover.
He is a child.

1351
01:53:08,295 --> 01:53:12,755
Well, he's not our child!
He's an Aboriginal child! He's gone walkabout!

1352
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,063
- Bandy!
- <i>The next time you see him...</i>

1353
01:53:15,135 --> 01:53:17,126
will be when he wants to see you.

1354
01:53:17,204 --> 01:53:19,798
He'll be halfway to Arnhem Land by now.
You'll never find him.

1355
01:53:19,874 --> 01:53:22,775
You could find him.
You know that land better than anyone.

1356
01:53:22,843 --> 01:53:25,107
- You and Magarri can find him.
- <i>And do what, huh?</i>

1357
01:53:25,179 --> 01:53:28,239
<i>Bring him back here and lock him up?</i>
<i>You could start your own mission.</i>

1358
01:53:28,315 --> 01:53:31,773
Oh! You're just trying to be clever
because you don't want to be responsible.

1359
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:33,615
He's not my son!

1360
01:53:36,257 --> 01:53:38,191
What did you say?

1361
01:53:41,028 --> 01:53:44,259
- I better go.
- <i>Don't leave! Drover, don't.</i>

1362
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:47,991
I understood when you said
you had to be free.

1363
01:53:48,068 --> 01:53:52,368
I understood that,
but that was between you and me.

1364
01:53:52,439 --> 01:53:54,669
<i>But it's different now.</i>

1365
01:53:54,742 --> 01:53:56,903
We've got Nullah.

1366
01:53:58,412 --> 01:54:00,346
- I gotta go.
- I need you to stay.

1367
01:54:00,414 --> 01:54:03,247
- I'll be back in six months.
- I need you to stay with me!

1368
01:54:03,317 --> 01:54:05,444
And if you can't do that, then I-

1369
01:54:05,519 --> 01:54:08,113
I would prefer it if you didn't return.

1370
01:54:12,693 --> 01:54:14,661
All right.

1371
01:54:14,728 --> 01:54:16,662
You're the boss.

1372
01:54:20,567 --> 01:54:23,365
Drover.

1373
01:54:34,214 --> 01:54:37,183
<i>I can feel them bad spirits coming...</i>

1374
01:54:37,251 --> 01:54:40,186
<i>so I chase after that King George.</i>

1375
01:54:40,254 --> 01:54:43,883
<i>But that Callahan,</i>
<i>he been stopped drinking Mrs. Boss's tea.</i>

1376
01:54:48,963 --> 01:54:52,956
<i>He lose his blind eye,</i>
<i>and I not invisible anymore.</i>

1377
01:54:59,606 --> 01:55:01,938
Jedda!

1378
01:55:03,978 --> 01:55:06,503
Fletcher,
we've apprehended that young'un.

1379
01:55:07,247 --> 01:55:12,378
<i>And in the course of our duties, we arrested</i>
<i>the suspected murderer of Lord Ashley.</i>

1380
01:55:12,453 --> 01:55:14,045
<i>King George.</i>

1381
01:55:21,061 --> 01:55:24,030
No!

1382
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:28,197
You finally lifted the game, Callahan.
Good on you.

1383
01:55:28,268 --> 01:55:31,499
- Things are looking up.
- <i> The militarization of Darwin.</i>

1384
01:55:31,572 --> 01:55:34,939
<i>Their cattle yards</i>
<i>are alive with military activity...</i>

1385
01:55:35,009 --> 01:55:38,740
<i>and the Carney Cattle office,</i>
<i>once that proud icon of Darwin...</i>

1386
01:55:38,812 --> 01:55:41,576
is now military headquarters.

1387
01:55:41,648 --> 01:55:44,378
<i>At 6:15 a.m. local time...</i>

1388
01:55:44,451 --> 01:55:48,410
the United States Pacific Fleet
was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...

1389
01:55:48,489 --> 01:55:50,855
by the empire of Japan.

1390
01:55:50,924 --> 01:55:54,257
The United States has joined the war.

1391
01:55:55,429 --> 01:55:58,398
As the Japanese horde pours southward...

1392
01:55:58,465 --> 01:56:02,128
the final evacuation of Darwin
is under way.

1393
01:56:10,277 --> 01:56:13,440
Get those boxes cleared on the double!

1394
01:56:13,514 --> 01:56:15,345
- Come on.
- This way, boys.

1395
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:17,077
Quickly. Quickly.

1396
01:56:35,736 --> 01:56:38,603
<i>Hey, creamy! Creamy!</i>

1397
01:56:38,672 --> 01:56:41,300
<i>Doesn't your mommy want you?</i>

1398
01:56:52,052 --> 01:56:54,520
- <i>You filthy creamy!</i>
- Come on.

1399
01:56:54,588 --> 01:56:57,489
Come, my child.
Come on! Come on, my child.

1400
01:56:57,558 --> 01:56:59,185
Creamy! Hey, creamy!

1401
01:57:22,449 --> 01:57:23,814
- Excuse me.
- Nullah!

1402
01:57:23,884 --> 01:57:25,511
- <i>Lady Ashley.</i>
- It's Lady Ashley.

1403
01:57:25,586 --> 01:57:27,781
- Father Benedict, you deal with this.
- Nullah!

1404
01:57:27,855 --> 01:57:30,517
- Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!
- No! This is madness!

1405
01:57:30,591 --> 01:57:33,492
Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away!
I don't want to go!

1406
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,858
Was she hugging a pickaninny?

1407
01:57:35,929 --> 01:57:37,988
People do the most extraordinary things.

1408
01:57:38,065 --> 01:57:41,125
- Go on.
- I don't want to go! Mrs. Boss!

1409
01:57:41,201 --> 01:57:41,876
It'll be all right.

1410
01:57:41,877 --> 01:57:43,829
These poor unfortunates
will be safe in God's hands.

1411
01:57:43,904 --> 01:57:46,338
These are not unfortunates!
These are children!

1412
01:57:46,406 --> 01:57:49,375
These are no different than the children
you are taking south to protect!

1413
01:57:49,443 --> 01:57:52,412
- Don't let them take me away! No!
- Nullah! Nullah!

1414
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:55,073
- She's humiliating herself.
- Please help me!

1415
01:57:55,149 --> 01:57:57,242
- We've got to help her.
- Lady Ashley!

1416
01:57:57,317 --> 01:58:00,081
- Help me! That's my child.
- I understand what you're saying.

1417
01:58:00,154 --> 01:58:00,661
Please! Nullah!

1418
01:58:00,662 --> 01:58:02,486
You don't have an essential job.
You must evacuate.

1419
01:58:02,556 --> 01:58:06,322
- Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away.
- The church has a plan for them.

1420
01:58:06,393 --> 01:58:09,157
To leave those children behind
while we send ours to safety?

1421
01:58:09,229 --> 01:58:11,857
- Control yourself, Catherine.
- How can you all be so heartless?

1422
01:58:11,932 --> 01:58:14,833
You be a brave boy for me.
You be brave.

1423
01:58:14,902 --> 01:58:18,463
Neil, I want you to do something about this.
I want you to help Lady Ashley.

1424
01:58:18,539 --> 01:58:20,905
Yeah, now, look,
I could probably sort it out.

1425
01:58:20,974 --> 01:58:23,704
Show the ladies their cabins,
and I'll see what I can do.

1426
01:58:23,777 --> 01:58:25,335
<i>Come on, ladies.
To the upper decks.</i>

1427
01:58:25,412 --> 01:58:27,403
I will come find you,
whatever happens.

1428
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:29,779
Whatever it takes,
we'll be together again. I promise.

1429
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:34,048
- I believe you, Mrs. Boss.
- Come along, child. Quickly. Quickly.

1430
01:58:34,121 --> 01:58:36,055
Mrs. Boss.

1431
01:58:37,457 --> 01:58:40,858
- I sing you to me.
- You be brave.

1432
01:58:42,629 --> 01:58:45,257
- Nullah.
- Come, boy. Come quickly.

1433
01:58:48,969 --> 01:58:51,631
Nullah! It'll be all right!

1434
01:58:57,211 --> 01:59:00,203
<i>I will find you! I will!</i>

1435
01:59:08,155 --> 01:59:11,386
<i>Nullah! Nullah!</i>

1436
01:59:18,632 --> 01:59:21,624
I sing you to me, Mrs. Boss!

1437
01:59:21,702 --> 01:59:24,762
And I will hear you, my darling!

1438
01:59:30,877 --> 01:59:33,311
There's a radio tower on Mission Island...

1439
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:36,781
directly in the path
of the oncoming Japanese.

1440
01:59:36,850 --> 01:59:39,341
Be the first place the Japs hit.

1441
01:59:40,921 --> 01:59:42,855
You're monstrous.

1442
01:59:46,893 --> 01:59:49,953
I'll have the original contract with
the original offer drawn up and ready.

1443
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:54,194
<i>You can get yourself a room at Ivan's,</i>
<i>and I'll get you a job with Cath at H.Q.</i>

1444
01:59:54,268 --> 01:59:58,261
<i>I'll give you a call.</i>
<i>You will do this, Lady Ashley.</i>

1445
01:59:58,338 --> 02:00:02,172
After all, pride's not power.

1446
02:00:05,846 --> 02:00:08,974
Yeah, pride's not power.

1447
02:00:39,212 --> 02:00:41,737
<i>Mission Island to H.Q.</i>

1448
02:00:41,815 --> 02:00:45,046
Mission Island to H.Q.
Visibility good.

1449
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:48,087
<i>All clear. Over and out.</i>

1450
02:00:49,823 --> 02:00:53,919
<i># Ave Maria #

1451
02:00:53,994 --> 02:00:58,192
<i> I was on Mission Island</i>
<i>lock-lock for two whole months.</i>

1452
02:00:59,266 --> 02:01:03,202
<i>Mrs. Boss promised she'd come for me...</i>

1453
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:05,761
<i>so I play my magic song.</i>

1454
02:01:10,277 --> 02:01:12,245
<i>But that Drover-</i>

1455
02:01:12,312 --> 02:01:14,940
<i>him been gone far, far away...</i>

1456
02:01:15,015 --> 02:01:17,415
<i>on that big army drove.</i>

1457
02:01:18,518 --> 02:01:21,851
<i>Him been gone so long, so far away...</i>

1458
02:01:21,922 --> 02:01:26,518
<i>maybe he not hear me.</i>

1459
02:01:28,328 --> 02:01:32,094
Leave it off.

1460
02:01:32,165 --> 02:01:34,292
What? No whistling?

1461
02:01:34,368 --> 02:01:36,700
Just not that tune.

1462
02:01:50,117 --> 02:01:52,585
<i>Not that one either.</i>

1463
02:01:52,652 --> 02:01:55,052
<i>No music?</i>

1464
02:01:55,122 --> 02:01:57,249
You must be properly hurtin'
for Mrs. Boss.

1465
02:01:57,324 --> 02:01:59,258
Shut your damper hole, will ya?

1466
02:01:59,326 --> 02:02:01,886
I can see why Mrs. Boss
gave you the boot.

1467
02:02:01,962 --> 02:02:04,396
- You wanna know why she gave me the boot?
- Yeah.

1468
02:02:04,464 --> 02:02:07,126
'Cause I wouldn't stop Nullah
from going walkabout.

1469
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:09,168
He went walkabout?

1470
02:02:09,236 --> 02:02:11,761
Yeah. I tried to explain to her
what that means, but-

1471
02:02:11,838 --> 02:02:14,636
- <i>See him go?</i>
- Nah.

1472
02:02:14,708 --> 02:02:17,404
So he's gone.

1473
02:02:17,477 --> 02:02:21,140
- Yeah. I told you. He went walkabout.
- You don't know?

1474
02:02:21,214 --> 02:02:23,114
Eh?

1475
02:02:23,183 --> 02:02:27,517
<i>That little fella, he could have walked</i>
<i>into a big hole or got eaten by a croc.</i>

1476
02:02:27,587 --> 02:02:31,023
- What if the cops have got him?
- Don't you bloody start. He's an Aboriginal boy!

1477
02:02:31,091 --> 02:02:36,495
Wait. You're just hiding behind that
blackfella business so you don't get hurt.

1478
02:02:36,563 --> 02:02:39,031
<i>This isn't about walkabout, is it?</i>

1479
02:02:39,099 --> 02:02:42,535
Is it? You're running.

1480
02:02:43,737 --> 02:02:46,137
- I'm not running, mate.
- Yes, you are, brother.

1481
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:51,666
<i>You're scared of getting your heart hurt</i>
<i>like before, when my sister died.</i>

1482
02:02:54,981 --> 02:02:58,109
<i>But knowing you, you probably never</i>
<i>told Mrs. Boss that you loved her, eh?</i>

1483
02:03:00,253 --> 02:03:03,313
You got no love in your heart...

1484
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:05,381
<i>you got nothing.</i>

1485
02:03:09,029 --> 02:03:11,998
<i>No dreaming, no story.</i>

1486
02:03:13,066 --> 02:03:15,034
Nothing.

1487
02:03:25,512 --> 02:03:27,912
<i>Hey. Big mob of army fellas.</i>

1488
02:03:30,617 --> 02:03:33,085
Must be diggers, eh?

1489
02:03:33,153 --> 02:03:36,088
<i>They're not diggers, mate.</i>
<i>They're Yanks.</i>

1490
02:03:36,156 --> 02:03:38,624
What the bloody hell are they doing here?

1491
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:13,892
Once you've signed the contract...

1492
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:17,225
I'll get one of the brothers to take you
out to the mission on the sloop.

1493
02:04:17,297 --> 02:04:21,290
You can be happily reunited
with your little creamy.

1494
02:04:21,368 --> 02:04:23,928
No loss of pride, Lady Ashley.

1495
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:30,475
<i>Good morning, Ivan!</i>

1496
02:04:33,446 --> 02:04:37,883
- You look happy.
- I am. I get my little boy today.

1497
02:04:37,951 --> 02:04:41,614
Oh, and, Ivan, we're leaving
the territory tomorrow.

1498
02:04:41,688 --> 02:04:44,919
Good! I need the room.

1499
02:04:44,991 --> 02:04:47,459
I'll miss you too, Ivan!

1500
02:05:19,225 --> 02:05:22,217
- Cath, sorry I'm late.
- Quick changeover, girls.

1501
02:05:23,229 --> 02:05:25,595
- Did you speak to Neil?
- Yes.

1502
02:05:25,665 --> 02:05:28,259
I'm seeing him about Nullah
after my shift.

1503
02:05:28,335 --> 02:05:30,826
- Look. I was just thinking-
- What?

1504
02:05:30,904 --> 02:05:33,304
About Nullah.

1505
02:05:33,373 --> 02:05:35,807
What?

1506
02:06:05,372 --> 02:06:07,431
I'm getting a signal from Mission Island.

1507
02:06:07,507 --> 02:06:10,738
Large air formation bearing down.
Suspect visibility.

1508
02:06:28,728 --> 02:06:32,425
If you can't understand the ordnance...

1509
02:06:32,499 --> 02:06:34,490
how can you understand the order?

1510
02:06:49,516 --> 02:06:51,916
What's happening?

1511
02:06:58,458 --> 02:07:01,188
<i>We're under attack!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

1512
02:07:08,835 --> 02:07:11,201
Hurry up!

1513
02:07:20,346 --> 02:07:21,904
Let them free!

1514
02:08:42,695 --> 02:08:47,826
<i>Drover! Hey! Drover! Magarri!</i>

1515
02:08:47,901 --> 02:08:52,304
Goolaj, where's Mrs. Boss?

1516
02:08:52,372 --> 02:08:55,864
She at that army H.Q. - old Carney place!

1517
02:08:55,942 --> 02:08:58,467
Okay. Come on!

1518
02:09:00,246 --> 02:09:02,214
Drover,
I'll see you at Faraway Downs!

1519
02:09:05,919 --> 02:09:10,015
You can't go in there, mate!

1520
02:09:14,894 --> 02:09:17,522
- Drover!
- Callahan?

1521
02:09:17,597 --> 02:09:19,724
<i>Is she in there? Sarah Ashley.</i>

1522
02:09:19,799 --> 02:09:22,063
- It's too late.
- She's in there!

1523
02:09:22,135 --> 02:09:24,126
Hold it, mate!

1524
02:09:25,271 --> 02:09:29,537
Let me in there! Sarah! Sarah!

1525
02:09:29,609 --> 02:09:32,908
Let me in there!

1526
02:09:32,979 --> 02:09:36,210
I'll handle this. You get your man
out of here right now!

1527
02:09:36,282 --> 02:09:38,716
- She's a part of dreaming now.
- Get out of my way!

1528
02:09:38,785 --> 02:09:40,252
- Go on! Hit me!
- Get out of my-

1529
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,016
Go on! Hit me!
It's not gonna bring her back.

1530
02:09:43,089 --> 02:09:44,784
She's in there! Sarah!

1531
02:09:44,858 --> 02:09:47,588
Clear the corridor! Come on!

1532
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:50,925
Nobody past this point unless they're
at death's door or already through it.

1533
02:09:50,997 --> 02:09:52,965
<i>You got a name?</i>

1534
02:09:53,032 --> 02:09:55,626
Ashley. Sarah Ashley.

1535
02:10:00,206 --> 02:10:02,140
What did he say?

1536
02:10:40,914 --> 02:10:43,576
<i>But right now it's raining.</i>

1537
02:10:44,851 --> 02:10:48,617
<i>It's different now.</i>
<i>We've got Nullah.</i>

1538
02:10:51,257 --> 02:10:53,248
<i>Here you are.</i>

1539
02:11:06,406 --> 02:11:08,636
<i>She deserves a drink like any man.</i>

1540
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:12,701
- <i> Too bloody right.</i>
- <i> Crikey!</i>

1541
02:11:18,785 --> 02:11:21,379
Hey, no boongs in here.

1542
02:11:36,836 --> 02:11:38,827
You didn't say that, did you?

1543
02:11:38,905 --> 02:11:41,465
That's how it is.

1544
02:11:42,775 --> 02:11:44,766
Just because it is...

1545
02:11:46,746 --> 02:11:49,738
doesn't-
doesn't mean it should be.

1546
02:11:53,386 --> 02:11:55,479
Serve him a fuckin' drink!

1547
02:12:20,947 --> 02:12:23,711
Ah, what does it matter?

1548
02:12:25,151 --> 02:12:27,176
I'm a total bloody ruin.

1549
02:12:27,253 --> 02:12:30,689
<i>I'm evacuating south,</i>
<i>like everybody else.</i>

1550
02:12:30,757 --> 02:12:32,918
You're short one glass.

1551
02:12:37,497 --> 02:12:41,365
<i>One... more... glass.</i>

1552
02:12:49,175 --> 02:12:53,236
I leave this place
for the looters and the Japs.

1553
02:12:58,651 --> 02:13:00,642
Why not the boongs?

1554
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:20,533
<i>I saw her this morning...</i>

1555
02:13:20,606 --> 02:13:22,574
<i>before she went to the work.</i>

1556
02:13:22,642 --> 02:13:24,633
<i>She was so happy.</i>

1557
02:13:26,012 --> 02:13:28,810
She was gonna get that...

1558
02:13:28,881 --> 02:13:32,078
<i>little boy and go south.</i>

1559
02:13:33,486 --> 02:13:35,647
What about the children
on Mission Island?

1560
02:13:35,721 --> 02:13:40,215
<i>The creamies?</i>
<i>They are left out there.</i>

1561
02:13:40,293 --> 02:13:44,161
- They left them out there?
- Safe in the hands of God.

1562
02:13:44,230 --> 02:13:46,528
They left them-

1563
02:13:46,599 --> 02:13:49,193
<i>They say the island was hit first.</i>

1564
02:13:49,268 --> 02:13:52,260
<i>They say no one would have survived.</i>

1565
02:13:57,410 --> 02:14:00,208
They say a lot of things.

1566
02:14:03,116 --> 02:14:05,107
<i>There's been some mistake.</i>

1567
02:14:06,219 --> 02:14:08,210
That's Cath Fletcher.

1568
02:14:09,422 --> 02:14:11,481
Oh, God. Cath.

1569
02:14:11,557 --> 02:14:14,890
- Oh, God!
- Sort her out.

1570
02:14:14,961 --> 02:14:17,896
- Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, God!

1571
02:14:17,964 --> 02:14:20,125
Nullah. I've got to get to Nullah.

1572
02:14:20,199 --> 02:14:22,963
- Sarah, the Japs hit the mission first.
- No!

1573
02:14:23,035 --> 02:14:26,027
- No! I don't believe you! I don't believe it!
- Sarah, look at me.

1574
02:14:26,105 --> 02:14:28,096
No one can get out there.

1575
02:14:32,378 --> 02:14:36,041
No one.

1576
02:14:37,216 --> 02:14:39,150
<i>I need help to get to the island.</i>

1577
02:14:39,218 --> 02:14:42,187
- Half the Jap navy's out there, you stupid bastard.
- I have the Lord on my side.

1578
02:14:42,255 --> 02:14:44,815
I don't give a damn who's on your side!

1579
02:14:46,926 --> 02:14:49,588
God works in mysterious ways, Brother.
Go, go, go!

1580
02:14:49,662 --> 02:14:51,323
<i>Magarri, secure the boat.</i>

1581
02:14:51,397 --> 02:14:53,763
- <i>Thank you, Lord. Thank you.</i>
- Thank you, Bull.

1582
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:04,773
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1583
02:15:09,415 --> 02:15:12,907
Sarah, we leave at first light.

1584
02:15:33,105 --> 02:15:34,902
Ivan.

1585
02:15:34,974 --> 02:15:38,307
- Check the second dormitory.
- Okay.

1586
02:16:15,848 --> 02:16:17,782
Nullah.

1587
02:16:22,154 --> 02:16:24,088
Oh.

1588
02:16:49,882 --> 02:16:52,112
Come on. It's all right.

1589
02:16:53,719 --> 02:16:56,153
- Shh.
- Where are the other-Are there other boys?

1590
02:16:56,222 --> 02:16:58,213
- I don't know.
- <i>Are there any other boys?</i>

1591
02:16:58,291 --> 02:17:00,782
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Okay.

1592
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:02,851
Drover?

1593
02:17:04,864 --> 02:17:07,799
- Nullah.
- Drover!

1594
02:17:09,935 --> 02:17:12,802
<i>Drover!</i>

1595
02:17:12,872 --> 02:17:15,340
I knew you'd come.
I sing you to me.

1596
02:17:15,408 --> 02:17:17,342
Oh.

1597
02:17:20,446 --> 02:17:23,006
- Magarri!
- Hey, little fella.

1598
02:17:29,655 --> 02:17:32,021
Mrs. Boss come too?

1599
02:17:32,091 --> 02:17:34,321
Where's Mrs. Boss?

1600
02:17:34,393 --> 02:17:36,384
We, uh-

1601
02:17:36,462 --> 02:17:39,727
We can't say her name anymore,
little mate.

1602
02:17:43,069 --> 02:17:45,230
All right?

1603
02:17:45,304 --> 02:17:48,398
Hey. Now you listen to me.
I need your help.

1604
02:17:48,474 --> 02:17:50,533
I'm gonna get these fellas
off the island.

1605
02:17:50,609 --> 02:17:52,941
You're gonna have to be strong.
Can you do that?

1606
02:17:53,012 --> 02:17:55,003
- Mm-hmm.
- Good boy.

1607
02:17:56,282 --> 02:17:59,342
All right. Go and get
your little mates down there.

1608
02:17:59,418 --> 02:18:02,182
- Come over here. Let's go.
- Come with me. It's okay.

1609
02:18:02,254 --> 02:18:05,712
- <i>Come on.</i>
- We're gonna get you all off this island, all right?

1610
02:18:05,791 --> 02:18:08,089
All right.
Boys, we're gonna have to swim.

1611
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:11,926
We have to be quiet, like a turtle.
Okay?

1612
02:18:11,997 --> 02:18:15,262
<i>Now, I'm gonna take you home on a ship.</i>
<i>It's over there. You see it?</i>

1613
02:18:25,611 --> 02:18:27,909
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

1614
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,914
Quick, quick, quick!

1615
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:32,884
Ivan.

1616
02:18:34,186 --> 02:18:36,677
- Ivan. Swim the big boys down to the sloop.
- Right.

1617
02:18:36,756 --> 02:18:40,089
Use the current and drift it
down to the end of the wharf. Go.

1618
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:42,992
Come on, boys. Quick.

1619
02:18:43,062 --> 02:18:45,257
Run! Run!

1620
02:18:45,331 --> 02:18:47,765
Quick, quick!

1621
02:18:47,833 --> 02:18:49,767
<i>Let's go.</i>

1622
02:19:01,414 --> 02:19:03,974
Ah, crikey.

1623
02:19:09,688 --> 02:19:12,748
Hey.

1624
02:19:14,927 --> 02:19:17,487
- I take this mob walkabout.
- You'll never make it.

1625
02:19:17,563 --> 02:19:19,531
Well, you gotta make it!

1626
02:19:19,598 --> 02:19:22,294
You got family now.

1627
02:19:22,368 --> 02:19:24,598
You gotta drove this mob home, Drover.

1628
02:19:30,209 --> 02:19:32,769
Good luck, brother.

1629
02:19:35,548 --> 02:19:37,448
- Go, go.
- That's it. Good boy.

1630
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:18,879
Magarri.

1631
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:26,994
<i>Up the ladder, boys. Quick. Hurry now.</i>

1632
02:20:34,773 --> 02:20:36,400
Come on.

1633
02:21:19,919 --> 02:21:21,910
Drove 'em home, Drover.

1634
02:22:08,767 --> 02:22:10,701
Sergeant, get the men on the trucks.

1635
02:22:10,769 --> 02:22:13,670
<i>We're evacuating within 15 minutes.</i>

1636
02:22:13,739 --> 02:22:18,005
<i>We rendezvous with the main convoy</i>
<i>at 0800 hours at Adelaide.</i>

1637
02:22:19,011 --> 02:22:21,104
<i>Start the truck, Sergeant Lapin.</i>

1638
02:22:22,381 --> 02:22:25,475
<i>If anyone is lagging,</i>
<i>use whatever force is necessary.</i>

1639
02:22:25,551 --> 02:22:28,076
Every single man, Lapin.
And don't take no for an answer.

1640
02:22:28,153 --> 02:22:33,181
- <i>You won't have to wait for us, Captain.</i>
- Move! Come on! Move!

1641
02:22:33,258 --> 02:22:36,386
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Fletcher.

1642
02:22:36,462 --> 02:22:38,521
It's my awful duty to inform you...

1643
02:22:38,597 --> 02:22:40,758
<i>that your wife, Catherine-</i>

1644
02:22:43,135 --> 02:22:45,467
My wife is dead?

1645
02:22:45,537 --> 02:22:49,564
<i>It's a funny old world, isn't it?</i>

1646
02:22:49,642 --> 02:22:51,633
Generous to a fault.

1647
02:22:51,710 --> 02:22:56,044
<i>Did you know that Lady Ashley insisted...</i>

1648
02:22:56,115 --> 02:22:58,106
that my wife work her shift...

1649
02:23:00,619 --> 02:23:06,421
so that she could see
some... half-caste kid on the mission?

1650
02:23:06,492 --> 02:23:08,653
<i>Now my wife's dead.</i>

1651
02:23:10,596 --> 02:23:12,860
Now I've lost everything.

1652
02:23:24,343 --> 02:23:26,402
<i>We have to go, Sarah.</i>

1653
02:23:40,192 --> 02:23:43,787
Come on! Come on, boys!

1654
02:23:46,198 --> 02:23:48,792
They'll be flying in here
and blowing us up any minute!

1655
02:23:48,867 --> 02:23:50,926
<i>Get on the bloody trucks!</i>

1656
02:24:08,620 --> 02:24:12,454
<i>Sarah, please. We have to go now.</i>

1657
02:24:19,331 --> 02:24:21,822
<i>My magic not good.</i>

1658
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,834
<i>All the smoke.</i>

1659
02:24:25,738 --> 02:24:28,002
<i>But then he speak to me.</i>

1660
02:24:28,073 --> 02:24:32,737
<i>Grandfather.</i>

1661
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:57,160
Come on, love. Don't muck about.

1662
02:25:06,111 --> 02:25:08,045
Can you hear that?

1663
02:25:09,481 --> 02:25:11,449
<i>Music. Can you hear it?</i>

1664
02:25:11,517 --> 02:25:13,781
Come on, boys.

1665
02:25:20,926 --> 02:25:22,951
Sing.

1666
02:25:26,732 --> 02:25:28,723
- <i>Sarah, please.</i>
- Can't you hear it?

1667
02:25:38,477 --> 02:25:40,707
It's children singing.

1668
02:26:03,368 --> 02:26:06,997
- <i>Sarah! What's going on?</i>
- Just give her another minute.

1669
02:26:33,665 --> 02:26:36,133
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1670
02:26:37,970 --> 02:26:40,939
Mrs. Boss!

1671
02:26:43,141 --> 02:26:46,042
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1672
02:26:49,348 --> 02:26:51,612
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

1673
02:26:57,222 --> 02:26:59,087
Nullah!

1674
02:26:59,157 --> 02:27:01,648
- Mrs. Boss!
- Ah!

1675
02:27:01,727 --> 02:27:05,163
- I can say your name!
- Oh!

1676
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:09,291
Mrs. Boss. I sing you to me
like the first night I see you.

1677
02:27:09,368 --> 02:27:12,599
Them Japs nearly got us.
We had to swim'em.

1678
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:16,334
Some of them little fellas
from the desert can't swim'em.

1679
02:27:16,408 --> 02:27:20,344
But the Drover take 'em
on his back like a turtle.

1680
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:24,813
What did you say? What?

1681
02:27:24,883 --> 02:27:26,817
Drover.

1682
02:27:54,413 --> 02:27:57,177
You're alive! Oh, God!

1683
02:28:26,278 --> 02:28:28,838
Sarah, what's going on?
I can't hold the sergeant any longer!

1684
02:28:32,818 --> 02:28:35,912
Come on, boys!

1685
02:28:35,988 --> 02:28:38,980
Oh, my God.
It's the children from the mission.

1686
02:28:39,057 --> 02:28:41,187
The last convoy leaves Darwin
in a matter of minutes.

1687
02:28:41,188 --> 02:28:41,582
Come on!

1688
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:43,594
- In the truck!
- Come on, boys!

1689
02:28:43,662 --> 02:28:45,687
- To the truck. Follow Brother Frank.
- Truck's waiting. Let's go.

1690
02:28:45,764 --> 02:28:47,493
Follow Brother Frank.
Follow Brother Frank.

1691
02:28:47,566 --> 02:28:49,500
- <i>That's it. That's it.</i>
- Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1692
02:28:49,568 --> 02:28:51,832
- Let's go.
- <i>Come on, boys.</i>

1693
02:28:51,903 --> 02:28:55,270
<i> Quick as you can to the end of</i>
<i>the wharf, and then straight on the truck.</i>

1694
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:58,275
- <i>Sarah.</i>
- Ivan!

1695
02:28:58,343 --> 02:29:00,573
Thank you!

1696
02:29:04,082 --> 02:29:06,516
Thank you.

1697
02:29:06,585 --> 02:29:08,985
I shall prepare your bill.

1698
02:29:14,026 --> 02:29:16,051
Where'd you come from?

1699
02:29:16,128 --> 02:29:19,586
The good Lord has delivered us,
but we could do with a ride, Sergeant.

1700
02:29:19,664 --> 02:29:22,030
I'm not Jesus Christ,
but I'll give it my best shot.

1701
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:24,193
Come on, kids.
Come on. On the trucks.

1702
02:29:24,269 --> 02:29:26,965
<i>I want a third in the front,</i>
<i>a third at the back.</i>

1703
02:29:27,039 --> 02:29:29,940
<i>Come on. Leg 'em up.</i>
<i>They're little fellas. Come on.</i>

1704
02:29:30,008 --> 02:29:32,943
<i>Bring those little fellas up to the front.</i>

1705
02:29:33,011 --> 02:29:35,980
<i>You cursed me, you little creamy.</i>

1706
02:29:36,048 --> 02:29:39,142
Oh. Oh.

1707
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:44,216
When I said that no one
could get out there...

1708
02:29:44,289 --> 02:29:46,280
<i>I'd forgotten about you, Drover.</i>

1709
02:29:46,358 --> 02:29:50,294
<i>That no matter.</i>
<i>We gonna go back Faraway Downs.</i>

1710
02:29:51,997 --> 02:29:55,262
Yes, he's right. With the water up,
it's the safest place in the north.

1711
02:29:56,334 --> 02:29:58,495
<i>These are, after all-</i>

1712
02:29:58,570 --> 02:30:01,903
Extraordinary circumstances.

1713
02:30:03,475 --> 02:30:06,342
Extraordinary circumstances.

1714
02:30:06,411 --> 02:30:09,005
Thank you, Emmett.

1715
02:30:14,953 --> 02:30:17,421
I'll see you mob in Faraway Downs.

1716
02:30:26,264 --> 02:30:30,132
Here, fellas, make some room
for the kids, will ya?

1717
02:30:30,202 --> 02:30:32,466
- Can you help me, please?
- In you go.

1718
02:30:33,805 --> 02:30:35,966
Right-o! That's it. They're all on.

1719
02:30:36,041 --> 02:30:38,805
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

1720
02:30:40,345 --> 02:30:42,836
All right, kids, hold on.

1721
02:30:47,786 --> 02:30:49,981
Mr. Fletcher!

1722
02:30:51,389 --> 02:30:53,380
Mr. Fletcher.

1723
02:30:53,458 --> 02:30:55,619
Neil.

1724
02:30:55,694 --> 02:30:57,525
<i>We gotta go.</i>

1725
02:31:00,532 --> 02:31:03,467
Go and tell Callahan
there's looters everywhere.

1726
02:31:05,203 --> 02:31:08,331
Go and tell Callahan!

1727
02:31:14,112 --> 02:31:17,206
- I've got the keys to the car upstairs.
- Right-o.

1728
02:31:21,386 --> 02:31:23,217
Come on, Mrs. Boss. Hurry up.

1729
02:31:36,334 --> 02:31:37,699
Nullah!

1730
02:31:42,107 --> 02:31:45,736
<i>I got</i> gulapa <i>magic.</i>
<i>No one can hurt me.</i>

1731
02:31:45,810 --> 02:31:48,074
- <i> Nullah! No!</i>
- No!

1732
02:31:55,687 --> 02:31:58,588
<i>No! No!</i>

1733
02:32:09,501 --> 02:32:12,470
Nullah!

1734
02:32:12,537 --> 02:32:16,064
Nullah, you all right, little man?
Nullah, please. Come on. Please.

1735
02:32:17,809 --> 02:32:19,743
Come on.

1736
02:32:22,113 --> 02:32:24,104
There. That's it.

1737
02:32:26,718 --> 02:32:29,414
No bullet. Me <i>gulapa.</i>

1738
02:33:04,990 --> 02:33:06,924
<i>King George teach me...</i>

1739
02:33:06,992 --> 02:33:11,122
<i>the rain will fall,</i>
<i>the grass grow green...</i>

1740
02:33:11,196 --> 02:33:14,859
<i>and life, it begin again.</i>

1741
02:33:20,605 --> 02:33:23,073
Let's go home.

1742
02:33:23,141 --> 02:33:25,200
There's no place like it.

1743
02:34:08,219 --> 02:34:10,915
<i>One thing I know.</i>

1744
02:34:10,989 --> 02:34:14,254
Why <i>we tell story</i>
<i>is the most important of all.</i>

1745
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:18,827
<i>That's how you keep them people</i>
<i>belong you...</i>

1746
02:34:18,897 --> 02:34:21,457
<i>always.</i>

1747
02:35:10,815 --> 02:35:12,749
Oh.

1748
02:35:27,866 --> 02:35:31,666
Mrs. Boss, I sing you to me.

1749
02:35:58,730 --> 02:36:00,664
Here.

1750
02:36:57,922 --> 02:37:00,516
And I will hear you.

1751
02:38:06,791 --> 02:38:10,659
<i># Sing and I will hear you #

1752
02:38:10,728 --> 02:38:13,754
<i># No matter where you are #

1753
02:38:14,899 --> 02:38:18,835
<i># A song to light the darkest night #

1754
02:38:18,903 --> 02:38:22,805
<i># And guide me from afar#</i>

1755
02:38:22,874 --> 02:38:26,105
<i># And I will never#</i>

1756
02:38:26,177 --> 02:38:29,510
<i># Be afraid #

1757
02:38:29,581 --> 02:38:33,381
<i># Now I know you're somewhere #

1758
02:38:33,451 --> 02:38:36,852
<i># You're everywhere to me #

1759
02:38:39,657 --> 02:38:42,285
<i># The warming of the sun #

1760
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:47,297
<i># Upon the earth beneath my feet #

1761
02:38:47,365 --> 02:38:50,960
<i># And when the rain falls down #

1762
02:38:51,035 --> 02:38:55,028
<i># You tell the story #

1763
02:38:55,106 --> 02:38:59,475
<i># And I will hear you #

1764
02:38:59,544 --> 02:39:02,672
<i># Always near you #

1765
02:39:02,747 --> 02:39:06,239
<i># By the Boab tree ##</i>

1766
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:33,502
<i> # From the sunburnt plains</i>
<i>of far-off north Australia #

1767
02:39:34,846 --> 02:39:39,146
<i># Came a fella born to ride</i>
<i>the wide, brown land #

1768
02:39:40,652 --> 02:39:43,450
<i># Oh, he grew up running wild #

1769
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:46,354
<i># But soon by all was styled #

1770
02:39:46,424 --> 02:39:50,690
<i># As the country's greatest</i>
<i>ever-drovin' man #

1771
02:39:52,296 --> 02:39:56,630
<i># Though his legend rode the winds</i>
<i>from Broome to Darwin #

1772
02:39:58,002 --> 02:40:03,372
<i># They loved and loathed him</i>
<i>right from end to end #

1773
02:40:03,441 --> 02:40:06,274
<i># For when the Drover gave his heart #

1774
02:40:06,344 --> 02:40:09,074
<i># To a girl whose skin was dark #

1775
02:40:09,147 --> 02:40:14,813
<i># From that day on</i>
<i>he was no white man's friend #

1776
02:40:14,886 --> 02:40:17,616
<i># So goes the Drover's story #

1777
02:40:17,689 --> 02:40:20,249
<i># You will hear it near and far #</i>

1778
02:40:20,324 --> 02:40:25,489
<i># And in the end</i>
<i>it's all he'll ever own #

1779
02:40:25,563 --> 02:40:28,691
<i># It says the outcast is a free man #

1780
02:40:28,766 --> 02:40:31,428

02:40:31,502 --> 02:40:36,235
<i># Makes the blanket</i>
<i>of the southern skies his home #

1782
02:41:09,974 --> 02:41:15,810
<i># But the Drover is a man</i>
<i>of constant shadows #

1783
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:21,011
<i># Haunted by his pain</i>
<i>his past and name #

1784
02:41:21,085 --> 02:41:24,145
<i># For every mile he rides #

1785
02:41:24,222 --> 02:41:26,588
<i># What he cannot hide #

1786
02:41:26,657 --> 02:41:28,921
<i># Is the longing in his heart #

1787
02:41:28,993 --> 02:41:32,053
<i># To love again #

1788
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:34,826
