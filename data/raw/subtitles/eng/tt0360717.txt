That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

39
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,719
It's hysterical, Manny.

40
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,190
As long as we're laughing...

41
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,687
we won't cry
over the box office.

42
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,338
Talk about depressing.

43
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,933
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

44
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,531
That's depressing.

45
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,934
I love a good chorus line.

46
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,519
What's this? It's a play.

47
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,080
Who wrote it, Annie?

48
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:30,949
Some guy. Driscoll.

49
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,646
Driscoll.

50
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,576
From the Federal Theatre.

51
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:38,004
Don't knock it, honey. At
least they got an audience.

52
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:41,601
It'll pick up. Isn't
that right, Manny?

53
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,812
It always does.

54
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:48,811
See you tomorrow.

55
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:52,971
The trick is to start to build right
from the back of your throat.

56
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,659
Works well
out through the nose, too.

57
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,530
Have you eaten today?

58
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,793
Oh...

59
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,160
I'm not hungry. Don't
worry about me.

60
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:03,421
Hey.

61
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,448
You're all I've got.

62
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,138
Come on, take me to dinner.

63
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,133
Okay.

64
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,327
You think the kitchen
will still be open on Third?

65
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,924
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

66
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,901
Harry, what's going on?

67
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:31,430
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

68
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:35,050
It's all right for you. We haven't
had a paycheck in two weeks.

69
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:36,781
How we gonna eat?

70
00:04:36,988 --> 00:04:39,975
They're not getting away with this!
They just did.

71
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,480
Ann, it's no use.

72
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,467
The show, it's over. It's done.

73
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:47,532
I'm done.

74
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,690
I'm leaving, Annie.

75
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:55,443
I'm going back to Chicago.

76
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:57,907
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,638
I'm sorry, Annie.

78
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:06,035
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

79
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,990
You gotta think of yourself now.

80
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,847
You should try
out for that part.

81
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,909
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

82
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:21,870
Every time you reach
out for something you care about...

83
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,661
fate comes
along and snatches it away.

84
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,317
But not this time, Annie.

85
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,414
Not this time.

86
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,672
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston. Oh, jeez.

87
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:39,804
Look, miss, I told you
already, call my office.

88
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,801
Leave your résumé
with my secretary.

89
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:44,917
Now, why would I want to do that when
we can talk about it in person?

90
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,629
Because that's what a smart
girl would do.

91
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,153
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,234
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

93
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,968
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

94
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,228
Jesus, you don't
give up, do you?

95
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,856
Mr. Weston, I know
this role backwards.

96
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,896
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

97
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:02,357
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

98
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,106
I know times are tough.

99
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,165
You want my advice?

100
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,563
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

101
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,255
A girl like you doesn't
have to starve.

102
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,945
There's a new place.
It just opened.

103
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:29,131
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

104
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,189
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

105
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,880
Just play the date,
take the money...

106
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,841
forget you was ever there.

107
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,824
How much more is there?

108
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,084
Another five reels.

109
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:14,781
Lights up.

110
00:07:22,638 --> 00:07:23,998
This is it?

111
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,889
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

112
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:28,586
Another one of your safari
pictures?

113
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:31,741
You promised us romantic scenes
with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

114
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,508
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

115
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,173
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

116
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,794
so she could get
her teeth fixed.

117
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,699
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

118
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,322
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

119
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:45,048
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

120
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:47,018
once we get them on the ship.

121
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,113
What ship?

122
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:52,003
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

123
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:55,865
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

124
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,455
Yes, I understand that.

125
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,893
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

126
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:01,221
and I'll tell you why.

127
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:04,117
The story has changed. The
script has been rewritten.

128
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,307
Life intervened.

129
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,768
I've come into possession
of a map.

130
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,194
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

131
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,385
A place that was thought
to exist only in myth.

132
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:18,714
Until now.

133
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,812
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

134
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,217
Is he asking for more money?

135
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,870
He's asking us to fund
a wild goose chase.

136
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:29,396
I'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.

137
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,553
The ruins of an entire
civilization.

138
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,720
The most spectacular
thing you've ever seen.

139
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,239
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

140
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,604
Will there be boobies?

141
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:48,063
Boobies?

142
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:51,224
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

143
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,083
In my experience, people
only go to these films...

144
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:57,515
to observe the undraped
form of the native girls.

145
00:08:57,684 --> 00:08:59,148
What are you, an idiot?

146
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,404
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots?

147
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,092
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

148
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,618
Not that you'd know
what that means, you cheap lowlife!

149
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:16,368
Would you step
out for a moment, Carl?

150
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,578
Zelman and Associates.

151
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:31,810
Give me that, quick.

152
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:35,496
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

153
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:39,693
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

154
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,214
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

155
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,251
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

156
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,609
He's had a lot of near-success.

157
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,110
He's a preening self-promoter.

158
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,463
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's got
"loser" written all over him.

159
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,020
I understand
your disappointment...

160
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,220
♪ He can't direct. He ♪
♪ doesn't have the smarts. ♪

161
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,088
♪ He's washed up. ♪
♪ It's all over town. ♪

162
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:06,575
This jumped-up
little turd's gonna bankrupt us.

163
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,476
The animal footage has value.

164
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:10,972
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

165
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,431
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

166
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,851
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

167
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,344
Get him back in.

168
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,968
Mr. Denham.

169
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,165
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

170
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:31,360
No, Carl, you can't do this.

171
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,588
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.

172
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:35,680
It's not ethical! What
are they gonna do, sue me?

173
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:36,848
They can get in line.

174
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,352
I'm not gonna let
them kill my film.

175
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,849
You realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board?

176
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,704
We have no permits, no visas.

177
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,398
That's why I have you, Preston.

178
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,560
We have no insurance, we have
no foreign currency.

179
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,559
In fact, we have no
currency of any kind.

180
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,624
He's there.

181
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,516
Get in there. Who's gonna
pay for the ship?

182
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,676
Get in.

183
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,135
You get out of there! Come here!
Step on it! Step on it!

184
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,259
Get out! You're
finished, Denham!

185
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:10,452
Don't worry, Preston. I've had
a lot of practice at this.

186
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:14,074
I'm real good at crapping
the crappers.

187
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:17,499
Red Label, 80% proof...

188
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:19,402
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

189
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:20,528
You got it.

190
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:22,966
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

191
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:25,323
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

192
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,016
She doesn't wanna
be in this picture.

193
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,774
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

194
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,935
Yesterday. I told you.

195
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,635
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

196
00:11:36,705 --> 00:11:38,691
That's what you told her.

197
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:41,756
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

198
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:46,117
God damn it, Preston, all you had to do
was look her in the eye and lie.

199
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:48,907
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

200
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,412
She's unavailable.

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,303
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

202
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,659
You'll never get her
into a size four.

203
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:59,288
You gotta get a girl that'll fit
into Maureen's costumes.

204
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:02,851
Fay's a size four.

205
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:06,403
Yes, she is, but she's doing
a picture with RKO.

206
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,474
Cooper, huh?

207
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,996
I might have known.

208
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,761
You're not listening. We
got to delay the shoot.

209
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:18,291
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

210
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,788
Not an option. Carl.

211
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,321
I said I'd find a girl.

212
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,644
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

213
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:26,540
Call Jack. I need
that goddamn screenplay!

214
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,456
Defeat is always momentary.

215
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:05,389
What?

216
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:02,817
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

217
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,413
Excuse me.

218
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,938
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

219
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,144
Vaudeville, huh?

220
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:24,234
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

221
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,103
If you don't kill them
fast, they kill you.

222
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,637
Mr. Denham...

223
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,668
I want you to know...

224
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,523
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

225
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,454
Or, for that matter...

226
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,074
taking things that don't
belong to me.

227
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:39,048
It was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding.

228
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,080
It's just that I haven't
been paid in a while.

229
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,537
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

230
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:50,991
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

231
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:55,538
No, no. Oh, God, no.

232
00:14:55,616 --> 00:14:58,136
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

233
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,301
I'm not that type
of person at all.

234
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,068
What type of person are you?

235
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,097
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

236
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:09,216
Believe me, I am on the level. No
funny business. Please sit down.

237
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,851
Please. Please.

238
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:16,833
Okay.

239
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,362
Ann, I want you to imagine...

240
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,090
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

241
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:25,455
You're filming in the Far East?

242
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,020
Singapore.

243
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,845
On board ship, he meets
a mysterious girl.

244
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,731
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

245
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:39,494
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

246
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:43,457
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

247
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,707
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...

248
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,433
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

249
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,052
And sure enough, against her
better judgment...

250
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,814
She falls in love.

251
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:01,579
Yes.

252
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,706
But she doesn't trust it.

253
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:06,842
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

254
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,296
Uh...

255
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:10,562
really?

256
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,093
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

257
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:14,559
Why is that?

258
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,545
Good things never
last, Mr. Denham.

259
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,604
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

260
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:28,228
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

261
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,697
Well, I really... Ann,
I'm telling you...

262
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,093
you're perfect. Look at you.

263
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,148
You're the saddest
girl I've ever met.

264
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:38,309
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

265
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,669
See, that's where you're
wrong, Mr. Denham.

266
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:44,331
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

267
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,958
Good luck with your picture.

268
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:52,348
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

269
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:53,819
I'm offering you money.

270
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,540
Adventure, fame, the thrill
of a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

271
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:58,703
You want to read a script?

272
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,832
Jack Driscoll's turning
in a draft as we speak.

273
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,197
Jack Driscoll?

274
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:06,592
Sure. Why?

275
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,650
Wait. You know him?

276
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,273
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

277
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,344
What a writer, huh? And
let me tell you, Ann...

278
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,430
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

279
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:19,870
He said to me, "Carl..."

280
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,295
"somewhere out there is a woman
born to play this role."

281
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,758
And as soon as I saw
you, I knew.

282
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,385
Knew what?

283
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,635
It was always going to be you.

284
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,111
- How much do I owe you?
- Make it a quarter.

285
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,769
Keep the change.

286
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:53,599
Is this the moving picture ship?

287
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,593
Not exactly.

288
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:59,089
It's actually this
one over here.

289
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:12,723
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

290
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,652
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

291
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:16,814
This is all of it? Yeah.

292
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,479
We're taking the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

293
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,245
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

294
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:22,869
Carl! Yes!

295
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,305
Get it on board,
fellows, come on.

296
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,088
It's bad, it's bad.

297
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,060
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

298
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,249
Who? Men in uniform.

299
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:36,410
The studio called the cops.

300
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:40,903
Englehorn! Cast off!

301
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,872
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

302
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:44,994
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

303
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,726
I cannot do that.

304
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,063
We are waiting on the manifest.

305
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,592
What? Who? English, please.

306
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,718
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

307
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,407
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

308
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,910
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

309
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:02,133
Can we talk about this later?

310
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,028
Can't you see we're
in the company of a VIP guest?

311
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,109
Ma'am.

312
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,374
Ann Darrow.

313
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,525
So you are ready for this
voyage, Miss Darrow?

314
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:19,894
Sure.

315
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:23,020
Nervous?

316
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:27,551
Nervous? No.

317
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:30,843
Why? Should I be?

318
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,000
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

319
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,059
Why don't I show Miss
Darrow to her cabin?

320
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,919
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

321
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,416
Miss Darrow, if you
would just...

322
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:50,796
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

323
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,899
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

324
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,223
Do I have a choice?

325
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,790
Please follow me.

326
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,119
If there's anything that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

327
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:05,077
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

328
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,871
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

329
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:30,331
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

330
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,982
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

331
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,248
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

332
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,241
You want one? No.
I can't stay, Carl.

333
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:41,337
I got a rehearsal for which I am
now three hours late.

334
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,569
What's this? It's the script.

335
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,324
This is a script?

336
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:52,181
Jack, this is 15 pages.

337
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,871
I know, but they're good. You've got
15 good pages there, Carl.

338
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,942
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

339
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,406
You told me I had more time. I'm sorry.
Look, I gotta go.

340
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,493
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

341
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,156
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

342
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:07,419
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

343
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,365
All right, fine. We might
as well settle up.

344
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,236
You're gonna pay me?

345
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,234
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

346
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:24,221
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

347
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,116
How's $2,000 sound?

348
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,216
Sounds great.

349
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:31,006
I thought it might.

350
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,595
Sounds great. Okay.

351
00:21:34,637 --> 00:21:36,462
♪ Raise the spring line! ♪

352
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,122
Watch the aft!

353
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:48,237
And voilà.

354
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:50,102
Thanks.

355
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:54,955
You've written "two grand."

356
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:00,783
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

357
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:03,548
"Two thousand dollars."

358
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,091
It is the 29th, isn't it?

359
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,953
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

360
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,549
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

361
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,778
Never mind, Carl. Just pay
me when you get back.

362
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:22,210
All right.

363
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:38,636
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

364
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:43,195
And may I just say how excited
we are to have you back with us, sir?

365
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,061
Be a sport and lend
a hand here, would you?

366
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,595
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

367
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,379
Christ!

368
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,080
Appreciate the help, fellow.

369
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:56,269
Let me get the door for you.

370
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,530
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

371
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:07,115
Dead slow ahead both, Mr. Hayes.

372
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:09,121
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

373
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:18,434
Oh, Christ!

374
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,216
God damn it!

375
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,026
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

376
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh, no! No!

377
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:49,774
You're much better
off sticking with film.

378
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,434
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

379
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,021
I happen to love the theater.

380
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:57,948
No, you don't.

381
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:01,209
If you really loved it...

382
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,242
you would have jumped.

383
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:08,907
You! This is your fault!

384
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,429
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

385
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,523
Jesus. What do you
keep down here?

386
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,923
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

387
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,683
You sell them to zoos?

388
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,341
Zoo, circus.

389
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:38,238
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

390
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,498
Careful. Camel have bad
accident on floor.

391
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:43,330
Stain unremovable.

392
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,927
Skipper catch any wild
animal you want.

393
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:50,886
He'll do you real good
price on white rhino.

394
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:52,042
Choy.

395
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:57,706
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

396
00:24:57,775 --> 00:25:00,567
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

397
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,095
Spoiled for choice.

398
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,886
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

399
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,683
Or a chimpanzee?

400
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,772
I'll take this one.

401
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,347
I told you to lock it up.

402
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:29,937
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

403
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:33,065
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

404
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,160
Get them out of here.

405
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,053
Compliments of the chef. Okay.

406
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,432
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

407
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:26,333
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

408
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,148
Jimmy.

409
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:35,318
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

410
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,371
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

411
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,571
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

412
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,216
He don't mean no harm.

413
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:53,216
Thanks.

414
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,040
I'll keep him out of your way.
It's okay.

415
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:57,631
It's just that he likes
it down here.

416
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,296
It's where I found
him four years ago.

417
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:03,223
Stowed away in one of them
back cages.

418
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,923
His arm was broken
in two places.

419
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:10,979
He was wilder than half
the animals in here.

420
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,467
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

421
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,762
But it wasn't anyplace good.

422
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,417
You got to straighten up.

423
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:23,851
Jimmy.

424
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:27,641
You don't want to be on this
ship the rest of your life.

425
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,074
Yes, I do. No, you don't, Jimmy.

426
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:32,634
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

427
00:27:32,704 --> 00:27:34,631
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

428
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,821
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

429
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:38,450
I've been reading.

430
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:43,078
Where'd you get this?

431
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,416
I borrowed it.

432
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:49,838
On long-term loan.

433
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,764
Look at this. Look, look.

434
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,090
"Adventures on a tramp steamer." See?
Just like us.

435
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,768
It's so nice to meet
you, Mr. Driscoll.

436
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,336
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

437
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,413
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

438
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:18,450
Actually, I'm quite
familiar with your work.

439
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,737
I'm a huge fan.

440
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,742
I've read everything
you've ever written.

441
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,273
No, too much.

442
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:28,229
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

443
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:30,291
Seagulls.

444
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:33,447
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

445
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:34,677
I don't care, Mike.

446
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:37,146
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

447
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:41,401
Ann! Come on in. Let me
introduce you to the crew.

448
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:43,662
This is Herb, the cameraman.

449
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:46,923
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

450
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:49,153
May I say what a lovely dress?

451
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,116
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

452
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:55,136
Isn't
that one of Maureen's costumes?

453
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:59,234
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

454
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,324
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

455
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:04,849
Fancy my porridge à la walnuts?

456
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,568
Oh, Ann, I don't
believe you've met...

457
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:15,028
Ann?

458
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,659
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

459
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:27,541
Thrilled to meet you. It's an honor
to be a part of this.

460
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:30,172
Gee, thanks.

461
00:29:30,773 --> 00:29:33,667
Actually, I'm quite
familiar with your work.

462
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,291
Really?

463
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:38,152
Yes, and what I most admire...

464
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:41,845
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

465
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:44,877
Well, that's my job.

466
00:29:47,776 --> 00:29:50,099
I'm sure you've heard this
before, Mr. Driscoll...

467
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,632
if you don't mind me saying...

468
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,752
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

469
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:01,575
Excuse me. Wait a minute, Ann...

470
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:04,439
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

471
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,134
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

472
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,364
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

473
00:30:08,438 --> 00:30:11,225
one of those self-obsessed
literary types.

474
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,124
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

475
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:16,915
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his a...

476
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,802
It's nice to meet you,
too, Miss Darrow.

477
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,043
Good Christ!

478
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:07,421
She's standing at the railing.

479
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:09,007
She doesn't know it yet...

480
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:13,729
But they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

481
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,630
Okay, so she turns...

482
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:18,830
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

483
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,749
There's a knife sticking
out of his back.

484
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:25,750
Wait a sec. We're killing
off the first mate?

485
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:28,474
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

486
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:31,369
Come on, Jack. It
was an honest mistake.

487
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:33,992
Ann is nearsighted. It could
have happened to anyone.

488
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:35,655
I was joking, Carl.

489
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:39,022
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

490
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,842
And that's when she sees it.

491
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,376
Sees what?

492
00:31:48,644 --> 00:31:49,731
What?

493
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,623
The island.

494
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:04,709
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

495
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:07,871
Jack, keep your voice down.

496
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,922
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

497
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,514
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

498
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,611
All right. It has
a local name...

499
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:19,206
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

500
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,969
They call it Skull Island.

501
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,766
Did you get that?

502
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:25,899
What's wrong with this place?

503
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:28,693
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

504
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:32,249
Because, technically, it
hasn't been discovered yet.

505
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,611
Okay. All right.

506
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,064
So we arrive at this place.

507
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,859
S...

508
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:44,689
K...

509
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:47,090
U...

510
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,282
I...

511
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:52,041
I...

512
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,867
Island.

513
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:06,246
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

514
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,469
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

515
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:14,131
And I've never
been on one with a woman before.

516
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:17,655
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

517
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,688
No, they're a nuisance.

518
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:23,416
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

519
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:32,727
Cut!

520
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,196
It's great.

521
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:39,551
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

522
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:42,518
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

523
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:46,134
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

524
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:48,039
It was pure effluence.

525
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,863
I beefed up the banter.

526
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:52,058
Try to resist that impulse.

527
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,356
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

528
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,891
What are you, a Bolshevik
or something?

529
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,150
Actors.

530
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,577
Travel the world, but all they ever
see is a mirror.

531
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,346
Good legs.

532
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,599
Sea legs. Well, you
know, sea legs.

533
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,193
Yeah.

534
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,888
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

535
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:30,251
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

536
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,735
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

537
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:36,640
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

538
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:40,726
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

539
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:43,026
he must ignore her.

540
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,957
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

541
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,017
No?

542
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:49,811
Interesting theory.

543
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:52,536
I know. I should have...

544
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,903
It wasn't what I had
intended, but...

545
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:56,496
I'm sorry. I was...

546
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:58,559
And you made it your own.

547
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,019
I was nervous.

548
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,852
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

549
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,084
Please don't say another word.
Good night.

550
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:08,549
Miss Darrow.

551
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:16,362
You don't have to be nervous.

552
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:28,026
Thank you.

553
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:30,547
Let's take it...

554
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,948
Would you please... We're
trying to shoot a scene.

555
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,639
Okay. Thank you.

556
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:36,170
Okay, again.

557
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:52,874
We're close. Turn southwest.

558
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,500
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

559
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:00,954
It takes us way
outside the shipping lanes.

560
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,516
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

561
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,783
I'll make it worth your while.

562
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:10,102
There's nothing out there.

563
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,238
Well, then
you've nothing to lose.

564
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:29,198
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

565
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,394
what would you say?

566
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,255
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

567
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:39,741
Well, we turned
southwest last night.

568
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:41,610
Gentlemen, please.

569
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,532
We're not looking for trouble.
No.

570
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,265
You're looking
for something else.

571
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:54,024
Yes, we are.

572
00:37:55,688 --> 00:37:58,050
We're going to find
Skull Island.

573
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,475
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

574
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:06,232
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

575
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:08,824
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

576
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,749
What do you mean?

577
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:16,075
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes
were working our passage...

578
00:38:16,149 --> 00:38:17,704
on a Norwegian bark.

579
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:20,604
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

580
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,702
He'd been drifting for days.

581
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:26,162
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

582
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:29,678
An island hidden in fog.

583
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:33,712
He spoke of a huge wall...

584
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
built so long ago...

585
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:39,261
no one knew who'd made it.

586
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:42,399
A wall 100 foot high...

587
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,492
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

588
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,242
Why'd they build the wall?

589
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,331
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

590
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:59,857
neither beast nor man...

591
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:03,623
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

592
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,014
A lion or a tiger.

593
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:09,277
A man-eater. That's how all these
stories start.

594
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,135
What else did he say?

595
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:12,597
Nothing.

596
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:15,427
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

597
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,759
Mmm-hmm.

598
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,980
Sorry, fellows. You'll have
to do better than that.

599
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:23,481
Monsters belong in B movies.

600
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:25,570
If you find this place...

601
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,505
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...

602
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,361
you won't come back.

603
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,850
Just as long as you
understand that.

604
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,328
How long do you expect
us to stay out here?

605
00:41:03,924 --> 00:41:06,147
You're writing a stage comedy?

606
00:41:06,286 --> 00:41:08,179
I'm writing it for you.

607
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:12,202
Why would you do that?

608
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,996
Why would I write a play for you?
Yes.

609
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:19,250
Isn't it obvious?

610
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,316
Not to me.

611
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:28,335
Well...

612
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:31,662
it's in the subtext.

613
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:36,619
I guess I must have missed it.

614
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:43,509
It's not about words.

615
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:28,515
Message for you, Captain.

616
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,476
What's going on?

617
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:52,074
Hayes, why
are we changing course?

618
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,899
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

619
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:02,551
There's a warrant
out for your arrest.

620
00:43:02,891 --> 00:43:04,513
Did you know that?

621
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,570
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

622
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:17,026
Another week. I haven't
got a film yet.

623
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:21,083
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

624
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:24,410
No, Denham. You risked
everything I have.

625
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,571
What do you want?

626
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,899
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

627
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,899
I want you off my ship.

628
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:36,947
Set a course
for Rangoon, Mr. Hayes.

629
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:45,009
I'm finished.

630
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:48,332
It's over for me, Jack.

631
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:52,551
How'd you think this
would end, Carl?

632
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:11,653
Check our position.
Use the stars.

633
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:27,384
There are no stars, Captain.

634
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:31,215
What is that?

635
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:35,266
What? That.

636
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:40,892
That right there.

637
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,687
I don't know. What is it?
A coffee stain?

638
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:26,558
Station the forward lookout and get
me the depth by lead line.

639
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,322
Aye, Captain.

640
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,722
30 fathoms, no bottom!

641
00:46:43,562 --> 00:46:46,523
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

642
00:46:47,286 --> 00:46:49,146
Dead slow ahead, both.

643
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:54,163
You should stop the ship.

644
00:46:55,538 --> 00:46:57,327
15 degrees port.

645
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,920
We're getting
out of here, Mr. Hayes.

646
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,113
We'll find clear conditions.

647
00:47:04,786 --> 00:47:06,307
We have seabed!

648
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,524
25 fathoms!

649
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,862
We're shallowing!

650
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:18,290
20 degrees starboard!

651
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,413
Captain, you don't know where
the hell you're going!

652
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,113
Get me another reading!

653
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:26,933
Another reading!

654
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,191
22 fathoms!

655
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:34,781
Douse the lights. Aye, Captain.

656
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,164
10 fathoms!

657
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:02,502
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

658
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:21,192
Stop engines!

659
00:49:24,313 --> 00:49:26,105
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

660
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:28,261
Half astern both, Captain!

661
00:49:32,828 --> 00:49:34,019
Rocks!

662
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:38,276
Rocks!

663
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:44,998
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

664
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:47,863
To port! Rocks everywhere!

665
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:49,619
Take the wheel, Hayes.

666
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,955
Hang on!

667
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:32,711
Full ahead!

668
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,399
Rocks to port, Captain!

669
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:44,122
- Turn, Captain!
- Starboard, starboard!

670
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,776
Ah!

671
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:12,876
Shore up that breach!

672
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:16,207
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

673
00:52:18,242 --> 00:52:20,533
Hayes! She's taken a pounding!

674
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:24,231
What about the prop?

675
00:52:24,297 --> 00:52:26,484
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

676
00:52:26,558 --> 00:52:28,782
But she struck hard
against the rock!

677
00:52:29,786 --> 00:52:31,006
Captain!

678
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,438
Better come up quick!

679
00:52:35,305 --> 00:52:36,696
Right there!

680
00:52:51,474 --> 00:52:53,562
Want me to bring them back?

681
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:55,892
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

682
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,446
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

683
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:01,148
Come on, move it.

684
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:04,305
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

685
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,791
Can you believe this, Jack?

686
00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:18,950
We've got our picture.

687
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:19,095
Why does Marlow keep
going up the river?

688
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,453
Why doesn't he turn back?

689
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:27,716
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

690
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:32,204
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

691
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:36,092
But there's another part...

692
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,957
that needs to know.

693
00:54:42,193 --> 00:54:45,017
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

694
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:50,172
"We could not understand
because we were too far..."

695
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,233
<i>"and could not remember..."</i>

696
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:55,822
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages..."</i>

697
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,955
<i>"of those ages that are gone..."</i>

698
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:02,846
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories."</i>

699
00:55:05,713 --> 00:55:06,936
<i>"We are accustomed to look..."</i>

700
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,165
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster..."</i>

701
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:14,120
<i>"but there...</i>

702
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:19,249
<i>"there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free. ".</i>

703
00:55:29,236 --> 00:55:31,459
It's not an adventure story...

704
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,654
is it, Mr. Hayes?

705
00:55:35,655 --> 00:55:36,981
No, Jimmy.

706
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,480
It's not.

707
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:04,295
It's deserted. Of
course it's deserted.

708
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:07,790
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

709
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:12,012
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

710
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:28,158
Mr. Denham, I think
we should go back.

711
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,957
I will handle this.

712
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,007
Look. Chocolate.

713
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,971
You like chocolate?

714
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:44,428
It's good to eat.

715
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,022
You want?

716
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:55,240
Take it.

717
00:58:02,969 --> 00:58:05,326
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

718
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,811
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

719
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:16,166
She doesn't want the chocolate.

720
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:19,362
Aah!

721
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:42,689
All right!

722
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:45,539
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

723
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:48,971
They're harmless!

724
01:00:10,451 --> 01:00:11,506
Ann!

725
01:01:38,746 --> 01:01:39,835
Jack.

726
01:01:54,016 --> 01:01:55,408
Seen enough?

727
01:02:03,234 --> 01:02:04,887
Lighten the ship!

728
01:02:05,393 --> 01:02:09,048
Anything that's not bolted
down goes overboard!

729
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:12,871
Just heave it!

730
01:02:13,413 --> 01:02:14,635
We got away.

731
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:16,433
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

732
01:02:16,505 --> 01:02:20,262
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

733
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:24,254
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

734
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:28,374
And I'll tell you something else. I'm
gonna finish this film for Mike!

735
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:36,422
I'll finish it...

736
01:02:38,327 --> 01:02:40,621
and I'll donate the proceeds...

737
01:02:41,323 --> 01:02:43,116
to his wife and kids.

738
01:02:43,553 --> 01:02:47,100
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

739
01:02:47,943 --> 01:02:49,305
Hear, hear!

740
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:30,093
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

741
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:38,442
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

742
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,305
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

743
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:55,908
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

744
01:04:14,272 --> 01:04:15,428
Where's Ann? What?

745
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:16,661
Where's Ann?

746
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:23,025
Ann!

747
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,079
She's free!

748
01:04:50,406 --> 01:04:52,992
Full ahead, both engines!

749
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:01,684
Ann!

750
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:27,099
No! Stop! Turn back!

751
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:29,656
Stop!

752
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,352
We have to turn back.

753
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:35,209
They've taken Ann.

754
01:05:47,596 --> 01:05:50,675
Kong! Kong! Kong!

755
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:36,626
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

756
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:40,357
Jump to it! Jump
to it, gentlemen!

757
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:45,740
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

758
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:54,788
Come on, move it!

759
01:07:11,764 --> 01:07:13,421
Pull harder!

760
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:16,650
Row! Row!

761
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:18,045
Come on!

762
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:05,847
Kong.

763
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:29,607
Spread out! Find her!

764
01:10:38,394 --> 01:10:39,757
Miss Darrow!

765
01:10:39,957 --> 01:10:42,749
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

766
01:10:46,178 --> 01:10:47,202
Ann!

767
01:10:49,342 --> 01:10:51,095
She's here somewhere!

768
01:10:55,789 --> 01:10:57,616
What in God's name was that?

769
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,561
Behind the wall!

770
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:07,889
Behind the wall!

771
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:00,765
She's gone!

772
01:12:11,712 --> 01:12:13,469
Carl, what is it?

773
01:12:20,096 --> 01:12:21,753
You saw something.

774
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,698
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

775
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:35,156
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

776
01:12:35,229 --> 01:12:37,712
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

777
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:38,914
Choy!

778
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:42,240
Not you, Jimmy.

779
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:44,469
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

780
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:46,302
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

781
01:12:46,374 --> 01:12:47,701
Stay here.

782
01:12:48,206 --> 01:12:50,667
Miss Darrow needs me! No!

783
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:57,881
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

784
01:12:57,951 --> 01:13:00,380
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

785
01:13:00,849 --> 01:13:03,241
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

786
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:12,157
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

787
01:13:12,624 --> 01:13:14,414
And you got 24 hours!

788
01:13:14,885 --> 01:13:16,314
24 hours?

789
01:13:16,549 --> 01:13:18,705
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

790
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:43,619

791
01:13:45,992 --> 01:13:47,117

What is it?

795
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,211
Fire!

796
01:14:33,963 --> 01:14:35,298
Cut it out.

797
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,003
Hold your fire.

798
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,170
Hold your fire!

799
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:13,260
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

800
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:31,463
Come on. Come on. Come on.

801
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:05,025
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

802
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:11,459
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

803
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,122
They are now.

804
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:21,443
What the hell kind
of a place is this?

805
01:16:36,776 --> 01:16:38,170
Miss Darrow!

806
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:43,918
Ann!

807
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:00,247
No!

808
01:18:17,912 --> 01:18:20,103
Ann! Sailor: Miss Darrow!

809
01:18:28,693 --> 01:18:29,746
Ann!

810
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,455
Christ, it's a bleeding
boneyard!

811
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,315
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

812
01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:27,574
Ann! Ann!

813
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:43,039
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

814
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,096
Jesus, Jimmy. Hey, I need that!

815
01:19:45,174 --> 01:19:46,400
I'm not giving you a gun!

816
01:19:46,473 --> 01:19:48,493
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

817
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,118
I was in the army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

818
01:19:53,591 --> 01:19:55,712
I wanna help bring her back.

819
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:05,501
Don't make me regret it.

820
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:34,733
Conserve your ammunition!

821
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:45,547
I'm knackered.

822
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:49,906
- I can't breathe.
- I need a breather.

823
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:51,441
Fellows, we don't
have time for this.

824
01:20:51,509 --> 01:20:53,969
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

825
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:57,465
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

826
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,926
All right, you got five minutes!

827
01:21:00,161 --> 01:21:02,089
Everybody stay in sight.

828
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:09,510
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

829
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:41,014
Bloody Nora!

830
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:50,360
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

831
01:21:53,923 --> 01:21:58,043
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

832
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:06,365
The abominable snowman.

833
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:10,652
Yeah, a snowman. We dead meat.

834
01:22:11,356 --> 01:22:13,750
It's got to be
what, 20, 25 feet?

835
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,277
Carl saw it.

836
01:22:18,678 --> 01:22:20,164
Let's ask him.

837
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,460
Denham!

838
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:27,289
Where'd he go?

839
01:22:47,453 --> 01:22:49,211
Walk forward, Bruce.

840
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:51,537
What? You're the star
of this picture.

841
01:22:51,609 --> 01:22:54,660
Get into character and head
toward the animals.

842
01:23:00,794 --> 01:23:03,379
What the hell kind
of a place is this?

843
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:15,893
Are you sure about this, Denham?

844
01:23:16,395 --> 01:23:18,450
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

845
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,451
I need you in the shot, or people
will say they're fake.

846
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:23,708
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

847
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:34,349
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

848
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:35,722
I'm not moving.

849
01:23:41,481 --> 01:23:43,805
Mother of God.

850
01:24:05,701 --> 01:24:07,063
What's this?

851
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:34,673
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

852
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,532
Carl? He's up there, filming.

853
01:24:47,952 --> 01:24:49,347
Bugger this!

854
01:24:56,733 --> 01:24:58,526
Run, Jack!

855
01:25:01,324 --> 01:25:03,841
Holy Christ. Go, Jimmy, run!

856
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,237
Run, run, run!

857
01:25:13,102 --> 01:25:14,689
Let go! I'm not
leaving the camera!

858
01:25:14,763 --> 01:25:16,057
Let go, you idiot!

859
01:25:16,128 --> 01:25:17,956
Carl, run!

860
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:32,625
Get down.

861
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,483
Look out!

862
01:26:24,627 --> 01:26:26,147
Coming through!

863
01:27:30,265 --> 01:27:31,285
No!

864
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,970
Carl! Carl!

865
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:22,654
Get up! Come on. Come on.

866
01:28:37,471 --> 01:28:40,125
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

867
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:43,417
Herb! Herb, come on!

868
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,216
Take the tripod!

869
01:28:45,456 --> 01:28:46,681
Come on!

870
01:28:47,885 --> 01:28:50,435
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

871
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:51,532
Go!

872
01:28:51,608 --> 01:28:53,298
No, I'm not going
anywhere without you!

873
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:56,626
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

874
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:05,891
Jimmy, do a head count.

875
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:08,483
I want to know
how many are injured and how bad.

876
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,815
Injured?

877
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:12,978
Four of us are dead!

878
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:21,428
It's not your fault.

879
01:30:21,866 --> 01:30:24,554
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

880
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:27,421
You're absolutely
right, Preston.

881
01:30:27,824 --> 01:30:30,214
And I'll tell you
something else.

882
01:30:30,283 --> 01:30:32,575
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

883
01:30:32,978 --> 01:30:35,768
He died for what he believed
in, and I'm gonna honor that.

884
01:30:35,839 --> 01:30:39,889
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

885
01:30:40,365 --> 01:30:42,951
And we could all have
a piece of it...

886
01:30:43,159 --> 01:30:45,677
for the price
of an admission ticket.

887
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:49,605
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

888
01:30:50,008 --> 01:30:51,664
We'll finish it...

889
01:30:51,771 --> 01:30:54,663
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

890
01:31:02,385 --> 01:31:04,544
Come on, guys. We
need more rope.

891
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:08,256
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

892
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:12,016
Englehorn sails in nine hours. So?
We gotta find Miss Darrow.

893
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,549
Hey, do you hear me? We're
gonna be stranded here.

894
01:31:17,112 --> 01:31:20,501
Look, fellows, Miss Darrow
was a great gal, no question.

895
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:22,296
And she was a wonderful person.

896
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:25,589
It's a terrible loss and we're
all gonna miss her.

897
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:29,783
I always knew you were nothing
like the tough guy you play on screen.

898
01:31:29,852 --> 01:31:31,576
I just never figured
you for a coward.

899
01:31:31,648 --> 01:31:33,769
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

900
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:36,771
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

901
01:31:36,839 --> 01:31:40,389
In the real world, they got bad
teeth, a bald spot, and a beer gut.

902
01:31:40,464 --> 01:31:43,983
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

903
01:31:45,423 --> 01:31:46,910
Be seeing you.

904
01:31:48,154 --> 01:31:49,511
Anyone else?

905
01:31:51,045 --> 01:31:53,008
Well, see you. Come on.

906
01:36:48,865 --> 01:36:50,054
No!

907
01:36:50,759 --> 01:36:52,189
I said no!

908
01:36:59,643 --> 01:37:03,195
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

909
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,883
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

910
01:39:30,251 --> 01:39:31,626
Keep paddling.

911
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,382
What the hell was that?

912
01:40:52,284 --> 01:40:54,661
Come on. Get them out of there!

913
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:57,779
Preston!

914
01:41:02,901 --> 01:41:04,554
Give me your hand.

915
01:41:05,143 --> 01:41:06,347
Jack!

916
01:41:11,793 --> 01:41:13,081
Jack!

917
01:41:17,863 --> 01:41:19,149
- Choy!
- Help!

918
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,268
Swim, you filthy bugger.

919
01:42:30,039 --> 01:42:31,530
Choy!

920
01:42:33,332 --> 01:42:34,443
Stay with him.

921
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,938
Swim to shore
as fast as you can!

922
01:42:36,027 --> 01:42:37,024
Hold on. Preston!

923
01:42:37,772 --> 01:42:40,123
Whatever happens, don't
let go of the camera!

924
01:42:40,223 --> 01:42:41,805
Don't let go of the camera!

925
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,357
Come on, get
up out of that water.

926
01:42:52,868 --> 01:42:54,163
Get up!

927
01:43:33,826 --> 01:43:35,317
Come on, come on.

928
01:43:47,629 --> 01:43:49,574
Preston. Preston.

929
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:02,427
It's working.

930
01:44:20,718 --> 01:44:22,714
Did you get that, did you?

931
01:45:22,886 --> 01:45:24,210
No!

932
01:45:25,048 --> 01:45:26,214
No.

933
01:45:30,483 --> 01:45:31,565
No.

934
01:46:21,072 --> 01:46:22,194
What is it?

935
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,252
Mr. Hayes?

936
01:46:31,816 --> 01:46:34,402
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

937
01:46:34,912 --> 01:46:36,169
You understand?

938
01:46:36,741 --> 01:46:39,701
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

939
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:43,196
It's not about being
brave, Jimmy.

940
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:12,762
Go back!

941
01:47:14,802 --> 01:47:16,196
Back across the log!

942
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:18,951
I ain't gonna run! Get
Jimmy out of here!

943
01:47:19,194 --> 01:47:20,487
No! Get back! Get back!

944
01:47:25,383 --> 01:47:26,709
Move back!

945
01:47:44,322 --> 01:47:45,378
No!

946
01:47:50,643 --> 01:47:51,936
Look at me.

947
01:47:54,169 --> 01:47:56,721
Let him go! You got
to run, Jimmy.

948
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:02,252
Do as I say.

949
01:48:03,585 --> 01:48:04,981
Go with Jack.

950
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:08,466
Run!

951
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:14,394
No! Shoot him!

952
01:48:15,927 --> 01:48:16,925
No!

953
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:34,721
Here! Over here!

954
01:48:52,969 --> 01:48:54,931
Hold on! Hold on!

955
01:48:59,023 --> 01:49:01,282
Lumpy! Help me!

956
01:49:03,515 --> 01:49:04,911
Bloody hell, Choy!

957
01:54:25,916 --> 01:54:26,970
No!

958
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:32,330
Oh, my!

959
02:01:06,633 --> 02:01:07,926
Wait!

960
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:58,393
Carl.

961
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:05,044
Jimmy. Jimmy.

962
02:02:05,919 --> 02:02:06,917
Jimmy.

963
02:02:08,017 --> 02:02:09,174
You all right?

964
02:02:58,981 --> 02:03:00,240
No.

965
02:03:52,347 --> 02:03:54,364
Get off! Get it off!

966
02:04:01,897 --> 02:04:02,918
Get off!

967
02:04:16,762 --> 02:04:17,851
Get it off!

968
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:24,722
Kill it!

969
02:05:36,775 --> 02:05:38,171
Stop moving!

970
02:05:58,165 --> 02:05:59,889
Get it off my face!

971
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:03,251
Stay still. I am standing still.

972
02:06:05,749 --> 02:06:07,542
- Hold on.
- Be careful!

973
02:06:42,282 --> 02:06:44,897
Don't move! Stay
away from the walls!

974
02:06:45,573 --> 02:06:47,092
Coming through!

975
02:06:55,519 --> 02:06:58,108
Get out of there now! Climb!

976
02:07:05,383 --> 02:07:07,202
Nobody get in my way.

977
02:07:10,161 --> 02:07:11,912
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

978
02:07:11,999 --> 02:07:14,855
Get up the rope. Let's go.
Hurry up.

979
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:43,160
Jimmy, let's go.

980
02:07:47,791 --> 02:07:49,369
- Come on.
- Okay.

981
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:53,684
Go.

982
02:07:58,516 --> 02:08:00,396
Just as you go down...

983
02:08:01,423 --> 02:08:03,708
for the third and final time...

984
02:08:04,751 --> 02:08:07,663
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

985
02:08:08,245 --> 02:08:10,653
and your lungs
fill with water...

986
02:08:10,906 --> 02:08:15,177
do you know what happens in those last
precious seconds before you drown?

987
02:08:15,426 --> 02:08:18,309
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope. Come on.
Get out of here. Come on.

988
02:08:18,386 --> 02:08:20,957
Your whole life passes
before your eyes.

989
02:08:21,143 --> 02:08:23,590
And if you've lived
as a true American...

990
02:08:23,662 --> 02:08:25,700
you get to watch
it all in colour.

991
02:08:26,915 --> 02:08:28,540
Oh, and you will.

992
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:31,284
Now, why don't you climb
up the rope, huh? Come on.

993
02:08:36,466 --> 02:08:38,554
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

994
02:11:32,475 --> 02:11:33,994
It's beautiful.

995
02:11:55,396 --> 02:11:56,723
Beautiful.

996
02:12:08,174 --> 02:12:09,501
Beautiful.

997
02:12:56,776 --> 02:12:57,967
There.

998
02:13:01,038 --> 02:13:02,126
Thank God.

999
02:13:02,202 --> 02:13:04,161
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

1000
02:13:04,261 --> 02:13:06,225
He insisted on a rescue mission.

1001
02:13:07,558 --> 02:13:11,006
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

1002
02:13:12,312 --> 02:13:14,569
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

1003
02:13:14,641 --> 02:13:18,069
No matter how many times you
flush them down the toilet...

1004
02:13:18,136 --> 02:13:20,621
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

1005
02:13:21,565 --> 02:13:24,386
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

1006
02:13:25,156 --> 02:13:27,813
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

1007
02:13:35,736 --> 02:13:36,960
Driscoll!

1008
02:13:38,431 --> 02:13:42,085
Don't be a fool! Give it up.
It's useless!

1009
02:13:43,354 --> 02:13:44,714
She's dead.

1010
02:13:47,514 --> 02:13:49,067
She's not dead.

1011
02:13:52,967 --> 02:13:55,191
Jack's gonna bring her back...

1012
02:13:56,162 --> 02:13:58,749
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

1013
02:13:59,459 --> 02:14:01,976
We can still come
out of this thing okay.

1014
02:14:04,579 --> 02:14:06,134
More than okay.

1015
02:14:07,377 --> 02:14:08,929
Think about it.

1016
02:14:09,006 --> 02:14:11,826
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1017
02:14:12,759 --> 02:14:14,653
You wanna trap the ape?

1018
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:23,099
I don't think so.

1019
02:14:23,673 --> 02:14:27,101
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

1020
02:14:28,599 --> 02:14:30,355
I heard you were the best.

1021
02:14:38,446 --> 02:14:39,571
Jack!

1022
02:14:42,637 --> 02:14:44,394
Look after yourself!

1023
02:14:45,032 --> 02:14:46,655
Keep the gate open, will you?

1024
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:48,425
Sure thing, buddy.

1025
02:14:49,459 --> 02:14:50,786
Good luck!

1026
02:15:04,028 --> 02:15:05,391
I'm sorry.

1027
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:44,837
Ann.

1028
02:18:53,181 --> 02:18:54,271
Jack!

1029
02:18:55,145 --> 02:18:56,235
Run!

1030
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:28,073
Jack, Jack!

1031
02:19:35,763 --> 02:19:36,920
Jack.

1032
02:19:45,946 --> 02:19:47,910
Ann, it's okay.

1033
02:19:48,742 --> 02:19:51,131
Ann, let's go. Let's go.
Come on!

1034
02:20:04,376 --> 02:20:05,738
Let's go. Come on.

1035
02:20:06,474 --> 02:20:07,699
Come on!

1036
02:21:39,692 --> 02:21:40,780
Carl!

1037
02:21:40,954 --> 02:21:43,642
Please! Somebody help us!

1038
02:21:45,779 --> 02:21:47,242
They've gone.

1039
02:21:48,808 --> 02:21:50,858
Carl. Christ.

1040
02:21:51,435 --> 02:21:52,522
Carl!

1041
02:21:53,362 --> 02:21:55,518
Drop the bridge. Do it
now, for Christ's sake!

1042
02:21:55,593 --> 02:21:56,817
Not yet.

1043
02:21:58,256 --> 02:21:59,345
Wait.

1044
02:22:00,019 --> 02:22:01,107
Wait.

1045
02:22:05,242 --> 02:22:06,332
Wait!

1046
02:22:17,019 --> 02:22:18,245
Come on!

1047
02:23:30,507 --> 02:23:31,993
Now! Throw them!

1048
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:33,465
Throw!

1049
02:23:34,332 --> 02:23:35,354
No!

1050
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,953
Hold him!

1051
02:23:39,025 --> 02:23:40,510
Are you out of your mind?

1052
02:23:49,207 --> 02:23:51,326
- ♪ Stop! Hold the line! ♪

1053
02:23:52,066 --> 02:23:53,460
Keep him down!

1054
02:23:59,021 --> 02:24:00,019
Heave!

1055
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:02,376
Please!

1056
02:24:02,845 --> 02:24:04,535
No! Stop!

1057
02:24:04,875 --> 02:24:05,873
Jack.

1058
02:24:06,939 --> 02:24:08,198
No. Get her out of...

1059
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:10,160
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

1060
02:24:10,227 --> 02:24:12,188
No! Get her out of his sight!

1061
02:24:12,256 --> 02:24:14,184
It's too late. Throw it!

1062
02:24:16,448 --> 02:24:17,540
Look out!

1063
02:24:19,844 --> 02:24:21,306
Let go of me.

1064
02:24:25,433 --> 02:24:27,056
We gotta go. Come on.

1065
02:24:27,631 --> 02:24:28,820
Come on. Stop it.

1066
02:24:28,893 --> 02:24:30,411
Leave me alone!

1067
02:24:31,587 --> 02:24:33,105
Ann, please come on.

1068
02:24:40,403 --> 02:24:42,229
No. No!

1069
02:24:42,432 --> 02:24:44,690
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1070
02:24:46,892 --> 02:24:48,411
All of you, run!

1071
02:24:48,489 --> 02:24:49,849
Come on. Come on!

1072
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:09,222
Look out!

1073
02:25:19,946 --> 02:25:21,586
Move it! Move it!

1074
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:25,310
Come on, come on!

1075
02:25:34,227 --> 02:25:35,851
Stay there! It's me he wants!

1076
02:25:35,925 --> 02:25:38,115
Please stop this! Move!
Hold onto her!

1077
02:25:38,189 --> 02:25:40,843
Ann, go. Please,
I can stop this!

1078
02:25:40,917 --> 02:25:42,435
No! Ann, stay there!

1079
02:25:44,909 --> 02:25:46,303
Get it out!

1080
02:25:49,035 --> 02:25:50,889
Get the hell out of here!

1081
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:52,942
Come on! Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.

1082
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:54,313
Don't be crazy.

1083
02:25:55,518 --> 02:25:56,606
Let me go!

1084
02:25:57,946 --> 02:25:59,410
Cast off!

1085
02:26:01,706 --> 02:26:02,963
Come on, Carl!

1086
02:26:04,433 --> 02:26:06,259
- Row!
- Wait.

1087
02:26:06,530 --> 02:26:08,653
Row, God damn it!

1088
02:26:18,874 --> 02:26:19,996
Go back.

1089
02:26:26,892 --> 02:26:28,015
Jimmy, no!

1090
02:26:34,974 --> 02:26:35,972
No!

1091
02:26:53,005 --> 02:26:54,832
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1092
02:26:54,902 --> 02:26:56,422
Hide out in the back!

1093
02:27:18,926 --> 02:27:20,547
Wait! No!

1094
02:27:21,253 --> 02:27:23,838
No! No! Please don't!

1095
02:29:21,715 --> 02:29:24,232
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1096
02:29:26,974 --> 02:29:28,958
We're millionaires, boys!

1097
02:29:29,268 --> 02:29:31,161
I'll share it with all of you!

1098
02:29:31,993 --> 02:29:36,476
In a few months his name will be
up in lights on Broadway!

1099
02:29:38,650 --> 02:29:42,734
Kong! The Eighth
Wonder of the World!

1100
02:30:45,853 --> 02:30:47,874
What can I say? What can I say?

1101
02:30:47,952 --> 02:30:49,345
Any comments, sir?

1102
02:30:50,674 --> 02:30:52,295
The Mayor, thank you.

1103
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:54,499
Ready.

1104
02:30:54,666 --> 02:30:55,993
What am I?

1105
02:30:56,397 --> 02:30:58,122
Thank you very much.

1106
02:31:01,952 --> 02:31:03,437
Get used to it.

1107
02:31:03,648 --> 02:31:05,307
Listen, great to see you. Ready?

1108
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:06,845
I'm really appreciating that...

1109
02:31:06,913 --> 02:31:08,374
Look at you! I remember you.

1110
02:31:08,441 --> 02:31:11,422
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

1111
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:13,291
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1112
02:31:27,073 --> 02:31:28,230
Carl!

1113
02:31:30,097 --> 02:31:31,289
Zelman! I told you.

1114
02:31:31,362 --> 02:31:32,825
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1115
02:31:32,893 --> 02:31:34,879
Let's get a shot of this.

1116
02:31:35,355 --> 02:31:36,479
Come on.

1117
02:31:37,220 --> 02:31:39,543
Big smile. Yeah! That's great!

1118
02:31:41,909 --> 02:31:44,837
<i>Look at yourself. Look
at what you've become.</i>

1119
02:31:45,467 --> 02:31:48,142
- ♪ No woman is worth this. ♪
♪ This woman is worth it. ♪

1120
02:31:48,167 --> 02:31:50,148
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1121
02:31:50,226 --> 02:31:51,451
Oh, really?

1122
02:31:51,523 --> 02:31:53,179
She's not gonna buy
this for a second.

1123
02:31:53,253 --> 02:31:55,443
Shut up and hand
me the grapefruit!

1124
02:31:57,580 --> 02:32:00,234
<i>- You're writing a comedy?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1125
02:32:00,973 --> 02:32:02,901
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

1126
02:32:04,834 --> 02:32:06,695
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1127
02:32:07,695 --> 02:32:10,085
<i>Why would I write
a play for you?</i>

1128
02:32:13,479 --> 02:32:15,104
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1129
02:32:15,378 --> 02:32:16,865
Oh, I'm sorry.

1130
02:32:18,107 --> 02:32:19,965
I couldn't help but overhear.

1131
02:32:23,461 --> 02:32:26,186
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1132
02:32:26,259 --> 02:32:29,048
and halfway through the hors
d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1133
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,304
And that's when he told
you how he felt?

1134
02:32:31,377 --> 02:32:34,099
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1135
02:32:34,171 --> 02:32:36,134
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1136
02:32:36,202 --> 02:32:38,221
Well, then how does
she know that it's real?

1137
02:32:38,298 --> 02:32:41,746
He said it was not about the words.
Oh, please!

1138
02:32:41,956 --> 02:32:46,076
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1139
02:32:46,451 --> 02:32:50,736
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1140
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:54,023
It never happened.

1141
02:32:55,032 --> 02:32:56,791
That's how it ended.

1142
02:32:56,929 --> 02:33:00,649
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1143
02:33:02,519 --> 02:33:05,876
I honestly believed things
might actually work out...

1144
02:33:06,978 --> 02:33:08,962
which was really very...

1145
02:33:12,232 --> 02:33:13,455
foolish.

1146
02:33:13,695 --> 02:33:16,318
Men. Oh, they'll give
you the world...

1147
02:33:16,393 --> 02:33:18,786
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1148
02:33:18,854 --> 02:33:20,748
slip through their fingers.

1149
02:33:20,816 --> 02:33:22,040
Typical.

1150
02:33:22,648 --> 02:33:26,301
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1151
02:33:27,272 --> 02:33:29,167
Romance. Who needs it?

1152
02:33:53,852 --> 02:33:55,181
Thank you.

1153
02:33:56,016 --> 02:33:57,377
Thank you.

1154
02:34:00,309 --> 02:34:01,635
Thank you.

1155
02:34:03,433 --> 02:34:04,796
Thank you.

1156
02:34:06,597 --> 02:34:08,059
Ladies and gentlemen...

1157
02:34:09,653 --> 02:34:12,135
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1158
02:34:12,912 --> 02:34:14,636
The story of our adventure...

1159
02:34:15,473 --> 02:34:18,436
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1160
02:34:19,399 --> 02:34:20,886
their lives lost...

1161
02:34:21,663 --> 02:34:23,749
in pursuit of a savage beast...

1162
02:34:24,924 --> 02:34:27,511
a monstrous
aberration of nature.

1163
02:34:28,749 --> 02:34:30,869
But even the meanest
brute can be tamed.

1164
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:33,901
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1165
02:34:34,371 --> 02:34:36,028
the beast was no match...

1166
02:34:36,635 --> 02:34:38,188
for the charms of a girl.

1167
02:34:41,657 --> 02:34:43,243
A girl from New York...

1168
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:48,242
Who melted his heart...

1169
02:34:48,945 --> 02:34:51,530
bringing to mind that old
Arabian proverb...

1170
02:34:53,467 --> 02:34:56,623
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty..."

1171
02:34:57,661 --> 02:34:59,554
"and beauty stayed his hand."

1172
02:35:00,855 --> 02:35:04,712
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1173
02:35:12,465 --> 02:35:15,914
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1174
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:19,043
the greatest thing your eyes
have ever beheld.

1175
02:35:20,185 --> 02:35:24,836
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1176
02:35:26,042 --> 02:35:27,698
Ladies and gentlemen...

1177
02:35:27,772 --> 02:35:32,285
I give you Kong, The Eighth
Wonder of the World!

1178
02:35:41,643 --> 02:35:44,763
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1179
02:35:45,071 --> 02:35:48,497
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1180
02:36:09,184 --> 02:36:10,977
Observe, if you will...

1181
02:36:14,242 --> 02:36:16,207
I am touching the beast.

1182
02:36:16,506 --> 02:36:20,726
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1183
02:36:27,852 --> 02:36:29,471
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1184
02:36:48,745 --> 02:36:50,932
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1185
02:36:51,006 --> 02:36:52,629
a surprise guest.

1186
02:36:53,434 --> 02:36:55,624
The real-life hero
of this story.

1187
02:36:56,031 --> 02:36:58,457
The man who hunted
down the mighty Kong!

1188
02:37:00,122 --> 02:37:04,876
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1189
02:37:06,047 --> 02:37:08,371
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1190
02:37:14,228 --> 02:37:16,283
Thank you. Thank you.

1191
02:37:16,958 --> 02:37:18,114
Thank you.

1192
02:37:45,732 --> 02:37:47,160
He was right.

1193
02:37:48,725 --> 02:37:51,514
About there still being
some mystery left in this world...

1194
02:37:52,684 --> 02:37:54,976
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1195
02:37:55,345 --> 02:37:57,603
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1196
02:37:59,170 --> 02:38:01,463
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1197
02:38:03,564 --> 02:38:06,957
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

1198
02:38:21,363 --> 02:38:23,949
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1199
02:38:24,024 --> 02:38:27,315
for we now come to the climax
of this savage ritual.

1200
02:38:27,519 --> 02:38:30,001
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1201
02:38:30,778 --> 02:38:34,397
Behold her terror as she is offered
up to the mighty Kong!

1202
02:38:35,636 --> 02:38:39,685
A big hand, folks, for the bravest
girl I've ever met!

1203
02:38:40,427 --> 02:38:41,686
Miss Ann Darrow.

1204
02:39:29,528 --> 02:39:31,252
Save me from the beast!

1205
02:39:40,108 --> 02:39:41,333
Help me!

1206
02:39:45,466 --> 02:39:46,760
Where is she?

1207
02:39:47,927 --> 02:39:49,479
Where's Ann? I have no idea.

1208
02:39:49,556 --> 02:39:52,946
I heard he offered her all kinds
of money and she turned him down flat.

Here's your story, boys.

1220
02:40:40,027 --> 02:40:43,112
"Beauty and the man who saved
her from the beast."

1221
02:40:48,843 --> 02:40:49,836
No.

1222
02:40:58,156 --> 02:41:00,015
We have to get these
people out of here.

1223
02:41:00,085 --> 02:41:02,071
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1224
02:41:03,811 --> 02:41:06,002
Let him roar. It makes
a swell picture.

1225
02:41:07,838 --> 02:41:08,858
Head for the exits.

1226
02:41:08,934 --> 02:41:11,362
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1227
02:41:19,514 --> 02:41:20,740
Excuse me, fellows.

1228
02:41:21,678 --> 02:41:24,365
Coming through. Coming
through, fellows.

1229
02:41:27,932 --> 02:41:30,914
Get me down! Help me, please!

1230
02:41:33,321 --> 02:41:36,215

There they are.

Come on, pal, we gotta
draw him off.

1241
02:44:52,199 --> 02:44:54,025
It's all yours, buddy.

1242
02:45:10,398 --> 02:45:12,121
Hey, get out of here, lady!

1243

Come on.

Come on. Come on.

1246
02:46:06,192 --> 02:46:07,188
Look out.

1247
02:46:29,778 --> 02:46:31,003
Jesus Christ.

1248
02:51:53,616 --> 02:51:54,704
Fire!

1249
02:51:57,107 --> 02:51:58,197
Stop!

1250
02:52:13,630 --> 02:52:15,069
Listen up.

1251
02:52:15,158 --> 02:52:18,102
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1252
02:52:18,192 --> 02:52:19,643
You hear me?

1253
02:52:20,275 --> 02:52:22,891
It was built
for humans, by humans.

1254
02:52:22,975 --> 02:52:25,297
Not for stinking
lice-infested apes.

1255
02:52:25,551 --> 02:52:27,300
The thought
of some mutant gorilla...

1256
02:52:27,385 --> 02:52:32,072
crapping all over the streets of this
fair city, fills me with disgust.

1257
02:52:32,169 --> 02:52:34,163
So this is how it's gonna be.

1258
02:52:34,240 --> 02:52:36,569
We find it. We kill it.

1259
02:52:36,652 --> 02:52:39,896
We cut it's ugly head
off and we ram it up...

1260
02:52:59,861 --> 02:53:01,416
No. No.

1261
02:55:32,530 --> 02:55:33,859
Beautiful.

1262
02:55:40,285 --> 02:55:41,340
Yes.

1263
02:55:43,977 --> 02:55:45,337
Yes, it is.

1264
03:00:40,998 --> 03:00:42,120
Hey! Hey!

1265
03:00:42,394 --> 03:00:44,016
Nobody past this point.

1266
03:00:45,255 --> 03:00:46,877
You can't go in there!

1267
03:00:48,216 --> 03:00:49,212
Hey!

1268
03:00:51,308 --> 03:00:52,599
Stop him!

1269
03:00:55,697 --> 03:00:57,954
Hey! Get back. You're
not allowed up there!

Move along.

1277
03:08:46,016 --> 03:08:47,912
Just one shot! One shot!

1278
03:08:48,579 --> 03:08:50,667
Come, come! Boys,
how about a photo?

1279
03:08:50,742 --> 03:08:51,737
Look at me.

1280
03:08:51,838 --> 03:08:53,560
Come on, watch the camera.

1281
03:08:56,396 --> 03:08:57,916
Come a little closer.

1282
03:08:58,593 --> 03:09:00,782
That's it, folks. Show's over.
Step back!

1283
03:09:00,856 --> 03:09:03,042
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1284
03:09:03,748 --> 03:09:05,301
Why'd he do that?

1285
03:09:05,610 --> 03:09:08,073
Climb up there and get
himself cornered.

1286
03:09:08,141 --> 03:09:10,462
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1287
03:09:10,533 --> 03:09:13,184
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1288
03:09:19,382 --> 03:09:22,103
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1289
03:09:24,670 --> 03:09:26,635
It wasn't the airplanes.

1290
03:09:30,992 --> 03:09:33,281
It was beauty killed the beast.
