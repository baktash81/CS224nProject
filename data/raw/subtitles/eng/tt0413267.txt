1
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,754
Onward, Chauncey!

2
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,490
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

3
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,491
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Charming!

4
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,941
This is worse than ''Love Letters''.
l hate dinner theater!

5
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,845
Me, too.

6
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,948
Whoa there, Chauncey!

7
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,351
Hark! The brave Prince Charming
approacheth.

8
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,955
Fear not, fair maiden. l shall slay
the monster that guards you...

9
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,460
...then take my place as rightful king.

10
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,529
What did she say?

11
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,569
lt's Shrek!

12
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,570
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

13
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,708
Prepare, foul beast...

14
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,709
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

15
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,216
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

16
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,817
Do you mind?

17
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,818
Do you mind? Boring!

18
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,493
Prepare, foul beast...

19
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,672
Someday you'll be sorry.

20
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,673
We already are!

21
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,967
Mommy...

22
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,206
You're right. l can't let this happen.

23
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,045
l can't!

24
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,046
l am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

25
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,385
And l promise you this, Mother...

26
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,386
...l will restore dignity to my throne.

27
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,960
And this time,

28
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,961
no one will stand in my way.

29
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,750
Good morning.

30
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,751
Good morning.

31
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,255
Morning breath.

32
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,256
l know. lsn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,595
Good morning, good morning

34
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,130
The sun is shining through

35
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,466
Good morning, good morning
To you

36
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,467
And you!
And you!

37
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,341
They grow up so fast.

38
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,342
Not fast enough.

39
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,348
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

40
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,349
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

41
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,685
Great! Let's get started.

42
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,122
Come on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

43
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,792
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

44
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,502
I got some sleep and I needed it

45
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,741
Not a lot, just a little bit

46
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,742
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

47
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,978
It's a crying shame

48
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,983
It's a royalpain in the neck

49
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,984
l knight thee.

50
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,508
lf you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

51
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,778
Can somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

52
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,683
l will see what l can do.

53
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,873
Yeah, wow.

54
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,874
ls this really necessary?

55
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,945
Quite necessary, Fiona.

56
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,881
- l'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

57
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,882
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

58
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,787
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

59
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,788
l don't know how much longer
l can keep this up.

60
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,392
l'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

61
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,462
lt's just until Dad gets better.

62
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,234
Shrek?

63
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,969
You look handsome.

64
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,970
Come here, you.

65
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,253
My butt is itching up a storm and
l can't reach it in this monkey suit.

66
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,759
Hey, you! Come here. What's your name?

67
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,330
Fiddlesworth, sir.

68
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,331
Perfect.

69
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,603
Ladies and gentlemen...

70
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,604
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

71
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,012
Ahh! You've got it.

72
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,782
A little to the left.

73
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,117
That's it! That's good.

74
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,118
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

75
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,355
Shrek!

76
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,961
My eye!

77
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,962
What are you doing?

78
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,703
Fiona!

79
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,808
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. l'm fine.

80
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,648
Shrimp! My favorite!

81
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,329
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Calm down.

82
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,330
Calm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? l am an ogre.

83
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,402
l'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and l never will be.

84
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,577
l think that went well.

85
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,945
Donkey!

86
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,180
Come on, Shrek!

87
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,181
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

88
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,694
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

89
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,432
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

90
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,869
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

91
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,905
You had me at ''vermin-filled''.

92
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,375
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

93
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,549
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

94
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,050
Uh, no.

95
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,051
What l'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

96
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,055
Donkey?

97
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,056
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

98
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,995
...they were little ogre feet?

99
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,570
Honey, let's be rational about this.

100
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,575
Have you seen a baby lately?

101
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,576
Theyjust eat and poop, and they cry...

102
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,913
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

103
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,351
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

104
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,352
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

105
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,290
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

106
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:24,027
Right now, you're my family.

107
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,601
Somebody better be dying.

108
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,705
l'm dying.

109
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,276
Harold?

110
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,613
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

111
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,849
Of course, darling.

112
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
Fiona.

113
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,388
Yes, Daddy?

114
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,389
l know l made many mistakes with you.

115
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,727
lt's okay.

116
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,728
But your love for Shrek has...

117
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,798
...taught me much.

118
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,469
My dear boy...

119
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,470
...l am proud to call you my son.

120
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,873
And l'm proud to call you my frog...

121
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,712
...King dad-in-law.

122
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,713
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

123
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,662
The Frog King... is dead.

124
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,941
Put your hat back on, fool.

125
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,676
Shrek...

126
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,677
...please come hither.

127
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,683
Yeah, Dad?

128
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,684
This kingdom needs a new king.

129
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,188
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

130
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,528
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

131
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,866
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

132
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,873
Come on, Dad. An ogre as king?

133
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,378
That's not such a good idea.

134
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,379
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

135
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,816
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

136
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,155
Really? Who is he, Dad?

137
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,491
His name is...

138
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,128
...is...

139
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,897
What's his name?

140
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,898
...is...

141
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,401
Daddy!

142
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,854
His name is Arthur.

143
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,855
Arthur?

144
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,594
l know you'll do...

145
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,931
...what's right.

146
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,104
Harold?

147
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,105
Dad? Dad!

148
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,942
Dad?

149
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,943
Do your thing, man.

150
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,474
When you were young and yourheart

151
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,478
Was an open book

152
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,649
You used to say live and let live

153
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,920
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

154
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,057
But ifthis everchanging world
In which we live in

155
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,997
Makes you give in and cry

156
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,670
Say live and let die

157
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,276
Live and let die

158
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,447
Hey, lady
You, lady

159
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,054
Cursing atyourlife

160
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,055
You're a discontented mother

161
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,392
And a regimented wife

162
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,754
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

163
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,093
Ah, Mabel!

164
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,094
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
l'll never know.

165
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,599
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

166
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,836
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

167
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,442
What do you want, Charming?

168
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,443
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

169
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,716
And a Fuzzy Navel.

170
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,717
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

171
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,225
We're not your friends.

172
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,330
You don't belong here.

173
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,331
You're absolutely right,
but, l mean, do any of us?

174
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,403
Do a number on his face.

175
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,404
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

176
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,142
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

177
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,413
Oh, what's it to you?

178
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,815
They left you the unfairest of them all.

179
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,816
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

180
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,487
How does that feel?

181
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,529
Pretty unfair.

182
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,064
And you!

183
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,065
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

184
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,439
l hate that little wooden puppet.

185
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,541
And Hook.

186
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,542
Need l say more?

187
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,749
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

188
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,750
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

189
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,788
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

190
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,826
...into that tiny glass slipper?

191
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,397
Cinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

192
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,067
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

193
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,841
...that has ever done you wrong!

194
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,842
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

195
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,913
But there are
two sides to every story...

196
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,618
...and our side has not been told!

197
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,619
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

198
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,425
Who wants their...

199
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,426
...''happily ever after''?

200
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,780
This way, gents.

201
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,793
lt's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

202
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,964
But l will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

203
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,470
As are you.

204
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,972
And, uh, you.

205
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,973
l don't know you, but l'd like to.

206
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,046
l got to go!

207
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,881
l don't wanna leave you either.

208
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,882
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

209
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,653
But don't worry. l'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

210
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,825
Be strong, babies.

211
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,394
Coco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

212
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,395
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

213
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,168
That's my special boy!

214
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,169
Come here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

215
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,180
Shrek?

216
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,181
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

217
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,619
Come on. There's no way
l could run a kingdom.

218
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,289
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

219
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,094
lt's not that. You see...

220
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,095
And if he gives me trouble,
l always have persuasion and reason.

221
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

222
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,973
Fiona...

223
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,974
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

224
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,377
...and our swamp.

225
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,881
lt's not going to be just you and me.

226
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,651
All aboard!

227
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,721
lt will be. l promise.

228
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,725
l love you.

229
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,634
That's lovely.

230
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,635
Bye-bye, babies!

231
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,245
Shrek!

232
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,581
- Wait!
- What is it?

233
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,582
l'm... l'm...

234
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,088
l love you, too, honey!

235
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,089
No! l said l'm...

236
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,496
You're what?

237
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,497
l said l'm pregnant!

238
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,704
What was that?

239
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,705
You're going to be a father!

240
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,544
That's great!

241
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,545
Really? l'm glad you think so!

242
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,482
l love you!

243
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,618
Yeah!

244
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,619
Me, too! You!

245
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,825
l'm going to be an uncle!
l'm going to be an uncle!

246
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,462
And you, my friend, are royally...

247
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,237
Home.

248
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,517
Shrek!

249
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,187
Fiona!

250
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,526
Fiona?

251
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Oh, no.

252
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,651
Better out than in, l always say.

253
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,230
No, no, no!

254
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,734
lt's okay. lt's gonna be all right.

255
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,575
Stop! Hey, wait!

256
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,794
Donkey. Donkey!

257
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,795
Wake up!

258
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,465
Dada!

259
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,236
Shrek! Are you okay?

260
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,973
l can't believe l'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

261
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,645
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

262
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,651
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

263
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,652
l know how it happened.

264
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,989
l just can't believe it.

265
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,827
How does it happen?

266
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,669
And the cat's in the cradle
and the silverspoon

267
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,843
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

268
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,579
When you coming home, son?
I don't know when

269
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,015
But we'll get together then, Dad.

270
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,150
Donkey! Can you just cut to the part

271
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:16,151
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

272
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,089
You know l love Fiona, boss. Right?

273
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,090
What l am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

274
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,295
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

275
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,035
Don't listen to him!

276
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,871
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

277
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,872
lt's not my life l'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

278
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,543
When have you ever heard the phrase
''as sweet as an ogre''...

279
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,549
...or ''as nurturing as an ogre''...

280
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,550
...or ''You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre.''

281
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,956
Okay. l get it.

282
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,957
lt's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

283
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,394
That's true.

284
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,996
l'm doomed.

285
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,565
You'll be fine.

286
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,566
You're finished.

287
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,737
Uh, with yourjourney.

288
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,581
''Wor-ces-ters-shiree''?
Now that sounds fancy!

289
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,620
lt's Worcestershire.

290
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,588
Like the sauce?

291
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,589
lt's spicy!

292
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,761
They must be expecting us.

293
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,437
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

294
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,438
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

295
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,077
High school?

296
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,779
Ready? Okay!

297
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,348
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

298
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,349
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

299
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,453
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

300
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,194
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

301
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,535
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

302
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,372
l'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

303
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,009
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

304
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,814
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

305
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,850
So l was all like, ''l'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you.''

306
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,523
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

307
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,524
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

308
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,663
l just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

309
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,366
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

310
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,367
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

311
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,740
l know you're busy not fitting in, but
can you tell me where l can find Arthur?

312
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,378
He's over there.

313
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,866
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

314
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,706
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

315
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,709
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

316
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,281
Sorry.

317
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,051
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

318
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,620
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

319
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,455
lt's top secret!

320
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:41,456
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

321
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,330
Greetings, Your Majesty.

322
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,732
This is your lucky day.

323
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,968
What are you supposed to be?

324
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,969
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

325
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

326
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,311
Unhand me, monster!

327
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,414
Stop squirming, Arthur.

328
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,415
l'm not Arthur.

329
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,421
l am Lancelot.

330
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,422
That dork over there is Arthur.

331
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,498
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

332
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,234
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

333
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:27,235
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

334
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,006
Excuse me?

335
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:32,007
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

336
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,615
Oh, Arthur...

337
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,616
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

338
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,124
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

339
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,125
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

340
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,635
Hold it.

341
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,636
We're here for the mascot contest.

342
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,376
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

343
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,381
This is a costume?

344
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,382
Worked on it all night long.

345
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,653
Looks pretty real to me.

346
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,654
lf he were real, could l do this?

347
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,660
Or this?

348
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,661
lf it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

349
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,666
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

350
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,003
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his lecture...

351
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,275
...on ''just say nay''.

352
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,276
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

353
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

354
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,352
...ogre?

355
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,856
That's right. l'm the new mascot.

356
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,857
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

357
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,628
...whatever it is they're doing!

358
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,301
This is all a bit unorthodox...

359
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,437
Where can l find Arthur Pendragon?

360
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,377
Hey, wait...

361
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,750
Classic.

362
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,585
You should be ashamed of yourself!

363
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,586
l didn't do it. They did.

364
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,661
Please don't eat me.

365
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,662
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

366
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,998
l'm not here to eat him!

367
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,904
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

368
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,273
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

369
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,274
What?

370
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,477
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

371
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Burn.

372
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,291
ls this for real?

373
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,292
Absolutely. Clean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

374
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,830
So, wait...l'm really the only heir?

375
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,502
The one and only.

376
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,503
Give me a second.

377
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,308
My good people...

378
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,178
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

379
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,179
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

380
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,617
''Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

381
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,355
Maybe l should cut him some slack.

382
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,356
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

383
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,859
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
l don't know, a king?

384
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,696
Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him.''

385
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,868
l'm looking at you, jousting team!

386
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,071
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

387
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,142
l've always loved you.

388
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,047
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

389
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,048
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while l rule the free world!

390
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,419
Okay, let's not overdo it.

391
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,420
l'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

392
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,890
You just overdid it.

393
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,669
Look at you!

394
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,337
You look darling.

395
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,673
Just precious. Look at her.

396
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,175
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

397
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,176
No. Not at all.

398
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,514
Do you smell ham?

399
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,515
lt's present time!

400
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Fiona, please open mine first.
lt's the one in front.

401
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,724
''Congratulations on your new
mess mak...'' Oh, mess maker!

402
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,495
''Hopefully this helps.
Love, Cinderella.''

403
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,833
- Look at that!
- What is it?

404
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,671
lt's for the poopies.

405
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,373
Wait... babies poop?

406
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,841
Everyone poops, Beauty.

407
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,443
Fiona!

408
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,444
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

409
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,949
Ta-da!

410
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,919
You know the baby will love it,
because l do!

411
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

412
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,557
Who's this one from?

413
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,558
l got you the biggest one,
because l love you most.

414
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,627
''Have one on me. Love, Snow White.''

415
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,301
What is it?

416
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,969
He's a live-in babysitter.

417
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,204
Where's the baby?

418
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,205
You're too kind, Snow,
but l can't accept this.

419
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,910
lt's nothing. l have six more at home.

420
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,812
- What does he do?
- Cleaning.

421
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,547
- Feeding.
- Burping.

422
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,150
So, what are
Shrek and l supposed to do?

423
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,419
Work on your marriage.

424
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

425
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,424
Come on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

426
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,563
You're tired all the time.

427
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,432
You start letting yourself go.

428
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,733
Stretch marks.

429
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,734
Say goodbye to romance.

430
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,405
l'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

431
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,675
She's right!

432
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,676
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

433
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,248
How did Shrek react when you told him?

434
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,252
When he first found out, Shrek said...

435
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,268
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

436
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,278
Now... bombs away!

437
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,963
Well, well, well. lf it isn't Peter Pan.

438
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,966
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

439
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,987
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

440
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,610
You go! Take care of the baby!

441
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,611
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

442
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,453
Everyone in! Now!

443
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,454
Come on! Put some back into it!

444
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,560
We don't have time. Now go!

445
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,561
Quickly, ladies!

446
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,632
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

447
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,417
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

448
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,719
The name doesn't ring a bell.

449
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,555
No bell.

450
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,556
l suggest you freaks cooperate...

451
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,794
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

452
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,795
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

453
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,067
- Hook!
- Right!

454
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,068
Avast, ye cookie.

455
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,906
Start talking.

456
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,580
- Gingy!
- Papa!

457
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,581
Settle down now.

458
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,929
On the good ship Lollipop

459
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,366
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

460
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,770
You!

461
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,106
You can't lie.

462
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,107
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

463
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Well... l don't know where he's not.

464
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,485
You don't know where Shrek is?

465
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,221
lt wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

466
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,222
...that l couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

467
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,127
So you do know where he is!

468
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,796
On the contrary,
l'm possibly more or less

469
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,165
not definitely rejecting the idea

470
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,166
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

471
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,104
Stop it!

472
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,373
...l do not know where he shouldn't be.

473
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,975
lf that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

474
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,976
Even if he wasn't not where
l knew he was, it could mean...

475
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,081
On the good ship Lollipop

476
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,082
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

477
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,424
He's bringing back the next heir?

478
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,160
No!

479
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,161
Hook! Get rid of this new ''King''.

480
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,499
But bring Shrek to me.

481
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
l have something special
in mind for him.

482
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,836
He'll never fall for your tricks!

483
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,674
Oh, boy.

484
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,185
l can't believe it. Me, a king?

485
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,355
l knew l came from royalty, but...

486
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,759
...l figured everyone forgot about me.

487
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Oh, no. ln fact the King
asked for you personally.

488
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,631
Really? Wow.

489
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,903
But l know it's not all fun and games.

490
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,904
lt really is
all fun and games, actually.

491
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

492
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,777
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

493
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,248
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

494
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,885
Well, l've heard
it's harder than it looks.

495
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,056
This is going to be huge.

496
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,057
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

497
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,062
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

498
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,667
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

499
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,668
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

500
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,605
What do they do?

501
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,606
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

502
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,079
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

503
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

504
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,152
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

505
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,122
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

506
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,690
Really?

507
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,691
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

508
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,162
Make sure they don't die of famine!

509
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,030
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

510
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,031
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

511
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,503
Festering sores!
You are one funny kitty cat.

512
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,142
What did l say?

513
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,143
We don't want Artie
getting the wrong idea.

514
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,279
Artie?

515
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,619
There goes my hip!

516
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Artie! What are you doing?

517
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,724
What does it look like?!

518
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,130
This really isn't up to you.

519
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,131
l don't know anything about being king!

520
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:40,134
You'll learn on the job!

521
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,640
Sorry, but l'm going back.

522
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,641
Back to what? Being a loser?

523
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,981
Now look what you did!

524
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,982
Look what l did?
-
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

525
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,821
Shrek!

526
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,668
Land ho!

527
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,017
How humiliating.

528
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,018
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

529
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,088
Now it's ''Your Highness''?
What happened to ''loser''?

530
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,925
lf you think this is getting you
out of anything, it isn't.

531
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,962
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

532
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,434
...and you're going to be a father!

533
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,703
What?

534
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,404
You just said ''father''.

535
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,274
King! You're going to be king!

536
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,275
''You're going to be king!'' Yeah, right.

537
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,046
Where are you going?

538
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,649
Far Far Away... from you!

539
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,650
Get back here, young man!

540
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,222
Boss? l don't think he's coming back.

541
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,223
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

542
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,560
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

543
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,899
Come on. Why would l do that?

544
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

545
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,103
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

546
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,409
You're right, Donkey.

547
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,247
What about this?

548
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,248
- Shrek!
- Come on. lt's just a joke.

549
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,654
Still...

550
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,006
Listen, Artie.

551
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,007
lf you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, l feel you, dude.

552
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,279
l'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

553
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,818
But what l am screamin' is, yo...

554
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,819
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

555
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,390
lf it doesn't groove, or what l'm saying

556
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,391
ain't straight trippin',
say, ''Oh, no, you didn't!

557
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,029
You're getting on my last nerve.''

558
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,030
And then l'll know it's...
l'll know it's wack!

559
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,969
Help!

560
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,970
l've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

561
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,506
- Artie, wait.
- Come on! Help! Hello?

562
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,645
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

563
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,550
Welcome to my serenity circle.

564
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,551
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

565
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,822
Now prepare to...

566
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,329
l knew l should have got that warranty!

567
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,669
Mr. Merlin?

568
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,270
You know this guy?

569
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:04,271
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

570
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,676
Technically, l was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

571
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,414
At the request of my therapist,

572
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,415
and the school authorities, l retired
to the tranquility of nature

573
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,185
to discover my divine purpose.

574
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,856
Can l interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

575
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:23,626
Uh, no.

576
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,627
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

577
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,467
lt's organic.

578
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,037
Thanks. l ate a boulder on the way in.

579
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:37,038
We need directions to Far Far Away.

580
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,776
''We''? Who said l was going with you?

581
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,777
l did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

582
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,883
lf the job's so great, you do it.

583
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,884
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

584
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,723
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

585
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,792
Yeah, and l'm going to miss him.

586
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,793
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

587
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,330
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

588
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,002
...before l kick it there!
Now, which way am l kicking?

589
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,140
l could tell you, but since you're

590
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,810
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

591
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,479
it would be karmically irresponsible.

592
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Self-destructive...?
Are you going to help us or not?

593
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,019
Most definitely, but only after you

594
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,020
take the journey to your soul!

595
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,857
l don't think so.

596
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,858
lt's either that
or primal scream therapy.

597
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,764
All right. Journey to the soul.

598
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,268
Now, all of you,

599
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,938
look into the Fire of Truth

600
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,939
and tell me what you see.

601
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,779
Ooh, charades!

602
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,780
Okay, l see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

603
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,685
Okay, monster... go for it.

604
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,797
l see a rainbow pony.

605
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,866
Excellent work! Now the boy.

606
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,467
This is lame.

607
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,468
You're lame! Nowjust go for it.

608
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,473
Okay.

609
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,474
There's a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest.

610
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,881
Yes! Stay with it!

611
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,882
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

612
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,553
lt's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

613
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,891
lt's going to fall!

614
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,898
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

615
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,238
Okay, l get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

616
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,255
Look, Artie, um...

617
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,164
Just thought l'd help set the mood...

618
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,165
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

619
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,944
l know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

620
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,616
Even ogres get scared.

621
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,786
You know... once in a while.

622
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,624
l know you want me
to be king, but l can't.

623
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,528
l'm not cut out for it,
and l never will be.

624
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,933
Even my own dad knew
l wasn't worth the trouble.

625
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,934
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

626
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,805
...and l never heard from him again.

627
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,809
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

628
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,146
l doubt he was worse than mine.

629
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,583
Oh, yeah?

630
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,584
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

631
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,824
l guess l should have realized it.

632
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,825
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

633
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,998
l guess that's pretty bad.

634
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,170
lt may be hard to believe,

635
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,171
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

636
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,775
but people used
to think l was a monster.

637
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,845
And for a long time, l believed them.

638
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,251
But after a while,

639
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:45,252
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

640
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,923
and just trust who you are.

641
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,360
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

642
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,364
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

643
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,037
Thanks, Artie.

644
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,038
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

645
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,876
Yeah... l got that.

646
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,382
This place is filthy!

647
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:18,387
l feel like a hobo.

648
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,290
l'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

649
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,291
Everything's always about you.
lt's not like your attitude is helping.

650
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,996
Maybe itjust bothers you
l was voted fairest in the land.

651
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,068
You mean in that rigged election?

652
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,069
Give me a break. ''Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

653
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,172
...let down thy golden extensions!''

654
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,442
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints
and let's work together!

655
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,216
So l guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

656
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,587
in this stinkhole until we rot.

657
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,588
No, we get inside and find out
what Charming's up to.

658
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,094
l know he's a jerk and everything,

659
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:01,095
but that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

660
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,600
That's it!

661
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,464
Come on! This way!

662
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,465
Rapunzel, wait!

663
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,943
Charming, let go of her.

664
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,944
But why would l want to do that?

665
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,253
What?

666
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,254
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

667
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,297
Rapunzel, how could you?

668
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,699
Jealous much?

669
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,269
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

670
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,038
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

671
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,039
That is, if l let you last the week.

672
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,713
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

673
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,714
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

674
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,121
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

675
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,122
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

676
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,059
Sorry?!

677
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,060
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

678
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:44,465
...he's doomed?

679
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,540
Look out! They got a piano!

680
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,541
Kill them all... except the fat one.

681
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:31,044
King Charming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

682
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,983
King Charming?

683
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,984
Attack!

684
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,291
Artie, duck!

685
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,007
Ready the plank!

686
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,990
- Shrek!
- Help!

687
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,412
Cowards!

688
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,914
What has Charming done with Fiona?

689
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,915
She's going to get what's coming to her.

690
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:45,085
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

691
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,123
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

692
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,028
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

693
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:56,029
No, Shrek. Hold on. l've got an idea.

694
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,602
l am a buzzing bee.

695
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,603
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

696
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,939
...l mean us, back to Far Far Away.

697
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,109
Forget it. l don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

698
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,679
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

699
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,018
Please. l know you can do it.

700
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:17,953
l said forget it!

701
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:20,954
But...

702
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,632
What's with you?

703
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,633
lt's just so hard, you know?

704
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,470
They need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

705
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,409
'Cause there's a really bad man.

706
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,311
lt's just so hard!

707
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,580
Take it easy.

708
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,581
No! l don't think you understand!

709
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,084
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

710
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,590
Have a heart, old man.

711
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,591
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

712
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,333
Okay.

713
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,334
l'll go get my things.

714
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,439
Piece of cake.

715
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,440
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

716
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,110
l am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

717
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,548
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

718
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,549
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful,

719
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,453
it will wear off eventually. l think.

720
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,959
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

721
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,960
lf Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

722
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,232
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

723
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,902
Alacritious expeditious...

724
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,738
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

725
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,739
Let's help our friends get back...

726
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,311
...soon!

727
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,986
lt worked!

728
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,297
l haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

729
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,167
Donkey?

730
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,168
What? ls something in my teeth?

731
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,440
Oh, no! l've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

732
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,781
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated pinata!

733
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,186
You should think about going on a diet!

734
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,187
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
l feel all exposed and nasty!

735
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,460
So you two think this is funny?

736
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,233
l'm really sorry, guys.

737
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,234
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

738
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,643
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

739
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,546
am l supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

740
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,547
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

741
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,818
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

742
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,822
You'll learn to control that.

743
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,727
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

744
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,905
Watch it. l'm walking here
and l'm gonna keep going until...

745
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,744
Pinocchio!

746
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,913
Shrek! Help me!

747
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:33,914
- What happened?
- Charming and the villains took over!

748
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,250
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

749
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,154
She's what?! What?!

750
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,992
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

751
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,361
You heard him. Help the brother out.

752
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,597
Do you see any pockets on me?

753
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,598
Hold on a second.

754
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,936
l had no idea, really. l... l swear.

755
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,609
Quick! Where is Fiona?

756
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,610
Charming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

757
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:07,514
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

758
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,517
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

759
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:17,392
''lt's a Happily Ever After After All''.

760
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,862
''Shrek's final performance''?

761
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,863
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

762
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,133
l guess l've been so busy
l forgot to mention it.

763
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,639
The ogre! Get him!

764
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,640
Don't worry, jefe. l got this.

765
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,150
Uck! Kill it!

766
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,151
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

767
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,091
We're dealing with amateurs.

768
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:52,092
He's a star, people! Hello?
l'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

769
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,831
l'm going to lose it!

770
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,832
ls everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

771
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,769
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

772
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,006
And l hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey butter.

773
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,442
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

774
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,513
withoutjalapeno honey butter!

775
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,682
l just lost it.

776
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,351
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

777
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,352
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, l promise!

778
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,524
''With this sword, l do...'' No. ''With...''

779
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:28,361
''With this sword, l do smote thee!''

780
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,534
ls ''smote'' the right word? ''Smoot''?

781
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,536
l don't think that's a word.

782
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:37,537
Maybe l should just ''smite'' him.
Let's try this again. Now...

783
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,043
Shrek attacks me.
l pretend to be afraid.

784
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,947
''Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!''

785
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,484
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
itjust doesn't feel real enough!

786
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,224
Who told you to stop dancing?!

787
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,826
Wink and turn.

788
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,827
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

789
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,739
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

790
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,410
And l assure you...

791
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:18,411
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

792
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,584
...we've had to wait.

793
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,421
Break a leg.

794
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,324
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

795
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,325
Thank goodness. l was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

796
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,530
Where's Fiona?

797
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:38,531
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

798
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,945
Let me guess. Arthur.

799
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,117
lt's Artie, actually.

800
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:58,118
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

801
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,458
How pathetic.

802
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,459
Stand still, so l won't make a mess.

803
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,462
Charming, stop! l'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

804
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,467
This isn't about him.

805
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,468
Then who's it about?
l'm supposed to be king, right?

806
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,141
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

807
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,179
l was.

808
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,180
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

809
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,618
Not exactly.

810
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,186
What does that mean?

811
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,822
l said whatever l had to say, all right?

812
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,823
l wasn't right for the job,
so l needed some fool to replace me.

813
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,660
And you fit the bill. So just go!

814
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,601
You were playing me the whole time.

815
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:48,503
You catch on real fast, kid.

816
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,504
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as l thought.

817
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,515
You know, for a minute...

818
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,551
- ...l actually thought...
- What?

819
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,552
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

820
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,189
What did you expect?

821
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

822
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,383
Leave me out with the waste

823
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,321
This is not what I do

824
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:44,390
It's the wrong time

825
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,063
She's pulling me through

826
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:51,064
It's a small crime

827
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,669
And I got no excuse

828
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,670
And is that allright, yeah?

829
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,409
Is that allright with you?

830
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:04,410
Is that allright, yeah?

831
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,249
IfI give my gun away when it's loaded?

832
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,421
Ifyou don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?

833
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:23,263
Is that allright?
Is that allright?

834
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:26,266
Is that allright with you?

835
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:27,302
No.

836
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,036
No.

837
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,005
Had we stayed put like l suggested,

838
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,941
we'd be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

839
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,609
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,379
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

841
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,114
Yeah, loganberries.

842
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,116
- Shut up, Cindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

843
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,117
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

844
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,055
Who cares who's ''running the kingdom''?

845
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,056
- l care.
- You should all care.

846
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,263
l have your badge number, tin can!

847
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,301
- Donkey?
- Princess!

848
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,435
Puss?

849
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:03,436
l am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

850
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,807
And l'm me!

851
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,075
But you're...

852
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,878
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

853
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,980
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

854
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,683
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

855
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,018
You poor sweet things.

856
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,553
l don't get it.

857
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,554
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

858
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,925
Who dat?

859
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,093
Where's Shrek?

860
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,094
Charming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

861
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,499
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

862
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,804
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

863
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,180
What are you doing?

864
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,681
Waiting to be rescued.

865
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,783
You've got to be kidding me.

866
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,686
What else can we do? We're just four...

867
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,687
...l mean three, super-hot princesses...

868
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,124
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

869
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,029
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

870
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,910
Mom!

871
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,911
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

872
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:22,315
Excuse me. There's still one more.

873
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:35,228
Why don't you just lie down?

874
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,233
Okay, girls, from here on out...

875
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,236
...we take care of business ourselves.

876
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,755
The FarFarAway Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

877
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,328
...''It's A Happily EverAfter
AfterAll.''

878
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,329
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

879
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,765
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

880
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,949
Places, everyone!

881
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,723
Easy!

882
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,724
Sorry. l was showing off
for the little one.

883
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:42,362
lt's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Come here, beautiful.

884
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,135
Well, she's got your eye.

885
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,373
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

886
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,986
Little birdies, take wing

887
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,625
Flitting down from the trees they appear

888
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,626
And to chirp in my ear

889
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,363
All because I sing

890
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,995
Move it! Go!

891
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,405
My babies!

892
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,406
Help!

893
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,952
Hey, how's it goin'?

894
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,699
O to the K. The coast is clear.

895
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,469
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

896
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,470
l thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Cool.

897
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,808
l recall it was Team Awesome.

898
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,877
l voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

899
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,979
Okay! From henceforth,

900
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,980
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

901
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:52,251
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!

902
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:55,924
Artie!

903
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,425
Wait, wait!

904
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,761
Where is the fire, senor?

905
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,930
Please. Don't act so innocent.

906
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,931
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

907
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,569
lt's not like it seems.

908
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,538
lt's not? l think it seems pretty clear.

909
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,208
He was using me. That's all.

910
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,777
Using you? You really don't get it.

911
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,778
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

912
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:22,448
Charming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

913
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,697
Cue the spot!

914
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,804
I wait alone up here

915
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,640
I'm trapped anotherday

916
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,641
Locked up here please set me free

917
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,978
My new life I almost see

918
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,983
A castle, you and me

919
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,984
Yes, a castle, you and me

920
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,157
Cherubs!

921
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:10,162
Tis I, Tis I
Upon myregal steed

922
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,867
Princess, my love

923
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,770
At lastyou shall be freed
I'm strong

924
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:18,172
And brave
And dashing my way there

925
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:21,173
With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!

926
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,813
- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!

927
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,717
- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!

928
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,022
Facing creatures so vile

929
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,290
Foul!

930
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,291
So you can gaze upon me!

931
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,197
I knew you'd come forme

932
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,198
And now we finally meet

933
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,770
I knew you'd wait

934
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,771
And from myplate oflove you'd eat

935
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:16,228
Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?

936
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,666
Will Charming fight orflee?

937
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:19,867
Please rescue me!

938
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,703
From this monstrosity!

939
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:24,704
Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!

940
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,510
Oh, boy.

941
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,511
You are about to entera world ofpain

942
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,248
With which you are not familiar!

943
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,023
lt can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

944
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,098
''Prepare, foul beast.''

945
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,202
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

946
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,605
Could you kill me and then sing?

947
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,111
Be quiet!

948
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:06,112
l'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

949
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,783
Thank you.

950
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:11,784
Do they come in men's sizes?

951
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,823
Now that be funny!

952
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,824
Enough!

953
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,195
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

954
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:27,133
...to have everything you worked for...

955
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,803
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

956
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,974
Now you'll know how l felt.

957
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,651
Sausage roll!

958
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,338
Pray for mercy from Puss!

959
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,040
And Donkey!

960
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,041
D

961
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,520
Hi, honey.

962
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,521
Sorry we're late. You okay?

963
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,691
Much better, now that you're here.

964
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,696
So, Charming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

965
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,035
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But l have a better idea.

966
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,756
No! Let go of me!

967
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,757
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

968
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:06,732
Everybody, stop!

969
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,570
Oh, what is it now?!

970
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,571
Artie?

971
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,516
Who thinks we need
to settle things this way?

972
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:30,256
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

973
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:34,093
But we are villains!
lt's the only thing we know.

974
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,598
You never wish
you could be something else?

975
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,599
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

976
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,105
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

977
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:47,041
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

978
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,210
when the whole world's against you.

979
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,078
Right. Thanks, Ed.

980
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:54,079
Fair enough. You're right.
l'm not a talking tree.

981
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:56,851
But you know...

982
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,852
...a good friend once told me...

983
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:03,122
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

984
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,294
...orjust some loser...

985
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:11,797
...doesn't mean you are one.

986
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,569
What matters most
is what you think of yourself.

987
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,573
lf there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

988
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,010
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

989
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,049
- Me?
- Get him!

990
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,584
No, no, no!

991
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,585
What l mean is each of you...

992
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:35,654
...is standing in your own way.

993
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,462
l always wanted to play the flute.

994
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,463
l'd like to open up a spa... in France!

995
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,267
l grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

996
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:41,553
A new era finally begins!

997
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,060
Now all of you...

998
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:49,061
...bow before your King!

999
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,903
You need to work on your aim.

1000
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,574
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1001
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,577
Well, you need to keep looking...

1002
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:10,082
...because l'm not giving up mine.

1003
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,423
Mommy?

1004
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,770
lt's yours if you want it.

1005
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:32,771
But this time it's your choice.

1006
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:55,963
Author!

1007
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:58,964
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1008
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,638
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1009
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:10,642
Okay, Senor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

1010
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,216
Though l have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1011
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,851
Please say you didn't.

1012
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,886
All right! Look.

1013
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,887
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1014
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,324
...but this should do the trick.

1015
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,499
- Are you...?
- l'm me again!

1016
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,500
- And l am not you!
- All right!

1017
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:38,337
Oops.

1018
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,507
Ah, never mind.

1019
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:46,912
What did l tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1020
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,116
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1021
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,188
l have something
much more important in mind.

1022
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:24,716
Finally.

1023
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,724
Dada.

1024
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,161
Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place

1025
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,301
l smell Shrek Junior!

1026
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:43,103
Where else could a creep like me

1027
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,973
Meet such a pretty face

1028
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,974
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1029
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,714
Looking up, it's looking like

1030
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,750
My losing streak is done

1031
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,754
Peek-a-boo!

1032
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:03,755
Peek-a-boo!

1033
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,261
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1034
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:10,097
Used to always feel like

1035
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:13,098
Wished that I was dressed better

1036
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,569
Where's the baby?

1037
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,570
Neverhad a lot ofluck
Until I finally met her

1038
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:32,451
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1039
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,959
Looking up, it's looking like

1040
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,960
My losing streak is done

1041
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,965
My losing streak is done

1042
01:21:57,145 --> 01:22:00,145
Well... what shall we do now?

1043
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:18,830
l got it.

1044
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:27,005
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1045
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,510
I want to thank you forletting me
be myself

1046
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,515
Again!

1047
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:36,517
Look at my hips!

1048
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:39,518
I want to thank you forletting me
be myself

1049
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,856
Again!

1050
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,297
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

1051
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,298
Stiffall in the collar

1052
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,536
