1
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,275
[distant clanking]

2
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,480
[man mutters]

3
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,815
Come on, a second.

4
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,816
That's it.

5
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:49,817
Pick it up.
Let's go.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,287
[man whistling]

7
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,226
[whistling stops]

8
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,328
Mud.

9
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,630
Man:
* They'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight... *

10
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,465
Cheers.

11
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,800
[singing continues]

12
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,638
It's bad luck to sing
around dynamite, Mac.

13
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,973
* All join round

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,575
* And sweetly
hear you sing *

15
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,576
[whistles]

16
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,977
Okay, up!

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,480
- Sorry.
- Here we go.

18
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,149
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

19
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,650
That's what
the fuse is...

20
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,185
* They'll be a hot time
in the old town... *

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,256
[men muttering]

22
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,327
[grunts]

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,802
Old man: 
 It was mid-August 1919.

24
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,138
I was young 
 and I thought I was tough,

25
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,140
and I knew it was beautiful.

26
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:51,145
And I was a little bit crazy, 
 but hadn't noticed it yet.

27
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,480
We were the summer crew.

28
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,647
Close one.

29
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,483
Mr. McBride 
 and his redheaded son

30
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,286
worked at different ranches 
 in the Bitterroot Valley

31
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,555
and were saving up 
 for their own place.

32
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,124
Mr. Smith had been 
 a miner all his life,

33
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,460
and naturally 
 was our powder man.

34
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,730
You get headaches
touching your face
after touching dynamite.

35
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,132
Dynamite made me sick,

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,801
and it must have been 
 why Mr. Smith

37
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,570
had such terrible 
 problems with his health.

38
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,638
[coughing]

39
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,140
The one we called Canada

40
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:24,144
wore this first pair 
 of horn-rimmed glasses 
 I ever saw.

41
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,147
He'd been 
 in His Majesty's Royal 
 something or other,

42
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,717
and had been gassed 
 in the trenches.

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,952
The way he treated animals

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,122
was kinder than any man 
 I ever knew,

45
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,758
except for Bill Bell,

46
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,127
the head ranger 
 of the Elk Summit district

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,962
of the Selway forest,

48
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,133
and rumored to be 
 the toughest man 
 in the Bitterroot Valley,

49
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,971
and, we thought, 
 the best ranger 
 in the forest service.

50
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,274
[man coughing]

51
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,778
[men chattering]

52
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,784
I'd worked for Bill 
 for three summers,

53
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,787
and even though 
 he was my model 
 and an artist,

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,456
maybe because he was,

55
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,427
at 17, something in me 
 was half-looking 
 for trouble with him.

56
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,312
Cut your fuse
too short?

57
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,313
Might've.

58
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,148
- Dangerous.
- Yeah, dangerous.

59
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,718
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,454
'Nuff said.

61
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,623
Yeah.

62
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,794
- Mr. McBride?
- Yes, sir, Bill?

63
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,629
A good morning's work.

64
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,930
Thank you.

65
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,136
That's enough
blasting for today.

66
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,972
You put any
chicken in there?

67
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm hungry.

68
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:01,309
What do we got?

69
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,311
Let's look
to the other side first.

70
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,012
I'll get the other side.
Don't worry about it.

71
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,789
Mac:
Ask you a question,
Bill?

72
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,857
Never hurt.

73
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,092
What are we doing here?

74
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,794
It's just a trail.

75
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,297
How come
they want it so wide?

76
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,132
They going to build
a railroad through here?

77
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,967
You don't get to be
a district ranger

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,971
by asking the United States
Forest Service how come.

79
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,272
You ask them how far.

80
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,274
Yeah,
you ask them how far.

81
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,581
I've known artists
in my time.

82
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,451
Writers, painters,

83
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,286
piano players.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,188
When it comes to
packing a mule,

85
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,791
that man ranks
right up there.

86
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,226
Right up there
with bloody Mozart.

87
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,463
Seems to know
what he's doing.

88
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,631
Know what he's doing?

89
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,233
Mac, to take a packstring
of half a hundred

90
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,970
across the Bitterroot divide
without a pack shifting

91
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,805
or the slightest chafe,

92
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,207
that is a masterpiece
of the highest order.

93
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,977
If my number's up tomorrow,

94
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,145
at least I can say
I rode with Bill Bell

95
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,247
and I saw it done.

96
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,791
Man:
Going to be heading down
into Hamilton tomorrow, Bill?

97
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,159
Yep.
Time to start looking
for my dog.

98
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,128
Be back
in a couple of days.

99
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,296
Payroll in hand?

100
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,297
Yeah, payroll?

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
It's okay.
He knows.

102
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,137
I bet you
I could walk it in a day,

103
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,474
all the way to Hamilton
and still have
daylight leftover.

104
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,742
Is that a fact?

105
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,310
Yep.

106
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,779
That's a fact.

107
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,818
I almost forgot
what Hamilton looks like.

108
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,454
There's a bank at one end
that doles it out.

109
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,123
Hotel girls
and tinhorn gamblers
at the other,

110
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,224
always ready
to take it away.

111
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,793
They got
a soda fountain there.

112
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,962
Ice cream soda.

113
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,931
Gosh, that would
taste great right about now.

114
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,833
Sure need something
to wash down this cooking.

115
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,301
What do you got
against the cook, anyway?

116
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,971
Last year Mac
was Bill's fair-haired boy.

117
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,906
This year the ranger's
found a new favorite.

118
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,307
That about it, Mac?

119
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,308
No, that's not it.

120
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,944
Yeah, that's not it.

121
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,979
No, no, no.

122
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,714
Why would I have anything
against the cook?

123
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,816
[men laughing]

124
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,351
Why would I have anything
against anybody

125
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,919
who's going around
in an old girl's
tennis shoes?

126
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,300
The fact was, 
 everything they said 
 was true.

127
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,636
I was jealous of the cook.

128
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,172
I disliked him 
 and I didn't have a reason.

129
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,975
When you're young 
 you just know things,

130
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,445
and I knew this cook 
 was a forty-cent piece.

131
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,412
Who's winning?

132
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,951
[men chattering]

133
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:58,952
Eight.

134
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,622
Ten.

135
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,457
Oh, yeah, Bill.
All you got to do
is peg eight there.

136
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,125
You mind, Red?

137
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,760
Sorry.
No harm meant.

138
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,797
17.

139
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,832
19.

140
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,034
27.

141
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,703
29.

142
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,308
30.

143
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,645
31 for two,
and a pair is four.

144
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,586
15 two, 15 six,

145
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,457
15 two, 15 four,
15 six,

146
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,960
and a pair is eight.

147
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,462
Hold on, Bill.
That's not an eight hand.

148
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,497
A pair of eights
and a seven

149
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,433
is 15 two, 15 four,
and pair of six.

150
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,201
It's an eight.

151
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,074
It's only a six hand.

152
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,955
Right you are.
It's a six.

153
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,923
I already told you
it was a six hand.

154
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,424
He's an expert.

155
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,198
I deal, right?

156
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,233
Hey, Mr. Expert!

157
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,936
How about a little three-hand
nickel and dime game?

158
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,338
Poker, pinochle,
you name it.

159
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,908
Come on.
What do you say?

160
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,143
I say
what I always say,

161
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,646
I don't play cards
against the men I work with.

162
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,482
And what I say,
if there's an expert around,

163
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,785
he owes it to the others
to teach them a thing or two.

164
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,653
Right.

165
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,055
Personally,
I could never see
the sense in playing cards.

166
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,157
Me neither.
Too many ways of counting.

167
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,910
I say what I always say.

168
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:06,614
I never plays cards
against the men
that I work with.

169
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,287
So much for today.

170
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,488
Big day tomorrow.

171
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,790
Yep. Cards are
for playing

172
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,825
when you've got
nothing better to do.

173
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,127
What do you know?
Another expert!

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,461
- Night, men.
- Night, y'all.

175
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,796
- Night, y'all.
- Good night.

176
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,297
- Night!
- Mr. Hawkes.

177
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,801
Red: Whoa!
Look at the stars!

178
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,103
McBride: Come on, son.
Morning comes early.
Let's go.

179
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,645
You mind getting
a little kindling
for the stove?

180
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,479
I think I'm going
to need it tonight.

181
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,115
[chattering
continues]

182
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,756
Make some coffee.
It's cold out here.

183
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,600
Mac.

184
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:09,977
I don't want you
riling the cook.

185
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,846
'Nuff said?

186
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,149
I'm not going to rile him.

187
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,118
Someday I'm just
going to punch
the prune juice out of him.

188
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,020
Not in this district,
you're not.

189
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,792
Shut your mouth, Mac.

190
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,959
Shut your stupid mouth

191
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:26,960
before you go
and say something stupid.

192
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,495
What's that?

193
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,764
I said who says
I'm going to stay
in this district!

194
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,933
- Morning.
- Morning.

195
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,289
[horn honks]

196
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,164
[man yelling in Chinese]

197
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,599
[speaking Chinese]

198
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,772
Man:
How you doing, Ned?

199
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,809
- An ice cream soda.
- What flavor
 you going to have?

200
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,611
- Chocolate.
- Coming right up.

201
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,475
I can take that
for you, sir.

202
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,611
- Thank you, son.
- You're welcome.

203
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,953
Put him out back, Jake.

204
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,422
He gets lonesome
if he don't see
them mountains.

205
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,265
[men chattering]

206
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:58,979
Man:
How you doing, Bill?

207
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,113
Bill:
Pretty good.

208
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,283
Give me a beer.

209
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:09,389
We thought
that was your horse
outside the drugstore.

210
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,394
I must give off
a scent or something
when I come to town.

211
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,066
What do you say
to a few hands
of poker, Bill?

212
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,633
No thanks.

213
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,135
I'm still growing the hide

214
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,906
you skinned off
of me last time.

215
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,742
Have you boys
seen my dog around town?

216
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,544
Not so far this year.

217
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,181
On the house, Bill.

218
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,617
Keep the change.

219
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,020
Sure.
Thanks, Bill.

220
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,290
Lose your dog,
did you?

221
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,292
I just don't know
what sheep herder

222
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,460
she got herself
hooked up with
this season.

223
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,461
Run off on you?

224
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,798
She just loves
chasing coyotes.

225
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,968
I'll be back down
in a couple weeks.

226
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,804
Anybody brings her in,
I'd appreciate
you getting me word.

227
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,975
I don't see the sense
of you toting payroll
up the mountains every month.

228
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,111
The boys can't
come to town and spend it.

229
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,680
They just like
the feel of it, I guess.

230
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,792
Forest Service.
Nothing to do but collect
your government pay.

231
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,628
Bill: Yep,
only got to fight fires,

232
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,965
clear trails,
string line, cruise timber,

233
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,799
chase poachers.

234
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,535
Just kill time...

235
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,972
till we can come into town
for a modest meal

236
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,774
and a hot bath.

237
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,813
Man:
Forest Service.
Every year.

238
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,284
Excuse me, boys.

239
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,119
That will be 75 cents.

240
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,787
He put some kind
of cheese on it.

241
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,956
I hate cheese.

242
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,457
It's still 75 cents.

243
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,292
Tell Wong
to put it in our account.

244
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,626
That's fine for Wong,

245
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,662
but you got
no account with me.

246
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,965
Here you go.

247
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,733
Something
for your hope chest,
little lady.

248
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,302
Running sandwiches
to you gentlemen

249
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,703
is going to make me
rich in no time.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,174
[laughter]

251
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,950
[man snoring]

252
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,587
[snoring continues]

253
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,276
Wakey-wakey.
Rise and shine!

254
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,314
The sea is calm
and the day is fine!

255
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,782
I'm awake. I'm awake.
You don't have to do that.

256
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,590
[men muttering]

257
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,479
The important thing?
Not to cut your throat.

258
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,049
Not to cut the throat.

259
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,928
Hey, Mac.

260
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,531
You happen to see
the stars last night?

261
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:41,801
No.

262
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,272
What a beautiful
sight they were.

263
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,807
Morning, Mac.

264
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,975
Morning.

265
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,611
Pull the skin tight.
Come from underneath.

266
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,584
Hey.

267
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,925
Come on.
Come on.

268
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,307
You got a headache again?

269
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,974
Yeah.

270
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,644
I told you about touching
your fingers to dynamite,
and then your mouth.

271
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,146
Yeah, yeah.
You told me.

272
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,480
It's not an old wives' tale.

273
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:28,481
I've been a miner
all my life.

274
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:29,449
I got to know
about something.

275
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,050
You made your point.

276
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,452
You ask me,

277
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,087
you're getting too cocky
for your own good.

278
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,761
[muttering]

279
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:57,977
Dry off, Mac.

280
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,312
We got a mountain
to blow up.

281
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,481
Footwork, footwork.
Watch your feet.

282
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,683
Put your hands--
That's it. Okay--

283
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,929
[men chattering]

284
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,801
There's no future
in this end of the job.

285
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,803
You can see
where I've come.

286
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,805
What you ought to do
is stick with Bill.

287
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,474
Learn the fine art
of packing

288
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,908
and you got a future.

289
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,477
Man:
Future, that would be nice.

290
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,644
Mud.

291
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,647
Get a good clean breath
with a new set of lungs.

292
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,115
I got it.

293
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,083
That's yours.

294
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,455
Nothing moves
in these mountains
without a packer.

295
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,790
Nothing moves
without the packer.

296
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,425
That's a fact, Mac.

297
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,627
Is that a fact?

298
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,563
Nothing?

299
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,131
Wait a minute.

300
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,966
- What are you doing?
- Use the whistle.

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,568
What happened
to the whistle?

302
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,036
Not healthy
using my fingers.

303
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,306
Holy mackerel!

304
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,808
- Run!
- Let's go!

305
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,142
Come on!

306
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,311
Go. Come on,
hurry up!

307
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,778
Go, run!

308
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,293
Mac, I think I ought
to tell you

309
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,128
what it's like
to be 65 years old.

310
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,296
Why's that?

311
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,631
Because you ain't
never going to make it.

312
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,633
Red: That's for sure.
Never going to make it.

313
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,268
McBride:
Not unless you learn
to set a fuse.

314
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,938
Hey, Mac!

315
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,607
Isn't it your turn
to go down for the lunch?

316
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,977
Bill's not
going to like that.

317
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,846
That's for sure.
Not going to like it
for one bit.

318
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,153
Mr. Hawkes,
why don't you stay
and eat with us?

319
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,457
Things to do.

320
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,293
Well, now, Edna,
how you feeling?

321
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,627
In the pink, huh?

322
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,795
How do you know
that one's Edna?

323
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,229
'Cause the other one
is wearing tennis shoes.

324
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,964
[men chuckling]

325
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,233
I guess the other one's
wearing tennis shoes.

326
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,802
That's a good one.

327
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,804
Let's go.
Come on.

328
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,306
Come on.

329
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,973
I wouldn't go
repeating that
back in camp.

330
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,810
I don't suppose
Old Tennis Shoes
even heard it.

331
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,712
Ranger wants you
back in camp!

332
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,981
Uh-oh!

333
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,117
[laughter]

334
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,466
Going someplace?

335
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,968
Lookout on Grave Peak
quit this morning.

336
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,137
Oh, yeah?

337
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,306
Came down
off that mountain
in three jumps.

338
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,307
Know what he said?

339
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,475
No.

340
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,976
Put his hand on his bed,

341
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:17,977
pulled back the blanket,

342
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,479
and took hold
of a rattlesnake.

343
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,913
You believe that?

344
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,450
No, I don't believe that.

345
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,953
It's too high up there
for rattlesnakes.

346
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,120
Why don't you go
up on lookout

347
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,623
for a couple of weeks
and find out?

348
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,791
Why you sending me, Bill?

349
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,126
If you spot
any lightning fires,
call them in.,

350
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,128
'Cause of the cook, right?
I'm exiled.

351
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,797
Count your thousands.

352
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,967
Each one
is a fifth of a mile.

353
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,437
Less than a fifth,
you better duck
and pray for rain.

354
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,809
Get a big storm
up there or snow,

355
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,111
close up camp
and come back to the station.

356
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,291
You still think
about that fire we fought
up in Coeur d'Alene?

357
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,294
Nope.
Not at all.

358
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,464
No more bad dreams?

359
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,732
How did you know that?

360
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:16,603
I hear things.

361
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,074
- Well?
- Well, what?

362
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:26,779
Well, 'nuff said.

363
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,451
Better take your spikes,
your gun.

364
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,957
Why don't you ask the cook
to make you a sandwich?

365
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,126
It will be dark
by the time
you get to the peak.

366
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,128
Not unless I walk backward.

367
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,464
I'll last
till I get there.

368
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,633
Anyway,
I can eat better
with a can opener.

369
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,134
Take some water.

370
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,802
Water makes you sick
on the trail.

371
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,471
Who told you that?

372
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,805
Nobody.

373
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,607
It happened to me one time,
so I oughta know.

374
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,480
[panting]

375
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,783
Peak before dark.
Peak before dark.

376
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,252
"Better ask the cook.
'Nuff said."

377
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,258
"It will be dark..."

378
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,101
Rattlesnake my...

379
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:29,308
Northern place...

380
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,277
"See queer sights...

381
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:38,284
"But the queerest
they ever did see,

382
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,286
"was the night on the marsh,

383
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,954
"of the Lake LaBarge,

384
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:44,557
"when I cremated
Sam McGee."

385
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:49,762
[thunder]

386
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,601
Peak before dark.
Peak before dark.

387
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,039
[sighs]

388
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,915
[men chattering]

389
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:09,882
I'll show you this.
Look.

390
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,117
Put your hand--
put your finger.

391
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,384
See? Look.

392
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,424
[thunder]

393
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:32,805
[phone ringing]

394
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:37,877
[ringing continues]

395
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,118
Hello?

396
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,119
Mac: 
 Just checking in.

397
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,454
I'm at Grave Peak.

398
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,190
You made good time
considering
the weather.

399
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,458
Nothing to it.

400
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,661
I can outwalk anybody
in the Forest Service.

401
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,796
You got me believing it.

402
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,798
Everything
okay up there?

403
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,567
Everything 
 looks perfect.

404
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,834
Not too wet for you?

405
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,971
Summer mist, that's all.

406
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:09,141
Don't let it
get you down.

407
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,010
You couldn't have done me 
 a bigger favor, Bill.

408
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,312
I'd be afraid
to pray for this kind of job

409
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,447
for fear it was simple
to have it this good.

410
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,117
That's a load off my mind.

411
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,418
Good.

412
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,287
So long, Mac.

413
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,755
So long, Bill.

414
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:40,139
He'll live,
if he's not struck dead
for lying.

415
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,941
[chattering]

416
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,363
[distant thunder]

417
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,132
One thousand one,

418
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,969
one thousand two,
one thousand three,

419
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,137
one thousand four--

420
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,240
[thunder]

421
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:21,814
* My baby,
when you hear the bells
go ding-a-ling *

422
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:25,384
* All join round,
sweetly hear you sing *

423
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,120
* When you get that rhythm

424
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,622
* You're gonna
shout and sing *

425
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:33,926
* They'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight *

426
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,132
Not sending me up here
to stare at mountains
for two weeks

427
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,968
as some sort
of punishment, eh?

428
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,938
Well, the joke's on you,
Mr. District Ranger.

429
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,809
I'm tough enough
to take it.

430
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,143
Don't you worry.

431
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,111
I'm tough enough.

432
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,810
Old Mac: 
 Even at that age,

433
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:28,781
I already knew mountains 
 lived and moved.

434
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,784
Long before, 
 when I had 
 a child's sickness,

435
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,452
my mother put me outside

436
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,622
in a bed with 
 mosquito netting over it,

437
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,458
and I lay there 
 watching the mountains

438
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,628
until they made me well.

439
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,966
That's why I knew then, 
 when I was 17,

440
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,970
that when needed, 
 mountains would move for me.

441
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,580
[moaning]

442
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,116
[flames crackling,
men shouting]

443
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,254
[shouting intensifies]

444
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,294
[shouting continues]

445
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,463
Man:
We're surrounded!
The fire's all around us!

446
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,464
[flames roar]

447
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:45,291
One thousand one,
one thousand two,

448
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,127
one thousand three,
one thousand fo--

449
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,596
[thunder]

450
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,145
No, just the usual
afternoon lightning.

451
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,313
Bill: 
 Count your thousands?

452
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,948
Yeah, I counted off
the distances.

453
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,449
Nothing started smoking.

454
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,717
Do you need anything?

455
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,719
- Nope.
- Sure?

456
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,623
Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Fine.

457
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,458
Well, so long, Mac.

458
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,260
So long.

459
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:39,311
Hold still.
Hold still.

460
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,147
I'm trying to look.

461
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,398
Boy, I wouldn't
want to be Mac
out there in this storm.

462
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,800
That's what tents are for.

463
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,470
Smith:
Of course, tents work best
if they're still standing.

464
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,306
I've known winds
to hit 80 miles an hour
up on Grave Peak.

465
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,975
80 mi--

466
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,309
Oh, yeah.
80 plus.

467
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,810
- That much?
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,779
[clacking]

469
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,849
Stop fooling
with that cribbage board!

470
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,124
I suppose
if Mac were running
into any trouble,

471
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,425
he'd call in, huh?

472
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,460
Bill:
It's what
the phone line is for.

473
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,728
That's what they're for,
all right.

474
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,702
[wind howling]

475
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,280
[hissing]

476
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,030
That's it.
All yours. No more.

477
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,451
Old Mac: 
 I kept telling myself that 
 I had slipped dynamite,

478
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,953
fought a big fire, 
 carried a gun,

479
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,457
helped Bill pack, 
 watched mountains by myself,

480
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,125
and that was a summer's work,

481
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,695
so I should just 
 get my time and quit.

482
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,630
What I neglected 
 to tell myself

483
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,300
is that 
 it's almost impossible 
 to quit a ranger

484
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,103
who's sore because 
 you do not like his cook.

485
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,307
And I also had the feeling

486
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,443
that he was 
 watching me somehow,

487
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,980
just to see 
 if I'd duck out 
 when things got tough.

488
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,282
[panting]

489
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,118
"Was the night on the marsh

490
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,420
"of Lake LaBarge..."

491
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,964
"Was the night on the marsh
of Lake LaBarge,

492
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:57,936
"when I cremated
Sam McGee."

493
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,611
Okay. Okay.

494
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,114
'Nuff said.

495
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,928
[grunts]

496
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,376
Whoa!

497
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,444
Ooh! Ooh! Ow!

498
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,779
[grunting]

499
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,796
That's it.
That's it.

500
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,567
Time to quit.
Time to quit.

501
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,436
That's it.
Time to quit.

502
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,784
Some reason
you're standing there?

503
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:23,289
Why, it rained.
Uh, snow was coming.

504
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:27,293
I could tell the season's
pretty near over.

505
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,794
Did you get a message
from somebody

506
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,296
it was getting ready
to snow?

507
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,631
Well, it rained and blew,

508
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:36,968
and I could tell
snow was coming.

509
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,438
Maybe you ought to transfer
over to the weather bureau.

510
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,540
There are rattlers
up there.

511
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,343
Did you have
a run-in with one?

512
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:49,315
No, the wire was down.
Spikes didn't hold.

513
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,417
Listen, Bill,
I've been thinking--

514
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,452
Me, too.
I've been thinking.

515
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,953
Yeah, but I--

516
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,488
The trail crew's
been getting along
good without you.

517
00:35:56,522 --> 00:36:00,759
And as you say,
it's near the end
of the season.

518
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,528
I could use somebody
around here

519
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,563
to help me get
the gear together.

520
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,935
How about a game
of cribbage tonight?

521
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,615
I guess I could stay on
a day or two more
and help out.

522
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:26,452
You weren't thinking
about quitting, were you?

523
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,120
Over a measly rattlesnake?

524
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,456
Heck no.

525
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,957
Over some stupid
rattler?

526
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,625
What gave you that idea?

527
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,294
Good.

528
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,629
Be a shame to quit
at this stage of the game,

529
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,599
just when things
were about to get interesting.

530
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:52,311
15 two,
and 3 threes are six,
for eight,

531
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,346
and I am out.

532
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,216
Three down 3 is a nine.

533
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,388
No. Bill,
3 threes are just
three of a kind.

534
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,789
A pair counts two.

535
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,957
A three of a kind
of anything counts six.

536
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,260
Six.

537
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:11,297
[men chattering]

538
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,865
Just wanted to make sure
you didn't forget
how to count.

539
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,534
Another game?

540
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,307
Nothing like
a little time on lookout

541
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,575
to make a station-cooked
meal taste good, huh?

542
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,814
That what you think?

543
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,116
Easy now, Mac.

544
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,951
I got a better idea.

545
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,621
Hawkes,
drop those eggs,

546
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,757
and come join Bill and me

547
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,792
in a game of poker.

548
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:42,461
Season's near over,

549
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,096
and the three of us
have never
sat down to a game.

550
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,967
How many times
do I have to tell you?

551
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,937
I don't play cards
against the men I work with.

552
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,311
Why don't you show him

553
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:01,212
why you don't play cards
with the men you work with?

554
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,420
Sit down.

555
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,098
[men muttering]

556
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,607
[laughter]

557
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,944
Let's play poker.

558
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,589
[muttering continues]

559
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,433
Cut.

560
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,642
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

561
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,143
Man:
He's splitting them up.

562
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,312
Man 2:
I never seen anybody
deal that fast.

563
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,114
[laughter]

564
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:10,449
Hawkes:
Play your hands.

565
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,451
All right,
what have we got here?

566
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:13,519
Holy--
Four tens!

567
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:15,954
- I got four queens!
- Jacks!

568
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,290
Good hand, Red.

569
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,460
That takes it all.

570
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,928
I bet I win.

571
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:32,604
[laughter]

572
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,172
- How did he do it?
- Unbelievable.

573
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,807
The man's a cardsharp, boys.

574
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,975
Still want
to play poker?

575
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,176
[laughter]

576
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,479
A real artiste.

577
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,947
Hawkes:
I'll tell you
once and for all

578
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,284
about my card play.

579
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,455
I play cards
for a living.

580
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,122
I have to get out
in the summer

581
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,792
because of my health.

582
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,127
But I need
to keep my hands soft,

583
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,129
so I cook
and I wash dishes

584
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,966
instead of doing
trail work.

585
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,302
I practice every night
before I go to sleep,

586
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,972
and that's why
I never play cards

587
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,508
against the men
that I work with.

588
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,478
[laughter]

589
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,245
Just as well,
huh, Mac?

590
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,614
That would have been
a long summer.

591
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,015
Man:
Look at Mac's eyes.

592
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,486
[harmonica playing]

593
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,301
Count your blessings, Mac.

594
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,770
The cook could've
picked you clean all summer.

595
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,612
Something about
this cook business
doesn't add up.

596
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,616
I think Bill's got
something up his sleeve.

597
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,452
That's what I think.

598
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:55,921
What do you think, Mac?

599
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,529
Red, let me ask you.

600
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:07,132
Have you ever once
in your whole life

601
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:12,137
had one single
solitary original thought

602
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,641
that didn't bounce off
from somewhere else?

603
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:19,144
I mean,
have you ever sat down,

604
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,312
considered all
the available information,

605
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,614
weighed it all
in your mind,

606
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,949
sifted all
the possibilities,

607
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,784
discarded what
you couldn't prove,

608
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:26,952
sorted out
what made sense,

609
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,954
and came to your own
personal,

610
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,123
original Red McBride
opinion?

611
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,696
Why would I go
to all that trouble?

612
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,434
Good night, son.

613
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,936
Good night, Pa.

614
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,596
Hi.

615
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,441
Hey, fellas.

616
00:42:58,644 --> 00:42:59,577
What's going on?

617
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,948
Man: Wow.

618
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,454
[coughs]

619
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:11,422
Shh.

620
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,492
Man: Ooh!

621
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,104
[muttering]

622
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:34,179
Mac:
Mr. McBride thinks

623
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,815
you've got something
up your sleeve.

624
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:41,486
Well, do you?

625
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,023
Bill:
Ranger's revenge.

626
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:48,694
How? Where?

627
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:50,195
The end of every season,

628
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,031
those tinhorn gamblers
at the Oxford
strip me clean.

629
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,703
Well, I don't suppose
it's a big secret
in the district

630
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:01,006
that you aren't,
well, a real whiz-bang 
at the cards.

631
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,076
It's a sure enough secret
that the cook is.

632
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,117
That's why I'm betting
my whole bankroll on him.

633
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,753
I'm leaving it up to you

634
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,922
to get the rest of the crew
to chip in

635
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,257
and help fatten up
the cook's playing money.

636
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,425
Me?

637
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,593
They know how you feel
about the cook.

638
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:24,763
Bound to go along
if they see you bet on him.

639
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,664
My wages on him?

640
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:30,535
He'll win big.
Real big.

641
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,204
When that time comes,
you pick up the money.

642
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:35,874
Use a bag or something.

643
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:40,712
Bill, I don't know
if I deserve to have
such a key part in this.

644
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:43,081
Ranger knows his men.

645
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,349
But does he know
one of them, namely me,

646
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,017
isn't too keen about getting
his head punched in?

647
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,019
Those tinhorns
are pantywaists

648
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,520
when it comes
to shedding any blood.

649
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:52,023
What a relief.

650
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,793
Better take your gun
just in case.

651
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,862
Holy Moses, Bill.

652
00:44:56,895 --> 00:45:00,365
I got nothing
but that .32-20
on a .45 frame.

653
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,033
That's as big
as horse artillery.

654
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:05,103
I'd be arrested
before I got in the bar.

655
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,105
You decide, then.

656
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,540
Either way,
I'll cover you.

657
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,109
Cover me?

658
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,610
What's that
supposed to mean,
"Cover me"?

659
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,445
What is that, Bill?

660
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,749
All you got to do
is concentrate on scooping
that money into the bag.

661
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:21,252
Make it a sugar bag.
Sort of sweet justice.

662
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:24,055
[chuckling]

663
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,699
I'm counting on you, Mac.

664
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,367
I don't know, Bill.

665
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,702
I don't go in too much

666
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,704
for getting
the stuffing beat out of me.

667
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,208
I told you,
I'll cover you.

668
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,709
Yeah, but what
I'm saying is that--

669
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,344
'Nuff said.

670
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,586
I wonder if
the United States
Forest Service

671
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,255
has any idea
why their crews

672
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,991
have such
an appetite for peaches.

673
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:05,596
[men laughing]

674
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,098
Man:
This is good stuff!

675
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,935
- Oh, that's right!
- Yeah!

676
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:13,271
[men chattering]

677
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,505
Old Mac: 
 Bill had explained

678
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:17,108
the ranger's revenge 
 to the crew,

679
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:19,610
but they hadn't warmed  
 to the idea of backing Hawkes

680
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:21,446
anymore than I had.

681
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:25,416
The fact was, 
 they'd rather darn socks 
 than lose a dime.

682
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,121
So Bill and I both knew 
 that it was up to me 
 to talk them into it.

683
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,356
Here he comes!

684
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,825
[cheering]

685
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:40,698
- Bitterroot beer.
- Be careful there.

686
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,633
Drink up!

687
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,002
You guys want
some more of that?

688
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,037
Not too much
for the young lad there.

689
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:48,373
There you go.
Time for celebration.

690
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,208
[groans]

691
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,542
That's good, huh?

692
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:53,478
Boys, here we are
at the end of the season.

693
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,580
Yeah.

694
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,850
You all know
what I got in mind.

695
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:00,618
What's that, Bill?

696
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,654
[laughing]

697
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,927
No doubt
there is risk involved,

698
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,430
financial
and otherwise.

699
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,965
Got to make up
your own minds.

700
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,735
In or out?
It's up to you.

701
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,409
Mac?

702
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,448
Well, you all know
how I feel about Mr. Hawkes.

703
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,749
Yeah, we sure do.

704
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,750
Yeah, sure do.

705
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,485
Make it plain every day.

706
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:42,860
I'm not about to let that
get in the way
of good business.

707
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:45,196
I'm in for
half a month's pay.

708
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,132
[murmuring]

709
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,200
I believe in that boy.

710
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,036
He's going to go far,
and I'm going to go with him

711
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,138
all the way to the bank.

712
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:58,043
The last time
I volunteered--

713
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:01,379
well, it didn't
work out so good.

714
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,414
- Come here, Red.
- Okay, what?

715
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:06,384
Fix bayonets, boys.
We're going over the top.

716
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,253
Yeah, we're in!

717
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,587
You ain't keeping
Red and me out.

718
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,256
We're gonna
clean out that town.

719
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:12,590
How much we going
to make, Mac?

720
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,425
How much you figure?

721
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,427
Man:
What do you figure, Mac?

722
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:18,429
Man 2:
Come on, Mac.

723
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:21,099
I figure
we should each clear
a summer's wages.

724
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:23,768
- Ooh!
- A summer's wages?

725
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,570
At least.
Maybe more.

726
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,005
More?

727
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,273
We better practice up
for Hamilton!

728
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,008
We're going to
clean out that town!

729
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,442
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo-hoo!

730
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,544
McBride:
I never knew a summer crew
worth its salt

731
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,980
that didn't clean out
the town

732
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,347
at the end of the season.

733
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,849
Red:
Including them women
and girls at the hotel!

734
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:42,553
[men chattering]

735
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:45,991
[snoring]

736
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,774
What are you doing?

737
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,276
Going to set a record.

738
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,778
All the way to Hamilton
in one day.

739
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,914
Are you crazy?
What for?

740
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,249
I need a little
local fame.

741
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,319
Always took you
for smarter.

742
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,921
Nobody's perfect,

743
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,623
except maybe Hawkes.

744
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:21,759
Oh, I see.

745
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,061
You're going to
kill yourself

746
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,396
because you're jealous
of a two-bit cardsharp.

747
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,098
Packing's a pipe dream,

748
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,266
powder makes me sick,

749
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,501
so it's got to be
the walking.

750
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:33,838
[coughs]

751
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,926
You're not proving
anything to anybody.

752
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,029
Just to me.

753
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,364
Didn't you ever do that?

754
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:02,100
Mac, it's 14 miles
up to the Bitterroot divide

755
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:03,868
before you even start down.

756
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:07,004
And it's another 14 miles
just to the mouth
of Blodgett Canyon.

757
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:09,207
That ain't even
the hard part.

758
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,543
Some people play cards
better than others,

759
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:15,180
me, I can outwalk any man
in the district.

760
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,847
Even if you make it,

761
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,583
they're apt to bury you
for dead when you get there.

762
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,485
Not this boy.

763
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,556
Saturday night
I need you alive and well
in Hamilton.

764
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,358
Saturday night
in Hamilton.

765
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,526
Nothing to it.

766
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,860
Bill: You got
plenty of water?

767
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,496
I told you,
it makes me sick.

768
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,031
How'd you ever
live this long?

769
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,101
I'm a Presbyterian!

770
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:36,594
[grunts]

771
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:47,938
Oh, gee.

772
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,027
No, no, no.

773
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,530
No cramps.
No, no, no.

774
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,533
'Nuff said.
I got to go.

775
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:18,869
I got to go.
Saturday night.

776
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:22,707
Hamilton.
Saturday night.

777
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,543
Hamilton.
Saturday night.

778
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,345
In Hamilton.
Saturday night.

779
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:46,631
[muttering]

780
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,633
Start to stop and swear...

781
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,468
And what did that--

782
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,437
Whoa!

783
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,107
Aah!

784
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,316
[coughing]

785
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,162
'Nuff said.

786
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,203
One more rise.
One more rise.

787
00:53:26,237 --> 00:53:29,039
You can do it.
It's just over the hill.

788
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:32,042
You can do it.
Almost there.

789
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,345
Hamilton,
just over the rise.

790
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,327
They moved it.

791
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,498
They moved it.

792
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:01,071
52, 54,

793
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:03,774

50-10, 50-12.

795
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,085
Can't drink.
Can't drink.

796
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,120
'Nuff said.

797
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,389
Can't drink.

798
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:25,763
From time to time, 
 I thought I was on 
 the fire line,

799
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:30,100
and that the sky 
 was swirling 
 with burning cones,

800
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:35,072
and that the universe 
 was upside down 
 with Hell above.

801
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,846
School, school.
Money, money.

802
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:44,349
I'll cover you,
cover you, cover you.

803
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,983
Sugar bag...

804
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,854
Vanilla.

805
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:06,931
Vanilla.

00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,174
Yellow.

808
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:52,342
Hmm?

809
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,845
Lemon.

810
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,519
Coming right up.

811
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:22,873
Chocolate.

812
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:25,175
What's the matter with you?

813
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:28,746
Chocolate.

814
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,315
I don't believe
you should have another.

815
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:41,526
Walked it--
one day.

816
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,428
All the way.

00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,481
Oh.

819
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,735
How are you today, sir?

820
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:05,475
You got a problem?

821
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:11,749
You smell.

822
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:15,252
What did you say?
I smell?

823
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,087
Nice.

824
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:22,226
Yeah, well,
why don't you just order?

825
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,335
I'll give you a minute.

Dirty.

829
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,460
Me?

830
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,667
Oh. In the back.

831
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,447
You ready to order now?

832
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,717
No, I'm ready
to order now.

833
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,218
I see.

834
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,524
Do you know
what you want?

835
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:04,528
Mmm.

836
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:06,697
No?

837
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:09,466
Okay, how about
the chicken chow mein?

838
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,536
That would be
just fine.

839
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:16,540
We've got some
different kinds
of chop suey.

840
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,209
That would be
just fine.

841
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:22,947
How about chicken chow mein
suey chopped?

842
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,983
That would be
just fine.

843
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,288
I'll bring you
some soup to start.

844
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,257
That would be
just fine.

845
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,796
Are you okay?

846
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,230
Just fine.

847
01:01:58,148 --> 01:01:59,283
I need the check.

848
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:00,785
But you haven't
even eaten yet.

849
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,252
Please,
have the check.

850
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,510
I love you.

[chattering]

852
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,953
Well, well, well.

853
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:38,122
You sure gave us
a scare there,
young fella.

854
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:41,125
Got to stay alive.

855
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:42,459
You'll live, all right,

856
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,095
if you lay off
of ice cream sodas
after exertions.

857
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:48,632
Saturday night.

858
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:49,967
Hamilton.

859
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,301
This here is Hamilton,
but it ain't Saturday.

860
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,736
I recommend 
you get some sleep
till it is.

861
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,639
Hey, no charge
for the soup.

862
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:57,307
Get out of the way.

863
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:58,675
Man:
I want you to come see me
in my office in the morning.

864
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,877
You hear?

865
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,978
You don't come tomorrow,

866
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,446
I'm going to charge you
for tonight.

867
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:03,613
If you come tomorrow,

868
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:06,250
I won't charge you
for tonight or tomorrow.

869
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,085
Just want to know
if you're okay.

870
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,020
You see
that he gets there.

871
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:11,521
Me?
I don't even know him.

872
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,357
Well, you better
get him to the hotel.

873
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,859
That place?

874
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:18,728
Don't worry.
He's in no condition
to fall into sin.

875
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:21,866
[groans]

876
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:25,035
The only men
on God's green Earth

877
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:27,371
dumber about cards
than a sheep herder

878
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:30,875
is Bill Bell
and his summer crew
of Forest Service boys.

879
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:34,044
They can't shuffle,
they can't deal,
they can't count.

880
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:37,181
My how I love them.

881
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,516
They're not going to like
being separated
from a summer's pay.

882
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,518
They'll see red.
They'll want blood.

883
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,787
I'll lay odds on that.

884
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:48,525
Bound to be fighting.
Bound to be.

885
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,196
I don't tangle myself.
It's bad for the fingers.

886
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:53,864
Yeah, that's right.

887
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:56,366
You got to watch it.

888
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,170
Yeah, tangling
is bad for the fingers.

889
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:04,441
That's why
I favor surprise.

890
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,410
[men laughing]

891
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,084
You keep your gun handy.

892
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:15,085
Yes, sir.

893
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,854
[laughter continues]

894
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:19,756
[music playing,
women laughing]

895
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,425
- Woman: Give me my money.
- Man: I said no.

896
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:24,428
- You promised it to me!
- No, it's enough for you.

897
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:26,931
- No, it's not.
- Enough!

898
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:28,265
Woman:
You didn't give me
anything!

899
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,367
Man:
No, that's what I said.
I am a businessman.

900
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,868
Woman:
You call yourself
a businessman?

901
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:32,869
Man: Yes!

902
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:34,371
- It's mine!
- No!

903
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,373
- I earned it!
- I said no.

904
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:39,043
Woman:
You owe me that money.
You promised it to me.

905
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,710
- We made a deal!
- That's it! I said no.

906
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:44,014
Woman:
Give me my money!

907
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:45,849
I set him up.
I deserve my cut.

908
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,552
I am a businessman.
You are cheese for a trap.

909
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,854
Woman:
You're a two-bit cheapskate,
that's what you are.

910
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:54,691
You're a no-good showgirl
with nothing to show.

911
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,194
Hey, hey, hey.
Not too fast, buster.

912
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,862
Five bucks...

913
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,032
[chattering,
woman laughing]

914
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,200
How do you do?

915
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,402
Go back to bed, cowboy.

916
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:11,908
You deaf?

917
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,247
Woman:
Hey, that's mine!

918
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,416
He gave it to me!

919
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,085
Man:
Ladies, please!

920
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:23,720
Now there's enough
for all of you.

921
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,361
All right, again.

922
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,530
Good.

923
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:36,366
Come on,
give me a big one.

924
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,536
Uh-huh.
Well, you walked
too far,

925
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,039
you got too hot,
you probably didn't drink
anything to boot.

926
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,707
Well, of course.

927
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,709
All of your blood
was on the outside of you,

928
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:47,744
in your legs,
in your arm muscles.

929
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,014
You drank them two
ice cream sodas.

930
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,248
They was cold, of course.

931
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,516
The blood rushed
inside you,

932
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:55,019
left your head empty,
and then you fainted.

933
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:57,687
I haven't ever known
anybody who fainted before.

934
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:00,090
- I thought only wome--
- What was that?

935
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:02,359
Nothing, nothing.

936
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,761
Here, I want you
to take these, right,

937
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,096
and get out of here.

938
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,597
I've got people
waiting outside

939
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,333
with things a lot worse
than ice cream soda disorders.

940
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,567
Get!

941
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,437
You boys listen
to your mama, now.

942
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,039
[boys arguing]

943
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:17,241
You are pretty big
for fainting.

944
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:19,109
Maybe you got
a heart condition.

945
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,878
I don't think so.

946
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,413
Pretty sure
of yourself, are you?

947
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,282
You're quite outspoken
for a girl.

948
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,417
It helps people
avoid stepping on you.

949
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:28,418
I can see
that it might.

950
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:29,419
It does.

951
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:30,520
It's not a bad
feature to have.

952
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:32,522
Especially
if you have freckles.

953
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,358
You do have a few,
don't you?

954
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:36,860
I don't discuss
my skin coloration
with strangers.

955
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,695
The name's Mac.

956
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,365
Sue.

957
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:42,532
Do you mind
if I ask you,

958
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,201
do you have a bag
you can spare?

959
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,170
A sugar bag, maybe?

960
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,006
Okay, come on.

961
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,377
Listen,
I might as well tell you

962
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,844
before you find out
the hard way.

963
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:58,182
The boys at the Oxford
are laying for Bill Bell
and his crew.

964
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,849
I don't know
any boys at the Oxford.

965
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,852
Yeah, well,
you could do
Bill Bell a favor.

966
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:04,921
Tell him he could
be in big trouble

967
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,890
if he takes up
a deck of cards
in his hands.

968
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,925
I figure Bill Bell
is a man capable

969
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,594
of taking care
of himself.

970
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,229
Like all you men, right?

971
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,333
[women chattering]

972
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:20,270
Are you from Hamilton?

973
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:22,439
No, Darby.

974
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,441
I ran away with the intention
of getting to Missoula,

975
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,776
but this is as far as I got.

976
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:27,744
I'm from Missoula.

977
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,979
[chattering]

978
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,916
I figured you were from
the big city.

979
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,852
I guess passing out
like that

980
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,521
is about the oddest
thing I've ever done.

981
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,855
Not quite.

982
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,157
You also said
you love me.

983
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,527
I don't hold
sick people to their word,

984
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,530
so don't worry about it.

985
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,198
You're pretty smart
for being from Darby.

986
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,667
Just you wait
till I get to Missoula.

987
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,871
Thanks for helping me.

988
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,673
You're welcome.

989
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:05,749
Hey, you remember
what I said about the Oxford.

990
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:08,051
I got better things to do
than to play nurse.

991
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:16,426
But you should come by
for a hamburger later.

992
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,895
You'll need some meat
to strengthen you up.

993
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,298
How did you do?

994
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:56,466
Made it.

995
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,536
[men laughing]

996
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,871
Man:
I guess he got that
local fame he was wanting.

997
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:02,872
[laughter continues]

998
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:03,873
Hey, Red,
come on, let's go.

999
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:07,010
Man:
Hey, Mac, how you doing?

1000
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,312
Hey, Mac.

1001
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:13,082
Listen, we're one crew,

1002
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:15,252
but let's don't
stand around together
in one bunch

1003
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:16,420
until we get
to the Oxford.

1004
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,921
What time you want us
there, Bill?

1005
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,258
I say start drifting in
between 9:30 and 10:00.

1006
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:24,761
Mr. Smith,
I want you to hang
in the doorway,

1007
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,963
take care of
whatever comes in
from the bar side.

1008
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,565
Right you are.

1009
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:31,868
Anything goes wrong,
Mac will scoop up the money,

1010
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,703
I'll cover him.

1011
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,873
Rest of you help out
wherever we're hurting.

1012
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,042
Other than that,
let's don't make
too many plans.

1013
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,611
One or two
wouldn't hurt.

1014
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:44,013
Okay, let me
go over the rules.

1015
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:45,849
Except for one or two
hands a night,

1016
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:47,351
I'm a percentage player.

1017
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,018
I'm a very good
percentage player,

1018
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:50,687
so I'll probably
be ahead.

1019
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,856
But if I'm not,
don't lose patience.

1020
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:55,992
They'll be one big hand.
Just be ready.

1021
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,128
One very big hand.

1022
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,096
Those are rules?

1023
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,868
You heard him.

1024
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:07,036
McBride:
I'm for a sip of something
we didn't percolate ourselves.

1025
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,572
What do you say, men?

1026
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:11,375
Raises the spirits,
dulls the pain,
God save the king.

1027
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:13,209
God save the king!

1028
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:15,011
Man:
Here we go!

1029
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:35,965
Hey, you!

1030
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:37,934
Kid, where do you
think you're going?

1031
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,671
I've got some friends
in there.

1032
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:43,006
Come here.

1033
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,111
What do you want?

1034
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:51,681
I'm looking
for Bill Bell.

1035
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,116
You work for him?

1036
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,351
That's right.

1037
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,953
He's back there.

1038
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,488
What's he doing
back there?

1039
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:00,590
Why don't you go back
and find out?

1040
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,198
You got the bag?

1041
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:10,367
The bartender's
got a gun.

1042
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,402
There's ways around that.

1043
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,170
[men chattering]

1044
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,206
Ante up, ante up.

1045
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,676
Oh, Mr. Hawkes,
try and speed up,
will you?

1046
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,216
Man:
I'll raise you a dollar.

1047
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,518
[coins clink on table]

1048
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:30,286
Man 2:
I see that.

1049
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,621
Man:
Feeling lucky?

1050
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,123
Hawkes:
Darn, I can't possibly--

1051
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:36,125
No, I should drop out.

1052
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,862
Look, mister,
when you ain't got 'em,
you pretend you have them.

1053
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,229
When you have got 'em,
you pretend you ain't.

1054
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:41,965
I read you like a book.

1055
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,600
Now bet or fold.

1056
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,102
Yeah.

1057
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:49,238
Guess I may as well.

1058
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,042
Three boys.

1059
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,944
Ooh, that's a big hand.

1060
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:58,715
Like I figured,
got me beat.

1061
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,016
Pair of queens.

1062
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,524
Old Mac: 
 For my money,

1063
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,793
he was too flashy 
 and showing off.

1064
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,362
But our crew 
 was proud of him,

1065
01:12:12,396 --> 01:12:15,031
and standing right over him 
 as if I owned him,

1066
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,866
I guess I was, too,

1067
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,035
although never completely 
 losing the feeling

1068
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,270
that something was missing 
 in him somewhere.

1069
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,977
Man:
You sure deal
pretty slowly.

1070
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,215
I told you, boys.

1071
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,184
I told you I had
a flush going in.

1072
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,487
[crowd murmuring]

1073
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,603
I'll open for a dollar.

1074
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,471
Staying in.

1075
01:14:01,505 --> 01:14:04,207
I think
these are worth it.

1076
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,275
I'll raise a dollar.

1077
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:08,978
No, how about five?

1078
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:10,580
- [crowd murmuring]
- Five dollars?

1079
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,129
Give me two cards.

1080
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:32,969
I'm playing these.

1081
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:36,172
Give me three.

1082
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,345
Dealer takes three.

1083
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,520
I beg your pardon,

1084
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:52,355
but I like to see
a man's face

1085
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:53,456
when I play cards with him.

1086
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,925
[crowd murmuring]

1087
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:57,393
[chuckles]

1088
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:11,007
Cost you five more dollars
to stay in.

1089
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:16,980
Make it ten.

1090
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,715
[murmuring continues]

1091
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,196
Uh-unh.

1092
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,698
Sorry, partner,
but I do believe

1093
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,099
you're going to
have to throw away
your hand.

1094
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:39,636
I do believe,
you've got an extra card.

1095
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:40,970
Who, me?

1096
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:43,740
Yeah, you.

1097
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:45,508
You got six cards
in your hand.

1098
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,812
You must have had
that extra card
up your sleeve

1099
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,680
just waiting for
a big pot like this one.

1100
01:16:19,475 --> 01:16:21,544
Sorry, I don't think
I heard you just right.

1101
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:26,249
Yeah, you did.

1102
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:29,052
I said you got
six cards in your hand.

1103
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:34,223
Count 'em.

1104
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,839
How many?

1105
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:52,676
How many?

1106
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,647
1, 2, 3, 4...

1107
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:01,184
5.

1108
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,786
And if you're looking
for that extra card

1109
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,187
you dealt me
to get me out of the game,

1110
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,990
you'll find it
in your dealer's hatband.

1111
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:08,491
Man:
What in the world?

1112
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,265
The cook had gone too far 
 and shown off,

1113
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,334
and now everybody knew 
 what he was 
 and why he was there,

1114
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,269
especially Bill,

1115
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,271
who looked at me 
 and I knew 
 it was 'nuff said.

1116
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,541
[honkytonk playing]

1117
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,410
[shouting]

1118
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:30,680
Get off!

1119
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:33,683
* You are mine,
I love you best of all *

1120
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:37,687
* And be my man,
or I'll have no man at all *

1121
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:41,357
* There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight *

1122
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:44,694
* When you hear
those bells go ding-a-ling *

1123
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,696
- Nice hook, son.
- Thanks, Pa.

1124
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:50,333
* All join round,
and sweetly you must sing *

1125
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:51,334
I knew it.

1126
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:53,336
Drop the money, kid!

1127
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,371
Help me!

1128
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:58,474
* Hot time
in the old town tonight... *

1129
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,844
[man scatting]

1130
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,993
* Please, oh, please

1131
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,228
* Do not let me fall

1132
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:23,399
* You are mine,
I love you best of all *

1133
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:27,270
* He will be my man,
or I'll have no man at all *

1134
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:31,340
* There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight *

1135
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,177
* There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight *

1136
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,678
Come on, tough guy.
Come on.

1137
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,682
* There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight *

1138
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,317
[coughing]

1139
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,520
Up you get, Mac.
It's over.

1140
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,356
Red, Red!
Whoa, it's me, Pa!

1141
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,858
Red, come on!
Let's go. It's over.

1142
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,527
Come on, Red, Red.
Come on, it's okay.

1143
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,029
Are you all right,
honey?

1144
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,230
You want me
to get you a drink?

1145
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:58,334
[men shouting]

1146
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,702
Let go!
Let go of me!

1147
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,337
Let go.

1148
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,242
Man:
Is my lip bleeding?
Is my lip bleeding?

1149
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:11,047
Man 2:
Oh! I can't see!

1150
01:19:12,115 --> 01:19:15,584
Okay.
Okay, boys.

1151
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:16,752
I'm going to count it.

1152
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:18,087
No, no,
that's all right, Bill.

1153
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:20,423
Let Mr. Smith count it.

1154
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:22,558
All right.

1155
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:29,765
Not counting
what you invested,

1156
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:33,702
earnings come to,
per man,

1157
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:38,174
about $7.20 each.

1158
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:41,177
- $7.00?
- And 20 cents?

1159
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,179
You sure?

1160
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:46,850
$7.20
is a big night's work.

1161
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:49,185
$14.40 for you and me.

1162
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:50,854
Hey, Mac,
you did real good.

1163
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:52,021
You came right through
in the trenches.

1164
01:19:52,055 --> 01:19:53,857
- You sure did, Mac.
- That's for sure, Mac.

1165
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,959
Good going!
Oh, sorry.

1166
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:56,960
Red.

1167
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:58,995
I didn't mean
to hit you so hard.

1168
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:13,042
You're a real good fighter.

1169
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:14,844
Thanks, Mac.

1170
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:16,846
- He is, really.
- That's true, son.

1171
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,784
[chattering]

1172
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,686
Come back here
tomorrow afternoon

1173
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:25,188
and help me pack up.

1174
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:27,523
Oh, no, no, no.
The night is but a pup!

1175
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,626
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay! See--

1176
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,795
- Whoa, whoa!
- Pick him up.

1177
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:35,298
[all shushing]

1178
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,801
Red: $7.20. Not bad
for a night's work.

1179
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,036
Whoo!

1180
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:42,038
Man:
Red, stop that.

1181
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:45,274
[chattering]

1182
01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:54,250
Man:
Hold on to your
feathers, ladies.

1183
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,586
[women giggle]

1184
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,005
- Bye, Wong.
- See you next time.

1185
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,013
Heard about last night.

1186
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:25,982
I'll take
that hamburger now.

1187
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:47,270
Oh, oh!

1188
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:15,864
Be a wonder
if you don't go deaf
in this ear.

1189
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,533
What?

1190
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,169
Not that you listen
out of it much anyway.

1191
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,842
I told you
to be careful.

1192
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,910
Here, hold this.

1193
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:03,279
I've never spent so much time

1194
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,482
tending to the infirmities
of one person in my whole life.

1195
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:23,532
Well, I've seen better,

1196
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,335
but it'll have to do.

1197
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:31,507
Thanks.

1198
01:23:33,076 --> 01:23:35,611
I really do
appreciate it.

1199
01:23:35,644 --> 01:23:36,579
Honest.

1200
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:40,849
I wouldn't have done it

1201
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,651
unless I was
more than willing.

1202
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,090
Before I forget,
there's a friend of yours
out in the alley.

1203
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:23,058
He looks even worse
than you do.

1204
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:27,896
Well, you better show me.

1205
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,670
[bell tolling]

1206
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:42,511
I offered to help him,
but he told me to get away.

1207
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:44,980
You picked
the last guy in the world
to help this bird.

1208
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:58,327
Hey.
What happened?

1209
01:25:01,564 --> 01:25:04,200
I'm broke.

1210
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:07,270
You?
An expert?

1211
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,905
A true artiste,
broke?

1212
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:10,906
How's that
possible?

1213
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:15,244
They rolled me.

1214
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:16,979
That spindly
little showgirl

1215
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,981
with nothing to show.

1216
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:22,885
[laughs]

1217
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:29,258
Need some money.

1218
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,993
Get to Butte.

1219
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:03,492
Loan me $10.00.

1220
01:26:08,964 --> 01:26:10,566
I'll tell you what...

1221
01:26:15,804 --> 01:26:19,608
I'll give you
my $7.20 of winnings.

1222
01:26:19,642 --> 01:26:20,909
That will get you
a ticket back home.

1223
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:22,245
I don't want it back.

1224
01:26:22,278 --> 01:26:23,246
I'll pay you back.

1225
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:25,248
Never mind about that.

1226
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:28,217
All right.
Thanks.

1227
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:39,194
So what do you think, huh?

1228
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,663
What do you think?

1229
01:26:42,398 --> 01:26:45,868
About what?

1230
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:48,671
Do you think you might
ever make it back this way?

1231
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:57,313
I wouldn't be surprised.

1232
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,893
Ready?

1233
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:16,399
It's been a pretty good
crew this summer.

1234
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:20,403
Did what they had to do...

1235
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:25,574
loved the woods
without thinking
they own them...

1236
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:30,145
Every man good
at one thing or another...

1237
01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:36,685
swinging a jackhammer,
fighting fires,

1238
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,654
loved to fight...

1239
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:48,697
good with tools and knots,

1240
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:49,998
liked to work.

1241
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:56,872
If you think about it,

1242
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:59,174
that's a lot to say
about a bunch of men.

1243
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:01,977
Yes, it is.

1244
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,425
There he is, girl.
Go on. Go on, now.

1245
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:18,394
There's that old dog.

1246
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:21,664
[dog barks]

1247
01:28:21,697 --> 01:28:23,098
Thanks, Bill.
She's a good one.

1248
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,100
Come here, girl.
Whoa, it's my girl!

1249
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,435
There's my girl.

1250
01:28:26,469 --> 01:28:28,337
You catch any coyotes
this summer?

1251
01:28:28,371 --> 01:28:30,172
Did you?
Did you?

1252
01:28:30,205 --> 01:28:32,341
That a girl.
Yeah.

1253
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:46,522
That was a fair thing
you did for the cook.

1254
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:50,859
Yeah, well...

1255
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:54,797
So, you going to come
work for me next summer?

1256
01:28:56,732 --> 01:29:00,869
Spare chance of making
a ranger out of you yet.

1257
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:04,540
Sure.
It's a deal.

1258
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:07,242
It's a deal, then.

1259
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:09,578
I'll write you
in the spring.

1260
01:29:09,612 --> 01:29:10,846
Deal.

1261
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,492
Be seeing you.

1262
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:25,528
Me, too.

1263
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,537
Come on, girl.

1264
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,505
- [whistles]
- [dog barks]

1265
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:55,190
Old Mac: 
 I watched Bill Bell 
 and his horse

1266
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:58,861
and that old dog 
 who loved catching coyotes,

1267
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:00,863
and then he turned 
 in his saddle

1268
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,532
and raised up that hat 
 he always wore

1269
01:30:03,566 --> 01:30:05,701
and gave me a big wave.

1270
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,036
And I stood on 
 the middle rail 
 of the corral

1271
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,039
and gave him 
 a big wave back.

1272
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,176
I had no way of knowing 
 that particular afternoon,

1273
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:18,514
but I was never to cross 
 the Bitterroot Mountains again,

1274
01:30:18,547 --> 01:30:20,516
and I was never 
 to see Bill Bell

1275
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:23,919
or any of 
 the other men again.

1276
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:28,524
I have a feeling Bill Bell 
 might have guessed that 
 when he rode off.

1277
01:30:28,557 --> 01:30:32,294
Everything that 
 was going to happen, 
 had happened.

1278
01:30:32,327 --> 01:30:36,131
Everything that was 
 to be seen was gone.

1279
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:38,133
My summer with 
 the ranger and the cook

1280
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:42,270
had all disappeared 
 into that gigantic hole 
 in the sky.

1281
01:30:45,508 --> 01:30:47,943
I think the answer 
 had something to do

1282
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:51,113
with my becoming 18 
 the next summer.

1283
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:55,283
The wind sort of 
 shifted in my life.

1284
01:30:55,317 --> 01:30:57,953
I started wishing 
 that freckled girl Sue

1285
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:00,623
might just show up 
 in Missoula,

1286
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:03,125
things like that.

1287
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:06,161
I was very conscious  
 of becoming 18.
