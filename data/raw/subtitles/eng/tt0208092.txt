3
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,580
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
<i>Funny name for an Englishman, I know.</i>

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,500
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,780
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

7
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,940
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

8
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,580
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

9
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,180
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,220
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.</i>

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,020
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,820
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,180
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

14
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,220
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,260
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,020
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,740
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,620
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,540
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,940
<i>- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?</i>

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,740
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken literally.</i>

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,620
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,860
<i>It's bound with moral fibre...</i>

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,260
<i>... but asking a grown man
to believe it?</i>

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,180
<i>What is it?</i>

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,780
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,140
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,980
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,620
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,740
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,260
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,860
<i>Enough already. Ruben, say something.</i>

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,540
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,860
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...</i>

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,140
<i>... into the Greek word for "virgin".</i>

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,700
<i>It was an easy mistake to make...</i>

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,780
<i>... because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,020
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,260
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son."</i>

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,420
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.</i>

41
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,140
<i>It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

42
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,180
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...</i>

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,860
<i>... and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

44
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,060
Oy vay, "what are you saying?"

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,820
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written...</i>

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,540
<i>... doesn't make it so.</i>

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,540
<i>Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,060
<i>- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear anymore.</i>

49
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,820
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,100
<i>- Michael.
- Hello?</i>

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,500
<i>Mutti.</i>

52
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,700
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,980
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

54
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,180
- Michael.
- Mutti.

55
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,380
You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

56
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,020
Lie down on the floor.

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,620
Get on the floor!

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,060
Lie on the floor!

59
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,620
Get on the fucking floor!

60
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,740
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

61
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Down on the floor! Get down!

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,700
On the ground!

63
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,020
Get down, I say!

64
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,660
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

65
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,460
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,580
Where is the stone?

67
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,580
Where is the stone?

68
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Michael, where is the stone?

69
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,500
When does your plane leave?

70
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,900
Twenty minutes.

71
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,100
Give me your gun.

72
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,620
When you get to London...

73
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,140
...if you want a gun...

74
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,140
...call this number.

75
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,620
- Boris.
- Boris.

76
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,940
He can get you anything you need.

77
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,180
Is he allowed to do that?

78
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,540
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

79
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,180
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

80
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,260
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

81
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Two minutes, Turkish.

82
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,260
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,940
We'll need a proper office.

84
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,020
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

85
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,220
Why me?

86
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,260
Well, you know about caravans.

87
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,940
How's that?

88
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,420
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

89
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,740
And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.

90
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,700
What's wrong with this one?

91
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,700
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

92
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,660
It's tiptop.

93
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm just not sure about the colour.

94
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,220
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

95
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,260
Here's an address.

96
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
It's a campsite.

97
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,740
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

98
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,500
- What's happening with them sausages?
- Five minutes.

99
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,660
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

100
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,500
They ain't pikeys, are they?

101
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,300
I fucking hate pikeys.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,500
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

103
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,940
Fuck me. Hold tight.

104
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,660
- What's that?
- It's me belt.

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,140
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

106
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,340
- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.

107
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,780
Protection from what?

108
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,740
"Zee" Germans?

109
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,020
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

110
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,340
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

111
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,540
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

112
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,620
Heavy, isn't it?

113
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,940
Heavy is good.

114
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,300
Heavy is reliable.

115
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,060
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

116
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

117
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,660
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

118
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,260
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

119
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,700
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

120
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,620
<i>Tommy runs the other business...</i>

121
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,420
<i>... the slot machines...</i>

122
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,020
<i>... which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

123
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,140
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

124
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,100
All right, I'll take it.

125
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,860
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

126
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,380
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

127
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
<i>Brick Top.</i>

128
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,540
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

129
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,780
- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.

130
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,380
He'll do you proud.

131
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,500
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

132
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
It's what you deserve.

133
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,020
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

134
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,900
Dogs do that.

135
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,860
You're not a dog, are you?

136
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,620
No. No, I'm not.

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,780
However...

138
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,380
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

139
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,820
All except loyalty.

140
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,300
<i>It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...</i>

141
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,180
<i>... a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

142
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,420
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

143
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,180
But I got no time for grouses.

144
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,900
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

145
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,740
What the fuck are you two looking at?

146
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,220
<i>If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

147
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,660
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

148
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,060
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

149
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,900
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

150
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,100
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

151
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,460
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

152
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,860
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.</i>

153
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,700
<i>Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.</i>

154
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,740
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

155
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,420
You don't like me, do you?

156
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,940
Don't know what you mean.

157
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,660
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

158
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,300
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

159
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,740
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

160
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,340
<i>You can sort me out by showing me out.</i>

161
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,260
<i>It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...</i>

162
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,980
<i>... you do something
against your principles.</i>

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,060
<i>Basically, you have to forget
you got any.</i>

164
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,660
Are they Lancashire pigs?

165
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,660
Who's talking to you?

166
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,900
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

167
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't let me down.

168
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,100
You don't want to let me down, do you?

169
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,100
See you ringside.

170
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,180
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

171
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,980
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

172
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,660
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

173
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,020
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

174
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,940
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

175
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,500
But don't you hit him either.

176
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,700
Americans can't know it was Russian.

177
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,980
It will come back to me.

178
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,980
You're my brother, so think like it.

179
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,620
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

180
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,900
I don't want it getting back to me.

181
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,860
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

182
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,820
So don't use idiots for the job.

183
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,500
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

184
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,540
...so move quick. Okay?

185
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,140
One more thing.

186
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,140
It might help.

187
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,540
He loves to gamble.

188
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,340
Eighty-six carats?

189
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,900
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

190
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,620
A beautiful stone.

191
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,820
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

192
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,020
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

193
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,860
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

194
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,980
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

195
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,540
And Franky...

196
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,260
<i>- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.</i>

197
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,740
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

198
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,020
<i>- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.</i>

199
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,740
I'll see you, Avi.

200
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,620
Eighty-six carats.

201
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,460
- Where?
- London.

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,180
- London?
- London.

203
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,940
- London?
- Yes, London.

204
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,820
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

205
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,540
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

206
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,020
Not for me.

207
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,260
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

208
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,860
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.</i>

209
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,420
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.</i>

210
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,100
<i>Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

211
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,500
<i>Even tells his family
they're Jewish...</i>

212
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,900
<i>... but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

213
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,900
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...</i>

214
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,420
<i>...it is good for business.
- Avi!</i>

215
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,700
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

216
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,420
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

217
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,180
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

218
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,420
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

219
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,460
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

220
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,940
Listen to me.

221
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,340
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

222
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,780
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

223
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,460
What are you doing here?

224
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,940
It's a free country, isn't it?

225
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,500
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

226
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,940
So fuck off.

227
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,580
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

228
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,500
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

229
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,380
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,780
- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,380
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

232
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,460
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

233
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,300
The weight is sign of reliability.

234
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,980
I always go for reliability.

235
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,060
I'll take it.

236
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,660
How much do you want for it?

237
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,500
Nothing.

238
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,660
Okay, so what do you want for it?

239
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,860
I want you to do something for me.

240
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,300
There is a fight in couple of days.

241
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,860
What kind of a fight?

242
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,180
Unlicensed boxing.

243
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,380
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

244
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,860
If you place one down for me...

245
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,580
...we will call it quits.

246
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,460
- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...

247
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,980
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

248
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,100
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

249
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,780
I know something most don't.

250
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,380
So, "nu"?

251
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,580
What do you know?

252
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,220
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

253
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,900
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

254
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,300
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

255
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,340
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

256
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,340
Not if you're here.

257
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,340
Oh, you bastard.

258
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,460
I fucking hate pikeys.

259
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,220
That's a flash car, mister.

260
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,900
Not as flash as your bike.

261
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,940
Who are you looking for?

262
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,940
Mr. O'Neil.

263
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,260
- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.

264
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,860
Piss off.

265
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,260
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,460
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

267
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,260
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

268
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,700
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

269
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,420
You're a real tight fucker.

270
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
<i>There was a problem with gypsies.</i>

271
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,260
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

272
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
<i>You can't understand
what's being said.</i>

273
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,220
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

274
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,620
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

275
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,380
<i>Not Irish, not English.</i>

276
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,780
- How are you?
- Weather's been kind.

277
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>It's just Pikey.</i>

278
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,220
Would you look at the size of him?

279
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,900
How big are you?

280
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,060
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

281
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,500
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

282
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,100
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

283
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,780
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

284
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,300
I could murder one.

285
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,420
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

286
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,620
Get your hands out of there.

287
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,340
Cup of tea for the big fella?

288
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,060
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

289
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,140
You little bugger.

290
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,460
- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.

291
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,300
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

292
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,100
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

293
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,540
- Dags?
- What?

294
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,980
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

295
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,900
Oh, dogs.

296
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
Sure, I like dags.

297
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,180
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

298
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,260
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

299
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,420
<i>It's probably why
they talk like that...</i>

300
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
<i>... so you can't follow
what's being said.</i>

301
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,220
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...</i>

302
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,740
<i>... on his return
there will be ice cream.</i>

303
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,660
Good dog, good family.

304
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,740
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

305
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,500
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

306
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,980
All right, Mickey. Laters.

307
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,100
I don't see what the fuss is about.

308
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,060
They aren't bad fellas.

309
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,540
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

310
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,780
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

311
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,740
See that car? Use it.

312
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,940
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

313
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,540
Nobody brings you...

314
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,220
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

315
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,300
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

316
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,420
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

317
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,700
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

318
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,220
Now, go on! Go on!

319
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,580
I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!

320
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,620
Get her to sit down.

321
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,820
For fuck's sake!

322
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,260
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

323
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,140
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

324
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,700
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

325
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,180
You want to stay down.

326
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,380
You want to stay down!

327
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,260
Get back down and fucking stay down.

328
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,780
I promise you, you want to stay down.

329
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,060
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

330
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,660
Cheeky bastard.

331
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,780
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

332
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Get back down...

333
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,420
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

334
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,540
Bollocks to you.

335
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,540
This is sick. I'm out of here.

336
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,660
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

337
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,700
You stay until the job's done.

338
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,420
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...</i>

339
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,340
<i>... was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

340
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,820
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

341
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,500
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

342
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,380
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...</i>

343
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,220
<i>... Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.</i>

344
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,940
<i>Why would the gypsies
want to explain...</i>

345
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,220
<i>... why a man died in their campsite?</i>

346
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,620
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

347
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,220
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

348
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,620
<i>Tommy, "The Tit"...</i>

349
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,420
<i>... is praying.</i>

350
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,940
<i>And if he isn't...</i>

351
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,580
<i>... he fucking should be.</i>

352
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,260
Bad Boy.

353
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,220
- Sol.
- Easy.

354
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,060
No, it's a moissanite.

355
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,500
A what?

356
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,660
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

357
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,540
It's Mickey Mouse.

358
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,340
Spurious.

359
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,260
Not genuine.

360
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,340
And it's worth...

361
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,540
...fuck-all.

362
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,660
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

363
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,780
Leave this game to me and Sol.

364
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,660
Laters.

365
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,860
What is that, Vince?

366
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,740
This is a dog, Sol.

367
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,060
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

368
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
It's only a fucking dog.

369
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,620
- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.

370
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,060
Here.

371
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,820
They threw it in with the moody gold.

372
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,540
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

373
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,460
It better not be dangerous.

374
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,140
What do you think you're doing now?

375
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,540
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

376
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,500
Stop the dog!

377
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,380
Come back!

378
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,500
All right, Boris?

379
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,820
- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.

380
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,100
What can I do for you?

381
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,820
I have a job for you.

382
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,340
I already have a job.

383
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,260
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

384
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
Go on.

385
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,420
I want you to hold up a bookies.

386
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,820
From Russia with love, eh?

387
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,180
I have stones to sell...

388
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,420
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

389
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,620
...so if I am not rushing you...

390
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,700
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

391
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,420
I am not in Rome, Doug.

392
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,500
I am in a rush.

393
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,100
I got to make the bookies.

394
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,420
Bookies?

395
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,100
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

396
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,180
The unlicensed boxer?

397
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,700
Do you know something that I don't?

398
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,660
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

399
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,940
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

400
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,340
Of course I am.

401
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,220
Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.

402
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,100
Of course I have.

403
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,980
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

404
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,660
Your seats?

405
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,140
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

406
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,140
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

407
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,580
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

408
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,580
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

409
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,460
It went back to the gyppos.

410
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,340
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

411
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,940
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

412
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,220
Ask him.

413
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,740
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

414
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,900
Steady on the brakes.

415
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,700
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

416
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,580
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

417
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,700
All right?

418
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,420
What?

419
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,060
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

420
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,020
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

421
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,220
Worry about getting us a gun.

422
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,540
What's that?

423
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,220
This is a shotgun, Sol.

424
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,140
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

425
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,660
- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

426
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,100
That does not look like a bookies.

427
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,460
Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?

428
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,860
It's too tight.

429
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,180
Too tight?

430
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,460
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

431
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,780
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

432
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,980
Of course I am.

433
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,140
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

434
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,340
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

435
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,220
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

436
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,780
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

437
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,540
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

438
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,740
I didn't see it.

439
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,900
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

440
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,060
It was at a funny angle.

441
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,460
It's behind you, Tyrone.

442
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,420
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

443
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,300
Control that dog as well.

444
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,260
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

445
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,860
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

446
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,580
Don't snatch.

447
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,300
He can't swallow the whole ball.

448
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,180
Yeah.

449
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,100
Why the fuck...

450
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,580
...did you put Gorgeous George...

451
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,380
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

452
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,780
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

453
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,180
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

454
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,660
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

455
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,060
What the fuck did you expect?

456
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,460
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

457
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,060
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

458
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,620
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

459
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,660
You did.

460
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
You said get a good deal.

461
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,860
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

462
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,060
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

463
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,860
...and a good deal.

464
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,900
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

465
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,340
That his fight won't happen?

466
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,740
We replace the fighter.

467
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,740
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

468
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,140
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

469
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,660
What about John The Gun?

470
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,500
Or Mad Fist Willy?

471
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,980
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

472
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,100
Mad Fist went mad...

473
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,060
...and The Gun shot himself.

474
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,020
Jesus.

475
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,260
What?

476
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,860
Let's use the fucking pikey.

477
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,980
- How much you gonna pay us?
- 10 K.

478
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,900
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

479
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,420
All right.

480
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,060
I'll do it for a caravan.

481
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,220
A what?

482
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,580
A caravan.

483
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,620
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

484
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

485
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,580
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

486
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,860
Your what?

487
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,660
His ma.

488
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,620
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

489
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,220
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

490
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,260
<i>Now I'm changing fighters...</i>

491
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,340
<i>... and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

492
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,100
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...</i>

493
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,540
<i>... and aim for penetration.</i>

494
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,860
<i>If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...</i>

495
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,780
<i>... he'd want to split me in half.</i>

496
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,620
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

497
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,500
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

498
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,980
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

499
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,380
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

500
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,380
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

501
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,820
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,660
You're gonna have to repeat that.

503
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,380
We've lost Gorgeous George.

504
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,460
Well, where'd you lose him?

505
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,140
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

506
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,900
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

507
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,060
We're not backing out.

508
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,100
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

509
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,180
We're changing the fighter.

510
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,340
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

511
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,700
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

512
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,140
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

513
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
Mustard?

514
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,220
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

515
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,780
...you can't change fighters.

516
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,100
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

517
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,420
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

518
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,300
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

519
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,380
You can take bets at the fight.

520
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,940
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

521
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,860
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

522
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,420
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

523
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,020
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

524
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,260
<i>This is the one place
I didn't want to be:</i>

525
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,780
<i>In his debt.</i>

526
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,420
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

527
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,700
You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.

528
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,140
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

529
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,020
Now, fuck off.

530
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,620
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

531
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,900
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

532
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,660
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

533
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,220
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

534
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,500
A fight?

535
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,020
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

536
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,460
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

537
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,100
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

538
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,020
And this schmuck is gambling?

539
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,660
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

540
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,420
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

541
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,700
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

542
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,420
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

543
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,940
I have no idea.

544
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,220
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

545
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,020
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

546
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,100
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

547
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,740
I'm sure he can pay.

548
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,540
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

549
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,460
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

550
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,940
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

551
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,100
I don't like leaving my own country...

552
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,300
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

553
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,500
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

554
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,420
We've got sandy beaches.

555
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,420
So who the fuck wants to see them?

556
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,380
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

557
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,900
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

558
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,420
And we'll start at that fight.

559
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
How am I gonna get it out?

560
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,740
It will probably cough it up.

561
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,260
Will he be all right?

562
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,660
I hope not.

563
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,900
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

564
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,180
Why are we waiting?

565
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,980
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

566
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,980
And why's that?

567
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,900
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

568
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,540
What's in the case?

569
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:13,340
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

570
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,500
Jesus.

571
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,860
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.

572
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,500
That's why we're here.

573
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,620
Well done. This is the back way in.

574
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,340
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

575
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,020
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.

576
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,380
Tickets.

577
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,900
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

578
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,900
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

579
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,860
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

580
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,860
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

581
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,820
I'm looking for Franky.

582
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,460
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

583
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,300
- Lf there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.

584
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,860
You won't let us down.

585
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,300
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

586
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,420
Is that him?

587
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,740
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

588
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,940
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

589
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,300
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

590
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,020
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

591
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,620
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything...

592
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,860
What are you doing?

593
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,860
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

594
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,260
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

595
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,140
Drop the screen now.

596
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,780
How you doing, Vince?

597
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,300
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

598
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,820
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

599
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,340
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

600
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,700
Appreciated...

601
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,220
...but all bets...

602
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,580
...are...

603
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,940
...off.

604
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,540
If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?

605
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,860
I ain't fucking buying that.

606
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,140
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

607
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,180
What have you got?

608
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,380
Nothing, really.

609
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,820
A few coins, but no notes.

610
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,500
Show me your hands.

611
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,180
You've got five fingers.

612
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,620
Copper coins.

613
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,060
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

614
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,660
It won't open
because it's a security door.

615
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,460
Hold that.

616
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,500
My leg.

617
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,700
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

618
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,220
We're fucked.

619
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,220
What the fuck are you two doing?

620
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,540
Get us out of here.

621
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,820
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

622
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,820
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

623
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,220
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

624
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,340
In the red corner...

625
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,940
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

626
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,300
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

627
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,500
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

628
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,020
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

629
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,340
...one-punch machine gun...

630
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,820
...Mickey!

631
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,340
And in the other corner...

632
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,620
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker...

633
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,620
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

634
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:39,980
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

635
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Now, try and look like a fighter.

636
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,700
Let's get ready...

637
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,420
...to rumble!

638
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,660
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

639
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,020
What's the fucking crack?

640
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,860
- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't happy.

641
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,340
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

642
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,980
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

643
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,260
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

644
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,460
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

645
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,060
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

646
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:49,580
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

647
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,340
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

648
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,460
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

649
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,980
So why didn't you chop it off?

650
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,380
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

651
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,860
But he has the case.

652
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,420
Look, we...
Well, you have a problem.

653
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,660
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

654
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,060
Okay.

655
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,860
Here is the 10 grand.

656
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,020
No. Keep it. We want this.

657
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,940
Well, at least half of this.

658
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,620
What was in the case was mine.

659
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,060
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

660
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,980
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

661
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,860
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

662
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,500
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

663
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:06,100
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

664
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,660
Watch out!

665
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,660
Drop the gun, fat boy.

666
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,260
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

667
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,900
Give me the stone.

668
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,700
- It's in the case.
- What?

669
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,820
It's in the case.

670
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,740
You put the stone in the case?

671
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,420
Open it and give me the stone.

672
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,900
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

673
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,580
<i>Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

674
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,580
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

675
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,820
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

676
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,980
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

677
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,860
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

678
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,780
<i>Once I have that, it's...</i>

679
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,460
Oink, oink.

680
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,300
Shit.

681
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,220
So that's where you keep the sugar.

682
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,820
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

683
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,660
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

684
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,780
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

685
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,740
No, we don't, John.

686
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,220
I just had them polished.

687
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,580
Go and put the kettle on.

688
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,260
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

689
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,700
I'm sweet enough.

690
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,780
He's now your problem.

691
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,660
Okay?

692
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,740
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

693
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,460
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

694
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,940
Well, look at him.

695
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,420
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

696
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,260
I want to use the pikey.

697
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,620
All right. Of course.

698
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,020
Of course, fucking of course.

699
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,380
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

700
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,220
But this time...

701
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,780
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

702
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:29,380
And I do mean it, this time.

703
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,620
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

704
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,460
So now you can open it.

705
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,940
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

706
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,900
I think he's got away with enough.

707
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,020
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

708
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,060
That takes care of one little piggy.

709
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,060
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

710
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,940
Find them today.

711
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,660
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

712
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,940
Tommy.

713
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,300
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

714
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,700
You're looking for my boy, are you?

715
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,260
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

716
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,380
Would you like
to share that information?

717
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,900
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

718
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,740
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

719
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,580
He's coursing.

720
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,060
What's coursing?

721
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,780
Hare coursing.

722
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,380
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

723
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,540
On a hare.

724
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,700
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

725
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,940
So, what if it doesn't?

726
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,980
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

727
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,940
Proper fucked?

728
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,620
Yeah, Tommy.

729
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,460
Before "zee" Germans get there.

730
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,220
Do you know these tits, Errol?

731
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,620
I know a lot of tits...

732
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,500
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

733
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,700
John?

734
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,740
I can't help, guv.

735
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,180
Tyrone.

736
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,340
You silly, fat bastard.

737
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,300
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

738
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,460
On what?

739
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,460
On you buying this caravan.

740
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,260
Not the rouge one. The rose.

741
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,620
- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.

742
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,740
It's twice the size of the last one.

743
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,820
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

744
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,900
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

745
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,100
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

746
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,820
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

747
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,060
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

748
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,900
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

749
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,540
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

750
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,060
Have I made myself clear?

751
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,940
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

752
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,740
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

753
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,340
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

754
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,220
I'll tell you what.

755
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,860
Fucker.

756
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,860
I'll bet you for it.

757
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,060
You'll what?

758
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,820
He'll bet you for it.

759
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,900
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

760
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,540
I'll do you a favour.

761
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,340
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

762
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,060
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

763
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,780
If I lose...

764
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,780
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

765
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,900
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

766
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,580
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

767
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,900
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...</i>

768
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,460
<i>Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

769
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,180
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

770
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,780
What? Proper fucked?

771
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,100
You got that, London?

772
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,780
We're on!

773
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,700
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

774
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,060
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

775
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,980
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

776
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,180
Who's proper fucked now, then?

777
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,420
There's something very wrong
with this.

778
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,300
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

779
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:29,180
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

780
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,460
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

781
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,100
What? You saying I can't shoot?

782
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,820
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

783
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,820
I know you can't shoot.

784
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,220
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

785
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,300
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

786
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,020
You saying the gun don't work?

787
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,980
You tried it?

788
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,020
Whoops.

789
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,060
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

790
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,700
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

791
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,740
To keep his head warm.

792
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,340
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

793
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,940
I thought that was obvious.

794
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,420
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

795
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,020
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

796
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,980
- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...

797
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,940
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

798
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:26,300
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

799
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,060
We're in, governor.

800
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,340
Goody gumdrops.

801
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:40,260
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

802
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,540
Grab hold of his legs.

803
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,020
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

804
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,580
Hope this is not a bad moment.

805
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,540
Do you know who I am?

806
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,220
I do.

807
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,940
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

808
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,020
Well, I don't.

809
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,420
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

810
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,620
Apparently, the best thing to do...

811
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,940
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

812
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,660
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

813
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,700
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

814
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,740
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

815
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,740
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

816
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,780
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

817
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:05,580
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

818
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,940
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

819
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,940
...for the piggies' digestion.

820
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,100
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

821
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,420
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

822
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,580
They will go through bone like butter.

823
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,500
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

824
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,540
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

825
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,900
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

826
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,940
...in about eight minutes.

827
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,740
That means that a single pig...

828
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,540
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

829
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,020
...every minute.

830
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,140
Hence the expression...

831
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:49,020
..."as greedy as a pig".

832
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:55,340
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

833
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,620
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

834
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,100
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

835
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,020
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

836
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,100
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

837
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:19,220
...manifested by an
appropriate agent."

838
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:24,460
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

839
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,540
Me.

840
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,340
Gentlemen...

841
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,060
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

842
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:13,060
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

843
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,380
What about Tony?

844
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,780
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

845
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,820
Who's Bullet-Tooth...

846
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,980
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

847
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,220
He's a liability.

848
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,540
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.

849
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,140
You are gonna die, Tony!

850
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,060
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

851
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,020
I shoot you, you go down!

852
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,700
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

853
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,740
Why don't you fucking die?

854
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,980
- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?

855
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,860
In one sitting.

856
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,220
You're in trouble now.

857
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,940
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

858
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,140
<i>Bonjour.</i>

859
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,180
What's so fucking important?

860
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,500
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

861
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,420
...missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

862
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,420
You give us four days...

863
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,140
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

864
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,580
What do you think, Errol?

865
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,860
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

866
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,260
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

867
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,340
What have I told you about thinking?

868
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,660
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

869
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,060
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

870
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,500
Forty-eight hours.

871
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,140
After that it's your family...

872
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,540
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

873
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,180
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

874
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,980
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

875
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,500
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

876
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,260
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

877
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,780
Forty thousand.

878
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,500
Where was he last seen?

879
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,900
At a bookies.

880
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,900
Bookies?

881
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,900
Pass us the blower, Susi.

882
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,260
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

883
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,060
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

884
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,580
Blagged, robbed.

885
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,060
We'll see a man
that may know something.

886
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,020
I need a gun.

887
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,660
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

888
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,900
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

889
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,140
He's stained for fucking life.

890
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,940
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell...

891
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,940
All right, Mullet?

892
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,460
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

893
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,980
Nice tie.

894
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,780
I heard you weren't about that much.

895
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,580
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

896
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,940
Unlike yours, Mullet.

897
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,740
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

898
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,060
- Do me a favour, Tone.
- I will do you a favour, Mullet.

899
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,540
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

900
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:10,660
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

901
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,940
Comfortable, Mullet?

902
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,980
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

903
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,100
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

904
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,100
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

905
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,380
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

906
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,780
- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.

907
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,860
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

908
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,340
Slow down, Tone.

909
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,540
Slow down, Tony!

910
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,420
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

911
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,060
Play some music if you like.

912
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,740
I love this track.

913
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,780
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

914
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,180
Yes, Mullet?

915
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,580
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.

916
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,500
Better not be telling me porky pies.

917
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:04,140
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

918
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,460
It's very effective, Tony.

919
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,100
It's not too subtle, but effective.

920
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,060
Are we taking him with us?

921
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,380
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

922
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,580
A Russian?

923
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,380
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

924
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:31,580
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

925
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,380
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

926
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,180
Boris.

927
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,940
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

928
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,380
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

929
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,380
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

930
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,380
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

931
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,540
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...</i>

932
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,420
<i>... and you nicked all our savings.</i>

933
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:58,340
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

934
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,300
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

935
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,780
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?</i>

936
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,100
I can't make him do it, can I?

937
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,820
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

938
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:20,060
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

939
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,900
I want that pikey to fight.

940
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,060
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...</i>

941
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,100
<i>... might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

942
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,380
<i>And if that wasn't enough...</i>

943
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,180
<i>... he thought it would be
a good idea...</i>

944
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,180
<i>... to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.</i>

945
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,260
<i>While she was asleep in it.</i>

946
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,100
Turkish, get your arse up.

947
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,620
You lot...

948
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,020
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

949
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,060
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

950
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:13,420
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

951
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,140
What?

952
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:19,140
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

953
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,940
Jesus.

954
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:39,660
Sorry, Mickey.

955
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,660
Did you do it?

956
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,460
Then what are you sorry for?

957
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,060
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

958
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,700
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

959
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,700
Fuck off!

960
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,260
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

961
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,020
<i>His mum is still smoking
next to us...</i>

962
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,300
<i>... and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

963
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,420
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

964
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,420
<i>And if he'd said no...</i>

965
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,420
<i>... it could've been
a shite sight worse.</i>

966
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,620
Russians.

967
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,740
Russians.

968
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,340
I should've known.

969
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,340
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

970
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,900
What do you know about this goyim?

971
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,140
Ex-KGB cancer.

972
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,500
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

973
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,660
He'll be impossible to track down.

974
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,860
Yeah.

975
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,580
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.</i>

976
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,260
<i>- Where's he from?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

977
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,220
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

978
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,460
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

979
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,060
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

980
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,940
First things first. One of us...

981
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:26,140
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

982
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,940
Now.

983
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,220
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

984
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,460
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

985
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,980
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

986
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,460
Not a problem.

987
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,340
Get me to a doctor.

988
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,300
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

989
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,340
Okay, but first we get the stone.

990
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,620
First the stone. Then a doctor.

991
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,620
And not just any doctor, "boychik".
A nice Jewish doctor.

992
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,340
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

993
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,380
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

994
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:10,820
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

995
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,220
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

996
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,740
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

997
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:19,420
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

998
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,020
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

999
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,420
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

1000
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,380
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

1001
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,580
<i>- We're coming over. Hold him there.
- Hold on!</i>

1002
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,300
He's not on his own!

1003
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,500
We're off.

1004
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:53,300
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1005
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,940
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1006
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,980
So, where is he?

1007
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,740
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1008
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,340
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

1009
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,540
Did they look hard?

1010
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,900
They looked messy.

1011
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,900
- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?

1012
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,180
I want you to bury him.

1013
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,860
All right.

1014
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,180
I think we should get you a new gun.

1015
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,260
But this time, try it.

1016
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,340
How far to the Russian's?

1017
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,540
Be there in a minute.

1018
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,180
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1019
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:45,700
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1020
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,220
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1021
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,940
Why? What's wrong with it?

1022
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,980
- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.

1023
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,540
How do we get rid of him?

1024
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,100
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.

1025
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,100
- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.

1026
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,740
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1027
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,300
That's the spirit.

1028
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,980
Do they fire?

1029
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,340
Of course they fire.

1030
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,620
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1031
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,220
What do you know about replicas?

1032
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,820
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1033
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,140
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1034
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:26,020
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1035
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,660
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1036
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,420
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1037
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,900
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1038
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,500
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1039
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,660
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1040
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,620
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1041
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,180
Let me do you a favour.

1042
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,580
Whoops.

1043
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,180
You. Want a knife?

1044
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,460
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1045
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,780
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1046
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,260
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1047
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:07,100
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1048
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,580
Is that Boris?

1049
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,980
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1050
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,540
What about Rosebud?

1051
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,580
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1052
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,700
But which bit would you like?

1053
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:02,380
They're getting out.

1054
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,700
Get down and follow them.

1055
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,820
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1056
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,380
You're making a scene.

1057
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,460
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1058
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,460
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1059
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,540
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1060
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,220
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1061
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,180
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1062
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,900
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1063
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,460
Should we go in?

1064
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,060
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1065
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,180
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1066
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,780
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1067
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,740
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1068
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,860
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1069
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,660
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1070
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,420
Well, come on, then
before "zee" Germans get here.

1071
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,260
You just tell him who's in charge.

1072
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,180
Boris...

1073
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,460
You certainly told him.

1074
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,100
The Drowning Trout.

1075
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,980
Come and pick us up.

1076
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,100
And Doug...

1077
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:34,300
...sharpish.

1078
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,020
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1079
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,140
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1080
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,100
What's your name?

1081
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,580
Shoot him.

1082
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:16,140
Let go of the gun!

1083
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,140
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1084
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,860
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1085
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,540
There are two types of balls:

1086
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,540
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1087
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,500
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1088
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:40,820
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1089
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,780
...but they're not clever.

1090
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,660
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1091
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,060
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1092
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,380
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1093
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:58,420
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1094
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,860
There's no pussy here...

1095
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,860
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1096
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,460
Like a prick...

1097
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,940
...you're having second thoughts.

1098
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,540
You're shrinking.

1099
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,220
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1100
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:21,460
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1101
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:30,500
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...

1102
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,820
...written on the side of mine...

1103
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,620
...should precipitate...

1104
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,020
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1105
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,220
Now...

1106
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,220
...fuck off.

1107
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,020
Lock the door.

1108
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,940
Lock it!

1109
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,900
Give me the case.

1110
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:19,340
Fuck you.

1111
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,660
Shoot me.

1112
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,340
I will. I'll shoot you.

1113
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:36,140
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1114
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,860
You know what?

1115
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,340
Fuck you too.

1116
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,820
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.

1117
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:46,100
You! Drop guns.

1118
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,340
Fuck you!

1119
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:50,340
You drop your gun!

1120
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,460
Okay.

1121
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,820
Avi...

1122
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,500
...pull your socks up!

1123
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,060
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1124
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,260
Give me case.

1125
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,820
Avi...

1126
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,660
...where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1127
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,220
What's Boris doing here?

1128
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,340
Boris, what are you doing here?

1129
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,940
Fuck you!

1130
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,220
Where's the case?

1131
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,940
- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1132
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:55,740
I'll show you.

1133
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,660
Fuck you!

1134
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,020
Almost had it.

1135
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,460
For fuck's sake.

1136
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,380
Fuck you and all.

1137
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,580
You lucky bastard.

1138
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,420
Jeez, it's flawless.

1139
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,420
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1140
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,900
Leave the dog here.

1141
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,580
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent...

1142
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,580
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1143
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,060
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1144
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,060
Don't worry about it!

1145
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:47,420
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1146
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:49,220
It's okay.

1147
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:52,620
Sit down. Down.

1148
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,780
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1149
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,660
Well, we won't if you don't.

1150
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,940
All right, you give me the stone...

1151
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,940
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1152
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:13,540
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1153
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,660
Why is it down there?

1154
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,740
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1155
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,900
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1156
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,740
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1157
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:32,020
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1158
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,980
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle.50.

1159
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,540
What have they got to do
with anything?

1160
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:43,340
They're both staring straight at me.

1161
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,060
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1162
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,580
Now, out of the car.

1163
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,420
And leave your water pistols behind.

1164
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:57,220
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1165
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:00,420
I'll think of something.

1166
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,900
Why's he sweating?

1167
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,740
Oh, never mind.

1168
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,380
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1169
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:15,180
- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?

1170
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:18,980
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1171
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,060
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1172
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:25,820
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1173
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:31,220
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1174
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,380
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1175
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,700
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1176
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:42,940
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1177
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,860
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1178
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,420
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1179
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,580
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1180
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,340
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1181
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,820
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1182
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:03,620
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1183
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,820
So why are you so calm?

1184
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,660
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1185
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,500
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1186
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,700
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1187
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:21,100
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1188
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:25,300
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1189
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:04,820
Oh, that fucking dog!

1190
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:07,180
Go on, get the dog.

1191
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,020
- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.

1192
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,820
You people live like animals.

1193
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,700
Now, where's the stone?

1194
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,020
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1195
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,700
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1196
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,220
It's empty.

1197
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:38,100
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1198
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,340
No, I'm being serious!

1199
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:44,420
The dog. The dog must have had it.

1200
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:50,900
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1201
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:55,100
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1202
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:59,260
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.

1203
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:05,140
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1204
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:08,780
You know what I mean.

1205
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,220
That's a bit strong.

1206
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,140
I don't know about this.

1207
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,260
No, you can't do this.

1208
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,700
It's fucking squeaking!

1209
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:26,340
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1210
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:30,460
I'm shooting the dog!

1211
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,940
Shoot the fucking dog!

1212
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:52,940
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1213
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,420
Thank God for that.

1214
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:18,660
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1215
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:23,100
Tony, come on!

1216
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,300
Tony?

1217
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,660
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1218
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:51,500
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1219
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,740
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?

1220
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,140
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1221
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,180
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1222
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,260
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1223
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,700
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1224
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:11,300
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1225
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,660
Mickey.

1226
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,740
Mickey!

1227
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:23,060
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1228
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,900
Need a drink.

1229
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,420
You can't give him a drink!

1230
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:33,020
It's not for him. It's for me.

1231
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:40,380
Ah, mates. Amen.

1232
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:50,580
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1233
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,620
All right, Mickey?

1234
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,620
Mickey!

1235
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,020
Need to have a shite!

1236
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,820
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1237
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,540
...shoot the bastards.

1238
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:14,140
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1239
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,460
All right, Tom.

1240
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:25,660
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1241
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,100
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1242
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,780
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1243
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,620
Now, you have to forgive me.

1244
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,820
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1245
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:42,780
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1246
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:48,100
I fucking hate pikeys.

1247
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:53,220
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1248
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,220
Fucking hate pikeys.

1249
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,580
Is he fucking stoned?

1250
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,780
He's like that before a fight.

1251
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,260
Do you know when you're going down?

1252
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,940
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1253
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:10,300
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1254
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:13,020
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1255
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,540
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1256
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,940
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1257
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,940
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1258
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,620
And there none a yours.

1259
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:28,580
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1260
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:33,460
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1261
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,740
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1262
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:45,860
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1263
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,740
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1264
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:39,540
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1265
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:12,420
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1266
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,340
Talk about saved by the bell.

1267
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:57,060
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1268
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,940
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1269
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,940
All right, let's break it up.

1270
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,620
What, is he fucking deaf?

1271
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,020
What is he doing?

1272
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,460
Come on and sit.

1273
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,580
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1274
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:07,860
You're dancing like a fairy.

1275
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,140
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1276
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:14,540
Get out there and hurt him.

1277
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:20,940
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1278
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:40,740
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1279
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:47,220
<i>Now, we are fucked.</i>

1280
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,620
He can't stand up.

1281
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:55,620
We're out of here.

1282
01:29:55,860 --> 01:30:00,740
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...</i>

1283
01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:03,420
<i>... sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1284
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:09,820
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1285
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,660
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1286
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,340
Give me that fucking shooter!

1287
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,140
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1288
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,820
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1289
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:21,180
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1290
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:24,180
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...</i>

1291
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,860
<i>... because you're too scared
to think.</i>

1292
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,060
<i>You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.</i>

1293
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,420
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1294
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:36,820
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1295
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,700
<i>It had previously occurred to me...</i>

1296
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:44,540
<i>... that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1297
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,780
<i>For every action,
there is a reaction.</i>

1298
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,260
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1299
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,260
<i>... is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1300
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,060
Pete, talk to me.

1301
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:40,220
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1302
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:52,260
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1303
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:02,740
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1304
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:07,820
<i>That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1305
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:11,220
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1306
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:14,340
<i>... while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1307
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,900
<i>We're worse off now than
when we started.</i>

1308
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:25,060
<i>The next day we went
to the campsite...</i>

1309
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:28,300
<i>... but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1310
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,460
<i>Which was probably a good thing...</i>

1311
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,980
<i>... considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1312
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,540
Where is he?

1313
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,340
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1314
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,940
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1315
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:47,780
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1316
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:52,980
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1317
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:56,220
Bollocks! Come on.

1318
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:03,980
- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?

1319
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:09,780
So, what you doing here?

1320
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,860
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1321
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,300
What's in the car?

1322
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,860
Seats and a steering wheel.

1323
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:27,300
What do you know about gypsies?

1324
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:30,900
I know they're not to be trusted.

1325
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:34,580
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1326
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:37,740
Get the dog, Tommy.

1327
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:40,740
The dog.

1328
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,540
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1329
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,500
He loves that dog.

1330
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,380
Always playing silly games.

1331
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:54,340
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1332
01:33:54,660 --> 01:34:00,700
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1333
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,060
Could you tell me...

1334
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,740
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1335
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,060
Hey, George...

1336
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,860
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1337
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:26,460
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1338
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,940
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1339
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,660
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1340
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:43,300
<i>I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.</i>

1341
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:46,740
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...</i>

1342
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:50,500
<i>... and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1343
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:53,300
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1344
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:56,060
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1345
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,100
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1346
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,100
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1347
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,300
So, what do you think?

1348
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:08,100
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1349
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,620
I might.
