1
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,517
Give me your hand!

2
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,357
Give me your hand.

3
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:22,515
- I thought you said no more aches or pains.
- It's this darned corset. It binds.

4
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,102
No three-way stretch? How very un-chic.

5
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:30,481
You know the police department doctors.
No sense of style.

6
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,818
Anyway, tomorrow will be the day.

7
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,611
What's tomorrow?

8
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,239
The corset comes off tomorrow.

9
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:41,368
I'll be able to scratch myself tomorrow.

10
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:46,289
I'll throw this miserable thing
out the window. I'll be a free man.

11
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:50,251
Midge, do you suppose
many men wear corsets?

12
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,587
- More than you think.
- Really?

13
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,549
Do you know that
from personal experience or...

14
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:56,967
Please.

15
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:01,094
- What happens after tomorrow?
- What do you mean?

16
00:06:01,304 --> 00:06:05,141
What are you going to do
once you've quit the police force?

17
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:09,728
- You sound so disapproving, Midge.
- No. It's your life.

18
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,230
You were the bright, young lawyer
who decided...

19
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:15,024
...he was going to be
chief of police someday.

20
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:17,485
- I had to quit.
- Why?

21
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,447
Because of this fear of heights I have,
this acrophobia.

22
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:24,326
I wake up at night seeing that man fall
from the roof...

23
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,870
...and I try to reach out to him and...

24
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,666
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's what everybody tells me.

25
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,795
- Johnny, the doctors explained to you-
- I know, I know.

26
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,841
I have acrophobia,
which gives me vertigo, and I get dizzy.

27
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:42,261
What a moment to find out I had it.

28
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:46,891
You've got it, and there's no losing it.
And there's no one to blame. So why quit?

29
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,685
You mean, and sit behind a desk,
chair-borne?

30
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,729
- Where you belong.
- What about my acrophobia?

31
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:57,107
Suppose I'm sitting in this chair,
behind a desk.

32
00:06:57,357 --> 00:06:59,818
A pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor...

33
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:03,280
...and I reach down to pick it up,
bingo, my acrophobia's back.

34
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:07,869
What'll you do?

35
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:11,121
I'm not gonna do anything for a while.

36
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:15,335
Don't forget, I'm a man
of independent means, as the saying goes.

37
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,878
Fairly independent.

38
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:20,381
Why don't you go away for a while?

39
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,010
You mean, to forget?
Midge, don't be so motherly.

40
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:27,347
I'm not gonna crack up.

41
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:31,309
- Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
- I'm having one right now.

42
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,479
Midge, the music.
Don't you think it's sort of...

43
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,776
What's this doohickey?

44
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,654
It's a brassiere.

45
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,825
You know about those things.
You're a big boy now.

46
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,159
I've never run across one like that.

47
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,204
It's brand-new. Revolutionary uplift.

48
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:58,627
No shoulder straps, no back straps,
but does everything a brassiere should do.

49
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:01,505
Works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge.

50
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,048
It does?

51
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:06,426
An aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it.

52
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,012
He worked it out in his spare time.

53
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,721
Kind of a hobby.

54
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:14,935
A do-it-yourself type of thing.

55
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,063
How's your love life, Midge?

56
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:22,401
That's following a train of thought.

57
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:23,652
Well?

58
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,988
Normal.

59
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,530
Aren't you ever gonna get married?

60
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:31,617
You know there's only one man
in the world for me, Johnny-O.

61
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:34,912
You mean me.
We were engaged once, weren't we?

62
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,499
- Three whole weeks.
- Good old college days.

63
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:44,420
But you were the one that called off
the engagement, you remember?

64
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:47,506
I'm still available. Available Ferguson.

65
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,345
Midge, do you remember a fellow
in college by the name of Gavin Elster?

66
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:55,141
- Gavin Elster?
- Yes, funny name.

67
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,516
You'd think I would? No.

68
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,189
I got a call from Gavin today.
He dropped out of sight during the war.

69
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:06,108
Somebody said he went East.
I guess he's back.

70
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:09,655
- It's a Mission number.
- That's Skid Row, isn't it?

71
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,324
Could be.

72
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,241
He's probably on the bum and wants
to touch you for the price of a drink.

73
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:19,539
Well, I'm on the bum. I'll buy him
a couple drinks and tell him my troubles.

74
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,832
Not tonight. How about you and me
going out for a beer?

75
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,626
Sorry, old man. Work.

76
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,797
Then, I think I'll go home.

77
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,385
Midge, what'd you mean,
there's no losing it?

78
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:34,888
What?

79
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,515
The acrophobia.

80
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,933
I asked my doctor.

81
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,563
He said that only another emotional shock
could do it and probably wouldn't.

82
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:47,607
You're not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out?

83
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,028
- I think I can lick it.
- How?

84
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:51,779
I have a theory.

85
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,326
I think if I can get used to heights
just a little bit at a time...

86
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,121
...just a little, like that,
progressively, you see?

87
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,623
I'll show you what I mean. Here.

88
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,749
I'll show you what I mean.

89
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,961
- We'll start with this.
- That?

90
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:12,048
What do you want me to start with,
the Golden Gate Bridge?

91
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:14,051
Watch this. Here we go.

92
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:16,470
There.

93
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:21,807
Now, I look up, I look down.

94
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:27,273
- You're kidding. Wait a minute.
- There's nothing to it.

95
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,442
- Here.
- That's a girl.

96
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,653
I'll use that. Put it right there.

97
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:38,325
All right, here's the first step.

98
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,705
Okay, now step number two.

99
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,666
Step number two coming up.

100
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:50,420
There we are.

101
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,715
See? I look up, I look down, I look up...

102
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,883
I'm going right out to buy myself
a nice tall stepladder.

103
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:59,970
- Take it easy now.
- All right, now here we go.

104
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:01,973
No problem.

105
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:11,230
Why, this is a cinch.
I look up, I look down.

106
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,109
I look up, I look down.

107
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:46,056
How did you get in
the shipbuilding business, Gavin?

108
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,392
I married into it.

109
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,103
Very interesting business.

110
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:54,565
To be honest, I find it dull.

111
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,944
You don't have to do it for a living.

112
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:59,613
No, but one assumes responsibilities.

113
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,241
My wife's family is all gone.

114
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:05,035
Someone has to look after her interests.

115
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:08,914
Her father's partner runs the company yard
in the East. Baltimore.

116
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,044
So I decided, as long as I had to work at it,
I'd come back here.

117
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,507
- I've always liked it here.
- How long have you been back?

118
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:20,092
Almost a year.

119
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:21,468
You like it?

120
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,928
San Francisco's changed.

121
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:28,808
The things that spell San Francisco
to me are disappearing fast.

122
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:33,477
Like all these.

123
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:36,064
I should have liked to have lived here then.

124
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,775
Color, excitement, power.

125
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,444
Freedom.

126
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,198
Shouldn't you be sitting down?

127
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:45,948
No, I'm all right.

128
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:51,496
I was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper. And you've quit the force.

129
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:55,376
- Is it a permanent physical disability?
- No, no.

130
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,006
It just means I can't climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places...

131
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,549
...like the bar at the Top of the Mark.

132
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:05,343
There are plenty of street-level bars
in this town.

133
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,304
Would you like a drink now?

134
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,514
No, I don't think so.

135
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,015
It's a little early in the day for me.

136
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,813
I guess that covers everything, doesn't it?

137
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:21,693
I never married,
I don't see much of the old college gang.

138
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:25,489
I'm a retired detective
and you're in the shipbuilding business.

139
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,284
What's on your mind, Gavin?

140
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:34,245
I asked you to come up here, Scottie,
knowing that you'd quit detective work...

141
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:39,000
...but I wondered whether you'd go back
on the job as a special favor to me.

142
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,379
I want you to follow my wife.

143
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:44,423
No, it's not that.
We're very happily married.

144
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,928
- Well, then...
- I'm afraid some harm may come to her.

145
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,678
- From whom?
- Someone dead.

146
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:58,269
Scottie, do you believe
that someone out of the past...

147
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:03,484
...someone dead, can enter
and take possession of a living being?

148
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,902
No.

149
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:10,407
If I told you I believe this has happened
to my wife, what would you say?

150
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:14,869
I'd say take her to the nearest psychiatrist
or psychologist...

151
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:19,041
...or neurologist or...
Or maybe just the plain family doctor.

152
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,750
I'd have him check on you, too.

153
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,215
Then you're of no use to me.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

154
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:28,926
Thanks for coming in, Scottie.

155
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,469
Okay.

156
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,682
I didn't mean to be that rough.

157
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:37,393
No, it sounds idiotic, I know.

158
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,937
And you're still the hardheaded Scot,
aren't you?

159
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:44,232
Always were.
Do you think I'm making it up?

160
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,401
No.

161
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:50,027
I'm not making it up.
I wouldn't know how.

162
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,032
She'll be talking to me about something.

163
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,701
Suddenly the words fade into silence.

164
00:14:57,704 --> 00:15:00,665
A cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank.

165
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,795
She's somewhere else, away from me,
someone I don't know.

166
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:09,215
I call to her, she doesn't even hear me.

167
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:12,508
Then, with a long sigh, she's back.

168
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:16,723
Looks at me brightly.
Doesn't even know she's been away.

169
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:18,931
Can't tell me where or when.

170
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:23,146
How often does this happen?

171
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:25,440
More and more in the past few weeks.

172
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,526
And she wanders.
God knows where she wanders.

173
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:32,152
I followed her one day...

174
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:35,991
...watched her coming out
of the apartment, someone I didn't know.

175
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:38,867
She even walked a different way.

176
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:41,454
Got into her car and...

177
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:44,873
...drove out to Golden Gate Park,
five miles.

178
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,834
Sat by the lake...

179
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:51,421
...staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore.

180
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,842
You know, Portals of the Past.

181
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,929
Sat there a long time without moving.

182
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,890
I had to leave, get back to the office.

183
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,602
When I got home that evening,
I asked her what she'd done all day.

184
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,813
She said she'd driven
to Golden Gate Park...

185
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,021
...and sat by the lake, that's all.

186
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,108
Well?

187
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,863
The speedometer on her car showed
that she'd driven 94 miles.

188
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,241
Where did she go?

189
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,535
I've got to know where she goes
and what she does...

190
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,371
...before I get involved with doctors.

191
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:28,083
- Have you discussed this with the doctors?
- Yes, but carefully.

192
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:32,380
I want to know more
before committing her to that kind of care.

193
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,881
I'll get you a firm of private eyes
to follow her for you.

194
00:16:36,006 --> 00:16:38,843
- They're dependable, good boys.
- I want you.

195
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:41,347
Look, this isn't my line.

196
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:44,559
Scottie, I need a friend,
someone I can trust.

197
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,684
I'm in a panic about this.

198
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,896
I'm supposed to be retired. I don't want
to get mixed up in this darn thing.

199
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,025
Look, we're going to an opening
at the opera tonight.

200
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,487
We're dining at Ernie's first.
You can see her there.

201
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,198
Ernie's.

202
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,607
Say, will you tell me something?
That lady sitting there.

203
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,152
Who's the woman in the painting?

204
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,865
That's Carlotta. You'll find it
in the catalogue. Portrait of Carlotta.

205
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,031
- May I have this?
- Yes.

206
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:38,774
Yes?

207
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:46,364
Is there something I can do for you?

208
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:48,825
- Yes. You run this hotel?
- Yes.

209
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,037
Would you tell me who has the room
on the second floor...

210
00:29:52,162 --> 00:29:54,081
...in the corner, that corner?

211
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,085
I'm afraid we couldn't give out information
of that sort.

212
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,422
Our clients are entitled to their privacy,
you know.

213
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:04,133
And I do believe it's against the law.

214
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:08,845
Of course, I don't think any of them
would mind really, but still I-

215
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:12,641
Has she done something wrong?

216
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,977
Please answer my question.

217
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:18,479
- I can't imagine that sweet girl-
- What's her name?

218
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:22,777
- Miss Valdés. Spanish, you know.
- Carlotta Valdés?

219
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,568
Yeah, that's it.

220
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:27,153
Sweet name, isn't it? Foreign, but sweet.

221
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,823
How long has she had the room?

222
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:32,116
It must be two weeks.
Her rent's due tomorrow.

223
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,452
Does she sleep here ever?

224
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:37,832
No, she just comes to sit
two or three times a week.

225
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:42,378
I don't ask questions, you know,
as long as they're well-behaved.

226
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:45,671
When she comes down,
don't say I've been here.

227
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,093
But she hasn't been here today.

228
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,635
I just saw her come in five minutes ago.

229
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,555
No, she hasn't been here at all.
I would have seen her.

230
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:59,187
I've been right here all the time,
putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves.

231
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:02,105
And there.

232
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,441
You see? Her key is on the rack.

233
00:31:05,817 --> 00:31:08,863
- Would you please go up and look?
- To her room?

234
00:31:09,153 --> 00:31:11,699
- That's right.
- Yes, of course, if you ask.

235
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:15,744
- But it does seem silly.
- Thank you.

236
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:35,345
Mr. Detective?

237
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,061
Would you like to come and look?

238
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,799
- Her car's gone.
- What car?

239
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:44,415
Midge...

240
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:48,877
...who do you know that's an authority
on San Francisco history?

241
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:51,504
That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.

242
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:53,965
None of this:
"Hello, you look wonderful" stuff.

243
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:56,591
Just, "Do you know an authority
on San Francisco-"

244
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:58,843
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

245
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:01,764
Well, who do you? You know everybody.

246
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,684
Professor Saunders over in Berkeley.

247
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,770
No, I don't mean that kind of history.

248
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:10,773
I mean the small stuff,
people you never heard of.

249
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,571
You mean the gay old bohemian days
of gay old San Francisco.

250
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:20,033
Juicy stories, like who shot who
in the Embarcadero...

251
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:22,702
-... in August, 1879 .
- Yeah, that's right.

252
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,579
- Pop Leibel.
- Who?

253
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,666
Pop Leibel.
He owns the Argosy Book Shop.

254
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,707
What do you want to know?

255
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,838
I want to know who shot who
in the Embarcadero in August, 1879 .

256
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,590
Wait a minute. You're not
a detective anymore. What's going on?

257
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,845
- You know him well?
- Who?

258
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,928
- Pop Leibel.
- Sure.

259
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,849
Come on. I want you to introduce me.

260
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,769
- Get your hat.
- I don't need a hat.

261
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:53,439
Johnny, what's it all about?

262
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,320
Wait a minute.

263
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:08,495
Yes, I remember.

264
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,624
Carlotta.

265
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:13,292
The beautiful Carlotta.

266
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:15,878
The sad Carlotta.

267
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,300
What does an old house
on the corner of Eddy and Gough...

268
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:21,216
...have to do with Carlotta Valdés?

269
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:25,678
It was hers.
It was built for her many years ago.

270
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:27,681
- By whom?
- By...

271
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,064
No. The name I do not remember.

272
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:39,194
A rich man. A powerful man.

273
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,612
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

274
00:34:41,737 --> 00:34:43,656
- Cigarette, miss?
- No, thanks.

275
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,159
It is not an unusual story.

276
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,123
She came from somewhere small,
to the south of the city.

277
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,585
Some say from a mission settlement.

278
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,464
Young, yes. Very young.

279
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:06,011
And she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man...

280
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:08,722
...and he took her...

281
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:13,769
...and built for her the great house
in the Western Addition.

282
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:16,729
And...

283
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,981
...there was a child.

284
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:23,736
Yes, that's it. The child. The child.

285
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:29,450
I cannot tell you
exactly how much time passed...

286
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,287
...or how much happiness there was...

287
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,914
...but then he threw her away.

288
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:39,169
He had no other children.
His wife had no children.

289
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:43,798
So, he kept the child and threw her away.

290
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:48,345
You know, a man could do that
in those days.

291
00:35:48,803 --> 00:35:51,265
They had the power and the freedom.

292
00:35:52,515 --> 00:35:55,268
And she became the sad Carlotta.

293
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:58,771
Alone in the great house...

294
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,398
...walking the streets alone...

295
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:05,987
...her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty.

296
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:11,409
And, the mad Carlotta...

297
00:36:12,994 --> 00:36:15,704
...stopping people in the streets to ask:

298
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:18,458
"Where is my child?

299
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,626
"Have you seen my child?"

300
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,338
- Poor thing.
- And she died.

301
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,800
- She died.
- How?

302
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,677
By her own hand.

303
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:36,224
There are many such stories.

304
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:38,768
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

305
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:41,230
- I appreciate it. Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

306
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,899
Wait a minute! Good-bye, Pop.
Thanks a lot.

307
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:55,160
- Now then, Johnny-O, pay me.
- For what?

308
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:59,247
- For bringing you here. Come on, tell.
- There's nothing to tell.

309
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:03,334
- You'll tell or be back in that corset.
- Come on. I'll take you home.

310
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,430
There we are.

311
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:18,308
- You haven't told me everything.
- I've told you enough.

312
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:21,852
- Who's the guy and who's the wife?
- Out. I've got things to do.

313
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:25,482
I know. The one that phoned.
Your old college chum, Elster.

314
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:26,774
Midge, out, please.

315
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:30,443
The idea is the beautiful, mad Carlotta
has returned from the dead...

316
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:32,862
...and taken possession of Elster's wife.

317
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,824
Johnny, really. Come on.

318
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,119
I'm not telling you what I think,
I'm telling you what he thinks.

319
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:41,789
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

320
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:44,458
- Is she pretty?
- Carlotta?

321
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:47,086
Not Carlotta. Elster's wife.

322
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:53,382
Yes. I guess you'd consider
that she would be-

323
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,720
I think I'll go take a look
at that portrait. Good-bye.

324
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:59,181
- Midge...
- Good-bye!

325
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:32,756
You've done well, Scottie.
You're good at your job.

326
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,756
- That's Carlotta Valdés.
- Yes.

327
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:37,343
There are things you didn't tell me.

328
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:41,181
- I didn't know where she'd lead you.
- But you knew about this.

329
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,227
You notice the way she does her hair?
There's something else.

330
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:51,482
My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta.

331
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,276
She inherited them.

332
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:56,111
Never wore them.
They were too old-fashioned.

333
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:57,571
Until now.

334
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,951
Now when she's alone,
she takes them out and looks at them...

335
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:04,702
...handles them gently, curiously...

336
00:39:06,162 --> 00:39:09,374
...puts them on and stares at herself
in the mirror...

337
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,336
...and then goes into that other world,
is someone else again.

338
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:18,050
Carlotta Valdés was what,
your wife's grandmother?

339
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:20,260
Great-grandmother.

340
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,845
The child who was taken from her...

341
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,517
...whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to
her death, was Madeleine's grandmother.

342
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,646
And the McKittrick Hotel
is the old Valdés home.

343
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:35,316
I think that explains it.

344
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:39,738
Anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that.

345
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:43,032
She never heard of Carlotta Valdés.

346
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:46,537
She knows nothing of a grave out
at the Mission Dolores?

347
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:48,789
Or that old house on Eddy Street?

348
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:52,458
The portrait at
the Palace of the Legion of...

349
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,795
- Nothing.
- When she goes to these places-

350
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,839
She's no longer my wife.

351
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:02,301
How do you know
all these things she doesn't?

352
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:05,596
Her mother told me most of them
before she died.

353
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:07,598
I dug out the rest for myself here.

354
00:40:07,723 --> 00:40:10,935
- Why wouldn't she tell her daughter?
- Natural fear.

355
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,813
Her grandmother went insane,
took her own life.

356
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:17,315
Her blood is in Madeleine.

357
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:25,783
Boy, I need this.

358
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:55,196
Madeleine.

359
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:57,990
Madeleine!

360
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:00,760
Yes?

361
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,806
No, it's all right.

362
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,476
Yeah, I'll call you back.

363
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:09,101
Yes.

364
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:14,983
You all right?

365
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,404
You'll want this.

366
00:45:56,982 --> 00:46:00,444
You'd better come over here
by the fire where it's warm.

367
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,157
What am I doing here?

368
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:10,077
What happened?

369
00:46:11,954 --> 00:46:15,541
Well, you fell into San Francisco Bay.

370
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:21,255
And I tried to dry your hair as best I could.

371
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:25,050
Your things are in the kitchen.
They'll be dry in a few minutes.

372
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:27,429
Come on over by the fire.

373
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:37,771
I'll get you some cushions.

374
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,650
There you are.

375
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:53,204
Would you like to have some coffee?

376
00:46:55,955 --> 00:46:59,375
Here, you'd better have some.
Or perhaps you'd like a drink?

377
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:06,049
I fell into the Bay and you fished me out?

378
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:07,676
That's right.

379
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:11,596
- Thank you.
- You don't remember?

380
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,098
No, I...

381
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,562
Do you remember where you were?

382
00:47:20,897 --> 00:47:23,774
Yes. Of course I remember that.

383
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:29,948
But then I must have had a dizzy spell
and fainted.

384
00:47:30,156 --> 00:47:31,658
Where were you?

385
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:35,870
At Old Fort Point. Out at the Presidio.

386
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,333
Of course I remember. I often go there.

387
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,418
Why? Why do you go there?

388
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:46,296
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there.

389
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,215
Especially at sunset.

390
00:47:51,593 --> 00:47:53,428
Thank you for the fire.

391
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:55,390
Where were you before?

392
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,101
- When?
- This afternoon, I mean.

393
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:01,561
Wandering about.

394
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:04,773
I know, but where?
Where were you just before?

395
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,695
Downtown, shopping.

396
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:14,450
Here, you'd better have some coffee.

397
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:16,535
I think it's still warm.

398
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:21,207
You're terribly direct in your questions.

399
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,834
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

400
00:48:25,294 --> 00:48:27,671
You're not. You're merely direct.

401
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:34,552
And what were you doing there,
at Old Fort Point?

402
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,596
Just wandering about.

403
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,308
- You like it, too?
- Yes.

404
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:43,895
And where had you been just before?

405
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,897
I'd been to the Palace of the Legion
of Honor, the art gallery.

406
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,319
Yes, that's a lovely spot, isn't it?

407
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:55,531
I've never been inside,
but it looks so lovely driving past.

408
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:04,708
It's lucky for me,
you were wandering about.

409
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,375
Thank you.

410
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,420
I've been a terrible bother to you.

411
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,130
No, you haven't.

412
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:14,967
When you...

413
00:49:19,597 --> 00:49:21,474
There were some pins in my hair.

414
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,559
The pins, yes. Right in here.
I'll get 'em for you.

415
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,437
And my purse, please.

416
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:33,736
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

417
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,240
You shouldn't have brought me here.

418
00:49:39,492 --> 00:49:41,492
I didn't know where you lived.

419
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:46,749
You could have looked in my car.
But you didn't know my car, did you?

420
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,834
I knew which one it was.
It's right outside here now.

421
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:53,088
But I didn't think you wanted
to be taken home that way.

422
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:54,631
No, you're right.

423
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:58,176
I'm glad you didn't take me home.
I wouldn't have known you.

424
00:49:58,968 --> 00:50:02,806
Thank you. But I don't know you
and you don't know me.

425
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:06,476
- My name is Madeleine Elster.
- My name's John Ferguson.

426
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:10,438
Good, strong name.
Do your friends call you John or Jack?

427
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:12,773
John, mostly.

428
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:16,235
Old friends call me John.
Acquaintances call me Scottie.

429
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:18,822
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.

430
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:21,241
Gee whiz, I wouldn't like that.

431
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:26,204
After what happened this afternoon,
I should think you'd call me Scottie.

432
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,871
Maybe even John.

433
00:50:28,415 --> 00:50:29,873
I prefer John.

434
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:36,422
There, that's done.
And what do you do, John?

435
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:39,675
I wander about.

436
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,012
That's a good occupation.
And you live here, alone?

437
00:50:45,098 --> 00:50:47,976
- One shouldn't live alone.
- Some people prefer it.

438
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:51,687
No, it's wrong.

439
00:50:55,022 --> 00:50:56,566
I'm married, you know.

440
00:51:00,988 --> 00:51:05,115
Will you tell me something?
Has this ever happened to you before?

441
00:51:06,075 --> 00:51:07,077
What?

442
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:10,122
Falling into San Francisco Bay.

443
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,294
No, it's never happened before.

444
00:51:15,794 --> 00:51:19,631
I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats,
when I was a little girl.

445
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:24,511
I even fell into the river once
trying to leap from one stone to another.

446
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:27,890
But I've never fallen
into San Francisco Bay.

447
00:51:29,182 --> 00:51:30,932
Have you ever before?

448
00:51:31,142 --> 00:51:33,729
No, it's the first time for me, too.

449
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:38,608
I'll get you some more coffee.

450
00:51:53,498 --> 00:51:56,166
- Hello?
- What happened? She's not home yet.

451
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:59,960
She's all right. She's still here.
I'll bring her home soon.

452
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:02,965
- What happened?
- She went into the Bay.

453
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:08,346
- Hello? Hello?
- Did she hurt herself?

454
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:11,139
No, she'll be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

455
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:13,809
But she doesn't know. Do you understand?

456
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:16,311
She doesn't know what happened.

457
00:52:19,565 --> 00:52:21,733
Scottie, Madeleine is 26 .

458
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:26,071
Carlotta Valdés committed suicide
when she was 26 .

459
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:29,741
Just hold on a minute, Gavin.

460
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:02,274
Well now, Johnny-O. Was it a ghost?

461
00:53:03,482 --> 00:53:04,817
Was it fun?

462
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,007
That letter for me?

463
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:43,473
- Yes. Hello.
- Hello.

464
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:48,185
I worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

465
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:50,813
Well, I suddenly felt such a fool.

466
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,232
I wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

467
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:55,902
Yes, I'm fine. No aftereffects.

468
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:00,322
As I remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

469
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:03,576
- It sure was.
- What a terrible thing for me to do.

470
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:05,786
You were so kind.

471
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:10,583
It's a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

472
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,668
- You've nothing to apologize for.
- Yes, I do.

473
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:16,464
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

474
00:56:16,589 --> 00:56:18,507
Not at all. I enjoyed...

475
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:21,885
...talking to you.

476
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,180
I enjoyed talking to you.

477
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:31,977
I'll get my mail.

478
00:56:33,729 --> 00:56:36,941
- Would you like to have a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

479
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:43,573
I couldn't mail it. I didn't know
your address, but I had a landmark.

480
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:46,450
I remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

481
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:49,745
That's the first time
I've been grateful for Coit Tower.

482
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:56,253
- I hope we will too.
- What?

483
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:59,256
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

484
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,050
Good-bye.

485
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,985
Where are you going?

486
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:23,654
I don't know.

487
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:25,239
- Shopping?
- No.

488
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:27,616
Anywhere in particular?

489
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:31,161
I just thought that I'd wander.

490
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:34,456
That's what I was going to do.

491
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:39,753
That's right. I forgot.
It's your occupation, isn't it?

492
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:42,757
Don't you think it's a waste
for the two of us...

493
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,592
To wander separately?

494
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:47,177
But only one is a wanderer.

495
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:49,636
Two together are always
going somewhere.

496
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:52,349
I don't think that's necessarily true.

497
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:56,477
- You left your door open.
- Be right back.

498
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:41,480
How old?

499
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,940
Some 2 ,0 years or more.

500
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:47,110
- The oldest living things.
- Yes.

501
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,905
- You've never been here before?
- No.

502
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,157
What are you thinking?

503
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:56,369
Of all the people who've been born
and have died...

504
00:58:56,494 --> 00:58:58,204
...while the trees went on living.

505
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:02,501
Their true name is Sequoia sempervirens.
"Always green, ever living. "

506
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,128
- I don't like them.
- Why?

507
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,672
Knowing I have to die.

508
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,525
Here's a cross section of one
of the old trees that's been cut down.

509
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,928
Somewhere in here I was born...

510
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,058
...and there I died.

511
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:04,312
It was only a moment for you.

512
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:06,814
You took no notice.

513
01:00:16,365 --> 01:00:17,407
Madeleine.

514
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,623
Madeleine, where are you now?

515
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,625
- Here with you.
- Where?

516
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,839
- The tall trees...
- Have you been here before?

517
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,589
- Yes.
- When?

518
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,386
When were you born?

519
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,846
- Long ago.
- Where?

520
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:25,348
When? Tell me.

521
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,393
- Madeleine, tell me.
- No!

522
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:30,602
- Where do you go? What takes you away?
- I can't tell you.

523
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,649
When you jumped into the Bay,
you didn't know where you were.

524
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:36,902
- I didn't jump. You told me I fell.
- Why did you jump?

525
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:40,739
- I can't tell you.
- What was inside that told you to jump?

526
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,658
- Please.
- What?

527
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,660
Please, don't ask me.

528
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,413
Take me away from here.

529
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,081
Shall I take you home?

530
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,918
Somewhere in the light.

531
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:59,048
Promise you won't ask me again.
Please promise me that.

532
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,376
Why did you run?

533
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:37,877
I'm responsible for you now.

534
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,297
The Chinese say
that once you've saved a person's life...

535
01:02:41,422 --> 01:02:44,634
...you're responsible for it forever,
so I'm committed.

536
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,469
I have to know.

537
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,848
There's so little that I know.

538
01:02:54,185 --> 01:02:58,440
It's as though I were walking
down a long corridor...

539
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,779
...that once was mirrored, and fragments
of that mirror still hang there...

540
01:03:05,196 --> 01:03:08,491
...and when I come to the end
of the corridor...

541
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:10,953
...there's nothing but darkness.

542
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,457
And I know that
when I walk into the darkness...

543
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,420
...that I'll die.

544
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:25,298
I've never come to the end.
I've always come back before then.

545
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:28,553
- Except once.
- Yesterday?

546
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:33,432
And you didn't know what happened
till you found yourself with me.

547
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:35,349
You didn't know where you were.

548
01:03:35,474 --> 01:03:39,187
But the small scenes, the fragments
of the mirror, you remember those.

549
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:41,231
- Vaguely.
- What do you remember?

550
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:43,276
There's a room...

551
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:45,903
...and I sit there alone.

552
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:48,280
- Always alone.
- What else?

553
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:51,200
- A grave.
- Where?

554
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:54,954
I don't know. It's an open grave and...

555
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:59,459
...I stand by the gravestone
looking down into it.

556
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:02,169
- It's my grave.
- How do you know?

557
01:04:02,294 --> 01:04:05,965
- I know.
- But is there a name on the gravestone?

558
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:07,800
No.

559
01:04:08,718 --> 01:04:12,094
No, it's new and clean and waiting.

560
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:15,223
What else?

561
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:18,018
This part is a dream, I think.

562
01:04:19,978 --> 01:04:24,273
There's a tower and a bell,
and a garden below.

563
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,277
It seems to be in Spain...

564
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:29,694
...a village in Spain.

565
01:04:30,529 --> 01:04:32,616
It clicks off and it's gone.

566
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,576
Well, a portrait?

567
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:37,286
- Do you see a portrait?
- No.

568
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:40,415
If I could just find the key, the beginning...

569
01:04:40,748 --> 01:04:42,458
...and put it together, I...

570
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,418
And so explain it away?

571
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:48,422
There is a way to explain it, you see.

572
01:04:49,757 --> 01:04:53,052
If I'm mad, then that would explain it,
wouldn't it?

573
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:56,973
Madeleine!

574
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:02,727
Scottie!

575
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:06,731
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
I don't want to die.

576
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:10,818
There's someone within me,
and she says I must die.

577
01:05:10,943 --> 01:05:12,905
Scottie, don't let me go.

578
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:15,950
I'm here. I've got you.

579
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,327
I'm so afraid.

580
01:05:28,586 --> 01:05:30,046
Don't leave me.

581
01:05:30,756 --> 01:05:32,841
- Stay with me.
- All the time.

582
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,570
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi.

583
01:06:02,947 --> 01:06:05,616
- Did you get my message?
- I did, indeed.

584
01:06:06,742 --> 01:06:08,494
I'll get you a drink.

585
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:09,786
Okay.

586
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,831
Since when do you go around
slipping notes under men's doors?

587
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,793
Since I stopped being able to get them
on the phone.

588
01:06:16,918 --> 01:06:20,588
For a man who has nothing to do,
you're certainly a busy little bee.

589
01:06:20,713 --> 01:06:22,507
Where do you go these days?

590
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,300
Just wandering.

591
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:27,929
- Where?
- Round about.

592
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:36,020
What was this desperate urge to see me?

593
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:39,107
All I said in my note was:
"Where are you?"

594
01:06:39,314 --> 01:06:41,776
Doesn't sound very desperate to me.

595
01:06:42,026 --> 01:06:44,404
I detected a little undercurrent.

596
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:49,491
I just thought that if I gave you a drink
and fed you some dinner...

597
01:06:49,616 --> 01:06:52,120
...you'd be so grateful
you'd take me to a movie.

598
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:55,582
That's fair enough.
What'll we talk about at dinner?

599
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:58,709
This and that.

600
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:01,296
What I've been doing?

601
01:07:01,962 --> 01:07:03,464
If you want to.

602
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:06,341
We won't talk about anything
you don't want to.

603
01:07:06,593 --> 01:07:07,886
Naturally.

604
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,932
What have you been doing?

605
01:07:14,225 --> 01:07:15,350
Wandering.

606
01:07:18,062 --> 01:07:20,813
What have you been doing?
Thank you, dear.

607
01:07:21,273 --> 01:07:23,400
I've been having a wonderful time.

608
01:07:23,565 --> 01:07:27,195
- I've gone back to my first love: painting.
- Good for you.

609
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:30,824
I always said you were wasting your time
in the underwear department.

610
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:34,327
It's a living.
But I'm really excited about this.

611
01:07:34,577 --> 01:07:36,536
What is it? A still life?

612
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,123
No, not exactly.

613
01:07:40,498 --> 01:07:41,835
You want to see?

614
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:45,547
I thought I might give it to you.

615
01:08:00,896 --> 01:08:02,731
It's not funny, Midge.

616
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:07,692
I just thought...

617
01:08:11,656 --> 01:08:14,033
Let's make that movie some other night.

618
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:29,631
Marjorie Wood, you fool!

619
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:32,049
Idiot!

620
01:08:41,018 --> 01:08:42,518
Stupid! Stupid!

621
01:09:22,267 --> 01:09:23,852
Madeleine! What's the matter?

622
01:09:23,977 --> 01:09:27,522
I should have phoned,
but I wanted to see you, be with you.

623
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:30,357
- Why? What's happened?
- I had the dream.

624
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:33,861
- The dream came back again.
- It's gonna be all right.

625
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:37,699
It'll be all right. I'll get you some brandy.

626
01:09:38,325 --> 01:09:39,909
Drink this down.

627
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,285
Just like medicine.

628
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:45,454
There now.

629
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:49,209
It was a dream. You're awake.
You're all right now.

630
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:52,378
Now, can you tell me?

631
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:57,508
It was the tower again,
and the bell and the old Spanish village.

632
01:09:57,633 --> 01:10:00,677
- Yes?
- Clear, so very clear for the first time.

633
01:10:01,053 --> 01:10:02,181
Tell me.

634
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:05,642
It was a village square
and a green with trees...

635
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:08,811
...and an old whitewashed
Spanish church with a cloister.

636
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:12,399
Across the green,
there was a big, gray wooden house...

637
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,485
...with a porch and a balcony
above a small garden...

638
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:19,280
...and next to it a livery stable
with old carriages lined up inside.

639
01:10:19,405 --> 01:10:20,530
Go on.

640
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,994
At the end of the green,
there was a whitewashed stone house...

641
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,245
...with a lovely pepper tree at the corner.

642
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:29,413
And an old wooden hotel
from the old California days?

643
01:10:29,707 --> 01:10:34,043
And a saloon? Dark, low ceilings,
with hanging oil lamps?

644
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:37,257
- Yes.
- It's all there.

645
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:39,757
It's no dream.

646
01:10:42,011 --> 01:10:44,721
You've been there before. You've seen it.

647
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:47,600
No, never.

648
01:10:47,725 --> 01:10:51,520
A hundred miles south of San Francisco,
there's an old Spanish mission...

649
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:54,480
...San Juan Bautista it's called
and it's been preserved...

650
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:57,275
...exactly as it was 100 years ago
as a museum.

651
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,988
Think hard, darling. Think hard.

652
01:11:00,947 --> 01:11:04,574
- You've been there before. You've seen it.
- I've never been there.

653
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:07,118
- What is it? I've never been there.
- Think hard.

654
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:09,831
Go on about your dream.
What frightened you?

655
01:11:10,288 --> 01:11:13,333
I stood alone on the green
searching for something...

656
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:16,920
...and then I started to walk to the church...

657
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:21,966
...but then the darkness closed in
and I was alone in the dark...

658
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:26,763
...being pulled into the darkness,
and I fought to wake up.

659
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:30,390
You're going to be all right now.

660
01:11:30,684 --> 01:11:33,103
You've given me
something to work on now.

661
01:11:33,228 --> 01:11:35,479
I'll take you to that mission this afternoon.

662
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:38,274
When you see it,
you'll remember when you saw it before.

663
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,568
It'll finish your dream.
It'll destroy it, I promise you.

664
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:43,697
All right?

665
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:49,536
- Come on, now. I'll take you home.
- No. I'll be all right.

666
01:11:50,746 --> 01:11:52,747
You'll come back here around noon.

667
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:15,035
Madeleine, where are you now?

668
01:13:17,205 --> 01:13:19,624
- Here with you.
- And it's all real!

669
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,419
It's not merely as it was 100 years ago...

670
01:13:22,544 --> 01:13:26,882
...or a year ago or six months ago or
whenever it was you were here to see it.

671
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:29,843
Now, Madeleine,
think of when you were here.

672
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:34,681
There were not so many carriages then.

673
01:13:36,265 --> 01:13:38,641
There were horses in the stalls...

674
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:42,021
...a bay, two black and a gray.

675
01:13:44,315 --> 01:13:46,400
It was our favorite place...

676
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:50,654
...but we were forbidden to play here.

677
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:54,239
And Sister Teresa would scold us.

678
01:13:58,537 --> 01:14:01,332
Look at this. Here's your gray horse.

679
01:14:03,542 --> 01:14:07,713
Have a little trouble getting in and out
of the stall without being pushed.

680
01:14:07,838 --> 01:14:10,632
You see? There's an answer
for everything.

681
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:17,556
Madeleine, try.

682
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,395
Try for me.

683
01:14:44,997 --> 01:14:47,710
- I love you, Madeleine.
- I love you, too.

684
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:50,837
- Too late. Too late.
- No. We're together.

685
01:14:51,046 --> 01:14:53,841
No, it's too late.
There's something I must do.

686
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:56,301
No. There's nothing you must do.

687
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,096
There's nothing you must do.

688
01:15:01,349 --> 01:15:04,100
No one possesses you.
You're safe with me.

689
01:15:10,816 --> 01:15:12,442
No. It's too late.

690
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,001
It's not fair. It's too late.
It wasn't supposed to happen this way.

691
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:31,795
It had to happen. We're in love.
That's what counts.

692
01:15:31,879 --> 01:15:34,170
- Please let me go!
- Listen to me.

693
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:42,848
- You believe I love you?
- Yes.

694
01:15:44,808 --> 01:15:46,977
And if you lose me, then you'll know...

695
01:15:47,102 --> 01:15:49,769
...I loved you and wanted
to go on loving you.

696
01:15:50,022 --> 01:15:51,438
I won't lose you.

697
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:56,986
- Let me go into the church, alone.
- But why?

698
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:20,424
Madeleine!

699
01:18:44,317 --> 01:18:49,403
Mr. Elster, suspecting all was not well
with his wife's mental state...

700
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:54,702
...took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by Mr. Ferguson...

701
01:18:54,911 --> 01:18:56,787
...lest any harm befall her.

702
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:59,497
And you've heard
that Mr. Elster was prepared...

703
01:18:59,622 --> 01:19:02,085
...to take his wife to an institution...

704
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:06,670
...where her mental health would've been
in the hands of qualified specialists.

705
01:19:07,505 --> 01:19:11,009
Mr. Ferguson, being an ex-detective,
would have seemed...

706
01:19:11,174 --> 01:19:14,594
...the proper choice for the role
of watchdog and protector.

707
01:19:15,013 --> 01:19:17,889
As you have learned,
it was an unfortunate choice.

708
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:21,812
However, I think you'll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband.

709
01:19:21,937 --> 01:19:24,481
His delay in putting his wife
under medical care...

710
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:28,358
...was due only to the need
for information as to her behavior...

711
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:31,071
...which he expected to get
from Mr. Ferguson.

712
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:33,866
He had taken every precaution
to protect his wife.

713
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:36,992
He could not have anticipated
that Mr. Ferguson's weakness...

714
01:19:37,117 --> 01:19:38,829
...his fear of heights...

715
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,874
...would make him powerless
when he was most needed.

716
01:19:41,999 --> 01:19:43,750
As to Mr. Ferguson...

717
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:47,170
...you have heard his former superior...

718
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:51,090
...Detective Captain Hansen,
from that great city to the north...

719
01:19:51,215 --> 01:19:53,968
...testify as to his character and ability.

720
01:19:54,258 --> 01:19:56,637
Captain Hansen was most enthusiastic.

721
01:19:56,928 --> 01:19:59,932
The fact that once before,
under similar circumstances...

722
01:20:00,057 --> 01:20:04,437
...Mr. Ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death...

723
01:20:04,562 --> 01:20:07,940
...Captain Hansen dismissed
as an "unfortunate incident. "

724
01:20:09,982 --> 01:20:12,445
Of course, Mr. Ferguson
is to be congratulated...

725
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,114
...on having once saved the woman's life...

726
01:20:15,446 --> 01:20:19,700
...when, in a previous fit of aberration,
she threw herself into the Bay.

727
01:20:20,494 --> 01:20:23,998
It is a pity that,
knowing her suicidal tendencies...

728
01:20:24,914 --> 01:20:27,919
...he did not make a greater effort
the second time.

729
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:34,842
But we are not here to pass judgment
on Mr. Ferguson's lack of initiative.

730
01:20:35,049 --> 01:20:36,636
He did nothing...

731
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:40,680
...and the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone.

732
01:20:40,805 --> 01:20:45,936
Nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall...

733
01:20:46,936 --> 01:20:49,271
...have any bearing on your verdict.

734
01:20:50,105 --> 01:20:53,525
He did not remain at the scene
of the death. He left.

735
01:20:54,275 --> 01:20:57,820
He claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more...

736
01:20:57,948 --> 01:21:02,619
...until he found himself back in his own
apartment in San Francisco hours later.

737
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:05,247
You may accept that, or not.

738
01:21:07,082 --> 01:21:11,043
Or you may believe that, having once again
allowed someone to die...

739
01:21:11,793 --> 01:21:15,172
...he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness...

740
01:21:15,297 --> 01:21:16,757
...and ran away.

741
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:21,930
That has nothing to do with your verdict.

742
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:25,600
It is a matter between him
and his own conscience.

743
01:21:27,643 --> 01:21:32,189
From the evidence of the state of mind
of Madeleine Elster prior to her death...

744
01:21:32,314 --> 01:21:36,149
...from the manner of her death and
the postmortem examination of the body...

745
01:21:36,277 --> 01:21:38,278
...showing the actual cause of her death...

746
01:21:38,403 --> 01:21:41,238
...you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict.

747
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,783
Gentlemen, you may retire if you wish.

748
01:21:46,828 --> 01:21:48,497
Hold it, Mr. Jones.

749
01:22:10,435 --> 01:22:12,938
- We've reached a verdict.
- Thank you.

750
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:19,483
"The jury finds that Madeleine Elster
committed suicide...

751
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:21,527
"... while of unsound mind. "

752
01:22:22,447 --> 01:22:25,325
Your verdict will be so recorded.
Dismissed.

753
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:34,541
- Scottie, let's go.
- Mind if I speak to him for a minute?

754
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:35,876
Go ahead.

755
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:44,800
Sorry, Scottie. That was rough.

756
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:47,679
He had no right to speak to you like that.

757
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:51,517
It was my responsibility.
I shouldn't have got you involved.

758
01:22:51,849 --> 01:22:54,687
No, there's nothing you have to say to me.

759
01:22:55,063 --> 01:22:57,523
I'm getting out, Scottie, for good.

760
01:22:57,688 --> 01:22:59,317
I can't stay here.

761
01:22:59,858 --> 01:23:02,776
I'm going to wind up her affairs,
and mine...

762
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,280
...get away as far as I can.

763
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:07,656
Europe, perhaps.

764
01:23:08,406 --> 01:23:10,910
And I probably never will come back.

765
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,539
Good-bye, Scottie.

766
01:23:15,165 --> 01:23:18,293
If there's anything I can do for you
before I go...

767
01:23:20,044 --> 01:23:22,379
There's no way for them to understand.

768
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:26,134
You and I know who killed Madeleine.

769
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:35,977
Come on, Scottie. Let's get out of here.

770
01:25:44,353 --> 01:25:47,689
It's Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus.

771
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:52,443
I had a long talk with that lady
in Musical Therapy...

772
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,197
...and she says
that Mozart's the boy for you...

773
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:57,907
...the broom that sweeps
the cobwebs away.

774
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,371
It's what the lady said.

775
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:08,876
It's wonderful how
they have it all taped now, John.

776
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,380
They have music for dipsomaniacs,
and music for melancholiacs...

777
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:15,715
...and music for hypochondriacs.

778
01:26:16,924 --> 01:26:20,344
I wonder what would happen
if somebody got their files mixed up.

779
01:26:30,857 --> 01:26:34,402
I brought a lot of other things,
and you can see what you like.

780
01:26:34,777 --> 01:26:36,821
It shuts off automatically.

781
01:26:45,286 --> 01:26:46,996
Johnny, please try.

782
01:26:47,581 --> 01:26:48,956
Try, Johnny.

783
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:52,170
You're not lost. Mother is here.

784
01:26:56,882 --> 01:26:57,923
Time?

785
01:27:01,887 --> 01:27:03,722
I'll be in again, John.

786
01:27:04,472 --> 01:27:06,642
You want me to shut that off?

787
01:27:29,623 --> 01:27:32,165
You don't even know I'm here, do you?

788
01:27:35,963 --> 01:27:37,379
But I'm here.

789
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,564
Nurse, could I see the doctor
for a moment?

790
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,400
Doctor, Miss Wood.

791
01:27:59,235 --> 01:28:01,195
Won't you go in, please?

792
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,573
Yes, Miss Wood?

793
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:07,869
Doctor, how long is it going to take you
to pull him out of this?

794
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:11,247
It's hard to say. At least six months.
Perhaps a year.

795
01:28:11,788 --> 01:28:13,373
It really could depend on him.

796
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:15,543
- He won't talk.
- No.

797
01:28:16,293 --> 01:28:18,878
He's suffering from acute melancholia...

798
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:20,922
...together with a guilt complex.

799
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:23,467
He blames himself
for what happened to the woman.

800
01:28:23,592 --> 01:28:26,177
We know little of what went on before.

801
01:28:26,846 --> 01:28:30,016
I can give you one thing:
He was in love with her.

802
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,643
That does complicate the problem,
doesn't it?

803
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:37,395
I can give you another complication:
He still is.

804
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:40,064
And you want to know something?

805
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:43,109
I don't think Mozart's going to help at all.

806
01:30:13,406 --> 01:30:16,285
- Where'd you get this car?
- I beg your pardon?

807
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:19,705
I bought it from a man who used to live
in this building.

808
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,084
Mr. Gavin Elster.
I bought it from him when he moved away.

809
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:26,044
You knew him and his wife!

810
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,214
The poor thing. I didn't know her.

811
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:31,467
- Is it true that she really-
- I'm sorry.

812
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,405
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

813
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,310
Give me a scotch and soda.

814
01:34:02,548 --> 01:34:06,177
- What is it?
- Could I ask you a couple of questions?

815
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:09,472
- What for? Who are you?
- My name is John Ferguson.

816
01:34:09,722 --> 01:34:11,807
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll?

817
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:15,645
- There are some things I'd like to ask.
- You live in this hotel?

818
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:18,356
No. I happened to see you
when you came in, so I-

819
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:20,441
Yeah, I thought so. A pickup.

820
01:34:20,691 --> 01:34:24,404
You've got a nerve, following me
into the hotel and up to my room.

821
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:28,240
- Now, you beat it.
- Please. I just want to talk to you.

822
01:34:28,615 --> 01:34:30,243
I'm gonna yell in a minute.

823
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:33,160
I'm not gonna hurt you. Honest.
I promise.

824
01:34:33,704 --> 01:34:36,289
Please. Just let me talk to you.

825
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:38,834
- What about?
- You.

826
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:41,963
- Why?
- Because you remind me of somebody.

827
01:34:43,673 --> 01:34:45,548
I heard that one before, too.

828
01:34:46,342 --> 01:34:49,011
I remind you of someone
you were madly in love with...

829
01:34:49,092 --> 01:34:51,180
...but then she ditched you
for another guy...

830
01:34:51,305 --> 01:34:54,016
...and you've been carrying a torch
ever since.

831
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:56,766
Then you saw me and something clicked.

832
01:34:58,311 --> 01:34:59,936
You're not far wrong.

833
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:03,400
- It's not gonna work, so go.
- Please, let me come in.

834
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:08,864
You can leave the door open.
I just want to talk to you. Please.

835
01:35:11,617 --> 01:35:14,284
Well, I warn you, I can yell awful loud.

836
01:35:14,534 --> 01:35:16,163
You won't have to.

837
01:35:17,454 --> 01:35:22,878
You don't look much like Jack the Ripper.
What do you want to know?

838
01:35:23,212 --> 01:35:25,172
- I want to know your name.
- Judy Barton.

839
01:35:25,297 --> 01:35:27,716
- Who you are.
- I'm just a girl. I work at Magnin's.

840
01:35:27,841 --> 01:35:31,845
- How do you happen to be living here?
- It's a place to live, that's all.

841
01:35:32,052 --> 01:35:35,095
- But you haven't lived here long?
- Yeah, about three years.

842
01:35:35,221 --> 01:35:37,890
- Where did you live before?
- Salina, Kansas!

843
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,019
Listen, what is this? What do you want?

844
01:35:42,688 --> 01:35:45,774
- I just want to know who you are.
- Well, I told you.

845
01:35:47,944 --> 01:35:50,947
My name is Judy Barton.
I come from Salina, Kansas.

846
01:35:51,197 --> 01:35:53,323
I work at Magnin's and I live here.

847
01:35:55,743 --> 01:35:57,787
My gosh, do I have to prove it?

848
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:06,461
All right, mister,
my Kansas driver's license.

849
01:36:07,127 --> 01:36:10,424
"Judy Barton, number Z296794 .

850
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:13,719
"425 Maple Avenue, Salina, Kansas. "

851
01:36:17,346 --> 01:36:20,850
See the address on this one?
It's this place right here.

852
01:36:21,434 --> 01:36:25,272
A California license issued May 25 , 1954 .

853
01:36:27,107 --> 01:36:30,151
You want to check my thumbprints?
You satisfied?

854
01:36:31,943 --> 01:36:35,365
Whether you're satisfied or not,
you can just beat it.

855
01:36:39,786 --> 01:36:42,371
You have got it bad, haven't you?

856
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,169
Do I really look like her?

857
01:36:52,215 --> 01:36:54,300
She's dead, isn't she?

858
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:02,142
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry I yelled at you.

859
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,650
Yes, that's me with my mother.

860
01:37:13,235 --> 01:37:14,776
And that's my father.

861
01:37:15,821 --> 01:37:19,406
He's dead. My mother married again,
but I didn't like the guy...

862
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:23,035
...so I decided I'd see what it's like
in sunny California.

863
01:37:24,163 --> 01:37:26,205
I've been here three years.

864
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:28,000
Honest.

865
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:40,513
- Will you have dinner with me?
- Why?

866
01:37:41,303 --> 01:37:45,098
- I feel I owe you something after all this.
- You don't owe me anything.

867
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:48,187
- Then will you? For me?
- Dinner and what else?

868
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:52,525
- Just dinner.
- 'Cause I remind you of her?

869
01:37:52,942 --> 01:37:55,442
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.

870
01:38:00,198 --> 01:38:02,240
I've been on blind dates before.

871
01:38:02,574 --> 01:38:05,828
Matter of fact, to be honest,
I've been picked up before.

872
01:38:07,622 --> 01:38:08,498
Okay.

873
01:38:08,832 --> 01:38:11,499
I'll get my car. I'll be back in half an hour.

874
01:38:11,624 --> 01:38:14,838
- Give me time to change and get fixed up.
- An hour?

875
01:38:16,463 --> 01:38:17,463
Okay.

876
01:40:12,202 --> 01:40:13,746
Dearest Scottie:

877
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,290
And so you found me.

878
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:19,459
This is the moment
that I dreaded and hoped for...

879
01:40:19,543 --> 01:40:23,004
...wondering what I would say and do
if I ever saw you again.

880
01:40:23,463 --> 01:40:26,130
I wanted so to see you again, just once.

881
01:40:26,508 --> 01:40:29,177
Now I'll go,
and you can give up your search.

882
01:40:29,553 --> 01:40:33,848
I want you to have peace of mind.
You've nothing to blame yourself for.

883
01:40:34,013 --> 01:40:35,517
You were the victim.

884
01:40:35,642 --> 01:40:40,228
I was the tool and you the victim
of Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife.

885
01:40:40,603 --> 01:40:45,067
He chose me to play the part because
I looked like her. He dressed me like her.

886
01:40:45,317 --> 01:40:49,362
He was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to town.

887
01:40:49,487 --> 01:40:52,325
He chose you to be the witness
to a suicide.

888
01:40:53,285 --> 01:40:55,954
The Carlotta story was part real,
part invented...

889
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,540
...to make you testify
that Madeleine wanted to kill herself.

890
01:41:00,206 --> 01:41:04,503
He knew of your illness. He knew
you'd never get up the stairs to the tower.

891
01:41:04,878 --> 01:41:07,673
He planned it so well.
He made no mistakes.

892
01:41:09,048 --> 01:41:11,508
I made the mistake. I fell in love.

893
01:41:12,093 --> 01:41:14,262
That wasn't part of the plan.

894
01:41:15,181 --> 01:41:18,767
I'm still in love with you,
and I want you so to love me.

895
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,770
If I had the nerve, I'd stay and lie...

896
01:41:21,896 --> 01:41:24,315
...hoping that I could
make you love me again...

897
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,231
...as I am, for myself...

898
01:41:27,484 --> 01:41:30,986
...and so forget the other
and forget the past. But...

899
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:35,659
...I don't know whether
I have the nerve to try.

900
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:53,835
Here. I'll do it.

901
01:43:55,711 --> 01:43:58,758
- There you are.
- Thanks again. Good night.

902
01:43:58,925 --> 01:44:00,759
Can I see you tomorrow?

903
01:44:01,509 --> 01:44:04,929
- Tomorrow night? Well-
- No, I mean tomorrow morning.

904
01:44:07,934 --> 01:44:10,228
But I have to go to work. I've got a job.

905
01:44:10,353 --> 01:44:14,312
- Don't go to your job.
- What'll I live on? My oil wells in Texas?

906
01:44:14,687 --> 01:44:16,857
Let me take care of you, Judy.

907
01:44:18,776 --> 01:44:21,111
Thanks very much, but no, thanks.

908
01:44:22,446 --> 01:44:25,741
- No, Judy, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

909
01:44:25,991 --> 01:44:28,576
I've been understanding since I was 17 .

910
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:31,120
- And the next step is?
- No.

911
01:44:31,955 --> 01:44:33,999
No? Then what?

912
01:44:34,499 --> 01:44:36,084
We could just...

913
01:44:36,628 --> 01:44:38,629
...see a lot of each other...

914
01:44:39,464 --> 01:44:40,464
Why?

915
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:43,758
'Cause I remind you of her?

916
01:44:49,307 --> 01:44:51,392
It's not very complimentary.

917
01:44:53,268 --> 01:44:54,771
And nothing else?

918
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:57,897
No.

919
01:44:58,316 --> 01:45:00,691
That's not very complimentary either.

920
01:45:00,816 --> 01:45:03,654
I just want to be with you
as much as I can.

921
01:45:16,542 --> 01:45:17,708
Well...

922
01:45:18,752 --> 01:45:22,423
...I guess I could phone the store
in the morning...

923
01:45:24,423 --> 01:45:26,342
...and make some excuse.

924
01:46:32,992 --> 01:46:34,451
There you are.

925
01:46:36,202 --> 01:46:37,787
I like that one.

926
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:39,790
- Like that?
- Yes.

927
01:46:40,541 --> 01:46:42,916
- That's very nice.
- It's beautiful.

928
01:46:44,836 --> 01:46:46,255
There we are.

929
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,299
We'll get this,
then we'll buy you those clothes.

930
01:46:49,424 --> 01:46:51,550
- Honest?
- Right over there's Ransohoffs.

931
01:46:51,675 --> 01:46:54,720
- Nothing but the best. How much?
- That'll be 50 cents.

932
01:46:54,845 --> 01:46:56,764
- Thank you.
- You don't have to.

933
01:46:56,889 --> 01:46:58,183
I want to.

934
01:47:21,205 --> 01:47:24,959
- No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
- But you said gray, sir.

935
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:28,045
I just want an ordinary, simple gray suit.

936
01:47:28,335 --> 01:47:31,799
- But I like that one, Scottie.
- No, it's not right.

937
01:47:32,799 --> 01:47:35,594
The gentleman seems to know
what he wants.

938
01:47:36,429 --> 01:47:38,388
All right. We'll find it.

939
01:47:45,937 --> 01:47:48,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to buy you a suit.

940
01:47:50,192 --> 01:47:52,652
But I love the second one she wore.

941
01:47:53,446 --> 01:47:57,116
- And this one, it's beautiful.
- They're none of them right.

942
01:47:57,656 --> 01:48:01,036
I think I know the suit you mean.
We had it some time ago.

943
01:48:01,161 --> 01:48:03,455
Let me see. We may still have that model.

944
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:04,874
Thank you.

945
01:48:07,084 --> 01:48:09,794
You're looking for the suit
that she wore, for me.

946
01:48:09,919 --> 01:48:13,048
- You want me to dress like her.
- I just want you to look nice.

947
01:48:13,173 --> 01:48:16,718
- I know what suit would look well on you.
- No, I won't do it!

948
01:48:20,387 --> 01:48:21,262
Judy.

949
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:25,560
It can't make a difference to you.
I just want to see-

950
01:48:25,685 --> 01:48:28,855
I don't want any clothes.
I want to get out of here.

951
01:48:29,021 --> 01:48:31,399
- Do this for me.
- Here we are.

952
01:48:32,441 --> 01:48:34,401
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought so.

953
01:48:35,236 --> 01:48:37,489
- I don't like it.
- We'll take it.

954
01:48:37,864 --> 01:48:39,074
Will the thing fit?

955
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:42,660
It might need some slight alterations,
but it's madam's size.

956
01:48:43,703 --> 01:48:46,289
We'll have it for you to try on in a moment.

957
01:48:46,454 --> 01:48:49,374
- How long will the alterations take?
- Well...

958
01:48:49,499 --> 01:48:52,838
- May we have it by tonight?
- If it's absolutely necessary.

959
01:48:53,003 --> 01:48:56,382
Yes, it is. Now, we'd like to look
at a dinner dress...

960
01:48:56,547 --> 01:49:00,677
...short, black, with long sleeves
and a kind of square neck.

961
01:49:00,802 --> 01:49:02,805
- Scottie!
- My!

962
01:49:03,681 --> 01:49:07,309
You certainly do know what you want, sir.
I'll see what we have.

963
01:49:15,650 --> 01:49:18,735
- That's it. Do you have them in brown?
- Yes, we have.

964
01:49:18,863 --> 01:49:19,904
Fine.

965
01:49:28,078 --> 01:49:31,623
Here, Judy. Drink this straight down,
just like medicine.

966
01:49:32,501 --> 01:49:35,962
Why are you doing this?
What good will it do?

967
01:49:36,212 --> 01:49:37,631
I don't know.

968
01:49:38,132 --> 01:49:40,382
No good, I guess. I don't know.

969
01:49:44,179 --> 01:49:47,223
I wish you'd leave me alone.
I want to go away.

970
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,268
You can, you know.

971
01:49:52,604 --> 01:49:54,604
No. You wouldn't let me.

972
01:49:57,108 --> 01:49:59,818
And I don't want to go.

973
01:50:00,987 --> 01:50:03,488
Judy, I tell you this.

974
01:50:03,698 --> 01:50:07,242
These past few days are
the first happy days I've had in a year.

975
01:50:07,952 --> 01:50:09,537
I know because...

976
01:50:10,828 --> 01:50:12,916
Because I remind you of her.

977
01:50:14,792 --> 01:50:16,920
And not even that very much.

978
01:50:17,295 --> 01:50:18,296
No.

979
01:50:19,214 --> 01:50:22,300
No, Judy. It's you, too.

980
01:50:23,134 --> 01:50:25,426
There's something in you that...

981
01:50:30,014 --> 01:50:32,974
- You don't even want to touch me.
- Yes, I do.

982
01:50:35,393 --> 01:50:38,688
Couldn't you like me,
just me, the way I am?

983
01:50:40,317 --> 01:50:43,946
When we first started out, it was so good.
We had fun.

984
01:50:46,447 --> 01:50:49,116
And then you started in on the clothes.

985
01:50:50,826 --> 01:50:53,539
I'll wear the darned clothes
if you want me to...

986
01:50:53,664 --> 01:50:56,706
...if you'll just like me.

987
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:04,465
The color of your hair.

988
01:51:10,554 --> 01:51:13,142
Judy, please. It can't matter to you.

989
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,571
If I let you change me, will that do it?

990
01:51:27,155 --> 01:51:29,240
If I do what you tell me...

991
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,660
...will you love me?

992
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:33,910
Yes.

993
01:51:35,745 --> 01:51:37,330
- Yes.
- All right.

994
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:43,087
All right, then, I'll do it.
I don't care anymore about me.

995
01:51:52,388 --> 01:51:54,682
Come on. We'll sit by the fire.

996
01:52:15,534 --> 01:52:17,662
I'm afraid it's going to take several hours.

997
01:52:17,787 --> 01:52:21,873
The young lady thought you'd like to go
home. She'll join you when she's finished.

998
01:52:21,998 --> 01:52:25,337
No. Tell her I'll go to her hotel
and wait for her there.

999
01:52:26,046 --> 01:52:29,341
- You're sure about the color of the hair?
- Yes, it's an easy color.

1000
01:52:29,466 --> 01:52:31,801
- All the rest of-
- Yes, we know what you want.

1001
01:52:31,927 --> 01:52:33,220
Thank you.

1002
01:54:17,322 --> 01:54:18,406
Well?

1003
01:54:18,531 --> 01:54:22,160
It should be back from your face
and pinned at the neck. I told her that.

1004
01:54:22,285 --> 01:54:23,286
I told you that.

1005
01:54:24,327 --> 01:54:27,496
We tried it. It just didn't seem to suit me.

1006
01:54:33,545 --> 01:54:35,004
Please, Judy.

1007
01:57:40,768 --> 01:57:43,481
- Where shall we go for dinner?
- Anywhere you like.

1008
01:57:43,606 --> 01:57:46,901
- Ernie's?
- You have a thing about Ernie's, don't you?

1009
01:57:47,942 --> 01:57:49,946
After all, it's our place.

1010
01:57:53,782 --> 01:57:55,701
Hello, my love. Like me?

1011
01:57:58,036 --> 01:58:00,746
- Is that the best you can do?
- Come here.

1012
01:58:01,124 --> 01:58:02,584
No. You'll muss me.

1013
01:58:03,166 --> 01:58:05,501
That's what I had in mind. Come here.

1014
01:58:06,254 --> 01:58:08,339
It's too late. I got my face on.

1015
01:58:08,923 --> 01:58:10,424
I'm suddenly hungry.

1016
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,679
- Would you rather go somewhere else?
- No. Ernie's is fine.

1017
01:58:17,974 --> 01:58:21,142
I'm gonna have one
of those big, beautiful steaks.

1018
01:58:21,892 --> 01:58:24,937
Let me see. To start I think I'll...

1019
01:58:26,856 --> 01:58:28,775
Help me with this, will you?

1020
01:58:31,776 --> 01:58:33,071
I have it.

1021
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:37,200
- How do you work this thing?
- Can't you see?

1022
01:58:38,366 --> 01:58:42,039
- Now, there you are.
- Thank you. I'm just about ready.

1023
01:58:42,873 --> 01:58:45,209
All I've gotta do is find my lipstick.

1024
01:58:45,874 --> 01:58:48,044
Where did I put it? I had it a minute ago.

1025
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:04,227
I wonder if it's here. Here it is.

1026
01:59:06,355 --> 01:59:07,771
There, I'm ready.

1027
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:12,485
But first, muss me a little?

1028
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:18,824
Scottie, I do have you now, don't I?

1029
01:59:21,909 --> 01:59:25,204
How would you like to go someplace
out of town for dinner?

1030
01:59:25,914 --> 01:59:29,793
- Maybe we could drive down the peninsula.
- All right. If you'd like.

1031
01:59:48,104 --> 01:59:49,896
We're going awfully far.

1032
01:59:50,021 --> 01:59:53,234
I just feel like driving.
Are you terribly hungry?

1033
01:59:54,191 --> 01:59:55,902
No, it's all right.

1034
02:00:16,337 --> 02:00:18,047
Where are you going?

1035
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:24,930
One final thing I have to do...

1036
02:00:27,515 --> 02:00:29,810
...and then I'll be free of the past.

1037
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:52,291
Scottie, why are we here?

1038
02:00:52,706 --> 02:00:54,084
I told you.

1039
02:00:56,461 --> 02:00:58,589
I have to go back into the past once more.

1040
02:00:58,714 --> 02:01:02,134
Just once more, for the last time.

1041
02:01:03,219 --> 02:01:04,678
Why? Why here?

1042
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:07,473
Madeleine died here, Judy.

1043
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:13,019
- I don't wanna go. I'd rather wait-
- No, I need you.

1044
02:01:13,312 --> 02:01:14,313
Why?

1045
02:01:15,354 --> 02:01:18,023
I need you to be Madeleine for a while.

1046
02:01:18,818 --> 02:01:21,487
And when it's done, we'll both be free.

1047
02:01:22,278 --> 02:01:25,616
- I'm scared.
- I have to tell you about Madeleine now.

1048
02:01:26,742 --> 02:01:28,077
Right there.

1049
02:01:29,326 --> 02:01:31,870
We stood there,
and I kissed her for the last time.

1050
02:01:31,995 --> 02:01:34,790
She said, "If you lose me,
you'll know that I love you...

1051
02:01:34,915 --> 02:01:36,668
"... and wanted to keep loving you. "

1052
02:01:36,793 --> 02:01:40,044
And I said, "I won't lose you. " But I did.

1053
02:01:41,673 --> 02:01:43,214
And then she turned...

1054
02:01:45,134 --> 02:01:47,053
...and ran into the church.

1055
02:02:00,066 --> 02:02:02,652
When I followed her, it was too late.

1056
02:02:07,196 --> 02:02:08,906
I don't want to go in there!

1057
02:02:09,031 --> 02:02:10,491
It was too late.

1058
02:02:18,459 --> 02:02:22,212
I couldn't find her,
and then I heard footsteps on the stairs.

1059
02:02:22,838 --> 02:02:24,838
She was running up the tower.

1060
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:26,298
Right here.

1061
02:02:27,092 --> 02:02:29,386
See? She was running up the stairs...

1062
02:02:29,718 --> 02:02:32,512
...and through the trapdoor
at the top of the tower.

1063
02:02:32,637 --> 02:02:35,642
I tried to follow her,
but I couldn't get to the top.

1064
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:38,477
I tried, but I couldn't get to the top.

1065
02:02:38,645 --> 02:02:40,896
One doesn't often get a second chance.

1066
02:02:41,021 --> 02:02:43,191
I want to stop being haunted.

1067
02:02:43,816 --> 02:02:47,404
You're my second chance, Judy.
You're my second chance.

1068
02:02:47,529 --> 02:02:48,945
Take me away!

1069
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:52,910
You look like Madeleine now.
Go up the stairs.

1070
02:02:53,035 --> 02:02:54,953
- No!
- Go up the stairs.

1071
02:02:57,748 --> 02:02:59,708
Go up the stairs, Judy...

1072
02:03:01,334 --> 02:03:02,877
...and I'll follow.

1073
02:04:02,684 --> 02:04:05,729
This was as far as I could get,
but you went on.

1074
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:08,439
Remember?

1075
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:12,487
The necklace, Madeleine.
That was the slip.

1076
02:04:13,278 --> 02:04:15,113
I remembered the necklace.

1077
02:04:15,238 --> 02:04:17,908
- Let me go!
- No. We're going up the tower, Madeleine.

1078
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:19,742
You can't! You're afraid!

1079
02:04:20,537 --> 02:04:23,915
We'll see. We'll see.
This is my second chance.

1080
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,125
Please!

1081
02:04:25,457 --> 02:04:28,126
You knew that day
that I couldn't follow you.

1082
02:04:28,295 --> 02:04:31,131
- Who was up there? Elster and his wife?
- Yes.

1083
02:04:31,256 --> 02:04:34,550
And she was the one who died.
The real wife, not you.

1084
02:04:34,925 --> 02:04:37,303
You were the counterfeit, weren't you?

1085
02:04:37,428 --> 02:04:40,264
- Was she dead or alive-
- Dead! He'd broken her neck.

1086
02:04:40,389 --> 02:04:43,433
He'd broken her neck.
Wasn't taking any chances, was he?

1087
02:04:43,558 --> 02:04:47,103
When you got up there, he pushed her off,
but it was you who screamed.

1088
02:04:47,228 --> 02:04:51,317
- Why did you scream?
- I wanted to stop it. I ran up to stop it-

1089
02:04:51,482 --> 02:04:55,777
Stop it? Why did you scream,
since you tricked me so well up to then?

1090
02:04:56,071 --> 02:05:00,032
You played the wife very well, Judy.
He made you over, didn't he?

1091
02:05:00,241 --> 02:05:03,536
He made you over just like
I made you over, only better.

1092
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:08,125
Not only the clothes and the hair,
but the looks, the manner and the words...

1093
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:10,210
...and those beautiful phony trances.

1094
02:05:10,335 --> 02:05:12,379
And you jumped into the Bay, didn't you?

1095
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:15,299
I'll bet you're a wonderful swimmer,
aren't you?

1096
02:05:15,424 --> 02:05:17,009
- Aren't you?
- Yes!

1097
02:05:17,468 --> 02:05:21,847
Then what did he do? Did he train you?
Did he rehearse you?

1098
02:05:22,139 --> 02:05:25,097
Did he tell you exactly what to do,
what to say?

1099
02:05:25,223 --> 02:05:28,061
You were a very apt pupil, too,
weren't you?

1100
02:05:29,521 --> 02:05:32,022
Why did you pick on me? Why me?

1101
02:05:32,147 --> 02:05:33,606
Your accident!

1102
02:05:34,106 --> 02:05:35,566
The accident!

1103
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:38,321
I was the setup, wasn't I?

1104
02:05:38,446 --> 02:05:40,656
I was a made-to-order witness.

1105
02:05:48,373 --> 02:05:49,664
I made it.

1106
02:05:51,543 --> 02:05:54,212
- I made it.
- What are you going to do?

1107
02:05:56,798 --> 02:05:59,633
We're going up and look
at the scene of the crime.

1108
02:05:59,758 --> 02:06:01,218
Come on, Judy.

1109
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,440
This is where it happened.

1110
02:06:17,693 --> 02:06:20,360
The two of you hid there
and waited for it to clear...

1111
02:06:20,485 --> 02:06:23,905
...then you sneaked down
and drove into town, is that it?

1112
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:26,702
And then? You were his girl?

1113
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:29,413
What happened to you?

1114
02:06:30,038 --> 02:06:31,788
Did he ditch you?

1115
02:06:33,458 --> 02:06:35,252
With all of his wife's money...

1116
02:06:35,377 --> 02:06:39,256
...and all that freedom and power,
and he ditched you. What a shame.

1117
02:06:39,463 --> 02:06:42,132
But he knew he was safe.
He knew you couldn't talk.

1118
02:06:42,257 --> 02:06:44,845
- Did he give you anything?
- Some money.

1119
02:06:45,262 --> 02:06:48,140
And the necklace, Carlotta's necklace.

1120
02:06:49,306 --> 02:06:51,851
There was where you made
your mistake, Judy.

1121
02:06:51,976 --> 02:06:54,521
You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.

1122
02:06:59,192 --> 02:07:01,694
You shouldn't have been that sentimental.

1123
02:07:05,738 --> 02:07:07,742
I loved you so, Madeleine.

1124
02:07:12,121 --> 02:07:13,956
I was safe when you found me.

1125
02:07:14,081 --> 02:07:16,167
There was nothing that you could prove.

1126
02:07:16,292 --> 02:07:20,127
But when I saw you again,
I couldn't run away. I loved you so.

1127
02:07:20,921 --> 02:07:23,006
I walked into danger
and let you change me...

1128
02:07:23,131 --> 02:07:25,466
...because I loved you and I wanted you.

1129
02:07:28,261 --> 02:07:30,471
Scottie, please. You loved me.

1130
02:07:31,224 --> 02:07:33,893
- Keep me safe. Please!
- It's too late.

1131
02:07:34,018 --> 02:07:36,685
It's too late. There's no bringing her back.

1132
02:07:36,854 --> 02:07:37,979
Please.

1133
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:51,952
I heard voices.

1134
02:07:55,956 --> 02:07:57,456
God have mercy.
