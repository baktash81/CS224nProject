1
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,126
Nice ride.

2
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,534
Hey, say hello to your dad for me.

3
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,642
l haven't seen the big kahuna
for a while.

4
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,278
<i>Greetings from Venice, California.</i>
<i>Hi, I'm Emily Tyler.</i>

5
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,850
<i>I'm a lucky kid.</i>

6
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,579
<i>My sister, Tess, and I live</i>
<i>in the greatest place.</i>

7
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,554
<i>People come here</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>

8
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,820
<i>But for us, this is our back yard.</i>

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,397
<i>This is Venice Boardwalk.</i>
<i>It's got cool shops...</i>

10
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,536
<i>...great places to eat,</i>
<i>and tons of interesting people.</i>

11
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,764
<i>It may not look like a typical</i>
<i>neighborhood. You'd be surprised.</i>

12
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,102
<i>These people are the greatest.</i>

13
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:22,280
<i>The real way to judge a place</i>
<i>is when things aren't good.</i>

14
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,882
<i>Years ago, it was a difficult</i>
<i>time for our family.</i>

15
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,451
<i>Everyone here really pitched in.</i>

16
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,519
<i>But more about that later.</i>

17
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,052
-Hey, Tess.
-Emily.

18
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,317
Oops!

19
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:39,455
<i>My sister and I are a lot alike.</i>
<i>Some people can't tell us apart.</i>

20
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,792
<i>But we're really very different.</i>

21
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,936
<i>Tess is better at sports,</i>
<i>but I surf better.</i>

22
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,538
<i>My sister's left-handed.</i>
<i>I'm right.</i>

23
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,538
<i>Tess likes boys and I like boys.</i>

24
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,110
<i>Well, there's gotta be</i>
<i>some things we agree on.</i>

25
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:04,484
<i>And another thing we agree on. We got</i>
<i>about the greatest dad in the world.</i>

26
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,785
<i>Anyway, we're just a couple kids</i>
<i>from Venice, California.</i>

27
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,555
<i>It isn't just a cool place to visit.</i>
<i>It's our home.</i>

28
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,268
Hey, Emily.

29
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,406
Have you seen the whisk?

30
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,700
What?

31
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:29,245
We've lost the whisk?
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,450
How can we go on?

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,920
-Do you know what a whisk is?
-No.

34
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,353
-Chefs use it to scramble eggs.
-Why not forks?

35
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,581
lt bruises.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,955
Next you'll worry about hurting
their feelings.

37
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,961
Here. Watch.

38
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,973
Scramble, scramble, scramble....

39
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,943
-Scrambled eggs.
-No, no, no.

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,620
That is scrambled eggs.

41
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:25,135
-Dad's been working again.
-Let's bring him breakfast.

42
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,945
<i>This is our dad. He's a sculptor.</i>

43
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,584
<i>Not a starving artist.</i>
<i>Maybe you've seen his work.</i>

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,654
<i>Since our mom died two years ago,</i>
<i>all he does is work.</i>

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,850
<i>That's great for his fans,</i>
<i>but not so great for us.</i>

46
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,731
-Morning, Dad.
-Morning, Dad.

47
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,531
Morning, Monster. Munchkin.
Come here.

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,073
-Oh, you're so dirty.
-Dirty man. Dirty man.

49
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,642
-Whisk.
-Oh, there it is.

50
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,582
l was looking for that.
lf l could find my blowtorch.

51
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,882
lt's under the coffeepot.

52
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,122
-You've been working all night again.
-all night, what?

53
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,661
ls it morning already?

54
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,427
See that bright stuff out there?

55
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,570
-Hear the birds chirping?
-Yes, yes, l do.

56
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,296
Oh, Dad, it's excellent.

57
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:40,069
-What happens here?
-You know, l'm not really sure yet.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,649
I'm working more from sort of
a "feeling" place these days.

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,285
You can't work on an empty stomach,
so let's eat.

60
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,480
-Come on.
-Oh, look at this! Great.

61
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:57,720
You missed killer waves this morning.
El NiÃ±o sent some awesome 6-footers.

62
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,424
How come you never surf anymore?
You used to be first on the beach.

63
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,628
l don't know. l guess l just
haven't felt like it.

64
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,371
Are you meeting us for ice cream?

65
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,102
lce cream? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,383
Dad, are you okay?

67
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,446
Yeah, sure. Why?

68
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,250
Lately, you seem kind of out of it.

69
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,553
No, l haven't been out of it.
l've been totally with it.

70
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,526
Dad!

71
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,930
What is that?

72
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,294
Orange juice.

73
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,663
-Oh, my God!
-On cereal.

74
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,997
l wanted milk.

75
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,643
-lt's me. l forgot my key.
-What's the password?

76
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,810
l've got a client with me.
They love to tease me.

77
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,506
-Just go let him in.
-all right.

78
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,219
l discovered Maxwell as a student.

79
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,416
Classically trained but very hip.
Very now. Very cutting edge. Edgy.

80
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,858
This is Nigel, my dad's agent.
He's like family.

81
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,590
<i>The kind of family that moves in</i>
<i>and never leaves.</i>

82
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,334
Hi, Nige.

83
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,101
-And the password is...?
-Client.

84
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:25,646
Where's your daddy? ln the studio
creating his latest masterpiece?

85
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,161
Dad.

86
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,893
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go sit down.

87
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,795
Hi.

88
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,875
-Max Tyler.
-Enola Rubenstein.

89
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,672
As in the Rubenstein Foundation.

90
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,180
-Mrs. Rubenstein.
-Ms. Rubenstein.

91
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,583
The piece l want to show you
is right over this way.

92
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,450
-ls he single?
-Widower.

93
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,352
Excellent!

94
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,734
This one...

95
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,969
...is breathtaking.

96
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,539
That's our mother.

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,935
-Really?
-She was a ballerina.

98
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,810
Dad fell for her when he saw her dance.
lt was love at first sight.

99
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,010
Later he waited backstage with
a huge bouquet of roses.

100
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,917
And she flipped for him.
Who wouldn't?

101
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,321
And from that day on,
they were never apart.

102
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,224
Dad said every day with her
was magic.

103
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,434
How utterly romantic.

104
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,667
l must have him.

105
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,432
lt.

106
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,539
How much?

107
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,604
l'm sorry. This piece isn't for sale.

108
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,839
Nigel will let you know
what's available. Excuse us.

109
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:10,821
Artists. They're so temperamental,
so moody, so-- You know.

110
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,391
Call my contractor when the sculpture's
ready to be delivered.

111
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,792
There's an extra 25% for you
if you get me a date with Max.

112
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,593
Wish l could.
He hasn't gotten over losing his wife.

113
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,270
Yes, what a shame. What a tragedy.

114
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,966
And yet his anguish
keeps you in Armani.

115
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,377
-Ta, darling.
-Ta, dear.

116
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,223
<i>Thank you!</i>

117
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,504
The bank won't cash that
if there's slobber on it.

118
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,073
Nice suit!

119
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,404
-Another Rolex?
-Saw your new Range Rover outside.

120
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,110
How come Dad's still driving his old
Cutlass and you get a new car?

121
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:19,120
l have to look successful
in the circles l travel.

122
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,088
l don't want anyone l meet
to think...

123
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,889
...they're the first person
to write me a big check.

124
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:31,297
Now speaking of big checks, l think
l'll walk this one to the bank.

125
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,069
There's something fishy
about that guy.

126
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,576
Fishy? all you need is mayonnaise
and you've got tuna salad.

127
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,277
<i>This is our swim club,</i>
<i>home of the Westside Squids.</i>

128
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,011
<i>Every year there's a diving meet</i>
<i>between the Squids...</i>

129
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,687
<i>...and our Palos Verdes rivals.</i>

130
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,792
<i>My sister, Tess,</i>
<i>is the team's best diver.</i>

131
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,519
<i>Me? I do okay.</i>

132
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,631
<i>And this is Brad, our swim coach.</i>
<i>Need I say more?</i>

133
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,773
Great try, Emily. Better.

134
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,168
Thanks, Bod! l mean, Brad.

135
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,890
l never trained a more beautiful
and talented diver.

136
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,959
-Can l take you to the 7th grade dance?
-Pick me up at 7:30.

137
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,160
-Next!
-lsn't Tess gonna dive?

138
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,836
See you later.

139
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,444
Put this on my back.
l don't wanna get sunburned.

140
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,515
all right already.
l'm not your slave girl.

141
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,844
Oops!

142
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:59,524
lf you'd concentrate on diving like
you do on the diving instructor...

143
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,023
...we might have a chance to win.

144
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,788
l can't help it. He's a hunkasaurous.

145
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,058
How could you not think
he is totally delish?

146
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,269
-He's not her type.
-What is?

147
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,369
<i>A man who can jam</i>
<i>Dude with a tude</i>

148
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,471
<i>A tower of power</i>
<i>Can rock the shower</i>

149
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,199
-Rock what?
-l gotta work on my rhyming.

150
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,140
<i>This is Cody.</i>
<i>We've known him since...</i>

151
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,974
<i>...forever.</i>
<i>He lives in the neighborhood.</i>

152
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,741
<i>Cody has a big crush</i>
<i>on my sister, Tess.</i>

153
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,648
<i>She's the only one that doesn't know.</i>

154
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,450
Two tickets to the No Doubt concert
next weekend.

155
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,629
My old man worked on their album.
l got backstage passes.

156
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,093
That's so cool! My favorite band.

157
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,165
Good, l was hoping
you might be up for it.

158
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,371
We can't go
without a responsible adult.

159
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,030
-My au pair. She's <i>18</i>.
-She said responsible.

160
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,474
Your au pair used to be a groupie.
Your dad met her on tour.

161
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,150
Tess, let's show 'em how it's done.

162
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,719
Hey, Jules. Hey, <i>K</i>risten.

163
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,224
Who's that?

164
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,625
-Some new kid.
-l heard he's from Holly-weird.

165
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,174
-Don't panic. l've got you!
-Let go of me, college boy, l'm fine.

166
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,919
How would you like it if someone
laughed because you fell in the water?

167
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:43,352
-Well, it was sort of funny.
-Yeah, hilarious.

168
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,197
l heard he goes to a special school
for problem kids.

169
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,034
-Heard he got kicked out.
-He did time at juvie hall.

170
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:02,213
One thing's for sure. He should be
arrested for crimes against fashion.

171
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,682
What is he doing?

172
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,587
That guy probably can't swim a stroke.

173
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,199
You don't even dive
off the high platform...

174
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,461
...and you're our best diver!

175
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,711
Banzai!

176
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,750
l think your reputation's safe.

177
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,959
<i>This is our hangout, Van Gogh's Ear.</i>
<i>Dad took Mom here on their first date.</i>

178
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,225
<i>We came here so often,</i>
<i>Autumn named a sandwich after us.</i>

179
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,036
Autumn! Autumn!
Hi, guess who we brought?

180
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,639
Hi, stranger. We missed you!

181
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,312
Hi, girls.
lt's good to see you.

182
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,446
lt's good to see you too.

183
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,649
Wow, look at this!
The place has not changed at all.

184
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,547
Thank you.

185
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,655
That wasn't a compliment.

186
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,585
Hey, Max, where you been, man?

187
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:26,127
Dude, you look like a fish belly.
You're in need of serious sun.

188
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,131
-l've been busy working.
-Bummer.

189
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,433
Here, let's sit.

190
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,666
-Autumn, my dear?
-Yes?

191
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,935
Still make those famous
ice cream sundaes?

192
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,374
With cookie dough and three spoons!

193
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,278
-And marshmallow sauce.
-And whipped cream?

194
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,042
And nuts?

195
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,948
Dad?

196
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,693
Yeah. Nuts.

197
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,026
Okay, well,
Tyler family special coming up.

198
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,399
This is a great idea, huh?
Get out of the house...

199
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,476
-...see all your friends for a change.
-Sure.

200
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:17,011
Maybe we can ride the roller coaster
at the pier?

201
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,342
l hardly ever throw up anymore.

202
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,719
Except yesterday.

203
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,848
And there's supposed to be
a pretty sunset tonight.

204
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,859
-Do you girls remember your mother?
-Dad.

205
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,989
Of course we do.

206
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,461
No, l mean...

207
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,637
...l mean really remember her?

208
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,503
Remember her laugh?

209
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,171
How her hair smelled?

210
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,077
Just how full of life she was.

211
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:57,350
l remember Mom would make us all drive
to Big Bear just to touch the snow.

212
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,493
l remember she was great
at telling stories.

213
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,423
Especially about San Francisco.

214
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,826
lt'd be fun if we drove up
there some weekend.

215
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,261
What do you say?

216
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,336
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Daddy.

217
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,270
-Oh, here.
-Oh, it's on the house.

218
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,273
Oh! Thanks.

219
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,785
You know, l never liked the nuts.

220
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,463
l always just got them
on my sundae because...

221
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,395
...because your mother did.
l'm sorry.

222
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,867
You girls go ahead and finish up.

223
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,735
l'll meet you at home.
Come right away.

224
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,793
-Tess, you awake?
-You can't sleep either?

225
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,401
Thinking about Mom?

226
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,161
l miss her.

227
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,845
l miss her too.

228
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,641
l think about her every night.

229
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,580
Every day.

230
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,982
There's so much we never
got to talk about.

231
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,125
lf she were here,
she'd know how to help Dad.

232
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,932
-l wish she were here.
-Me too.

233
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,036
What if something happens to Dad?

234
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,799
What? Like he could die of sadness?

235
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,012
You've seen <i>Jerry Springer.</i>
lt happens.

236
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,545
Let's face it, maybe what Dad needs
to cheer him up...

237
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,581
...is a woman.

238
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,955
Sometimes l think you're the smart one.

239
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,352
You just figured that out?

240
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,458
l'm gonna get you.

241
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,736
SWF, 30s, n<i>/</i>s...

242
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,411
...lSO SM, B&B for R&M?

243
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,375
You need a code book to decipher this.

244
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:41,780
lt's easy, single, white female
in her 30s, non-smoker...

245
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,980
...seeks single male, brown hair,
brown eyes, for romance and monogamy.

246
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,026
-Wow, you're good.
-You have to read between the lines.

247
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,824
-Any time they compare--
-My fly girls. How's it going?

248
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,900
-Cody.
-Reading the personals? What's up?

249
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,536
Finding Dad a woman.

250
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,263
Easy. Get him a guitar.
Chicks dig musicians.

251
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,104
Our dad is a famous artist.
He's got enough groupies.

252
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,973
A smart and pretty woman.

253
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,411
lndependent, but still likes
to be taken care of.

254
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,484
You could sit
on an lnternet chat room.

255
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,554
Don't you watch the news?
That's creepy.

256
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,625
You go in for a chat, and you end up
stalked by psycho-people.com.

257
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,159
Dad won't go for it.

258
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:30,096
My dad's company got a billboard
on Sunset to advertise his CD.

259
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,532
Went platinum in one day.
Girls were mobbing him.

260
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,264
-l'm liking this.
-A personal ad on a billboard?

261
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,672
-The whole city would see it.
-Cody, you rock.

262
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,909
-lt's perfect.
-Maximum exposure.

263
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,643
We go in under cover of darkness.

264
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,290
Go, go, go!

265
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,288
Stop.

266
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,429
-Cool, pull out.
-Go, come on.

267
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,632
Stop, stop.

268
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,508
Stay right behind me.

269
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,234
all clear. Go, go, go.

270
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,636
-There's cars coming.
-Don't look down.

271
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,575
Camouflage, part two!

272
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,218
Easy, easy, easy. Take it back up!

273
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,150
Careful.

274
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,660
Wrong house.
The musician lives three doors down.

275
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,128
l'm looking for you, Dad.

276
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,693
Excuse me?

277
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:56,931
l realize it's unorthodox, just showing
up. But l'm no good with letters.

278
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,176
l can't write.

279
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,514
-Dad, what's going on?
-You must be the artists.

280
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,345
l'm the artist. These are my daughters.
Who are you?

281
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,680
Well, l'm interested.

282
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,958
-Cool to the max!
-Right on.

283
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,689
My gosh, Emily, it's working!

284
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,955
Will somebody tell me
what this is all about?

285
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:26,262
The billboard, what else?
Big gestures really get me.

286
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,537
l am completely clueless here.

287
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,841
Somebody better give me the 4<i>1 1</i> ,
and fast.

288
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,081
-You mean he doesn't know about this?
-Girls?

289
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,987
lt's really gonna blow your mind.

290
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,019
-Let's get dressed.
-We'll show you your billboard.

291
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,858
You'll excuse us, won't you?
Girls?

292
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,643
<i>In L.A., people will do anything</i>
<i>to get noticed.</i>

293
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,578
<i>I'm on Sunset Blvd.</i>
<i>with Billboard Dad...</i>

294
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,617
<i>...the man who put a personal ad</i>
<i>on a billboard.</i>

295
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,990
<i>Billboard Dad, is this getting</i>
<i>the results you wanted?</i>

296
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,593
<i>I find the whole thing</i>
<i>a little embarrassing--</i>

297
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,594
Brooke, check this out.
"Billboard Dad."

298
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,064
He put a personal ad
on a billboard over Sunset.

299
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,361
Not interested.

300
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,665
-Are you crazy? He's gorgeous.
-Please. l'm not that shallow.

301
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:41,743
l am! Come on, he's not drooling,
he's not talking to himself.

302
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,314
His knuckles don't drag when he walks.
"Here comes the bride."

303
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:51,113
Only in L.A. are desperation and
insanity a public interest story.

304
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,382
l know, l know. But he's so cute.

305
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,423
lt's like rock, paper, scissors.

306
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,462
Really cute covers desperation
and smashes insanity.

307
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,028
You're the first person l've met whose
mom doesn't worry about her enough.

308
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:12,107
You have to start dating. lt's been
26 months since you got divorced.

309
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,608
26 months? You're counting?

310
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,178
A bookkeeper's job is to count.

311
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:21,351
lf you don't put yourself out there,
you won't meet anyone.

312
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:26,490
l finally have my life together.
l don't need a rebound relationship.

313
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,956
Jack's remarrying.
Look what it's done to our son.

314
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:35,531
So the cheating ex-husband gets
to be happy, but you have to suffer?

315
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:40,068
l'm not suffering.
l don't need a man to make me happy.

316
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,966
Okay.

317
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:47,372
<i>-We're certainly hoping.</i>
<i>-These are your girls? They're twins!</i>

318
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,104
<i>Why did you do this for your father?</i>

319
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,215
<i>He's got a lot to offer a woman.</i>

320
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,181
<i>So we said it for him.</i>
<i>He's the greatest.</i>

321
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:01,324
<i>-From the mouths of babes.</i>
<i>-She called us "babes. "</i>

322
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,153
<i>Forgive her.</i>

323
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,891
<i>And I'm the smart one.</i>

324
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:12,030
Who'd date a man who puts
a personal ad up on a billboard?

325
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,430
l would.

326
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,641
You think Jughead from <i>Archie</i>
has potential.

327
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,571
With a different hat,
is all l'm saying.

328
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:24,043
Billboard Dad has a sense of humor,
and his kids like him.

329
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,773
Listen to you! You're as bad as him.

330
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,885
lf you write a letter,
you're on your own.

331
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,989
Yes, yes, and l'm very, very sorry.

332
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,224
l think we all are.

333
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,826
No, no.

334
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,227
l had no idea they were
planning any of this.

335
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,125
l did see it on the news.

336
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,662
A new one?

337
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,201
Oh, so this isn't a problem?

338
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,503
Don't thank me.
Please, do not thank me.

339
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,375
Me? Well, l have blue eyes.

340
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,108
Great. Goodbye.

341
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,044
Well.

342
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,191
lt seems the billboard company
won't press charges.

343
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,620
Billboard company?

344
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,059
lt seems they love the free publicity.

345
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,560
What publicity?

346
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,064
They'll put up a new billboard.

347
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,601
-They can't take it down!
-What about the women?

348
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,101
What women?

349
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:27,745
Girls, girls. lf l wanted
to go out, which l don't...

350
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,379
...l would find my own date, okay?

351
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,483
And not by putting
a billboard up over Sunset Strip!

352
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,122
Then how?
You hardly ever leave the studio.

353
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,883
You don't hang with your friends.
You never go out.

354
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,460
You don't even do anything
with us anymore!

355
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,261
Now....

356
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,762
Sit. Nobody moves.

357
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,804
l'll get it.

358
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,763
What is going on?

359
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,669
Nigel....

360
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,220
Hey, Mr. Tyler.

361
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,490
Got quite a bit of mail.

362
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,095
-Unbelievable!
-You're a hottie!

363
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:23,961
-Who in the world is this mail for?
-Me.

364
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,361
By the way, l saw you on the news.

365
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,572
Nice job, Tess, Emily.
We're with you.

366
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,606
The news? Nobody asked me
about airtime!

367
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,476
Maxwell, l'm in charge of your PR!

368
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,346
l know what's best for you!

369
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:51,791
-There must be a million letters here.
-Two million.

370
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:58,028
-This one smells romantic.
-This one sent a bribe.

371
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:04,837
-This one sent a picture.
-That's a cat.

372
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:10,173
Oh, my goodness, you're right.
lt was the whiskers that threw me.

373
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,906
You've got to be a little curious.

374
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,120
-Some of these women sound good.
-Yeah?

375
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,379
Look, this one's a doctor.

376
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,287
A concert cellist.

377
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:31,227
And a fashion model.

378
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,834
Come on, just a couple dates. Please?

379
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,765
-Please, Dad? For us?
-Please?

380
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,945
-Please?
-Please, please, please?

381
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,914
all right, l tell you what.
l will go out on three dates.

382
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,087
-Seven.
-Five.

383
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,619
Sold.

384
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,724
Only because l love you two.

385
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,895
After these five dates...

386
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,558
...you will leave me alone.
Understood?

387
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,100
Great. Five dates.
You have your wish.

388
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,898
l hope you're happy.
Any more money, give it to me.

389
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,057
So you come here often?

390
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,488
Pardon me, but you don't look
like you want to be here.

391
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,630
l'm sorry....

392
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,226
lt's been a while since l've been out.

393
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,098
l think l'm just out of practice.

394
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,332
Don't worry, l've had plenty.

395
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,738
lt's always the same story.

396
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:53,885
You ask me to tell you about myself.
l'll pour my heart out.

397
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:58,851
You'll tell me exactly
what l want to hear...

398
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,926
...make me fall
madly in love with you...

399
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,619
...and that's the moment
when you'll dump me.

400
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:10,924
Let's end this charade right now,
before l get hurt...

401
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:15,606
...while l've still got enough Prozac
left from the last jerk.

402
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,934
l'm out of here.

403
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,972
Okay.

404
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,843
Waiter. The check.

405
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,548
Do you have ear wax?
lt's genetic.

406
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:32,189
My entire family has
a terrible problem with it.

407
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,392
Oh wait!
l have a Q-Tip in my purse!

408
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,254
Gotcha!

409
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,860
lt's in here, l swear.

410
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,964
Q-tippie!

411
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,100
Check.

412
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,208
You have lovely eyes.

413
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,487
Thank you.

414
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,993
Waiter, the check.

415
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,423
Have you ever dated
a Parisian woman before?

416
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,396
No.

417
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,197
You're in for a treat, <i>chÃ©ri.</i>

418
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,039
<i>Garcon!</i>

419
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,008
Oh, boy.

420
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,707
Waiter! <i>Garcon.</i>

421
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,242
Make sure you chew it real good.

422
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:39,218
Don't eat too fast, or you'll give
yourself a little tummy ache.

423
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,358
Oh, you need a napkin.

424
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,619
Here you go.

425
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,261
Thank you.

426
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,694
Little cute guy needs a napkin.

427
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,632
Oh, look at that.
He's got a little schmutz.

428
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,271
Oh, he's a cute one!

429
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,532
-He's so cute.
-Yeah, he is.

430
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,241
Waiter!

431
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,413
-He's a cutie.
-l'm gonna sit down now.

432
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,048
-Okey-dokey.
-Okey-dokey.

433
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,815
-We should've made it seven dates.
-You can't give up!

434
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,254
Girls, a deal is a deal.

435
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,354
We have a whole bag full of letters.

436
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,658
There's gotta be someone
in there for you.

437
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,133
lt just didn't work out.

438
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,770
Come on, Tess. Let's go.

439
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,456
Goes in, l go out on a date.

440
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,865
Close, but....
all right, one more.

441
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,006
l will marry this woman.

442
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,279
lt's up...

443
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,652
...and it's bad.

444
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,732
The man never liked dating anyway...

445
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,766
...and that one's bad too.

446
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,599
The pressure's on.

447
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,937
all right, there's
no pressure whatsoever.

448
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,875
Oh....

449
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,310
Oh, boy.

450
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,215
Oh, you're kidding!

451
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:56,851
Wow! Of course l'd like to meet you.
How about tomorrow?

452
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,620
At the art museum? <i>1 1</i> :30?

453
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:03,561
l'll be there. Okay, bye.

454
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:08,963
Guess who's got a date
with Billboard Dad? <i>Moi.</i>

455
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,136
-l'm nervous.
-Don't be nervous.

456
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,472
He had the sense to pick a museum.
Shows class.

457
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,207
-Hey, you're right. He's cultured.
-Yeah, educated.

458
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,818
He's never gonna like me.

459
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,923
Yes, he will. He's gonna love you.

460
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,125
l look okay?

461
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,486
-You look beautiful.
-Not too--

462
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,754
You didn't try too hard,
but you look nice.

463
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,232
This is your day.
Tell me why l'm here.

464
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:43,736
The guy looks fine on TV, but what if
he turns out to be a weirdo?

465
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,303
When l tug my ear--

466
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,637
l know, l pretend to bump into you.
Then what?

467
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,576
l tag along?
This is so high school.

468
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,376
Hey, high school was my best years.

469
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,111
-l'll be your best friend.
-You already are.

470
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,655
Okay, l'll be over there.

471
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,987
lf you need me, just tug.

472
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,536
-Do you mind if l sit here?
-No.

473
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,642
l love Calder.

474
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,446
So do l. His work just
makes me feel like smiling.

475
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,994
l always loved that piece.

476
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,201
l did studies of it
when l was a student.

477
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,030
-Are you an artist?
-Sculptor, actually.

478
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,866
Not that l've ever gotten
any of my work in here yet....

479
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,307
Don't feel bad.
l think you have to be dead.

480
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,543
Dad's talking to that woman.

481
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,310
l'll give that a few years.

482
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,584
-She must be his date.
-She's pretty.

483
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,788
He's laughing.
l think he likes her.

484
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,898
So you say your friend
is here for a date.

485
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,726
That's right.

486
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,465
My best friend actually wrote
that guy on TV, Billboard Dad.

487
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,542
l'm here in case
she needs bailing out.

488
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,237
Oh, yeah. Well, l know how that goes.

489
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,981
Hey, you two were on TV.

490
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,016
Billboard Dad's kids.

491
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,586
-Yeah.
-That's us.

492
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,225
Somebody great on paper,
then you meet them...

493
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,520
...and it's like,
""What planet are you from?""

494
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,391
Especially in this case.

495
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,831
Where's your father? l'm his date.

496
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,698
You're his date?

497
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,437
Then who's he talking to?

498
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:03,273
l'm curious.
Why didn't you answer that?

499
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,177
-What? The billboard?
-Yeah.

500
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,947
Well, because...

501
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:16,282
...love doesn't happen that way.

502
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,725
You don't believe in love
at first sight?

503
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,931
l'm sorry. What did you say?

504
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,571
Dad, we found your date.

505
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,741
-Did you see us?
-l thought you stood me up.

506
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,739
l'm sorry.
l was talking to your friend.

507
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,310
l didn't realize you were waiting.

508
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,142
You're Billboard Dad?

509
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,585
-Max, actually.
-Brooke.

510
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,954
Debbie.

511
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,253
-Debbie. Debbie.
-Debbie.

512
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,591
-You met Emily and Tess.
-Oh, yes.

513
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,796
<i>This could've been</i>
<i>a really weird moment.</i>

514
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,956
<i>We knew Dad liked Brooke.</i>
<i>Debbie knew Brooke liked Dad.</i>

515
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,102
<i>She suggested they</i>
<i>have lunch together.</i>

516
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,932
<i>Talk about a good friend.</i>

517
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,839
-Nice meeting you.
-You too.

518
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,481
-You girls behave yourselves.
-Don't worry, we will.

519
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,352
That's what he thinks.

520
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,788
So l moved from Boston
after optometry school.

521
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,930
l did post-graduate work at Parsons
and my company was born.

522
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,464
-Why glasses?
-My mom used to say:

523
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,658
So far, so good.

524
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,770
""Men don't make passes
at girls in glasses.""

525
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,167
l'll change that.

526
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,833
Well, l can't imagine men
not making passes at you.

527
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,138
l mean, you're very beautiful.

528
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,983
Thank you.

529
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:51,119
-He said she's beautiful.
-She's crushing on him.

530
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:55,985
Let's give them a nudge.
Give me all the money you've got.

531
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,292
No, no! Not that table!

532
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,662
Sit somewhere else!

533
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,631
-Thank you.
-So why sculpting?

534
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,835
l was just so bad at basketball.
Very clumsy young man.

535
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,244
-l don't think we ordered these.
-Compliments of the house.

536
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,849
Well, thank you.

537
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:26,548
-ls he gonna kiss her?
-l don't know, l can't see!

538
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,452
That has to do with you.

539
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,557
For mademoiselle.

540
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,319
How beautiful!

541
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,231
-lt's been taken care of.
-Thank you.

542
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,265
Oh, well. lt's nothing, really.

543
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,872
You're stepping on my foot!

544
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,940
Get your elbow out of my stomach!
l'll fall!

545
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,608
Don't look at me.
My sister's the graceful one.

546
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,718
Girls, hello.

547
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,445
We'll be talking later, won't we?

548
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,593
Hey, down in the seat, both of you.

549
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,229
l don't want to hear
another peep out of you.

550
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,093
They could use a lesson in subtlety.

551
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:15,533
Oh, l don't know. l think being direct
always gets the best results.

552
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,141
Well, in that case...

553
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:23,711
...l'm supposed to wait three days,
but you want to go out with me again?

554
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,747
l mean, just me this time?

555
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,512
l'd really like to get
to know you better, but....

556
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,451
Uh-oh. ""But.""

557
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:41,888
l've rushed into relationships before,
and they've ended badly.

558
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,432
-We'd have to take things slow.
-Sure, slow.

559
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:51,574
We can do slow.
We can go however you'd like.

560
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,370
-So how's Saturday?
-Saturday's good.

561
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:22,969
Hello. You look gorgeous.

562
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,904
-Thank you. You look nice too.
-Thank you.

563
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,543
Shall we?

564
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,452
-There you go.
-Thank you very much.

565
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,121
-So thank you.
-lt was very nice getting to know you.

566
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,652
-My love.
-Thank you.

567
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,860
-lt was fun.
-Yeah.

568
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,698
-There you go.
-That door.

569
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,708
-Good night.
-Good night.

570
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:22,630
-Good night.
-Yeah.

571
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,787
Well, it's about time, Maxwell.

572
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,425
Who is this woman
keeping you from your work?

573
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,755
We're two weeks away from the show!

574
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:59,402
You should be in your studio,
not frolicking with some trollop.

575
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,966
Language! Besides...

576
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,903
...when have l ever let you down?

577
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,772
There will be plenty of pieces
for the new show.

578
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:14,144
This new direction l'm going in
is very exciting.

579
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,843
New? No, no, no!
New is bad.

580
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:23,856
The buyers want to see a sculpture
like the piece that made you famous.

581
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:28,394
Remember that? Stick with
the old stuff. l can sell it.

582
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,465
Oh, posh, Nigel!

583
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:37,372
You could sell igloos to the Eskimos.
We all know this. Besides....

584
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,203
Brooke's encouraging me
to broaden my focus.

585
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,312
And you know something?

586
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,782
So l tell you what, pal, you stick
with the money. That'll be your job.

587
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,615
l want to do my job, my friend.

588
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:58,623
Don't listen to her.
l made you famous, my friend.

589
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,057
Nigel, my friend...

590
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,725
...good night.

591
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:13,007
l'm the one with the massive
credit card debt.

592
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,838
l'm also the one with
the astronomical car payments.

593
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,642
He's in love.
That's wonderful, yeah.

594
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,310
They're trying to ruin me.
Great, thanks.

595
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,492
Wake up!

596
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,466
-Time to hang ten off the long board!
-What time is it?

597
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:45,106
What time? Time to go!
Come on!

598
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,569
He's back!

599
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,880
Let's see what you got.

600
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,826
You're gonna get wet
in a minute, Emily.

601
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,204
Less than a minute.

602
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,206
Watch where you point
that thing, jerk!

603
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:28,340
l got you a tape and shirt
from the No Doubt concert.

604
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,049
Wow, thanks, Cody.
That's awesome!

605
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,617
Everybody, listen up!

606
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:43,356
As you know, the Regional Diving Meet
is coming up at the end of this month.

607
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:50,006
You remember last year, we got robbed
by those snobs from Palos Verdes.

608
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:56,838
This year, we've got a chance to
win back first place, and our dignity.

609
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,073
Let's all work hard to put
a trophy in our case!

610
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,889
They added a new dive.
A reverse pike off the high platform.

611
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,857
Palos Verdes has it.

612
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,532
Well, l'm not great with heights.

613
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,428
But l'll give it a shot.

614
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,432
That's my girl.

615
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,106
-He called you his girl?
-Get over yourself, Emily.

616
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,317
Okay, you can do this.

617
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,026
Just pretend it's like the low dive.

618
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,819
Only higher.

619
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,294
Much higher.
Like Mount Everest higher!

620
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,403
Concentrate, keep your legs together.

621
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,664
Nice, clean entry.

622
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,318
Darn.

623
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,645
We got a couple of weeks.

624
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:15,450
Gonna do that at the regionals?
You'll be in the Losers Hall of Shame.

625
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,321
You think you can do better?
Let's see it.

626
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,495
all right.

627
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,660
Like he can dive.
He's a total spazoid.

628
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,062
Oh, my gosh!

629
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,364
He's gonna hurt himself.

630
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:40,348
Oh, my gosh!
He's better than Tess!

631
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,085
You're on the team!

632
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,915
l don't want to be
on your stupid team.

633
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,820
-That jerk!
-What an idiot!

634
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,054
There are only six spaces on the team.

635
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:58,735
lf he's on, somebody's
gonna get bumped off.

636
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,301
l'm number six.

637
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,604
lt's gonna be me.

638
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,444
Wow! Where'd you find this place?

639
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,675
-l built it.
-You built it?

640
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,888
Designed it.
Supervised the building.

641
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,952
-Why do you have a tractor?
-Forklift, actually.

642
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:29,154
About half the pieces l work on
are pretty large.

643
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,959
Some are upwards of <i>18</i>, 20 feet.

644
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,638
l don't feel like lifting that much...

645
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:39,069
...so a forklift comes in handy.

646
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,769
My son would love to get his hands
on some of these tools.

647
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,642
ls he mechanically inclined?

648
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,685
<i>He tinkers with gears and parts.</i>

649
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,651
<i>Or used to, until he hit</i>
<i>this rebellious stage.</i>

650
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:58,760
l think all kids go through
that ""testing the limits"" thing.

651
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,588
Yeah, l know.

652
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,732
He's upset about his dad
getting remarried.

653
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:08,260
<i>He wants to make a statement</i>
<i>at the wedding.</i>

654
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,032
<i>All right, speaking of statements...</i>

655
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,302
<i>...this is one of my newest pieces.</i>

656
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:21,309
Eavesdropping? Naughty girls.

657
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,019
We're kids.
Nobody tells us anything.

658
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,018
How else can we find out
what's going on?

659
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:32,194
l'll have you know that when
l was a boy, we didn't have intercoms.

660
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:35,559
To find things out,
we had to peek at keyholes...

661
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,031
...and root through trash
just like everyone else.

662
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,204
-Okay, Nigel.
-Whatever.

663
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,745
<i>It's a bit of a departure, the finish.</i>

664
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,419
l love all the movement in it.
lt's great.

665
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,053
<i>-Girls? Come on down.</i>
-Blast it!

666
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,663
<i>Brooke's here for your field trip.</i>

667
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,128
<i>Brooke was great.</i>
<i>She took us to do fun things.</i>

668
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,100
<i>Girl stuff.</i>

669
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,112
-Enjoying yourselves?
-Are you kidding?

670
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,678
When are we gonna meet your son?

671
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,646
Definitely soon.
You'll get along great.

672
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,952
Would a college guy fall in love
with a younger woman?

673
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,350
Much younger.

674
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:39,755
Emily's crushing on our coach.
She almost drooled on his clipboard.

675
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,490
You would too, if you saw him.

676
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,893
He's totally dreamy.

677
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,037
He was on the calendar
""The Men of USC.""

678
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,073
Dreamy is good, but the most
important thing is trust.

679
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,870
Without trust, you have nothing.

680
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,277
-l'd trust Brad with my life.
-Duh! He's a lifeguard.

681
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:04,614
Go ahead, laugh. At least l know
when a guy sends me signals.

682
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:07,613
-What does that mean?
-Figure it out.

683
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,384
l'm going to get my legs waxed.

684
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,597
You don't even have hair on them yet!

685
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:25,670
l'm talking about the production run,
you imbecile!

686
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,901
How long is it going to take you?

687
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,276
Stop complaining or l'll send you
back to where l found you.

688
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,680
At that factory, making lawn gnomes.

689
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,388
Hey, Nige. How's it going?

690
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,420
Who was that on the phone?

691
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,920
Where's your daddy?

692
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,560
-He's with Brooke.
-She's the coolest.

693
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:50,096
He spends all his time with her.
l think they could fall in--

694
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,632
Don't say that!
Not the ""L"" word.

695
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,828
-Don't say it.
-Don't you want him to be happy?

696
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,008
lf your dad gets happy,
his art might change.

697
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,506
lf his art changes,
it won't sell.

698
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,145
And if it doesn't sell, poof!

699
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,677
There goes your
shiny little lifestyles.

700
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,053
Bye, ladies.

701
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:20,055
Shiny lifestyle?
He's driving a Range Rover.

702
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:24,097
And wearing a Rolex.
lt's probably fake.

703
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,839
How about these?

704
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,341
That looks great. Look.

705
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,910
So how's it going
with the billboard hunk?

706
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,047
-Fine.
-You set a date yet?

707
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:43,015
l know rebound relationships.
He falls for the first girl.

708
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,278
Then l find out he's cheating.

709
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,715
So don't go pick out china patterns.

710
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:53,453
Miss Cynic, not every guy
is a cheater like your ex-husband.

711
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:58,293
And you brought up china patterns.
You can admit you like him.

712
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,733
-l don't want to get hurt.
-That doesn't happen every time.

713
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,102
Emily, your food's here.

714
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,790
Guess who's cruising
on his skateboard?

715
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,588
Let's go.

716
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,728
<i>That kid Ryan was such a pain.</i>

717
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,871
<i>He wanted everyone to think</i>
<i>he was a punk.</i>

718
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,836
<i>We'd teach him a lesson.</i>

719
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,168
That's enough, we'll miss him.

720
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,814
-Wow! You two look nice.
-Where we going?

721
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,016
Well, tonight's our
two-month anniversary.

722
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:30,454
Brooke and l are spending
a nice romantic evening alone.

723
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,994
That's cool.
lt's about time you two got romantic.

724
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,461
Do we need to give you
the safe-sex talk?

725
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,398
Emily Danielle!

726
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,634
lt's okay.
My son asked me the same thing.

727
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,105
Compare notes when he comes over.

728
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,608
He's coming over?

729
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,714
lt's his dad's honeymoon,
so l get him.

730
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:56,579
-You'll be with Nigel. lsn't that fun?
-Yeah.

731
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,478
That must be him.
Will you get it?

732
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,611
Oh, my God! Ryan, what happened?

733
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:32,482
-l wiped out on my skateboard.
-Are you okay?

734
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,646
No permanent damage.

735
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,724
Let's get you upstairs and changed.

736
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,589
-Right this way.
-Come on, sweetie.

737
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,297
-How come he didn't tell?
-l don't know.

738
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,959
Have fun, all right?
Come here. Give me a kiss.

739
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:53,141
l'm counting on you two
to make Ryan feel right at home.

740
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,839
-You ready?
-You bet.

741
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,307
Ryan.

742
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,545
Your clothes are in the dryer.
Be good.

743
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,379
We won't be late.

744
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,486
Any problems at all, just...

745
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,657
...well, talk to Nigel.

746
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,091
Pretty cool stereo.
lmpressive.

747
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,267
We have an alarm system.

748
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,100
-Why didn't you tell on us?
-Because l'm not a rat.

749
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,967
Spare us the prison code.

750
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:30,407
You didn't tell because you want to
use this when you really want revenge.

751
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,941
-For a betty, you're not so dumb.
-Don't call me a betty.

752
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,847
What's this about ""growing up
in foster homes""?

753
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:41,022
Are you some kind of
pathological liar?

754
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:42,718
You're right.

755
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:53,595
lf this guy's your dad's agent,
why is he asleep on your chair?

756
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,963
Does he live here?

757
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:58,732
-No. Our dad's his only client.
-Whatever.

758
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,239
Bye, dorks.

759
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,077
Why are you so rude?

760
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,736
You wouldn't understand.

761
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,678
You're perfect people
with this perfect life.

762
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:11,386
-We're not perfect.
-Nobody is.

763
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,612
And our life's not perfect.

764
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:17,054
Like everything you've tried
hasn't worked out?

765
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,224
l can't do a reverse dive.

766
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,762
That's just a stupid dive
in a dumb competition.

767
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,661
Why does it matter that much to you?

768
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:34,607
My mother was a ballerina.
This is as close as l could get.

769
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,982
That's the lamest excuse
l've ever heard.

770
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,244
Just because your father remarried...

771
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,219
...doesn't mean he won't love you.

772
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,354
Who asked you, Munchkin?

773
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,455
-l'm Monster.
-l'm Munchkin.

774
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,164
Whatever. And l'm joining
the diving team after all.

775
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,338
Guess who's off it?

776
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,940
No, no, no! Not polyester!

777
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,080
You're right, honey. He's here.

778
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,688
Hey, what's up?

779
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,126
Just waiting to go home.
Where's my mom?

780
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,556
She's out in the car.

781
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,361
l'll give you both a lift home.

782
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,441
Your mom told me about your dad
getting remarried.

783
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,140
That's got to be a tough one.

784
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,813
-No biggie.
-Yeah.

785
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,640
Well, l'll tell you...

786
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,684
...l've been outnumbered
by women for so long...

787
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,389
...it'd be nice to have a guy around.

788
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,524
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

789
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,850
Let's hit the road.

790
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,673
Careful, you idiot!
l can't afford another broken one.

791
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,145
That's my new BMW you're holding.

792
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,984
What's with the phony
Tyler sculptures?

793
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,953
Who knows how the new stuff will be?

794
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:34,323
lf not for the woman,
he'd be making the stuff that sells.

795
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,861
Don't throw a fit.

796
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,535
Just tell Tyler to dump the chick.
Problem solved.

797
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,728
all this hoopla over this stuff.

798
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,739
Nigel, hi.

799
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,945
-l sat on my glasses.
-Oh, no.

800
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,945
-Max said you could help.
-l'll see what l can do.

801
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:01,982
-Do you think you can save them?
-They're almost not worth repairing.

802
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,489
-How about a new pair?
-Brilliant.

803
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:12,794
Brooke, it's so wonderful to see
Max has found someone.

804
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,665
-Admit it, you're head over heels.
-You caught me. l admit it.

805
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,535
When Max was a student in ltaly,
l discovered him.

806
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,338
-Ever been?
-No, but l'd love to go.

807
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,515
Why not just go?

808
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,514
Rent a house
in the ltalian countryside.

809
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:35,256
-A nice, romantic summer abroad.
-l'd love to rent a house in ltaly.

810
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:39,086
-The kids would want to stay.
-Leave them with me.

811
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:43,425
-For a whole summer?
-lt's a new relationship.

812
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:47,160
lt would be great to spend
some time with Max alone.

813
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,997
lt's not easy with three kids around.

814
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:53,470
Not that l don't love his girls.
They're great.

815
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,940
Ryan is another story.

816
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:59,137
He has to come around in his own time.

817
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,813
Can l make a confession?

818
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:06,182
ln Europe, Max might be inspired
to get some work done.

819
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,725
l know Max hasn't worked much
since we met.

820
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,418
But l put my foot down
and sent him to his studio...

821
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:17,929
...with instructions not to come
out without his new masterpiece.

822
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:23,400
-l don't want him going broke.
-Thank you for making my job easier.

823
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,973
-What do you think?
-Honestly?

824
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,648
-They make you look devious.
-l'll take them.

825
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,850
l'll go get you a case.

826
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,861
Emily, did you borrow my Ugg boots?

827
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:52,364
Nigel's talking to Brooke. lt sounds
like they're moving to ltaly.

828
01:02:52,568 --> 01:02:56,163
-ltaly? Cool!
-Not cool. We're not invited.

829
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,771
<i>I'd love to go to Italy with Max.</i>

830
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:01,533
<i>It'd be great to spend</i>
<i>some time alone.</i>

831
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,441
<i>And the children? You can't</i>
<i>leave them with a stranger.</i>

832
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,706
They're staying with me!

833
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,884
<i>You'd take the kids?</i>

834
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,283
Of course! Would you send them
to boarding school?

835
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,251
<i>Great idea. It's not easy getting</i>
<i>to know each other with three kids.</i>

836
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:24,356
-Max would never agree to that!
<i>-He'll come around in time.</i>

837
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,797
<i>-How much is Max worth?</i>
<i>-That's confidentiall.</i>

838
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:34,032
-l think you're just after his money.
<i>-Okay, you caught me. I admit it.</i>

839
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:38,577
l'm not gonna let him get hurt
by some gold-digger!

840
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:55,523
Ducklets! Why the long faces?

841
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,325
Tell me what's got you so down.

842
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,868
-Don't act all cheery for us.
-We heard you talking with Brooke.

843
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:07,838
Oh, dear. l was hoping
to spare you two the ugly truth.

844
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,807
You're so young and impressionable.

845
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:14,574
-How much did you hear?
-They're moving to Europe?

846
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,378
She's gonna send us
to boarding school.

847
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,088
And she's after his money.

848
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,417
You missed the part
about the three ex-husbands?

849
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,684
Three of them?

850
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,992
How do you think she started
her business?

851
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,098
She's been lying to us.

852
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,429
-We thought she loved Dad.
-She seems terrific.

853
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:39,004
People aren't always
as they appear to be.

854
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:42,075
We can't let her break up
our family!

855
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:46,714
She's gonna hurt Daddy!
We've got to do something.

856
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:52,514
l've got an idea how to get rid
of her, but l'll need your help.

857
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:09,304
Good morning, Max.
l've brought you inspiration.

858
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,802
Nigel, l don't need a model today.

859
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,242
Do a favor for one of my countrymen.

860
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,743
She'll be deported if she
doesn't get work papers.

861
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,347
Make me look good, can't you?

862
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,543
l could do some sketching.

863
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:30,157
l don't want to hear another word
about wasting time.

864
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,487
You're hired, doll. Go get undressed.

865
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,699
There's a robe in the storage room.

866
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,271
Just throw your clothes anywhere.

867
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,809
What's that for, Nigel?

868
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:54,142
-l'm thirsty.
-l'll bet you're thirsty.

869
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,939
You're wanted
at your boyfriend's house.

870
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:23,839
That Max. He promised me he'd
work on his sculpture all day.

871
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,049
He misses you. How cute.

872
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,231
Hello?

873
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,860
Hello?

874
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,995
Thanks a lot.

875
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,963
Anything for Nigel, believe me.

876
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,829
Good.

877
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,772
She looked so crushed. l feel guilty.

878
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,772
She's a gold-digger. We had no choice.

879
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:32,674
lf we did the right thing,
how come l feel crummy?

880
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,615
l should've seen this coming!

881
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:43,018
-Maybe there's some explanation.
-There's an explanation:

882
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:47,491
all men are the same.
They're liars and cheaters.

883
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,130
Those are their good qualities.

884
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,333
What happened?

885
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,035
Billboard Dad turned into a jerk.

886
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,598
l'm sorry, Ryan,
l didn't mean to snap.

887
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,606
l haven't been spending
enough time with you.

888
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:04,677
l know you're bummed about your dad.

889
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,213
l'm gonna make this up to you,
l promise.

890
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:19,418
-Any word from the gold-digger?
-She won't return Dad's calls.

891
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,129
Splendid.

892
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,957
Don't say l don't take care of things.

893
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,294
-We gotta go to our diving meet.
-Yeah.

894
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:50,849
-How's the work coming, Maxwell?
-Fine. Just fine.

895
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:56,288
l've got my tortured soul back!

896
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,537
<i>Diving for Palos Verdes on the</i>
<i>three-meter springboard, Jenny Smith.</i>

897
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,443
<i>Diving for the Squids, Carol Clarke.</i>

898
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:23,413
<i>Squirt them, Squids!</i>
<i>Squirt them, Squids!</i>

899
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,503
This concludes the three-meter
springboard competition.

900
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:40,569
With the score tied,
the five-meter platform...

901
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:45,246
...will determine the championship
between Palos Verdes and the Squids.

902
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:55,717
<i>Now diving for Palos Verdes,</i>
<i>Phil Johnson.</i>

903
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,585
Tess, the entire reputation of our
swim club rests on your shoulders.

904
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:29,222
So relax and have fun!

905
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,984
Easy for him to say.

906
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,797
-Come on, Tess!
-Go, Tess!

907
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,654
Yes!

908
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:10,228
<i>A very good dive.</i>
<i>A little over on the entry...</i>

909
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,900
<i>...but let's wait for the score.</i>

910
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:25,505
With one round left, we're still tied
and that's as good as it gets

911
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,312
Good dive, Tess.

912
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:37,489
-What are you doing? Get your suit on!
-l'm not diving.

913
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,786
What?! Don't play with me.
Of course you are!

914
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:46,725
l can't. l just got a tattoo. lt has
to stay out of water for 4<i>8</i> hours.

915
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,903
-Doctor's orders.
-Great!

916
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,039
Now we're short a diver!

917
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,606
No, you're not. You've got Emily.

918
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,713
-Emily, l need you.
-Me?

919
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,650
You've been looking good lately.

920
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,410
Thanks, Brad, so are you.

921
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:10,889
Emily, get your suit on.
We're all counting on you.

922
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:17,628
For the final dive for the P.V. team,
it's Herman Schleckenberger.

923
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,340
Go for it!

924
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:46,890
<i>The winner will be decided</i>
<i>by Emily Tyler's final dive.</i>

925
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:53,295
<i>She needs a score of at least 22</i>
<i>to win for the Westside Squids.</i>

926
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:32,338
She did it! l think she did it!

927
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:43,346
Emily Tyler wins it for the Squids
on the last dive!

928
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:59,863
-How come you lied so l could dive?
-What makes you think l did?

929
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,340
No tattoo.

930
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:10,972
Congratulations, Emily.
l hear you Squids really doused them!

931
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,879
l didn't see your dad there.

932
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,778
He's bummed because of your mom
and him.

933
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,920
-He shouldn't have cheated on her.
-He didn't!

934
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,784
She shouldn't have lied
about ex-husbands.

935
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,756
-And tried to get his money!
-What are you talking about?

936
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:31,364
My dad's the only ex-husband
she's got. And business is doing great.

937
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,092
She doesn't need your dad's money.

938
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,627
-Nigel.
-Yeah, Nigel.

939
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:40,603
lf anyone's stealing money, it's him.
l'll show you.

940
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:44,810
There you go.

941
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:57,685
l told you. We have to warn your dad.

942
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:01,828
He'll never believe us.
He trusts Nigel too much.

943
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:06,728
-He will if he hears it from Nigel.
-Like that's gonna happen.

944
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,836
Wait, l've got an idea! Come on.

945
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:26,214
<i>We needed Cody's help.</i>
<i>But when I saw him punked out...</i>

946
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:30,755
<i>...I realized he was having</i>
<i>an identity crisis. He was confused.</i>

947
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,156
Cody, what did you do to yourself?

948
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:38,264
l know it's desperate, but l tried
flattery, concert tickets....

949
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,061
lt got me zilch.
Your sister goes for bad boys.

950
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:46,968
lf Tess doesn't get the message
l like her now, l'll become a monk.

951
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,943
Emily, do l look that ridiculous?

952
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,112
l'm Tess.

953
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:55,282
Oh, my gosh! You're--?

954
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,712
l'm dead.

955
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:03,557
Cody, snap out of it!
We need your help!

956
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,157
Anything.

957
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,032
Filthy!

958
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:17,928
Here's the sketch of the sculpture
Dad's working on. Like it?

959
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,167
lt's the most beautiful thing
l've ever seen!

960
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,313
Why don't you go see if you can help
the caterers set up?

961
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:40,820
Meet me at the loading site.
l've seen Max's new work.

962
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,088
Now, you ignoramus!

963
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,397
l need as many copies as you can make.

964
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:51,095
-l can't believe people buy this.
-Believe. l'm gonna be rich!

965
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:56,505
Everyone's gonna want one.
Even people who bought the old ones.

966
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:02,115
l'm going to be so filthy rich
selling Max Tyler's knockoffs...

967
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,683
...l won't need him anymore!

968
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,351
Got it.

969
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,892
lt's great. Different
from his early stuff.

970
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,695
But so refreshing, don't you think?

971
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:26,806
l told Maxwell his public's
ready for a new departure.

972
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,102
He's right.
This new work is so exciting!

973
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:35,339
-l have to have a piece. Let's get one.
-Great!

974
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:39,620
Nigel's rich
Nigel's rolling in the dough

975
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:44,849
<i>And the best part of this little scam</i>
<i>ls no one's going to know</i>

976
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,256
Where is my meal ticket?

977
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,992
lt's his opening.

978
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:59,002
Well, can't be expected
to do everything.

979
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,537
<i>Brooke can't come to the phone now.</i>

980
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:06,339
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone. Thank you.</i>

981
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:10,039
Brooke? Hi. Max again.

982
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:16,224
Still trying to reach you. l've left
messages here and at the store.

983
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,026
Please call me.

984
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:25,266
There you are! Your new work
has your public all abuzz.

985
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,630
-They're crying for a speech.
-Oh, l don't want to.

986
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:34,672
-l don't care if they like it.
-Just come down there with me.

987
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,244
-l'll do all the talking, friend.
-Fine. You do the talking.

988
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,039
You always do.

989
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:59,323
Maxwell Tyler, everyone.

990
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:08,743
Good evening and gracious thanks
for sharing in this evening.

991
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,071
-When Max said he was working...
-Dad, come here!

992
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,748
...l knew it would be wonderful!

993
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:19,113
-So l told him to go for it!
-You've gotta listen to this.

994
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:21,117
-Girls, later.
-But, Dad!

995
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,483
l said later.

996
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,420
We've gotta stop him.
Give me the tape!

997
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:31,996
When l found Max, he was practically
starving on the streets.

998
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,397
But thanks to my artistic guidance...

999
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,269
...he's become a star.

1000
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:42,034
l've been more than an agent,
more than a friend.

1001
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,904
Nigel, give me that!

1002
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,070
ls anyone here buying this baloney?

1003
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:51,547
Wanna hear some straight talk?
Listen to this song. Crank it up!

1004
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,947
What are you--?

1005
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,915
<i>I need as many copies</i>
<i>as you can make</i>

1006
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,855
I'm gonna be rich
Filthy, filthy rich

1007
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:05,431
<i>Selling Max Tyler's knockoffs</i>
<i>Knockoffs, knockoffs!</i>

1008
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,802
-Nigel?
-l did the mix.

1009
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:14,373
-Tell him how you've been forging.
-And selling fakes to these people.

1010
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:18,409
That's ridiculous!
l've been doing no such thing!

1011
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,810
Nigel?

1012
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:28,489
ls this true?

1013
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:33,592
lf you ask me, you should send
the two brats to boarding school.

1014
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,555
Did l say that out loud?

1015
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,729
Yeah, Nigel, you did.

1016
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,960
You don't believe l'd forge
your art for money?

1017
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:45,605
-What l do, l don't do for money.
-Of course not!

1018
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:51,507
-Someone has to look out for you.
-You've been looking out for yourself!

1019
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:56,615
After everything l've done for you,
l'm entitled to a profit!

1020
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,685
You and your rug rats can
eat my skivvies!

1021
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:03,254
Nobody talks about my girls like that.

1022
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,955
You're fired!

1023
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:13,500
And lose the phony accent. Everybody
knows you're from New Jersey.

1024
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,363
My new suit!

1025
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:19,096
Just get away from me. Get away!

1026
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,931
all right, that's it.

1027
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:24,703
Party's over. Everybody go home.

1028
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,811
Come here.

1029
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,444
Give me that.

1030
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:51,461
Daddy, are you gonna be mad
at us forever?

1031
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:56,143
Monster, Munchkin, pull up a seat.
Come on.

1032
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:03,246
-l'm not mad at you.
-You're worse than mad.

1033
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,147
-You're sad.
-We're really sorry.

1034
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:10,552
We messed things up big-time.
Especially for you and Brooke.

1035
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,221
Don't worry about it.

1036
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:17,226
l think Brooke and me, we just...

1037
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:21,730
-...we weren't meant to be.
-Nigel wasn't meant to be.

1038
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,939
Look, l think all of us...

1039
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:29,872
...we have to stop focusing
on what's happened in the past.

1040
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,672
We need a new start.
A fresh beginning. Agreed?

1041
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,078
-Sure, Dad.
-Whatever you say.

1042
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,649
From now on, it's just gonna be
the three of us, our family.

1043
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:47,692
l'll be spending more time with you.
No more distractions or extra people.

1044
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:52,263
Definitely no more girlfriends,
all right?

1045
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:58,034
Just be my two favorites, huh?
Come here.

1046
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:06,642
Now come on. Let's get out of here.

1047
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:10,781
-He really misses Brooke.
-We've gotta do something.

1048
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:22,661
So this is why you dragged me
to the museum.

1049
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:27,227
-Could we talk to you?
-We need to explain something.

1050
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:30,565
Mom, please listen to them.

1051
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,006
all right.

1052
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,075
Dad!

1053
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:41,415
-Where've you been?
-Haven't you seen the news?

1054
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,846
-l don't have time.
<i>-Billboard Dad is at it again!</i>

1055
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:48,955
<i>There's another message,</i>
<i>but this time it's for him!</i>

1056
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:53,285
<i>We don't know who the lady is,</i>
<i>but it pays to advertise.</i>

1057
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:57,828
l thought l told you never to do
something like this again!

1058
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,795
-We didn't do it.
-Honest!

1059
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,299
lf you didn't do it, who did?

1060
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:22,679
So why am l always
the last to know everything?

1061
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:28,895
l figured the only way to get your
attention is with a visual statement.

1062
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:32,624
You certainly are.

1063
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:36,868
Thank you. But l was talking
about the billboard.

1064
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:41,166
-l figure the billboard says it all.
-Well...

1065
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,703
...not everything.

1066
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,059
-And everyone lived happily ever after.
-Even me.

1067
01:25:02,297 --> 01:25:07,325
-Unless you're not sharing something?
-Trust me, you're happy.

1068
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,764
Not that happy.

1069
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,743
l'm happy too. Don't tell anybody.
Happy is bad for my image.

1070
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:21,677
See? Everyone lived
happily ever after.

1071
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,716
Well, almost everyone.

1072
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:33,923
Lovely original artwork here.
Get your lovely original artwork.

1073
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:37,689
Something to hang
over the mantelpiece.

1074
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:43,131
Fascinating dogs playing fascinating
tricks on a fascinating tapestry.

1075
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,100
Lovely original work.

1076
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,141
You look like a woman that needs
a dog over her mantelpiece.
