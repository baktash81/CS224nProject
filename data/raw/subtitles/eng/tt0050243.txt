1
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:05,506
THE CHAPLIN REVUE

2
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:24,799
Consists of three of
Chaplin's early movies:

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,641
A DOG'S LIFE

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,391
SHOULDER ARMS

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,093
THE PILGRIM

6
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:37,305
Three silent comedies

7
00:00:57,643 --> 00:01:00,641
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Charlie Chaplin talking.</i>

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,554
<i>This is Hollywood,
California in 1915</i>

9
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,973
<i>with its sun-kissed oranges
and lemon groves,</i>

10
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,266
<i>before it was visited
by the 3 horsemen of the apocalypse:</i>

11
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,468
<i>Oil, movies and aeronautics,</i>

12
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:14,263
<i>who strolled the earth uprooting
the orange and lemon trees,</i>

13
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:17,310
<i>and in their stead built factories
and motion picture studios.</i>

14
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:19,638
<i>I was one of the offenders.</i>

15
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:21,393
<i>I wanted a studio in a hurry.</i>

16
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,392
<i>In the States,
they do things in a hurry.</i>

17
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:24,882
<i>And, as if by magic, I got it.</i>

18
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,301
<i>This is not Stratford-on-Avon,
Shakespeare's birthplace.</i>

19
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:31,348
<i>Believe it or not,
this is a motion picture studio.</i>

20
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:34,140
<i>Now you see my arrival, that's me.</i>

21
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:36,636
<i>I look much younger there.</i>

22
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,093
<i>That was taken
at least 10 years ago.</i>

23
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,763
<i>Now let me take you backstage.</i>

24
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:44,301
<i>In those days I never worked
with a scenario.</i>

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,925
<i>It started with an idea
and developed on the set.</i>

26
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:59,184
<i>This is Miss Edna Purviance,
my leading lady.</i>

27
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,686
<i>She's put on a little weight during
the building of the studio.</i>

28
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,541
<i>In the next scene,
we ran into trouble.</i>

29
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,725
<i>We must have rehearsed it 50 times.</i>

30
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,227
<i>On the 32nd take the little fellow
became quite a dead weight.</i>

31
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,136
<i>It was very trying on the muscles
of my arms.</i>

32
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:40,181
<i>So now let me take you back
to the good old silent days.</i>

33
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:43,100
<i>There will be no talk,
no realistic sound.</i>

34
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:44,724
<i>I think it would spoil the mood.</i>

35
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,393
<i>I have composed 2 hours of music
which I hope</i>

36
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:52,063
<i>will be more agreeable than the sound
of footsteps on the gravel path.</i>

37
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:55,022
<i>Or a lot of yackety-yak talking
as I'm doing now.</i>

38
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,640
<i>There'll be music and action,
a sort of a comic ballet.</i>

39
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:02,471
<i>And now I shall retire behind
my curtain of silence.</i>

40
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:09,181
A DOG'S LIFE

41
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:15,773
Dawn.

42
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,142
Scraps...
A thoroughbred mongrel.

43
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,483
<i>Wanted! Strong men for
Sewer Work. Bring Recommendation</i>

44
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,234
<i>Men wanted for Brewery</i>

45
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:58,957
A tender spot in the tenderloin.

46
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:38,724
<i>THE GREEN LANTERN</i>

47
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:43,218
<i>NO DOGS ALLOWED</i>

48
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,177
A new singer sings an old song.

49
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:45,775
"If you smile and wink,
they'll buy a drink."

50
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,777
"I'm flirting."

51
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,072
"How about the lady?"

52
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,160
"There are strangers
in our midst."

53
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:15,414
Back to the Green Lantern.

54
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,502
"We will settle down
in the country."

55
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,850
When dreams come true.

56
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,353
<i>The next picture is a comedy
of the First World War.</i>

57
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:03,436
<i>These are actual scenes
of the fighting,</i>

58
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,693
<i>taken from the archives
of the Imperial War Museum.</i>

59
00:37:06,697 --> 00:37:08,523
<i>Fighting was different in those days.</i>

60
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:09,853
<i>They lived in trenches for months,</i>

61
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,649
<i>languishing in dugouts and mud</i>

62
00:37:11,864 --> 00:37:13,487
<i>until the fatal Zero Hour</i>

63
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:16,945
<i>when they went over the top
and captured the enemy's trench.</i>

64
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:18,728
<i>Half of them made it,</i>

65
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:19,948
<i>half of them didn't.</i>

66
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,569
<i>There were no atomic bombs
or guided missiles.</i>

67
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,270
<i>Then, it was only cannons,
bayonets and poison gas.</i>

68
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:29,063
<i>Those were the good old days.</i>

69
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:31,024
<i>So now, Shoulder Arms.</i>

70
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:38,069
SHOULDER ARMS

71
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:54,691
The awkward squad.

72
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,862
"Put those feet in."

73
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,661
Over there.

74
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:30,162
The enemy.

75
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:07,497
A quiet lunch.

76
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:23,919
"Make yourself
at home."

77
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,044
Later.

78
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:14,503
Changing guard.

79
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:19,080
"The password...
<i>'It's wet'.</i>"

80
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:51,294
News from home.

81
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:57,135
"This must be yours."

82
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:40,135
"To the day!"

83
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,227
Bed time.

84
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:05,436
"Stop rocking
the boat!"

85
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:00,887
Morning.

86
00:50:51,776 --> 00:50:54,099
"Over the top in
fifteen minutes!"

87
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:39,611
The captured trench.

88
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,395
13 not so unlucky.

89
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,649
"How did you capture
thirteen?"

90
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,739
"I surrounded them."

91
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,989
Two of a kind.

92
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,659
A call for volunteers.

93
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,243
"You may never return."

94
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:48,415
Within the enemy's lines.

95
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,380
More heroic work.

96
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:01,554
"Me American soldier."

97
01:05:14,322 --> 01:05:17,071
Arrested for aiding the Allies.

98
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,152
The Kaiser visits the front.

99
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,697
"Where's the officer?"

100
01:08:15,498 --> 01:08:17,287
"Don't lie... he's there!"

101
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:35,535
"We will discuss
your case later."

102
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,826
His pal captured again.

103
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:20,752
Prompt action.

104
01:11:26,424 --> 01:11:28,498
"Pay attention to
the war!"

105
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,789
The capture.

106
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:41,509
Word to the Allies.

107
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:55,591
Bringing home the bacon.

108
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:09,923
Peace on earth... good
will to all mankind.

109
01:14:58,436 --> 01:15:01,116
<i>While you're looking at the credits,
I'll tell you about The Pilgrim</i>

110

<i>This is the story of an escaped
convict who steals some clothes,</i>

111
01:15:04,352 --> 01:15:05,810
<i>I won't say what kind.</i>

112
01:15:06,019 --> 01:15:08,473
<i>By a coincidence,
he is mistaken for someone else.</i>

113
01:15:08,686 --> 01:15:11,684
<i>Enough said.
I hope the story will explain itself.</i>

114
01:15:15,395 --> 01:15:19,969
THE PILGRIM

115
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:49,393

The Father.

118
01:16:57,775 --> 01:17:00,311
"He can marry us."

119
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:38,691
Getting located.

120
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:36,990
