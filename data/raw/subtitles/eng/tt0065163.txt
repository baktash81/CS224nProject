1
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,851
Miguel!

2
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,441
Miguel!

3
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,233
Miguel.

4
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,572
Miguel.

5
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,486
Gwangi.

6
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,796
No, no.

7
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,255
Leave it.

8
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,295
He who takes from gwangi,
the evil one, is cursed.

9
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,299
Only by an old woman's tongue.

10
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,761
If he does not go back
to the forbidden valley,

11
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,773
we shall all suffer!

12
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,225
My eyes are blind,
but I see the signs!

13
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:29,267
Keep your superstitions
to yourself!

14
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,404
Fool!

15
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,991
Hah!

16
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,656
One day he will learn
to obey the law of gwangi,

17
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,736
or, like his brother,
he will perish!

18
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,821
Howdy, ma'am.

19
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,154
<i>Pasa, Senorita.</i>

20
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,163
<i>Carry your case, senor'?</i>

21
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,155
Eh, don't bother me, boy.

22
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,157
Don't you need a guide?

23
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,159
No, I don't need a guide.

24
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,621
An interpreter?
No.

25
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,621
You need a horse, senor.

26
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,003
I don't need anything.
Now get lost, comprende?

27
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,132
There is no
money in that, senor.

28
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,468
You want to do something?

29
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,679
If there's money.

30
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,680
Tell me where the arena is.

31
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,352
2 miles away.

32
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,810
2 miles?

33
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,980
You need that horse and a guide.

34
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,980
You're a real hustler, Chico.

35
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,992
I'll bet pappy sends you out

36
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,994
while he takes a siesta.

37
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,986
No, senor.
My papa is dead.

38
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,068
I run my own business.

39
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,084
My name is lope.

40
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,076
OK, lope, you and me

41
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,208
will do some business together.

42
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,205
Now, how about that horse?

43
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,707
10 pesos, senor.

44
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,466
And five more for the saddle.

45
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,432
The first million

46
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,466
is always the toughest, lope.

47
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,111
Woo! Woo!

48
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,475
Eeyah!

49
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,401
Aah!

50
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,434
Yah!

51
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,134
Ladies and gentlemen,

52
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,091
I now have the honor to present

53
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,803
the lovely and talented
star of our show,

54
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,979
riding wonder horse Omar,

55
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,937
Miss T.J. Breckenridge.

56
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,410
Well, I'll be.
Hey, tuck!

57
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,949
Tuck Kirby!
Hi there.

58
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,337
What in the name of Sam hill

59
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,341
brings you around here?

60
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,803
Up to no good.

61
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,853
You don't seem glad
to see me, champ.

62
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,847
Like a dying mule
seeing a vulture.

63
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,310
I'm no vulture...
Bird on the wing, maybe.

64
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,650
Flying to the next quick buck.

65
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,646
Looks like you finally made it.

66
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,648
Yeah, I'm making out alright.

67
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,900
All you care about is yourself.

68
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,242
I still care
about T.J.

69
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,028
You fuss like a mother hen.

70
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,042
Her daddy was my friend.

71
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,414
Somebody's got to protect her

72
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,422
from guys running out like you.

73
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,424
You weren't sorry I left.

74
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,666
Nope.

75
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,747
But it nearly
broke T.J.'s heart.

76
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,422
I hear you're not doing
so good by her, either.

77
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,591
Haven't been enough customers.

78
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,102
We don't need any big shot

79
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,104
telling us about the show.

80
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,096
Why don't you just go back...

81
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,598
Wait a minute.

82
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,350
That's her tune.

83
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,351
That's the grand finale, right?

84
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,443
Well, I'm surprised
you remembered.

85
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,860
Excuse me.
I've got to see this...

86
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,899
For old times' sake,
you understand?

87
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,928
Carlos.

88
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,170
Hurry up with that ramp.

89
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,503
Howdy there, partner.

90
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,963
Ex-partner.

91
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,632
To what do we owe
this unpleasant surprise?

92
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,642
I'm just looking around.

93
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,644
Trouble comes in threes.

94
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,176
I wonder what the next two are.

95
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey, you can't go in there.

96
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,728
Get out!

97
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,728
It's been
a long time, T.J.

98
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,980
Do you want to get killed?

99
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,322
You're the one who's always
trying it out there.

100
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,318
Don't start that.

101
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,990
We are going
to have a quiet talk,

102
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,488
or you'll be across my knee.

103
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,952
Fat chance.

104
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,962
This is T.J.,
remember?

105
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,754
Sure, I remember.

106
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,288
If you don't mind,
I'd like to change.

107
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,882
Well, go on.
Go ahead!

108
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,835
You hesitated before the jump.

109
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,763
Seeing you would upset
your own mother.

110
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,022
You're not pulling
much of a crowd, are you?

111
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,194
In Villarosa, things
will be better.

112
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,654
You sure?

113
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,984
Sure, I'm sure.

114
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,519
Why is that?

115
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,362
What do you care?
You've got your business.

116
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,148
Yep, that's right.
One-man operation.

117
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,953
Sitting in a plushy office,
buying and selling acts

118
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,447
instead of getting
knocked off horses.

119
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,489
It's less risk and more pay.

120
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,503
So mind your own business.

121
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,495
I'm doing just that.

122
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,037
I've got a deal to get you
off the hook here.

123
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,882
If you've got a brain,
you'll take it.

124
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,338
Thanks.

125
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,797
Buffalo bill wants to buy
Omar the wonder horse.

126
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,798
He's offering a good price.

127
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,140
And you get 10%, right?

128
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,676
20.

129
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,229
You're not getting one
thin dime out of me.

130
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,064
And buffalo bill
is not getting Omar.

131
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,730
And you can't come
busting in here

132
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,730
like some hick-town
horse dealer

133
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,652
trying to ruin my show.

134
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,740
People depend on me...
Champ, Carlos, rowdy.

135
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,907
But then you wouldn't know
anything about loyalty,

136
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,032
would you?

137
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,740
This is business.

138
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,332
You play con tricks, and
I'll stick to horse tricks.

139
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,828
Now, beat it!

140
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,461
My, my, you always did look
sweet in a temper.

141
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,591
Get out I said!

142
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,838
I've got hotter irons
in the fire, honey.

143
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,510
Just keep struggling along
leaping off platforms.

144
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,759
Go ahead break your neck
if you want to.

145
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,772
Makes no difference to me.

146
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,104
Good.

147
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,098
Just worried about that horse.

148
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,100
Wouldn't want him hurt.

149
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,862
Ooh!

150
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,690
Excuse me.

151
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,783
Good for you.

152
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:55,002
You should have thrown him
out a long time ago.

153
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,295
I say!
Hello there!

154
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,300
Over here, sir.

155
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,802
Someone you know?

156
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,814
A client of mine.
Professor Bromley.

157
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,806
What's he doing out there?

158
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,806
He digs for old
bones and things.

159
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,400
Hello!

160
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,025
Sounds like he's in trouble.

161
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,697
I say, thank heavens
you came along.

162
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,737
What has happened, professor?

163
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,160
What has happened?

164
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,158
You know very well
what has happened.

165
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,500
Rosita?

166
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,995
Rosita, my mule,
refused to budge.

167
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,998
Then she kicked me.

168
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know where
she's gone now.

169
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,172
Are you hurt?

170
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,170
Well, there are no bones broken,

171
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,512
but it's frightfully painful.

172
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,588
By the way, I don't
believe we've met.

173
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,143
My name's Bromley.

174
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,177
Hi. Name's tuck Kirby.

175
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,270
Hop on. We'll give you
a ride back.

176
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,017
Perhaps lope's mount might be

177
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,110
a little more practical.

178
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,315
Wait!

179
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,358
Whoa.

180
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
My boy.

181
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,279
Come on!

182
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,281
You ought to know better

183
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,333
than to get behind
a stubborn mule, professor.

184
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,997
Your advice comes
a little late, Kirby.

185
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,298
Look, professor. Rosita
has found her way home!

186
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,798
Vicious beast.

187
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,466
Give me your shoulder, lope.

188
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,694
I'd say you could use
a good stiff drink.

189
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,993
You're right.
It's in the trunk.

190
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,541
Lope tells me you're
one of these, uh,

191
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,406
one of these
archaeologist fellows.

192
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,543
He's pretty near the mark.

193
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,090
Actually, I'm a paleontologist.

194
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,085
Oh.
We dig deeper.

195
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,257
It isn't good
to dig up the past.

196
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,176
Let sleeping dogs lie, eh?

197
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,506
We won't get very far that way.

198
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,602
Depends on where
you want to get to.

199
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,887
To the bottom of things.

200
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,561
What Darwin did with
his theory of evolution,

201
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,230
I intend to do with
my theory of humanoids.

202
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Humanoids?

203
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,109
It means manlike.

204
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,238
Paleontologists
generally believe

205
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,065
that man first evolved
about a million years ago.

206
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,911
I'll prove it was
many eons before that.

207
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,948
If you'd like to look
in that trunk,

208
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,082
you'll find a piece of rock.

209
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,079
Will you get it?

210
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,550
That's it?

211
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,850
Now look at the fossil,

212
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,806
the impression left in the rock.

213
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,806
Looks like a footprint.

214
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,638
Precisely.
It's an Eohippus!

215
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,903
50...

216
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,234
Eohippus.
The so-called dawn horse...

217
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,731
The ancestor of our
present day horses.

218
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,743
I never saw a horse small enough

219
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,735
to leave a print like that.

220
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,737
You notice it had three toes?

221
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,789
Through evolution,
horses have grown larger.

222
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,754
That center toe
has become the hoof.

223
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,115
<i>Incredible!</i>

224
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,172
<i>Si, incredible.</i>

225
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,746
What is more incredible
is the fossil beside it.

226
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,591
I'm convinced that is the tibia
of some humanoid

227
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,338
that existed at the same time
as the Eohippus,

228
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,640
possibly more than
50 million years ago.

229
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,104
You found this thing
around here?

230
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,808
In the foothills.

231
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,648
This is my whole life,
Mr. Kirby,

232
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,864
but I need time and money.

233
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:55,275
My resources,
both financial and physical,

234
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,776
are running precariously low.

235
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
Well, professor,

236
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,197
what you need is a good rest.

237
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,199
Yes, Mr. Kirby.

238
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,451
Thank you for your kindness.

239
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,623
Lope.

240
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,008
I'll bet you didn't know

241
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,022
that was your
middle toe, did you?

242
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,903
T.J.

243
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,029
Yeah?

244
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,872
Can I speak to you a moment?

245
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,994
Of course.
In private.

246
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,372
I know.

247
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,671
You want that money
I owe you. Don't worry.

248
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,745
We'll pack them in with
our new attraction.

249
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,000
El Diablo will be successful.

250
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,592
Shh. Quiet.

251
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,587
It's not only money.

252
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,049
What else?

253
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,589
Us together.
You and me and Diablo...

254
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,893
Let's see how it goes.

255
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,434
Hiyah!

256
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
<i>Itoro!</i>

257
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,693
Ha ha ha!

258
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,401
Hiyah! <i>Itoro!</i>

259
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,334
Hi there, hon!

260
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,078
I thought I told you to go.

261
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,461
About that deal.

262
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,127
So go!

263
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,126
I guess you've been
thinking about it.

264
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,876
Nothing is further from
my mind, except you.

265
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,232
<i>Hey, Toro!</i>

266
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,729
<i>Hey, Toro!</i>

267
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,151
<i>Hey, Toro!</i>

268
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Lope!

269
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,446
<i>Hey, Toro!</i>

270
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,452
Hey, hey, <i>Toro!</i>

271
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,480
Tuck!

272
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,408
Darling, are you alright?

273
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,407
Cut it out, tuck,

274
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,372
if you want to get repaired.

275
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,503
It's not easy to keep still

276
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,170
with you hanging
around me like that.

277
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,967
Who was that fellow
who jumped the bull?

278
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,384
Oh, Carlos.

279
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,393
I'm glad he was there.

280
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:11,345
He saved your life.

281
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,478
Why did you walk
out on me, tuck?

282
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,475
I was ready to sell out,

283
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,977
to marry you.

284
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,478
That's all I ever wanted.

285
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,282
I don't know.

286
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,567
I didn't want to.

287
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,571
Getting married
is like being a horse

288
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,583
tied up in a corral.

289
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,325
I never could take
being all roped up.

290
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,254
T.J., you know what?

291
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,420
I just know you're
going to sell me Omar.

292
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,210
Hmm?

293
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,223
That's right.

294
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,215
You've got a deal.

295
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,597
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

296
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,354
Nothing. Anything
for you, baby.

297
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,687
Don't give me that baby stuff.

298
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,734
Carlos brought me a new act.

299
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,438
What kind?

300
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,358
Come to the opening
at Villarosa.

301
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,526
No, no, I mean now.

302
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,821
Alright. I'll
show you tonight.

303
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,782
But first,
the patient must rest,

304
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,792
or he might have a relapse,

305
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,794
and relapses can be fatal.

306
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,996
T.J...

307
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,461
Now lie still.

308
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,877
Doesn't it hurt to move?

309
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,836
Terrible.

310
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,232
Meet El Diablo.

311
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,582
Well, if that don't beat all.

312
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,838
You want a little
sugar, don't you?

313
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,393
Where'd you ever
get this critter?

314
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,175
Carlos found him.

315
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,849
He must have been
in a gold mine.

316
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,849
It took a while to train him,

317
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,851
but he's ready to debut.

318
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,903
What's the act?

319
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,696
We strap a platform
onto Omar's back.

320
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,196
El Diablo waltzes on top.

321
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,199
A horse dancing on horseback.

322
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,502
That's got to be a humdinger.

323
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,918
I can see it all now.

324
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,383
Presenting El Diablo,

325
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,301
the world's one and
only miniature horse.

326
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,512
We are on our way to a fortune.

327
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,897
Amazing.

328
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,733
It's absolutely astounding.

329
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,940
It was those three toes
that started me thinking.

330
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,656
And four on its hind feet.

331
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,488
Great Scott, it could be...

332
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,502
An Eo... what's it?

333
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,704
Hippus.

334
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,039
Eohippus, yes.

335
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,329
Eohippus, if you are one...

336
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,795
What are you doing here
over 50 million years

337
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,546
after you should be extinct?

338
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,348
It could be a freak of nature.

339
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,386
Is there any way to tell?

340
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,058
By checking its origin.

341
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,860
If I could prove
this is the genuine article,

342
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,855
I shall receive a knighthood

343
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,397
for the greatest scientific
discovery of the age.

344
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,535
The greatest scientific
discovery of the age?

345
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,043
T.J. Doesn't know
what she's got.

346
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,787
Sir Horace Bromley.

347
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,378
It'll look great in lights.

348
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,464
Buffalo bill, Barnum & Bailey.

349
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,300
Galileo, Newton, and Bromley...

350
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,926
Or the Ringling brothers...

351
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,934
We'll play one off
against the other,

352
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,966
sell to the highest bidder.

353
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,969
Possibly <i>lord</i> Bromley.

354
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,641
We'd make a killing.

355
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,982
We must find out where this
little horse came from.

356
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,608
Let's find this guy Carlos.

357
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,356
Impossible.

358
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,833
My dear fellow, I have no

359
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,833
commercial interest
in El Diablo.

360
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,285
I'm a scientist.

361
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,285
I don't care what you are.

362
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,617
T.J. Has given away
our secret,

363
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,133
destroying all my dreams.

364
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,835
Be reasonable.

365
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,835
My people do not
understand reason.

366
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,587
That witch Tia Zorina
speaks nonsense

367
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,590
about El Diablo.
They believe it.

368
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,602
You could show us the camp.

369
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,724
You've caused enough
trouble already.

370
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,018
Well, thanks
for your help, Carlos.

371
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,032
What help?
Tia Zorina. Camp.

372
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,355
We can sure find that camp.

373
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,451
How?
Why, lope.

374
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,656
Lope?

375
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,489
Sure. That kid
could find

376
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,491
a needle in a haystack

377
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,793
and sell it for a profit.

378
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,018
<i>Iole!</i>

379
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,314
<i>Iole! Iole!</i>

380
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,091
Madam, I am prepared to pay
a guide handsomely.

381
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,183
To lead you to the
forbidden valley? No!

382
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,520
Not for all the gold
in the world.

383
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,515
What forbidden valley?

384
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,557
From there came
the little horse.

385
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,561
And until he is returned,

386
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,573
a great evil will fall upon us.

387
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,395
Rubbish!

388
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,610
Unless the horse is returned,

389
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:44,201
we shall all suffer
the curse of hell.

390
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,198
Superstitious claptrap.

391
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,620
There's nothing hocus-pocus
about that little horse.

392
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,619
Don't you realize
we've discovered

393
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,881
a living specimen
of the Eohippus?

394
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,924
You mean that thing
really is an Eohippus?

395
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,798
Of course.

396
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,215
Well, naturally we shall
have to prove it

397
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,554
by scientific research.

398
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,550
Well, we aren't getting

399
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,562
any scientific
research done here,

400
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,184
are we, professor?

401
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,359
Uh, if you can't help me,

402
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,913
perhaps I can help you.

403
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,998
If you knew where
the little horse was hidden,

404
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,003
what would you do?

405
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,206
Return it
to the forbidden valley.

406
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,552
Well...

407
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,217
A centavo for your
thoughts, senor.

408
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,020
Oh, hiya, lope.

409
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,603
<i>Limonada, por favor.</i>

410
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,689
You look unhappy, senor.

411
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,685
I've got a problem, lope.

412
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,937
I've been wrestling
with it for hours.

413
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,029
Sometimes it helps
to tell an amigo.

414
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,146
Well, it's like this, amigo.

415
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,284
I made a big discovery
last night,

416
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,371
and if I tell
this friend about it,

417
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,946
she could make a fortune.

418
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,962
But if she makes a fortune,

419
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,544
it might not help me.

420
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,000
I can't figure

421
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,550
why I'm helping her
make a fortune

422
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,054
when I could just be quiet

423
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,836
and make a fortune
myself. Savvy?

424
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,841
I savvy very well.

425
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,853
I can't understand it.

426
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,635
Love.

427
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,058
Love's for Latins.

428
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,226
My mama used to tell me,

429
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,185
"when you help someone you love,

430
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,647
you help yourself."

431
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,187
<i>Here. Limonada.
For free advice.</i>

432
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,742
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

433
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,235
<i>De nada.</i>

434
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,236
You sure know how
to help yourself, lope.

435
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,409
What's the big discovery, senor?

436
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,578
No, no.
You'll want a cut.

437
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,747
Why? I'm doing fine alone.

438
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,746
I see. Widening
your horizons.

439
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,498
Sorry, senor?

440
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,499
You're going on a journey.

441
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,051
With the professor.

442
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,585
With the professor?

443
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,588
I must meet him tonight,

444
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,680
with the mule,
outside the arena.

445
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,717
Well, that's it, amigo.
No more figuring.

446
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,392
I think my friend
needs help right now.

447
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,925
Ha ha ha!

448
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
<i>Ah. Si, Si, Si.</i>

449
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,760
<i>Ivamos!</i>

450
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,491
Come on, come on.

451
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,694
Hey...

452
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,987
Hey, tuck!

453
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,987
Tuck, what's the hurry?

454
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,290
Lope, come here.

455
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,996
We are in luck, Chico.
They've got it.

456
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,014
Kirby, let them go!

457
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,008
Don't be a fool, man!

458
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,430
Come on.
We mustn't lose them.

459
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,807
What happened?

460
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,307
He hit me.

461
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,729
Who?

462
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,187
Your friend Kirby.

463
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,517
What?

464
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,401
I caught him and others
stealing El Diablo.

465
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,859
Stealing? Why,
the dirty...

466
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,320
No, not tuck.

467
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,531
We just saw him
with our own eyes.

468
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,701
He's no good, t.J.

469
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,001
Champ, get bean and rowdy.

470
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,705
You bet.

471
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,206
Whoa!

472
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,841
Look here.

473
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,128
Tuck's got company.

474
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,262
We're headed
in the right direction.

475
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,259
He's working with the professor.

476
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,521
He was speaking
of scientific interests.

477
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,524
Tuck wants El Diablo
for buffalo bill.

478
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,516
You should have listened to me.

479
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,308
He's right, t.J.

480
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,072
That tuck is the lowest.

481
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,443
All right, all right.

482
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,320
He was right.
I was wrong.

483
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,447
If we stand here,
we'll never catch him.

484
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,534
I know where they're heading.

485
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,909
There's a shortcut
to forbidden valley.

486
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,546
Help!

487
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,088
Professor, where
is that little horse?

488
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,592
I don't know.

489
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,553
You don't know?

490
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,274
Alright, sir Horace,
when your king finds out

491
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,765
you're a horse thief,
he'll sure give you

492
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:55,017
a touch of the sword...
There!

493
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,111
Tell me where El Diablo is.

494
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:00,237
You can make it easy
or hard on yourself.

495
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,275
The gypsies took him.

496
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,909
You put them up to it!

497
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,616
Yes, in a way, but
it will benefit us all.

498
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,448
Now, is that a fact?

499
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,663
El Diablo...

500
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,291
Is the property
of t.J. Breckenridge!

501
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,541
I'm protecting her interests.

502
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:19,963
Well, so am I.
Don't you see?

503
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,973
We must follow the gypsy trail

504
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,965
to the forbidden valley

505
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,967
because where
there's one Eohippus,

506
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,969
there must be others.

507
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,561
At least two,
the sire and the mare,

508
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,308
possibly more.

509
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,401
Just think what you
and miss Breckenridge

510
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,437
could do with a dozen Eohippi.

511
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,663
From now on, we're partners?

512
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,156
Oh, no, professor.

513
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,616
As a rule,

514
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,828
I never shake hands
with an anxious man.

515
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,998
I'll join you, but no deals.

516
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,497
Senor Kirby!

517
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,998
Hey. Hi there, lope.

518
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,422
Say, what's the price
of water around here?

519
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,921
One peso.

520
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,342
To you, half.

521
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,141
Okay.

522
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:30,159
Fly, little one.
Fly home to your master.

523
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,510
This circle of mountains,

524
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,559
jagged peaks, steep cliffs...

525
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,563
Could be the perfect barrier

526
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,135
against man and the elements.

527
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,811
No wonder they call it
the forbidden valley.

528
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:02,031
Yes. Might be the answer
to many things.

529
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,073
Like what?

530
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,237
We shall soon see,
Mr. Kirby.

531
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,697
We'll camp here

532
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,577
and start out first thing
in the morning.

533
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,242
What's that?

534
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,495
Quick! The horses!

535
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,455
Where's Rosita?

536
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,171
Senor Kirby.
Professor.

537
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,721
Look.

538
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,726
There's blood all around.

539
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,083
Whoa! Whoa.

540
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,288
Yeah, the gypsies stopped here,

541
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,462
and El Diablo ran off that way.

542
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,511
Senor Kirby! Professor!

543
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,153
Now, how'd they get here?

544
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,567
I was afraid
of something like this.

545
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:27,776
Hey!

546
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,324
Champ, I caught myself
a horse thief.

547
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,740
You don't think I had
anything to do with that?

548
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,121
Look! The Eohippus!

549
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,786
Easy, easy. Stay.

550
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,429
That's no good.

551
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,430
Let's chase him on horseback.

552
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,932
Go get him.

553
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,091
Hey, you need any help?

554
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,587
Not from you.

555
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,550
Oh!

556
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,732
I've got it!

557
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,725
Take your thieving
hands off him.

558
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,187
He's mine.

559
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,817
Whatever you say, t.J.

560
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,816
Tuck Kirby, I could shoot you.

561
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,199
Keep after him, champ!

562
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,387
Hey, we've got him cornered.

563
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,059
The devil we have.

564
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,782
I can see daylight in there.

565
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,775
He must have gone clear through.

566
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,777
That's that, because we're not.

567
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:40,578
Looks like the end of the road.

568
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,238
Opens into another whole
valley through there.

569
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,315
Wide enough for the horses.

570
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,413
Take up the slack easy.

571
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,949
Yeah, yeah. Whoa.

572
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,591
Take her away.

573
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,295
Hyah! Hyah!

574
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,642
OK. That did it.

575
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,935
Come on, boys.

576
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,746
Now, ain't that something?

577
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,461
Man, oh, man.

578
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,554
Hello!

579
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,882
Oh!

580
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,293
Help!

581
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,062
Giddup!

582
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,411
Whoa!

583
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,077
Here, what's this?

584
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,632
I never saw tracks like that.

585
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:27,966
Hey, champ.
Do you see what I see?

586
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,634
Holy..

587
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,472
What's that?

588
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,427
It looks like a plucked ostrich.

589
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,347
Let's get him for the show.

590
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,451
What the...

591
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,834
I'm going to try
and find the others.

592
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,119
Right.

593
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,963
It's hideous.
It's beautiful.

594
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,959
What kind of bird is it?

595
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,511
No bird.
A giant pterodactyl,

596
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,965
a flying reptile.

597
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,385
It's been extinct
for over 50 million years.

598
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,005
Then what's it doing here?

599
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,393
Precisely.

600
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,520
What is it doing here?

601
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,519
Where are the others?

602
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,982
Back there.

603
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,152
Let's get out of here!

604
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,950
Gwangi!

605
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,451
Take off, t.J.

606
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,409
Lope is hurt.

607
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,249
<i>Can you</i> ride? <i>Si, senior.</i>

608
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,865
Come on, professor.

609
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,882
I can't go now.

610
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,884
A big lizard's heading this way.

611
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,416
Now get aboard!

612
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,589
Leave me alone, Mr. Kirby.
I'm not leaving now.

613
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,049
Come on, tuck!

614
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,890
OK, professor.
It's your funeral.

615
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,892
<i>Kerr“</i>

616
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,648
great Scott.

617
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,691
I see what you mean,
Mr. Kirby.

618
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,217
Oh, by George.

619
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,810
A Styracosaurus.

620
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,697
Whoa!

621
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,832
Alright, champ.
Take a look.

622
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,882
Hyah.

623
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,512
Hey.

624
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,654
Okay up here.

625
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,606
Room for the horses
and everything.

626
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,606
Let's get up there.

627
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,608
What about the professor?

628
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,990
Nothing we can do.
Just hope he's alive.

629
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,303
Rowdy, you must be plumb loco.

630
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,891
Now what did I do?
Come here.

631
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,596
These cartridges are the blanks
we use in the show.

632
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,439
No wonder the rifles
didn't do any good.

633
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,895
How was I to know?

634
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,896
Hey, forget it.

635
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,898
Here. Maybe we
can use these.

636
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,150
Can you cut that into a spear?

637
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,281
I don't take orders
from no horse thief.

638
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,371
Now tell me.

639
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,909
Just what do you mean,
"horse thief"?

640
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,333
Break it up!
That's enough.

641
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,343
We'll settle this later.

642
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,335
No. We'll settle
it now. Lope.

643
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:45,797
It was the professor
and the gypsies.

644
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,139
Carlos said you did it.

645
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,390
Carlos.

646
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,929
You never did bring
anything but trouble to t.J.

647
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,523
Alright.

648
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:00,978
Stop it. Where do you think
you are? Civilization?

649
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,691
We've got to stick together
until we get out of this.

650
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,859
In all my travels,
I never saw nothing

651
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,873
like that
2-ton lizard.

652
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,865
If we could just
get him back alive.

653
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,117
The only thing I'm
getting back alive is me.

654
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,621
That does it.

655
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,796
Why aren't you in the cave?

656
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,377
You want to get yourself killed?

657
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,393
Not anymore.

658
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,385
What's that for?

659
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,637
That's a trap...

660
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,639
In case one
of those little lizards

661
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,311
decides to mosey up this way.

662
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,310
A hole in the ground

663
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,322
could swallow me up, too.

664
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,324
Can't tell a friend
from an enemy.

665
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,646
Cockeyed female.

666
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,834
Don't they sleep nights?

667
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,663
Come on, come on!

668
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,879
It's gone.

669
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,430
Yeah, temporarily.

670
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,545
Tuck, I've decided.
I'm going to sell out.

671
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,603
Great, if we ever
get back to Omar.

672
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:19,306
Not just Omar. The whole show...
Lock, stock, and barrel.

673
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,015
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

674
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,271
Well, sure. Sure.

675
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,534
Oh, sound happier.

676
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,776
I don't know, t.J.

677
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,778
I've been on my own so long...

678
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,530
I've been on my own, too.

679
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,543
But not like me.
I mean really on my own.

680
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:42,246
I had to con my way
to where I am.

681
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:46,915
Tuck, I don't care.
Don't you understand?

682
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,882
Alright.

683
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,553
Alright, t.J.

684
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,602
I'll tell you.

685
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,226
I've been looking for something
all of my life.

686
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,603
Yes.

687
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,600
It took a lot of finding,

688
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,942
but I've finally found it.

689
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,937
The most beautiful,

690
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,149
Goldarnedest ranch you ever saw.

691
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Ranch?

692
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,324
Yeah. In Wyoming.

693
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,160
Don't you see?

694
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:16,325
We could both sell out,
buy the place,

695
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:19,325
raise lots of cattle and horses.

696
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,996
And kids, maybe?

697
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,464
Yeah.

698
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,628
You... Talking
about settling down?

699
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,507
Sure you can make it, tuck?

700
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,925
Well, I won't know
till I give it a try,

701
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,045
will I?

702
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,194
Bean! Rowdy!
Bring torches!

703
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,768
It worked!

704
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,843
I say up there.
Watch your step.

705
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,797
There seems to be
a bit of a drop here.

706
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,686
I need some water
before we set out.

707
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,532
Be right back.

708
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,114
You shouldn't have
let him go alone.

709
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,654
His idea.

710
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,962
Whoa, whoa.

711
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,296
Ho!

712
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,728
Come on!

713
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,112
Hey, rowdy!

714
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,126
The Spears!
Get the Spears!

715
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,757
Ha!

716
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,125
Ha!

717
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,761
Heeya!

718
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,139
Ya! Ya!

719
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,214
Get the horses.

720
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,247
Bean, rowdy, saddle up.

721
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:53,692
Come on, giddup!

722
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,725
Heeya!

723
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,352
Got him!

724
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,558
Look out!

725
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,284
Rowdy, the other side!

726
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,866
Pull on the rope!
Come on!

727
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,417
Pull it!
Pull that rope!

728
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,303
Go on!
Get clear! Get clear!

729
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,618
Pull that rope!

730
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,329
Get clear!

731
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,966
Pull on that rope!
Hold him!

732
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,387
Hold him!

733
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,428
Get another rope on him!

734
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,490
Pull on the rope!
Hold him!

735
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,325
Another rope should do it!

736
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,801
Hold it steady!

737
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,264
Hold him!

738
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,384
Hold him!

739
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:40,153
They've got him, professor!
They've got him!

740
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,395
Heeya!

741
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,708
Steady now! Steady!

742
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,590
Keep the ropes tight!

743
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:09,125
Keep them tight!

744
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,090
Come on, professor!

745
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,243
Pull the ropes!
Keep them tight!

746
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,768
Alright, clear out!
Let go!

747
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,478
Rowdy, come on!

748
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,487
Steady those horses!

749
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,917
We can't get through!

750
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,533
Keep those horses steady!

751
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,706
Champ, Carlos!

752
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,059
We can't get through here!

753
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,138
Go back for the professor!

754
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,963
There's no way through!

755
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,957
There's no way through!

756
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:53,169
We've got to go back!

757
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,963
Aah!

758
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,628
Aah!

759
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,965
Aah!

760
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,885
Aah!

761
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,817
Aah!

762
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,116
Whoa.

763
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,792
Ha ha ha!

764
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,713
We're going to lug
this critter back alive.

765
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,723
T.J., honey,
you're going to have

766
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,755
the greatest main attraction
that any circus...

767
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,345
What's the matter?

768
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,774
Where's Carlos?

769
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,533
Champ!

770
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,158
Ho!

771
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,125
It is as I foretold.

772
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,589
Gwangi has killed Carlos,

773
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,718
just as he killed
his brother Miguel.

774
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,718
Well, how did you know that?

775
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,770
In a dream, I saw It...

776
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,773
The great jaws snapping,
the riderless horse.

777
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,686
He was doomed.

778
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,555
So will you be doomed,
all of you,

779
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,073
unless the evil one is set free.

780
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,105
Balderdash, my good woman.

781
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:09,609
Balderdash.

782
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,030
He's no more evil
than an alligator.

783
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,369
The only thing
that's evil are his jaws.

784
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:16,866
Spell?

785
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,788
He can cast no spells.

786
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,917
Come on.
Let's move out.

787
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,760
Defy the law and perish!

788
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,837
[

789
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:21,353
in the name of science,

790
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,769
I beg you to think again.

791
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,688
We've got a show to do.

792
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,187
A show?

793
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,649
A show?

794
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,649
It's disgraceful
to think of putting

795
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,651
this fabulous
creature on display

796
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,663
in a cheap circus.

797
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,985
Gwangi is our property.

798
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,370
He belongs to us all,
to scientific research!

799
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,366
Easy, professor.

800
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,870
Do your research

801
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,041
while you follow us
on our world tour.

802
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,959
You must be mad, raving mad.

803
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:53,632
We'll see what the royal society

804
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,471
has to say about this!

805
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,468
What's all this
about a world tour?

806
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,470
I've got it all figured out.

807
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,732
We play London,
Paris, Madrid, and...

808
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,394
You're forgetting
something, aren't you?

809
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,404
Oh, yes. New York.

810
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,566
No. Wyoming.
That ranch.

811
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,565
We talked about it, remember?

812
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,567
Yes, but that was before.

813
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:17,409
T.J., this show
was going to be it.

814
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:21,735
I helped so that all
of you could get paid of

815
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,832
from a show that's worth buying.

816
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:26,998
But now it's worth saving.

817
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,538
We can do the tour,
then buy the ranch.

818
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:32,342
We can't.
Not us. Not now.

819
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,256
Same old tuck.

820
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:37,425
Oh, no. Not
the same old tuck,

821
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,755
but a new kind of t.J.,

822
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,510
suddenly all caught up
in the world of glitter.

823
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,603
Leave me out.
That dreamboat's on the rocks.

824
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:47,599
As you like.

825
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,732
"As you like"?

826
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,728
Well, that's it.

827
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,242
I guess it is.

828
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,870
Figures.

829
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,874
Well, I'm sorry for you, hon,

830
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,906
because you're heading
for a place I just left.

831
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,751
You won't like it much.

832
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,626
Senorita, you must
go after Mr. Kirby.

833
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,631
He's a very proud man,

834
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,263
and he'll never come back.

835
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,477
Tuck!

836
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:34,596
[

837
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,399
back! Back!

838
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,400
Quiet him down!
Quiet him down!

839
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,412
I'm doing the best I can!

840
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,874
Back! Back!

841
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,999
Pedro, ready with
that fanfare music.

842
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,075
<i>Si, senor.</i>

843
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,249
Stand by, boys.

844
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,250
When that goes up,

845
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,132
you'll get the picture
of your lives.

846
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,437
Ladies and gentlemen!

847
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,404
I have the honor

848
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:26,489
to make the most
important announcement of this...

849
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,992
To make the most
important announcement

850
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,003
of the era!

851
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:38,285
What you are about to see

852
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,000
has never been
seen before! I repeat!

853
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:45,591
Has never been seen before
by human eyes!

854
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:50,299
Captured and brought back alive
by miss t.J. Breckenridge...

855
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,346
Aah!

856
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:57,345
Let her rip, boys.

857
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,396
Gwangi the great,

858
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:08,109
living wonder
of the prehistoric era!

859
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,962
Get that curtain down!
Can you get it down?

860
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,036
Stop him!

861
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,627
Hey, what's happening!
No, you're supposed to play!

862
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,419
Champ, what's happened?

863
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,964
Gwangi's loose!

864
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,088
Well, get some rifles!

865
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,364
Aah!

866
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,704
Aah!

867
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,400
Hey! Hey!

868
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,994
Heeya!

869
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:50,326
Heeya!

870
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,171
The doors!
The doors!

871
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:12,267
Lope!

872
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,364
Get in there!

873
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,293
Quick!
Out the back way!

874
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,417
I'll lock him in!

875
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,153
This door's barred
from the inside!

876
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:26,488
The other is, too!

877
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,299
Ya!

878
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,088
Hiyah!

879
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,239
Hey!

880
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,450
Ha!

881
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:20,212
Ha!

882
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,578
Come on!

883
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,584
Move!
