1
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,641
Let's sort the buyers
from the spiers...

2
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,142
the needy from the greedy...

3
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:48,940
and those who trust me
from the ones who don't...

4
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,140
because if you can't see
value here today...

5
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,614
you're not up here shopping.

6
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,116
You're up here shoplifting.

7
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,618
You see these goods?

8
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:58,120
Never seen daylight,
moonlight, Israelite...

9
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,622
Fanny by the gaslight.

10
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,180
Take a bag.

11
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:03,386
I took a bag home last night.

12
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,759
Cost me a lot more
than ten pound, I can tell you.

13
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,821
Anyone like jewelry?
Look at that one.

14
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,765
Handmade in Italy,
hand-stolen in Stepney.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,267
It's as long as my arm.

16
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,292
I wish it was as long
as something else.

17
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:16,306
Don't think because these boxes
are sealed up, they're empty.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,808
The only man who sells
empty boxes is the undertaker...

19
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,469
and by the look of you lot...

20
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,309
I'd make more money
with me measuring tape.

21
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:24,814
One price. Ten pound.

22
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,907
- Did you say ten pound?
- Are you deaf?

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,440
That's a bargain. I'll take one.

24
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,453
Squeeze in if you can.
Left leg, right leg...

25
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:32,148
your body will follow.
They call it walking.

26
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,656
You want one as well, darling?

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,180
That's it. They're waking up.

28
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,453
Treat the wife.

29
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:37,721
Treat somebody else's wife.

30
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,127
It's a lot more fun
if you don't get caught.

31
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,995
Hold on. You want one as well?

32
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,363
Show me a bit of life, then.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,527
It's no good standing out there
like one o'clock half-struck.

34
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,196
Buy them. You better buy them.

35
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,568
These are not stolen.

36
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:51,130
They just haven't been paid for,
and we can't get them again.

37
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,301
They've changed
the bloody locks.

38
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:53,468
Here. One for you.

39
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,876
It's no good coming back later
when I've sold out.

40
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,642
"Too late, too late"
will be the cry...

41
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,546
when the man with the bargains
has passed you by.

42
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,483
If you've got no money
on you now...

43
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:03,486
you'll be crying tears
as big as October cabbages.

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,852
Bacon, cozzers!

45
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,714
Shit.

46
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,484
So I said I'm on the roam

47
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,087
So I need a car

48
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,066
And I know
that I'm getting alive

49
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:20,195
And I say I got faith
and a season

50
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,534
And I say that's
where I'm going to...

51
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:24,564
Ed can hustle
a few quid here and there...

52
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:28,009
but his real talent lies in
cards and gambling with cards.

53
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,341
Bacon could see that his days...

54
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:36,352
of selling moody goods
on street corners are numbered.

55
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:39,878
It's time to move on,
and he knows it.

56
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,934
So I said I'm on the roam

57
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,526
So I need a car

58
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,972
And I know
that I'm staying alive

59
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:56,007
And I know
that I'm staying alive

60
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,505
And I know
that my faith is in season

61
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,974
And I say...

62
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,909
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,206
I'm bloody skinny, pal.

64
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,213
Yeah. Of course you are.
All right?

65
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:06,714
Nick the Greek,
always a pleasure.

66
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:08,216
Tom, what have you been eating?

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,717
I've been telling him this.

68
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:13,244
Enough, already!
You two, join me in my office.

69
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,322
So how much is it, Tom?

70
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,556
You know how much it is, Nick.

71
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:22,564
That includes the amp?

72
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:25,396
No, that does not
include the amp.

73
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,328
Shit, Tom.
I thought it included the amp.

74
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,599
Well, it doesn't.

75
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:31,799
I'll throw in
one of these telephones...

76
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,366
but it does not
include the amp.

77
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,674
Very nice.

78
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,509
I hope it includes the speakers.

79
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:41,243
It doesn't include the speakers,
it doesn't include the amp...

80
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:42,910
and it's not supposed
to include me...

81
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:44,817
getting the hump
with your stupid questions.

82
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,685
Now, you want it, Nick,
you buy it.

83
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,314
What else do I get with it?

84
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:51,520
A gold-plated Rolls-Royce,
as long as you pay for it.

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,994
Don't know, Tom.
Seems expensive.

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,488
Seems. Well, this seems to be
a waste of my time.

87
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,501
That is nine hundred nicker
in any shop...

88
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:01,127
you're lucky enough
to find one in...

89
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,865
and you're complaining
about two hundred.

90
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:04,805
What school of finance
did you study?

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,808
It's a deal. It's a steal.

92
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,436
It's sale
of the fucking century.

93
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:12,174
In fact, fuck it, Nick.
I think I'll keep it.

94
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,876
All right, all right.
Keep your alans on.

95
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,321
Here's a ton.

96
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:21,823
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ!

97
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:24,325
You could choke
a dozen donkeys on that.

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,328
And you're haggling
over one hundred pound.

99
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,796
What do you do when you're not
buying stereos, Nick...

100
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,298
finance revolutions?

101
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,232
One hundred pounds
is still one hundred pounds.

102
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,668
Not when the price is
two hundred pounds, it's not.

103
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:36,170
And certainly not
when you've got...

104
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,729
Liberia's deficit
in your sky-rocket.

105
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:40,207
Tighter than a duck's butt,
you are.

106
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,938
Come on. Let me feel
the fiber of your fabric.

107
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,108
The skinny one is Tom...

108
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,118
and he's the entrepreneur
of the bunch.

109
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:52,120
He's got a couple
of dirty little fingers...

110
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,122
in a couple of dirty
little pies.

111
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,624
Nick here, however,
has made it his business...

112
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,628
to have all twenty
fat little fingers and toes...

113
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:02,062
in every dirty bent
and stolen pie in London.

114
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,565
Between the two of them...

115
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,090
there ain't much
you can't get ahold of.

116
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,806
That's my twenty-five grand.
It's all there.

117
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,309
It took me a long time
to earn that...

118
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:15,810
so you treat it with respect.

119
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:17,836
What about the chef?

120
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:35,563
What have you come as?

121
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,065
Cupid, stupid.

122
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,557
That's the last time I'm getting
any more fruit off of you, Tom.

123
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:42,070
Do you call that fresh?

124
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:44,664
There was more small hairy
armored things in your fruit...

125
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:46,106
then there was fruit.

126
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,133
You should open a butcher's,
not a grocer's.

127
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:50,077
If you will order stuff
from Katmandu...

128
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:53,445
don't be surprised if it picks
up a few tourists en route.

129
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:56,042
Anyway, enough about that.
Where's the money?

130
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,952
Oi! Keep your fingers
out of my soup.

131
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,888
Soap is called "Soap"...

132
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,891
because he likes
to keep his hands clean...

133
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,187
of any unlawful behavior.

134
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:07,354
He's proud of his job and even
more proud that it's legal.

135
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:10,729
He represents the more
sensible side of the four.

136
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:16,632
You sure you can
afford twenty-five?

137
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:18,299
That depends
on how you look at it.

138
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,605
I can afford it
as long as I see it again.

139
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,579
Got the rest
from the fat man and Bacon?

140
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:26,581
Fat man, Bacon, and myself.

141
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:29,584
Looks like it's time
to make that call to Harry.

142
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,677
Who's this fat man, then, eh?

143
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,880
Eh?

144
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,188
Do you want a sandwich, Bacon?

145
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:41,294
It's not easy to take a seat...

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,797
at this card table.

147
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,800
The amount of money involved
has to be 100 grand upwards...

148
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,802
and there's no shortage
of punters.

149
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:50,805
The man who decides
whether you can play or not...

150
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,306
is this man... Harry...

151
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:56,573
or as some, including himself,
like to call him... Hatchet Harry.

152
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:57,977
You got it all?

153
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,916
One hundred grand.

154
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:04,784
Well, if you got it,
you got it.

155
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,515
Now, if you don't mind...

156
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:10,851
What's this Eddie like, then?

157
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,955
He's a fucking thief.

158
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,964
Harry has a colleague...

159
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,057
a monster of a man...
Barry the Baptist.

160
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,069
The Baptist got his name
by drowning people for Hatchet.

161
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,661
Are you going to fucking pay?

162
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,572
Yeah, I'll pay. I said I'll pay.
Aah!

163
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,576
Barry makes sure...

164
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,670
the administrative side of
the business runs harmoniously.

165
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:32,943
The boy's got a rare ability.

166
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:35,212
He seems to make cards
transparent.

167
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,015
All right. All right.
So we can say he's good.

168
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:40,851
Oh, no.
He's better than good.

169
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,914
He's a fucking liability.

170
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,756
Here, hold on.
What do you think of these?

171
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:47,261
We're selling hundreds.

172
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,763
Very nice, Harry.

173
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,697
What's it for?

174
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,327
Oh, don't play innocent
with me, Bazza.

175
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:54,529
Spanking.

176
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,437
Twenty-five from me,
Tom, Soap, and yourself.

177
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,776
It's a hundred grand
to the pound.

178
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:41,282
So why the fuck
are you counting it?

179
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:42,784
Because I like to.

180
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,777
A reasonable return should
be in the region of 120 grand.

181
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:49,882
That's for 25 grand invested,
going on previous experience.

182
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:51,358
Going on optimism.

183
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:52,758
Whatever it's going on,
it should be enough...

184
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:54,786
to send you on a cooking course.

185
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,491
You're not funny, Tom.

186
00:08:56,532 --> 00:09:00,229
You're fat and look as though
you should be, but you're not.

187
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,736
Fat? Who are you calling...

188
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,238
Jesus!
It's good in here, isn't it?

189
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:05,740
Handy for the tube,
great electrics.

190
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,742
I can see why you moved in.

191
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:10,745
Don't knock it.
It's "cheap," like the budgie.

192
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,237
Nobody wants to live next
to the people we live next to.

193
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:16,251
A bit antisocial,
to say the least.

194
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,752
What do you mean?

195
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,413
He means
they're thieving bastards.

196
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,947
I mean, when they're not
picking peanuts out of poop...

197
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:26,552
they rip off unfortunate souls
of their hard-earned drugs.

198
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:30,855
Not exactly thick, these walls.

199
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,694
Nice work.
Get yourself a drink.

200
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:42,043
Is that it?

201
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:45,046
How many times do I
have to tell you, Plank?

202
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,048
You find us a job worth doing...

203
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,549
you'll find your share
improving.

204
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,552
Have you got
a problem with that?

205
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:51,951
Charlie?

206
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,891
Police and thieves in the street

207
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:57,483
Police and thieves in the street

208
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,357
Fighting the nation with their

209
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,868
Guns and ammunition

210
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:09,370
You know, Charles,
this gear is getting heavier.

211
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,431
I've a strong suspicion
we should have been...

212
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,103
rocket scientists...

213
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:19,979
or Nobel Peace Prize winners
or something.

214
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,312
Peace Prize?

215
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,046
Ooh. Be lucky to find
your penis for a piss...

216
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,077
the amount you keep smoking.

217
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:33,617
Who the hell's that?

218
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,303
All right, Willie?

219
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,435
Does it look like I'm all right?
Take this.

220
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:52,436
I'm in danger of breaking sweat
at any second.

221
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,541
Charles,
why have we got that cage?

222
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,212
Uh, security?

223
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,050
That's right.

224
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:02,022
That's right. Security.

225
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:04,025
So what's the point
in having it...

226
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,721
if we're not going to
fucking use it?

227
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:09,560
I would have used it,
Winston, but this is Willie...

228
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,031
and Willie lives here.

229
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,332
Yes, Charles, but you
didn't know it was Willie...

230
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,300
Yes, Charles, but you
didn't know it was Willie...

231
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,097
until you opened the door,
did you?

232
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,568
Chill, Winston.

233
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:20,572
It's me. Charlie knows it's me.

234
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,597
What's the problem?

235
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,668
The problem is, Willie,
that Charles and yourself...

236
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,409
are not the quickest of cats
at the best of times...

237
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,681
so just do as I say and keep
the fucking cage locked!

238
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:36,655
What is that?

239
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,883
That's Gloria.

240
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,892
Yes, I know that's Gloria.

241
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,086
What's that?

242
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:44,458
Uh, fertilizer.

243
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:47,660
You went out six hours ago
to buy a money counter...

244
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,964
and you come back
with a semiconscious Gloria...

245
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,902
and a bag of fertilizer.

246
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:55,066
Alarm bells are ringing, Willie.

247
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,575
We need fertilizer.

248
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,271
Mm-hmm.
We also need a money counter.

249
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:01,337
This money's got to be out
by Thursday.

250
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,508
I'm buggered
if I'm going to count it.

251
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,950
Oh, and if you do have to
buy sodding fertilizer...

252
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,682
could you just be
a little more subtle?

253
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:11,790
What do you mean?

254
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:17,119
We grow copious amounts
of ganja, yeah?

255
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:18,630
Yeah.

256
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:23,294
You're carrying a wasted girl
and a bag of fertilizer.

257
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:27,295
You don't look like your average
horti-fucking-culturalist.

258
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,331
That's what I mean, Willie.

259
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:33,276
One, two, get down

260
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,242
Paid the cost to be the boss

261
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,383
Paid the cost to be the boss

262
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,752
I paid the cost to be the boss

263
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,157
Look at me...

264
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,667
How long has he been
in there, son?

265
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,362
About twenty minutes.

266
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,572
He's on his own?

267
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,598
Yeah. Just carrying a bag.

268
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,841
Let's pay him a little visit,
then, shall we?

269
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,177
See a bad mother

270
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:14,853
Big Chris
settles debts for Harry.

271
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:18,823
The only thing he cares more
about than an unsettled debt...

272
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:22,055
is his son and heir,
Little Chris.

273
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,857
Look at me

274
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,625
Know what you see?

275
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,498
See a bad mother

276
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:34,899
Shh!

277
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:41,039
This is one of them
high-powered jobs, isn't it?

278
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,071
Ohh!

279
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,413
Some bad news for you, John.

280
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,214
What the fuck?

281
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:50,188
You mind your language
in front of the boy.

282
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:52,589
Jesus Christ!

283
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,923
That includes blasphemy as well.

284
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,451
Now, tell me, John...

285
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:59,260
how can you be concentrating
on improving this lovely tan...

286
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,698
and it is a lovely tan,
by the way...

287
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:04,760
when you've got more
pressing priorities at hand?

288
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,999
Tell Harry...

289
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,007
I mean Mr. Harry...

290
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,874
I've been busy.
I'm nearly there.

291
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,776
Check his locker, son.

292
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,111
I don't suppose
there's any chance of you...

293
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,343
lifting this sun bed up, Chris,
is there?

294
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:23,051
He's not poor.

295
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,820
He's got over a monkey here,
and that's just in his wallet.

296
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:29,157
Fucking hell, John...

297
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,663
you always walk around
with that in your pocket?

298
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:34,461
Use language like that again,
you'll wish you hadn't.

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,797
Sorry, Dad.

300
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,201
Right. Put the rest
of the stuff in that.

301
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:42,730
You can go home
in a plastic bag tonight, John.

302
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,242
You owe what you owe...

303
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:46,609
and by the time
this tan's faded...

304
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:48,136
you want to have paid.

305
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,547
You never would have paid.

306
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:56,748
Who would pay for shit?

307
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,519
Yeah. Exactly.
I mean, we had to do certain...

308
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,428
What the hell
are you doing here?

309
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,929
Why? What's up?

310
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:08,263
Let me guess.
My foot in your ass.

311
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,531
Game of cards... Hatchet Harry?

312
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,028
You're supposed to be getting
your rest in, boy.

313
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:17,065
You playing cards
tonight, son?

314
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:20,539
With Harry?

315
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,548
Oh, don't be silly, Dad.

316
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:25,073
I wouldn't have anything
to do with that.

317
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:37,162
Where did he get
a hundred grand?

318
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,527
He's got some adhesive mates.

319
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,929
I mean, they're like brothers.

320
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:41,297
They've tossed up between them.

321
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,701
And J.D. is his dad
and owns the whole property?

322
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,227
No mortgage, no debts.

323
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,797
Lock, stock, the fucking lot.

324
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:50,308
Don't you worry, Harry.

325
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:52,311
I've got it under control.

326
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:55,337
Good. You can get this
under control now.

327
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:57,906
It seems Lord Appleton Smythe
has run out of money...

328
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,316
and these little beauties
are up for auction.

329
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:03,117
But I'm not paying a quarter
of a million quid for them...

330
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,986
if you know what I mean, Barry.

331
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:07,788
Make sure we get everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

332
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:10,295
I don't want to know
who you use...

333
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,298
as long as they're
not complete muppets.

334
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:16,597
And don't tell them
what they're worth, Barry.

335
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,473
In the cool of the evening

336
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:25,705
When everything is getting
kinda groovy

337
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,406
Right. Where was we?

338
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,277
Shotguns?

339
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:31,783
What, like guns that fire shot?

340
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,785
Oh, you must be the brains,
then.

341
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:35,514
That's right.
Guns that fire shots.

342
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:39,547
Make sure you bring everything
from inside the gun cabinet.

343
00:16:39,592 --> 00:16:41,560
There will be a load
of old guns.

344
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,061
That's all I want.

345
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:46,553
Everything else outside
the cabinet you can keep.

346
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:48,066
Oh, thank you very much.

347
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,330
There had better be
something there for us.

348
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,496
It's a fucking stately home.

349
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,506
Of course there will be
something there.

350
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,974
- Like what?
- Like fucking antiques.

351
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,476
Antiques?

352
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:01,412
What the fuck do we know
about antiques?

353
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,608
- We rob post offices.
- And steal cars.

354
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,345
What the fuck do we know
about antiques, mate?

355
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:10,412
If it looks old,
it's worth money. Simple.

356
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,425
So stop fucking moaning
and rob the place.

357
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,724
So who's the guv?
Who are we doing this for?

358
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:20,425
You're doing it for me
is all you need to know.

359
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:24,027
You know
because you need to know.

360
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,095
I see. One of those...

361
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,732
"on a need-to-know basis"
things, is it?

362
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,743
Like one of those
James Bond films.

363
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:35,406
Careful. Remember
who's giving you this job.

364
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,678
Right. I'm off.

365
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,309
Call me when you're done.

366
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,875
Ta-ta.

367
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,223
Fucking northern monkeys.

368
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:53,026
I hate these fucking
southern fairies.

369
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,935
You always keep me guessing

370
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,037
I never seem to know
what you are thinking

371
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,005
I never seem to know
what you are thinking

372
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,939
Ed has been playing cards...

373
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:03,441
since he could lift them up...

374
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,535
and he soon discovered
that he had a big advantage.

375
00:18:05,578 --> 00:18:07,546
It's not that he's good
with cards...

376
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,548
or even good at counting them.

377
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:12,050
It's that he's good with
reading peoples' reactions...

378
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:13,517
no matter how subtle.

379
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,112
And everybody has reactions...

380
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,458
...especially
when it comes to money.

381
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,017
Hold my hand

382
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,029
Love is kinda crazy

383
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:27,521
With a spooky little boy
like you

384
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:31,564
Spooky

385
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,565
- Invitations.
- Invitations?

386
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,098
Yeah. Invitations.

387
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:40,169
Four pretty, white pieces
of paper with your names on.

388
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,413
We've got 100,000 bits of paper
with the Queen's head on.

389
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,069
Will that do?

390
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,172
All right. Just you.

391
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:49,275
The others, they can wait
next door in Samoan Jo's.

392
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,752
Samoan Jo's? You mean the pub.
Hold on.

393
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,756
Hold on
to your fucking tongue...

394
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,224
and I will hold on
to my patience, OK, sonny?

395
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:59,023
No one in here tonight
but card players...

396
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:00,722
and I do mean no one.

397
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:10,465
Evening, Frazer, Don, Phil.

398
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,565
It's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

399
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,769
Is this supposed to be symbolic?

400
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,608
Apparently it's for security.

401
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:20,412
I'd have brought
my gloves if I'd have known.

402
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,180
You must be Eddie,
J.D.'s son.

403
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:25,210
You must be Harry.

404
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:28,018
Sorry, didn't know your father.

405
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,524
Never mind, son.

406
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,027
You just might meet him
if you carry on like that.

407
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:35,860
Evening, Tanya. Been a while.

408
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,490
All right, Ed.

409
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,348
Right. We call each other
"Kenny," OK, Gary?

410
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:00,821
All right, Kenny.

411
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:03,519
You going to put
your stocking on or what?

412
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,959
I've just spent two hundred
and twenty quid on me hair.

413
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,462
If you think I'm pulling
a stocking over it...

414
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,021
you're very much mistaken.

415
00:20:09,065 --> 00:20:11,033
You're going to have to
put something on.

416
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:15,637
This is three-card brag,
gentlemen.

417
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:17,639
Three threes are the highest...

418
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:20,141
then three aces,
then running down accordingly.

419
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:23,612
Then it's a running flush,
a run, a flush, and then a pair.

420
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:25,614
An open man can't see
a blind man...

421
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:29,550
and it will cost you twice
the ante to see your opponent.

422
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:31,280
Now, don't fuck around, fellas.

423
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,947
You all know the rules...

424
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:34,980
and you know
I won't stand for it.

425
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,844
What are you doing?
Put that back!

426
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:58,346
We're here to rob the guns.

427
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:00,815
Put it back. It's crap anyway.

428
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,013
Come on. Come ahead.

429
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,665
What sort of pub
is this, then?

430
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,674
It's a Samoan pub.

431
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:29,303
What's that?

432
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:31,779
It's a cocktail.
You asked for a cocktail.

433
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:36,114
No. I asked you
to give me a refreshing drink.

434
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:38,950
I wasn't expecting
a fucking rain forest.

435
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:41,513
You could fall in love
with an orangutan in that.

436
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:43,991
You want a pint, go to the pub.

437
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:47,428
I thought this was a pub.

438
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:48,930
It's a Samoan pub.

439
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:50,432
Well, whatever it is...

440
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,333
can you get your man
to turn the TV down?

441
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:54,836
You can ask him if you like.

442
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,360
If I was you,
I'd leave him well alone.

443
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,770
Here. Get rid of that.

444
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,775
Bring us a Diet Coke.

445
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:03,506
Excuse me.
Can you turn that TV down?

446
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:10,385
No.

447
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:17,256
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

448
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,723
Whoa! Whoa, Kenny!

449
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,427
What are you doing?

450
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:29,996
I am trying to find out
where they keep their money.

451
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:34,476
You twat. Can't you see
these people have got no money?

452
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,478
They can't even afford
new furniture.

453
00:22:36,512 --> 00:22:38,980
We've got the guns.
What's the matter with you?

454
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,482
Every time we do a job...

455
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:42,040
you have to go
burning peoples' feet.

456
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,551
What's wrong with you?

457
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:55,897
You want to be more careful,
old fella.

458
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,626
You very nearly
took my man's head...

459
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,328
clean off with that.

460
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:01,268
You all right, Kenny?

461
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:02,793
Kenny?

462
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:11,543
Ten grand... blind.

463
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,450
Twenty grand... open.

464
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,613
Deep end, eh?

465
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:22,317
Fold.

466
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:42,503
Gotcha.

467
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:57,319
Twenty grand... open.

468
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,853
I'll fold.

469
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,831
Don't go spending that
all at once, boy.

470
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,137
Bloody hell.

471
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:14,636
What?

472
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:16,645
I thought you said
there'd be no staff, Barry.

473
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,579
Did you get those guns?

474
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:20,673
You want to see
what they did to poor Gary?

475
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:24,049
Gary! Gary!

476
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,680
I said, did you get those guns?

477
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:28,747
Yes! We got them!

478
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,453
Good. I'll speak to you later.

479
00:24:32,962 --> 00:24:34,930
Gary, if you can hear me...

480
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:37,626
get back in the car now, mate,
OK?

481
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,429
Barry? Barry?

482
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:44,635
Fucking, sodding,
shandy-drinking bastard.

483
00:24:44,673 --> 00:24:45,833
Gary!

484
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,073
Liar, liar, pants on fire

485
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:54,105
Your nose is longer
than a telephone wire

486
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,051
Best be heedin' what I'm sayin'

487
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:58,781
You've been out all night

488
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:01,119
Know you've been bad

489
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:02,351
Don't tell me different

490
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,052
Know it's a lie

491
00:25:04,093 --> 00:25:07,085
Come to me, honey, see how I cry

492
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:13,358
Why must you hurt me,
do what you do?

493
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:17,270
Listen here, girl,
can't you see I love you?

494
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:20,400
Make a little effort,
try to be true

495
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:23,741
I'll be happy, not so blue

496
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:31,776
Owww!

497
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:41,126
Liar, liar, pants on fire

498
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:43,893
Your nose is longer
than a telephone wire

499
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,493
You keep on tellin' me
those lies

500
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:49,095
Soon going out with other guys

501
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:50,605
Give me my money!

502
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:54,006
Give me back my money,
you fucking snakes!

503
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,603
Take my advice, won't be long

504
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,112
Give me my money!

505
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:01,844
Give me back my money!
Give it back!

506
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:03,784
Wankers!

507
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:05,343
Wankers!

508
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:12,149
Come on. Not now, please.

509
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:14,788
Not... Oh, you fucking bastard.

510
00:26:20,703 --> 00:26:24,161
Fucking bastard.

511
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,673
Oh, my good God.

512
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,378
We'll take you to the cleaners.

513
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:40,515
Twenty grand... open.

514
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:43,615
Thirty thousand.

515
00:26:43,658 --> 00:26:46,991
Back to you already, Eddie.

516
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:49,997
Fifty grand.

517
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:53,531
Eighty grand.

518
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:57,503
One hundred grand.

519
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,803
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look, fellas, I know...

520
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:01,536
I know you're not in...

521
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:04,545
which means no one cares
what you know.

522
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:07,708
Two hundred fifty.

523
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,376
That's quite a raise.

524
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:16,686
That's one hundred and fifty
on my one hundred.

525
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,158
Yeah.

526
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:21,924
And is there anything else
you want to say?

527
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:25,729
As you know, this puts us
in an awkward position.

528
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,167
I don't have enough to continue.

529
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:30,433
We will have to see
both your cards...

530
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:32,940
if no one loans Eddie
the money to continue.

531
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:35,636
It's a loan,
or we see both your cards.

532
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:42,443
I will.

533
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,879
You will what?

534
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,881
I will loan you the money.

535
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:57,287
No. I think I'd rather
just turn them over.

536
00:27:57,332 --> 00:28:00,301
I'm not interested
in what you would rather.

537
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:02,303
I want to keep going.

538
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:04,965
I'm also offering you the money.

539
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:08,737
We don't have to turn them over
because you can borrow.

540
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,544
I need
two hundred and fifty grand.

541
00:28:13,582 --> 00:28:19,214
No. You need five hundred grand
to see me.

542
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:20,482
That's if I want to see you.

543
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:23,616
You're going to have
a problem carrying on.

544
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:28,685
I'll see you.

545
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:33,190
OK, before I loan you this...

546
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:36,295
I expect...
if you lose, of course...

547
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:39,000
my money back within a week.

548
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,837
Crystal?

549
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,366
That's Sunday, OK?

550
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:12,139
Is that it?

551
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:15,142
Now let's see his fucking cards.

552
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:32,960
So messed up

553
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,962
I want you here

554
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:40,897
In my room

555
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:43,097
I want you here

556
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:51,202
Now we're gonna be face-to-face

557
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:59,109
And I'll lay right down
in my favorite place

558
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:06,884
And now I wanna be your dog

559
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:10,796
And now I wanna be your dog

560
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:14,962
And now I wanna be your dog

561
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:23,974
Well, come on

562
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:29,377
Hello, boy.
Feeling a bit poorly?

563
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:32,079
I know your friends
are responsible...

564
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,088
for most of the cash...

565
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:38,081
so I'm going to give you
one week to find it.

566
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,856
Otherwise,
I will take a finger...

567
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:43,864
off each of you
and your friends' hands...

568
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,867
for every day that passes
without payment.

569
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,029
And then when you
run out of digits...

570
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,869
your dad's bar,
and who knows what then.

571
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,374
All right, my son?

572
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,579
I've been thinking about

573
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:03,243
What you have done to me

574
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:07,687
The damage is much deeper
then you'll ever see

575
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:11,687
Hit me like
a hammer to my head...

576
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:13,387
This doesn't look good.

577
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:15,521
I wonder, were you pushed

578
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:17,690
Or were you led?

579
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,700
He then proceeded to explain...

580
00:31:19,734 --> 00:31:21,429
the unfortunate position
they were in.

581
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:22,936
Harry was going to start...

582
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,905
sizing up
all their fingers in a week...

583
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,237
because he knew
there was no way...

584
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,243
Ed could settle
that debt on his own.

585
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:31,472
Harry saw it
as their money on the table...

586
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:34,744
so it was also their debt
off the table.

587
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:36,182
Ed would hate to admit it...

588
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,185
but he could have kissed
the old bastard for that.

589
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:40,949
If he said he wanted
to settle the debt on his own...

590
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:42,422
it would have been a lie.

591
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:43,890
Now, I wish to Christ...

592
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:46,393
he would have let me
settle the debt on my own.

593
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:50,164
I'm going to kill him!

594
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:51,665
Stop fucking about, Tom...

595
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,168
and think about
what we're going to do.

596
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:55,692
Now, sit down.

597
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,640
What's all the fuss
about Harry?

598
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:04,167
Why don't we just
boycott the payment?

599
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,448
Let me tell you
about Hatchet Harry.

600
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,475
Once there was this geezer...

601
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,215
called Smithy Robinson
who worked for Harry.

602
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:16,883
It was rumored
that he was on the take.

603
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:19,189
Harry's invited Smithy around
for an explanation.

604
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,957
Smithy didn't do
a very good job.

605
00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:24,965
Within a minute,
Harry's lost his rag...

606
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,762
reached out for
the nearest thing at hand...

607
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,134
which happened to be a
fifteen-inch black rubber cock.

608
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:35,234
He then proceeded to batter
poor Smithy to death with it.

609
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:40,846
Now, that was seen
as a pleasant way to go.

610
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,909
Hence, Hatchet Harry
is a man you pay if you owe.

611
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:49,117
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

612
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:52,025
I've been thinking about

613
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,961
What you have done to me

614
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:59,797
The damage is much deeper
then you'll ever see

615
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:04,601
Hit me like a hammer to my head

616
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,370
I wonder, were you pushed,
or were you led?

617
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,504
Why did you do it?

618
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:15,641
Why did you do that thing to me?

619
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:23,056
Golf... the best way
to spoil a good walk.

620
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:32,258
Winston Churchill said that.

621
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,269
I say it's a dog-eat-dog world.

622
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,771
And I've got bigger teeth
then you two.

623
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:42,868
I think our friend is trying
to tell us something.

624
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:44,173
Perhaps not.

625
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:46,578
Perhaps I should take another
swing just to make sure.

626
00:33:46,614 --> 00:33:48,104
Give me a five-iron, John.

627
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:49,673
Certainly, Dog.

628
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:54,544
Now, keep still.

629
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,227
Yes, Gordon, is there something
you'd like to tell us?

630
00:34:07,836 --> 00:34:09,360
It's in the fireplace.

631
00:34:09,404 --> 00:34:12,066
Shut it, you idiot! He'll... Aah!

632
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,971
Yes, Gordon,
you were saying?

633
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,134
It's in the fireplace.

634
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,644
Just pull it out.
It's in the bottom.

635
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,476
It's in the fireplace, Plank.

636
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:21,505
Just pull it out.
It's in the bottom.

637
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:25,781
Oh, Dog, I think you want
to have a look at this.

638
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:30,317
You going to let me down now?

639
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:33,693
No.
I'm not finished with you yet.

640
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:34,986
Steel.

641
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,361
Help!

642
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:40,626
Help!

643
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,497
Help! Aah!

644
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:47,566
Oh, Dog.

645
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,280
Who the hell is that?

646
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:56,975
It's only twelve o'clock.

647
00:34:57,016 --> 00:35:00,008
Use the cage.
That's what it's there for.

648
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,080
Who is it?

649
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:15,033
We have got security
for a reason, Willie.

650
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,730
Chill, Winston.
It's only Plank.

651
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,935
This weed's getting quite a rep,
you know, fellas.

652
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:25,205
All right? Easy.

653
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:27,007
Jesus!

654
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:28,513
Never saw you there.

655
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:30,981
Hello, love. Enjoying yourself?

656
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:34,385
Is she compos?

657
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,581
What do you think?

658
00:35:38,157 --> 00:35:39,317
Boo!

659
00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:42,226
Fuck me!

660
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,229
Clean that up, Charles.

661
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:46,026
Sod you. You clean it up.

662
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,794
Sorry, fellas,
but that stupid cow...

663
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,700
scared the fucking life
out of me.

664
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:53,102
Never mind.
Can you just sit down...

665
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:54,606
stay out of the way?

666
00:35:57,643 --> 00:36:00,012
How much is it you want?

667
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:02,310
I'm after a half weight.

668
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:04,509
Right. Well, that's
fifteen hundred, then.

669
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,677
Pass the scales, Willie.

670
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:11,379
Give us some gear, J.

671
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:18,389
Any chance of actually
seeing the, uh, money?

672
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:29,207
The odds are a hundred to one.

673
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,709
All as we need is five grand.

674
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:35,043
I'd rather put my money
on a three-legged rocking horse.

675
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,379
The odds are a hundred to one
for a good reason, Bacon.

676
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,884
It won't win.

677
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,352
Where's Eddie?

678
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:42,854
Where do you think?

679
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:46,346
The bottom of a bottle
and has been for two days.

680
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:48,360
It's hit him hard.

681
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:49,827
It's hit us all hard.

682
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:51,830
Yeah, but he's got
to tell his dad...

683
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,525
he's about to lose his bar.

684
00:36:53,566 --> 00:36:55,033
Listen to this one.

685
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:56,432
You open up a company...

686
00:36:56,468 --> 00:36:58,959
called "Ass Ticklers
Faggots Fan Club."

687
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:00,403
You take out an advert...

688
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,703
in the back page
of some gay mag...

689
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:05,266
advertising the latest
in ass-intruding dildos.

690
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:07,871
You sell it with,
I don't know...

691
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:10,905
"Does what no other dildo
can do until now.

692
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,918
"The latest and greatest
in sexual technology.

693
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:14,419
"Guaranteed results
or your money back."

694
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:15,613
All that bollocks.

695
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:17,622
These dils
cost twenty-five quid a pop.

696
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,624
That's a snip
for the amount of pleasure...

697
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,387
they're going to give
the recipients.

698
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:22,860
But they send their checks...

699
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:25,864
to the other company name,
nothing offensive...

700
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:28,389
"Bobbie's Bits" or something...
for twenty-five quid.

701
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,901
You take that
twenty-five quid...

702
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:32,403
you stick it in the bank
until it clears.

703
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,406
Now, this is the smart bit.

704
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,466
You send back the check
for twenty-five pound...

705
00:37:37,509 --> 00:37:38,976
from the other company name...

706
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:40,478
"Ass Ticklers
Faggots Fan Club..."

707
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:41,979
saying, "We're sorry"...

708
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:43,982
and "We couldn't get
the supplies from America...

709
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,984
"because they've run
out of stock."

710
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:49,476
Now, you see how many people
cash that check.

711
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:50,988
Not a single soul...

712
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:53,992
because who wants
their bank manager to know...

713
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:57,052
they tickle ass when they're
not paying in checks?

714
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,564
So how long do you have to wait
until you see the return?

715
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:01,327
Probably no more
than four weeks.

716
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:05,963
A month? So what fucking good
is that if we need it in six...

717
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:07,529
no, five days.

718
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:11,100
Well, it's still a good idea.

719
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:15,102
He may know we smoke a lot
and burn a bit of profit...

720
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:17,308
but he can't have any idea...

721
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,544
how much hard currency
we've accumulated.

722
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,052
I don't know.

723
00:38:21,086 --> 00:38:23,179
Do you know?

724
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:26,749
We can just slice it
off the top.

725
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:30,284
You guys got to realize
who this chap is.

726
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,298
Might look a bit silly,
but he's a fucking lunatic.

727
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:35,562
And if he gets
the slightest inkling...

728
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:37,296
we're not throwing
straight dice...

729
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,304
then you and me
are going to know...

730
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:42,307
what the sharp side
of a kebab knife feels like.

731
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:43,808
So you know these geezers well?

732
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,332
Well enough.

733
00:38:45,377 --> 00:38:48,107
I've been buying gear off
one of them for a couple years.

734
00:38:48,147 --> 00:38:49,546
What are they like, then?

735
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:51,549
Poofs. Nothing heavy.

736
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,245
Four public schoolboys.
Soft as shite.

737
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:16,036
They ponce around
in funny hippie clothes...

738
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:17,542
all day talking bollocks.

739
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:19,544
They're just good
at growing weed, that's all.

740
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:22,547
Business has got bigger
than what they can keep up with.

741
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:25,141
They can't all be stupid,
can they?

742
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,310
Think about it.

743
00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:29,150
They've got a container-load
of cash in shoe boxes.

744
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:30,655
They're selling Class "A" gear.

745
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:33,624
Don't you think there might be
someone sensible involved?

746
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:34,785
What about security?

747
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:36,260
There's one
steel gate as you go in...

748
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:37,660
but they never lock it.

749
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:39,288
What do you mean, never lock it?

750
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:40,889
What have they got it there for,
then?

751
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,662
I must have been there
fifty times.

752
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,464
It's never locked.
They're not suspicious.

753
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,471
Everyone who goes there
is a toff.

754
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:47,972
They're into that karma crap.

755
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,202
"If I don't harm nobody,
nobody harms me" stuff.

756
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,107
No way they can get back to you?

757
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:54,237
Even if they could,
they'd be too shit scared.

758
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,507
I'm a geezer.

759
00:39:55,547 --> 00:39:58,710
They've got no muscle.
Gutless faggots.

760
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,275
Fancy one?

761
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,121
What's all the flapping about?

762
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:06,124
You told the old man yet?

763
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:07,955
Hoping I won't need to.

764
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:09,620
I've got a plan.

765
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:11,356
Now, listen carefully.

766
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,974
Hello, boys.

767
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,476
Harry.

768
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:27,741
Do you want a drink?

769
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,748
Hello, my son.
Do you want a lolly?

770
00:40:29,782 --> 00:40:31,579
Piss off, you nonce.

771
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:33,585
Oi! Watch it.

772
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:36,645
No, thanks, Harry.
We're both all right.

773
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:38,155
Nice shooter.

774
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,748
Yeah. One of a pair.

775
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,259
Holland and Holland.

776
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:43,158
Do you want to hold it?

777
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,163
No. Not my thing. Thanks, Harry.

778
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:47,165
Business good?
I imagine that's why I'm here.

779
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,635
Four young fellas got in
deeper than they could handle.

780
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:53,194
They owe me
half a million pound.

781
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:54,967
How much?

782
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:56,497
Half a million.

783
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:00,210
I'm game.

784
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,311
Me, too.

785
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,617
Oh, God.

786
00:41:06,652 --> 00:41:08,552
Right.

787
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:12,717
We hit them
as soon as they come back.

788
00:41:12,758 --> 00:41:14,282
We'll be prepared, waiting.

789
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:17,921
And they're armed.

790
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:19,430
What was that? Armed?

791
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,433
What do you mean, armed?

792
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,934
Armed with what?

793
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:26,062
Uh, bad breath, colorful
language, feather duster.

794
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:28,596
What do you think?
Guns, you tit!

795
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,076
Guns? You never said
anything about guns.

796
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:35,171
A minute ago, this was
the safest job in the world.

797
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:37,682
Now it's turning into
a bad day in Bosnia.

798
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:40,184
Soap, stop being
such a mincer.

799
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,346
I've thought about that, and...

800
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:43,581
And what, exactly?

801
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:48,286
And... all we have to do
is find out who's carrying them.

802
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:51,728
They could all be carrying them,
for what we know.

803
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:54,732
No. Only one of them
carries them going to the job...

804
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:56,233
so I assume the same one...

805
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:59,237
will be carrying them when
they come back from the job.

806
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:00,602
You assume, do you?

807
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,038
And what do they say...

808
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:04,565
about assumption being
the brother of all fuckups?

809
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,475
It's the mother
of all fuckups, stupid.

810
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:08,809
Well, brother, mother,
any other sucker...

811
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:10,815
it don't make any difference.

812
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,010
They're still fucking guns...

813
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:16,384
and they still
fire fucking bullets.

814
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:19,390
Soap, if you have
a better idea...

815
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:20,891
how to get
five hundred thousand pounds...

816
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:22,894
in the next few days...

817
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,452
let us know.

818
00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:25,963
In the meantime, Tom...

819
00:42:25,998 --> 00:42:29,456
you talk to Nick the Bubble
about shifting the weed.

820
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,531
Weed?

821
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:38,040
No, it's not normal weed.

822
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:40,543
It's some fucked up
skunk Class "A."

823
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:43,045
I can't think,
let alone move shit.

824
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,048
Doesn't sound very good to me.

825
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:48,051
No, neither me. But it depends
what flicks your switch...

826
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:51,543
and the light is on and burning
brightly for the masses.

827
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:53,146
Anyway, do you know anyone?

828
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,748
I know a man, yes.

829
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,358
Rory Breaker.

830
00:42:58,395 --> 00:43:00,295
Not that madman with an afro?

831
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,299
I don't want anything
to do with him.

832
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,302
You won't have to.
Just get me a sample.

833
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:08,395
No can-do.

834
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:11,407
What's that,
a place near Katmandu?

835
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:12,908
Meet me halfway, mate.

836
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:15,741
Look, it's all completely
chicken soup.

837
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:16,905
It's what?

838
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,414
It's kosher as Christmas.

839
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:20,916
The Jews don't celebrate
Christmas, Tom.

840
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:22,418
Yeah, well, never mind that.

841
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm going to need
some artillery, too.

842
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:25,921
Couple of sawn-off shotguns.

843
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:27,423
This is a bit heavy.

844
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:28,924
This is London, not the Lebanon.

845
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,426
Who do you think I am?

846
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,428
I think you're Nick the Greek.

847
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:34,123
Hold those two.

848
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:39,862
I don't normally have anything
to do with weed, Nick...

849
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,371
but if it is
what he says it is...

850
00:43:42,405 --> 00:43:45,374
I'll take it off him for
three and a half grand a key.

851
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:48,536
That is,
if it is what he says it is.

852
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:50,773
I don't want to see it
after a sample.

853
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:53,009
I don't want to touch it
after a sample.

854
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:55,745
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Nathan here.

855
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:57,754
He'll sort out the details.

856
00:43:57,788 --> 00:44:00,552
But just let me
tell you one thing.

857
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,526
If the milk turns out
to be sour...

858
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,556
I ain't the kind of pussy
to drink it.

859
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:14,059
Do you know what I mean?

860
00:44:19,442 --> 00:44:21,410
Rory Breaker.

861
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:23,776
Rory? Yeah, I know Rory.

862
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:25,782
He's not to be underestimated.

863
00:44:25,816 --> 00:44:27,977
He's a funny-looking fucker,
I know...

864
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:29,610
but you've got to
look past the hair...

865
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:31,143
and the cute, cuddly thing.

866
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:33,418
It's all a deceptive facade.

867
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:35,958
A few nights ago...

868
00:44:35,992 --> 00:44:38,119
Rory's Roger iron rusted...

869
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:40,629
so he's gone down
the Battle Cruiser...

870
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:42,791
to watch the end
of a football game.

871
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,769
No one's watching the custard,
so he switches the channel over.

872
00:44:46,803 --> 00:44:48,566
A fat geezer's north opens...

873
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:52,097
and he wanders up
and turns the Liza over.

874
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:54,872
"Now, fuck off and watch it
somewhere else."

875
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,469
Rory knows claret is imminent...

876
00:44:56,513 --> 00:44:58,481
but he doesn't want to miss
the end of the game...

877
00:44:58,515 --> 00:45:00,346
so calm as a coma...

878
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:02,408
picks up a fire extinguisher...

879
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,079
walks straight past
the jam rolls...

880
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,678
who were ready for action...

881
00:45:05,722 --> 00:45:07,553
and plunks it
outside the entrance.

882
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:09,058
He then orders an Aristotle...

883
00:45:09,092 --> 00:45:11,686
of the most ping-pong tiddly
in the nuclear sub...

884
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:14,788
and switches back to his footer.

885
00:45:14,831 --> 00:45:17,061
"That's fucking it,"
says the geezer.

886
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,933
"That's fucking what?"
says Rory...

887
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,996
and he gobs out a mouthful
of booze, covering Fatty.

888
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,837
He flicks a flaming match
into his bird's nest...

889
00:45:25,876 --> 00:45:28,242
and the geezer's lit up
like a leaking gas pipe.

890
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:30,940
Rory, unfazed,
turns back to his game.

891
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:34,382
His team's won, too, four-nil.

892
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,902
Oi! Is your hair
supposed to look like that?

893
00:45:52,936 --> 00:45:55,461
- All right, short stuff.
- Never mind short stuff.

894
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:58,406
The next time we do
a job like this...

895
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:00,341
we're going to want more money,
Barry...

896
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:03,369
or we're going back
to post offices and cars.

897
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:04,539
Where's the others?

898
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:06,549
There was no others.

899
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,982
Stop fucking around.

900
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:09,485
The others. The old ones.

901
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:10,986
I don't know what you mean.

902
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,488
There were two old guns there.

903
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:13,989
Where are they now?

904
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,548
Not in the cabinet,
there wasn't.

905
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:17,958
There was a couple
of old hammerlock muskets...

906
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:19,427
the butler was carrying,
but they were ours.

907
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:20,622
We sold them.

908
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:22,495
You better
un-sell them, sharpish.

909
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:24,693
We had to sell them.
We needed the money.

910
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,201
I'm not fucking interested.

911
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:30,730
If you don't want to be counting
the fingers you haven't got...

912
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:34,232
I suggest you get those guns
quick!

913
00:47:17,787 --> 00:47:18,913
Jesus.

914
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:22,220
If I pick them up,
will they stay in one piece?

915
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,351
Where did you get them?

916
00:47:24,394 --> 00:47:25,884
I got contacts.

917
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,760
Listen, Tom,
you point them at me...

918
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:30,891
I'll shit myself
or do whatever you say to do.

919
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,993
Either way,
you get the desired effect.

920
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:35,129
They look very nice,
I agree, but...

921
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:37,639
well, they're lacking
in criminal credibility.

922
00:47:37,674 --> 00:47:39,073
I might get laughed at.

923
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,701
How much do you want
for these muskets?

924
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:42,006
Seven hundred each.

925
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:44,707
What's that? A pound for
every year they've been about?

926
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:46,716
I know they're antiques...

927
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,741
but I ain't paying
antique prices.

928
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:53,054
They're a bit long, ain't they?

929
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:58,049
Sawn-offs are out. People want
a bit more range these days.

930
00:47:58,094 --> 00:47:59,288
Range?

931
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,729
I don't want to blow the ass
out of this country, granted...

932
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:05,132
but I don't want anyone blowing
a raspberry at me, either.

933
00:48:05,168 --> 00:48:07,636
I want to look fucking mean.

934
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,137
Of course you'll look mean.

935
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:10,639
You'll look really scary.

936
00:48:10,673 --> 00:48:12,140
Anyway, enough about that.

937
00:48:12,175 --> 00:48:14,575
What about this geezer
who sells drugs?

938
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:16,078
Rory Breaker's standing by.

939
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:20,105
You stand to make a lot
of money, tubby Tommy.

940
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,756
I understand if this
has come as a bit of a shock...

941
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:30,453
but let me tell you
how this can be resolved...

942
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:31,960
by you, the good father.

943
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,587
Go on.

944
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,621
He likes your bar.

945
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,132
Yes.

946
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,635
He wants your bar.

947
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:41,159
And?

948
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,002
Do you want me
to draw you a picture?

949
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:49,137
That boy doesn't know
his asshole from his earhole.

950
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,376
This is my bar.
It's got nothing to do with him.

951
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,882
What, and I care?

952
00:48:53,917 --> 00:48:56,385
Remember, you do have
the luxurious advantage...

953
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:58,944
of being able to sustain
your son's life.

954
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:00,888
And you do have a reputation...

955
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:03,392
so I choose my words
very carefully.

956
00:49:03,426 --> 00:49:05,951
You tell Harry
to go fuck himself.

957
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:12,223
Now...

958
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:17,806
I'll put that down to shock...

959
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:19,138
only once.

960
00:49:20,143 --> 00:49:24,671
Only once can I or shall I
let you get away with that.

961
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:28,707
Your son's got three days
to find half a mil.

962
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,549
But make up your mind
which you prefer...

963
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:35,115
your bar or your son.

964
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:41,924
Plank goes in first.

965
00:49:41,965 --> 00:49:45,332
There's a cage, but it's
never locked, is it, Plank?

966
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:46,528
Never.

967
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,434
It don't want to be.

968
00:49:48,471 --> 00:49:51,463
Once he's got himself set,
he gets the rest of us in.

969
00:49:52,742 --> 00:49:54,437
Now we get nasty
with a couple of them...

970
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:55,876
shoot them up, gag them,
whatever.

971
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:58,380
These wankers shouldn't
give us any problems...

972
00:49:58,414 --> 00:49:59,813
but like any cowboys...

973
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:02,215
there will be a few tools
lying around.

974
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:03,719
When the job's done...

975
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:06,221
we come straight back here
and unload...

976
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:08,224
and Robert's
your father's brother.

977
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,226
Everyone savvy?

978
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,128
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

979
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,126
Have a look at these.

980
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:18,923
And what are we supposed
to do with these?

981
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,904
Put them on your head, stupid!

982
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,667
Christ.

983
00:50:24,707 --> 00:50:27,267
If you think I'm going to
turn up there clean-shaven...

984
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:29,174
and greet them
with a grin on my face...

985
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:30,678
you got another thing coming.

986
00:50:30,713 --> 00:50:32,681
Now, these fellas,
they're your neighbors.

987
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:35,183
I thought it might
be a good idea...

988
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:36,684
to disguise ourselves a little.

989
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:38,186
Right. Uh, yeah.

990
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,620
Good thinking, Soap. Well done.

991
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:42,988
I brought weapons, as well.

992
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,516
Weapons?
What do you mean, weapons?

993
00:50:47,663 --> 00:50:48,823
These.

994
00:50:48,864 --> 00:50:50,331
Jesus!

995
00:50:50,366 --> 00:50:53,096
Let's keep them covered up, eh?

996
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:57,863
Couldn't you have gotten
anything a bit bigger?

997
00:50:57,907 --> 00:51:01,434
What, like that?

998
00:51:01,477 --> 00:51:02,967
What do you think?

999
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,175
I think you need help.

1000
00:51:07,183 --> 00:51:10,448
Bar steward, can we have
a couple of drinks, please?

1001
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,454
Have you seen your dad?

1002
00:51:12,488 --> 00:51:14,752
Hatchet sent
one of his men round.

1003
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,951
Oh, shit. When?

1004
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:19,861
Crazy...

1005
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:34,843
Where did you get these,
a fucking museum?

1006
00:51:34,877 --> 00:51:36,708
Nick the Greek. Pow!

1007
00:51:38,214 --> 00:51:40,182
How much did you part with?

1008
00:51:40,216 --> 00:51:41,683
Seven hundred for the pair.

1009
00:51:41,717 --> 00:51:43,184
Drachmas, I hope.

1010
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:45,687
I'd feel safer
with a chicken drumstick.

1011
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:48,713
These are going to do
more harm than good.

1012
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,827
Jesus, Tom. Do these work?

1013
00:51:52,861 --> 00:51:55,022
Don't know.
Look nice, though, don't they?

1014
00:51:55,064 --> 00:51:56,361
I rather like them.

1015
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:58,696
That's top of the list
of priorities, that is.

1016
00:51:58,734 --> 00:51:59,962
Ladies.

1017
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:02,903
Back to more important issues,
if you don't mind.

1018
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:04,906
We have only got two real guns.

1019
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,635
Apparently,
that's what they are.

1020
00:52:06,675 --> 00:52:09,906
So we find a good place
to hide next door.

1021
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:12,413
We wait till it sounds
like the right time...

1022
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:14,916
then we Jack-in-the-box,
look nasty and stuff...

1023
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,417
cocoon them in gaffer tape...

1024
00:52:16,452 --> 00:52:19,148
nick their van, swap the gear
into the new van...

1025
00:52:19,188 --> 00:52:20,655
and bring it all back here.

1026
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:23,658
As long as we're all out of
our hiding places quickly...

1027
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:25,922
it's the last thing
they're going to expect.

1028
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:28,122
Oh, and if Tom or anyone else,
for that matter...

1029
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:30,222
feels like giving them
a bit of a kicking...

1030
00:52:30,266 --> 00:52:32,234
I'm sure it won't do any harm.

1031
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:35,362
Yeah. A little bit of pain
never hurt anybody...

1032
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:37,702
if you know what I mean.

1033
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,870
Also, I think
knives are a good idea...

1034
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,208
big fuck-off shiny ones...

1035
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:47,181
ones that look like
they could skin a crocodile.

1036
00:52:47,216 --> 00:52:50,549
Knives are good because
they don't make any noise...

1037
00:52:50,586 --> 00:52:52,554
and the less noise they make...

1038
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:55,056
the more likely we are
to use them.

1039
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,751
Shit them right up.

1040
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,352
Makes it look
like we're serious.

1041
00:52:59,395 --> 00:53:02,330
Guns for show, knives for a pro.

1042
00:53:03,832 --> 00:53:07,063
Soap, is there something
we should know about you?

1043
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:09,468
I'm not sure
what's more worrying...

1044
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:12,507
the job or your past.

1045
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,009
Come on, girls.

1046
00:53:29,924 --> 00:53:31,323
Where the fuck
are they going?

1047
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,621
Shift a piano?

1048
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,185
I thought this was
meant to be a robbery.

1049
00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:37,459
Where did they get
those outfits?

1050
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,932
Not a bad idea, that.

1051
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,231
All right. It's Plank.
Is Willie there?

1052
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,568
No. I'm afraid he's not.
He's out at the moment.

1053
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:46,835
Perhaps you can help.

1054
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:49,741
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank,
if you know what I mean.

1055
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:52,575
Look, if you could just
open the door...

1056
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:54,410
so I could talk
without shouting.

1057
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,313
I can't help you, Plank.

1058
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,217
I think you'll find
it is in your interest.

1059
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:01,244
Hold on, OK?

1060
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:03,849
Look, Willie,
it's Plank outside for you.

1061
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:05,085
He says it's in our interest.

1062
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,959
Listen. I don't care
if it's King fucking Kong!

1063
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,520
He's not coming in here,
not today.

1064
00:54:10,565 --> 00:54:12,692
Hold on.
We are in business...

1065
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:15,531
and correct me if I'm wrong,
but that is business.

1066
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,299
Corrected.

1067
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,636
That's a walking accident.
That we can do without.

1068
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,198
Jesus, he's OK.

1069
00:54:21,242 --> 00:54:23,506
He knows only
to buy weights now.

1070
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:26,104
We're looking at
at least a couple of thou.

1071
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:28,479
What do you think, Winston?

1072
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,280
Willie, this is the last time.

1073
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,445
All right?

1074
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:34,545
But you and the money
are going out the back.

1075
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:36,454
If he knows you're here,
he'll be all day.

1076
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,720
Just clear this shit up.

1077
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:40,226
What... now?

1078
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:41,728
Yes! Now!

1079
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:43,730
Just get rid of him quick.

1080
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:46,597
All right. Just coming.

1081
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,538
What the fuck is he doing?

1082
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:56,242
Come on.

1083
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:58,575
I can't wait out here all day!

1084
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:00,240
All right. Just coming.

1085
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:07,982
I thought you was going
to leave me out there all day.

1086
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:09,922
I didn't know
you were a removals man.

1087
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:11,857
Lives and learns, don't you?

1088
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,416
Keep the gates locked now?

1089
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:15,656
Yeah. Sorry.

1090
00:55:15,696 --> 00:55:17,220
Got to do business
like this now.

1091
00:55:17,264 --> 00:55:18,891
Can't be too careful these days.

1092
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:21,697
I know. Shut it!

1093
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,863
You say a word, the right ear
goes, then your left!

1094
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,201
What are you doing, Plank?

1095
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,697
What do you think I'm doing?
Hang on. What are you doing?

1096
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,040
Unlock the gate!

1097
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,136
Oi, I said,
unlock the fucking gate!

1098
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:34,739
That's it. Go, go, go!
Fucking move!

1099
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:40,894
What the fuck's going on?

1100
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:42,830
Hang on, I've got the keys.

1101
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:44,117
The gate's locked.

1102
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,378
I don't believe
the fucking gate's locked.

1103
00:55:46,502 --> 00:55:47,448
What you done to Fauntleroy?

1104
00:55:47,752 --> 00:55:49,943
I didn't touch him.
He passed out.

1105
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:53,380
Shut the door!
D'you want the world to see?

1106
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,337
What's going on down there?

1107
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:02,386
Shit!

1108
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:11,696
Charles, get the rifle out.

1109
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:13,664
We're being fucked.

1110
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:15,281
It must be this one.

1111
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:18,159
Hold that gun.
Plank, give me the keys.

1112
00:56:18,569 --> 00:56:19,752
Don't point that at my bollocks!

1113
00:56:21,602 --> 00:56:24,497
Planks of wood. I'm working
with fucking planks of wood.

1114
00:56:25,142 --> 00:56:28,727
Shit! What the fuck is that?

1115
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,359
What the fuck's that?

1116
00:56:31,173 --> 00:56:31,436
It's my Bren gun.

1117
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,030
Haven't you got something
more practical?

1118
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:38,882
Don't none of you slags move.
I'll kill the lot of you!

1119
00:56:38,902 --> 00:56:41,455
Who you gonna kill, Plank?
There's no one there.

1120
00:56:44,812 --> 00:56:47,056
Aaagh! They fucking shot me!

1121
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:49,072
Well, shoot 'em back.

1122
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,102
Jesus, Plank! Couldn't you get
smokeless cartridges?

1123
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:59,162
Shit, I've been shot.

1124
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:01,935
I don't believe this. Could
everyone stop getting shot?

1125
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:05,546
John, sit down and patch
yourself up, you tart!

1126
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,505
It's a fucking air rifle!

1127
00:57:14,545 --> 00:57:17,115
- What the fuck was that?
- The Bren gun.

1128
00:57:17,356 --> 00:57:18,850
Fire that gun again,
you're a dead man.

1129
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:22,493
No ifs, no buts,
you're a dead man!

1130
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:27,090
I've got bollock ache with this.
Where's my fucking gun?

1131
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:35,074
Now I've got your attention.
Firstly, I'll blow his toes off.

1132
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:39,477
There go his toes.

1133
00:57:39,982 --> 00:57:43,928
If you want me out of here,
open the fucking gate

1134
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,792
or I'm gonna blow his leg off!

1135
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,633
They're gonna kill us
if we do, man.

1136
00:57:50,841 --> 00:57:53,043
Poor J'll certainly get it
if we don't. He's serious.

1137
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:55,361
I'm losing patience.
Hurry up, girls!

1138
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:57,525
It's all fucking right!

1139
00:58:00,402 --> 00:58:03,314
Willie, he doesn't know
you're here...

1140
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,926
Sort something out.

1141
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:19,150
And all your friends,
there's a good lad.

1142
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,183
- There's only three of us here.
- I don't believe you.

1143
00:58:24,276 --> 00:58:28,344
- I'm gonna blow his leg off.
- There's only three of us!

1144
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:32,050
- Plank?
- Yeah, one of 'em's out.

1145
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:37,084
0pen the gate.

1146
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:02,715
Up, up, up, there's a good lad.

1147
00:59:21,465 --> 00:59:24,179
John, get them tied up.
Plank, where's the money?

1148
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:26,102
In those shoe-boxes.

1149
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:46,818
- Where?
- 0ut the back.

1150
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:49,476
- And the weed?
- 0ut the back.

1151
00:59:49,477 --> 00:59:51,466
- Point.
- With what?

1152
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:54,255
- Your hands!
- I'm tied up.

1153
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:56,556
Nod your head or something.

1154
00:59:57,709 --> 01:00:01,238
Check it out. Plank,
get Paul out that van lively.

1155
01:00:18,026 --> 01:00:19,252
Knife.

1156
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,326
I'm gonna cut him.
Make sure he knows he's dead.

1157
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:27,938
How you doing, Mick?

1158
01:00:28,283 --> 01:00:30,989
How d'you think?
He's nearly chopped my arm off.

1159
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,624
Jesus Christ.

1160
01:00:47,696 --> 01:00:48,586
Gordon Bennett.

1161
01:00:49,193 --> 01:00:50,395
What the fuck's
been going on here?

1162
01:00:51,422 --> 01:00:54,507
Shut up, you idiot.
It's Hanukkah.

1163
01:00:55,804 --> 01:00:57,045
Don't just stand there.

1164
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,375
Can you fit it all in?

1165
01:01:00,308 --> 01:01:04,008
There's a lot...I can't
get Epping Forest in my van.

1166
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:08,502
Bollocks to can't.

1167
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:10,533
You'll fit it all in
if you have to make two trips.

1168
01:01:16,518 --> 01:01:17,831
Bollocks!

1169
01:01:19,712 --> 01:01:21,381
If you don't move it,
we will move it.

1170
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:25,623
- I'll only be a minute.
- You've already been 15.

1171
01:01:27,497 --> 01:01:29,234
- Come and have a look.
- At what, exactly?

1172
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:32,490
- The van's half full.
- So?

1173
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:36,835
All I've got to do
is fill it up, put you in it...

1174
01:01:36,836 --> 01:01:37,749
What?

1175
01:01:41,317 --> 01:01:42,183
..and I'm off.

1176
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:53,412
Can you carry
more than one bag this time?

1177
01:01:53,804 --> 01:01:57,301
- I can't. My neck, Dog.
- How many more bags?

1178
01:01:57,288 --> 01:01:59,351
Just a couple.

1179
01:02:00,346 --> 01:02:02,176
Mick, you dead yet?

1180
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:07,555
I'll be all right. 0nce I've
dealt with that lanky prick.

1181
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:09,835
Do it quietly.

1182
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:18,134
Time to say "Goodnight, nurse".

1183
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:01,376
Where the fuck
did she come from?

1184
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,309
Tie her up.
We're out of here.

1185
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:43,524
What you doing, Ed?

1186
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:45,114
D'you want one?

1187
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,151
No, I fucking don't.
You cannot make tea, Edward.

1188
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:51,834
The British Empire
was built on cups of tea.

1189
01:03:52,343 --> 01:03:53,340
And look what happened.

1190
01:03:53,546 --> 01:03:56,760
If you think I'm going to war
without one, you're mistaken.

1191
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,204
Going to war with what?

1192
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:06,634
Have you forgotten
those guns, you dozy prat?

1193
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:24,953
You won't get away with this.

1194
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:31,144
- Paul, what's that?
- It's a traffic warden.

1195
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:34,076
What's he doing
in the back of the van?

1196
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,800
He was gonna call the cozzers.

1197
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,282
Fair enough -
we'll deal with him later.

1198
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,331
How we doing, Tom?

1199
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:46,133
Right as rain.

1200
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:48,669
I'm gonna take care of the cabs.

1201
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:50,178
Keep us posted.

1202
01:04:55,806 --> 01:04:56,903
Do you do airports?

1203
01:05:00,368 --> 01:05:01,899
Where are we gonna hide?

1204
01:05:05,186 --> 01:05:07,116
Don't complicate things.
Just hide.

1205
01:05:12,957 --> 01:05:15,775
0w! Fuck!

1206
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:21,960
We're on.

1207
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:40,961
They weigh a pound or two!

1208
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:42,487
Shut up and back up!

1209
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:45,968
Spin round, big boy.

1210
01:05:50,303 --> 01:05:51,605
Fuck!

1211
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:53,816
Stay down. Stay down!

1212
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,217
Tie 'em up. Tape 'em up.
Hands and face.

1213
01:06:03,795 --> 01:06:05,009
0n the floor!

1214
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:07,742
Bend over the fucking desk.

1215
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:17,698
Keys. I want keys, now.

1216
01:06:18,932 --> 01:06:22,055
'Course you will, sweetheart.

1217
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,404
I'll find ya.

1218
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:27,319
What d'you think this is?
Fucking hide and seek?

1219
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:31,064
That one. Search that one.

1220
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:41,848
Right, I'll see you
in the van,

1221
01:06:42,072 --> 01:06:47,826
when you've finished
with handsome.

1222
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:03,659
Jesus. That wasn't
too bad, was it?

1223
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,446
When the bottle in my arse has
contracted, I'll let you know.

1224
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,060
Bacon, see what we've got.

1225
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,210
Let's have a butchers.

1226
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:24,184
We've hit the jackpot, lads.

1227
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:27,779
We've got God knows how much
of this stinking weed.

1228
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:30,808
A shitload of cash.

1229
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:35,158
And a traffic warden.

1230
01:07:35,132 --> 01:07:35,733
What?

1231
01:07:38,797 --> 01:07:41,032
Jesus, Ed.
We got a traffic warden.

1232
01:07:42,822 --> 01:07:44,241
I think he's still alive.

1233
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:47,272
He's got claret
coming out of him somewhere.

1234
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,576
What did they want
with a traffic warden?

1235
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,853
I don't know.
I don't think we need him.

1236
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,543
Knock him out
and dump him at the lights.

1237
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,502
What d'you mean,
knock him out? With what?

1238
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,378
Use your imagination.

1239
01:08:03,723 --> 01:08:06,389
Don't touch him up.
Knock him out.

1240
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:07,939
I'll knock you out!

1241
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:12,005
You wanna knock him out,
you knock him out.

1242
01:08:12,432 --> 01:08:14,030
I fucking hate traffic wardens.

1243
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:30,378
It's about time you gave my
young friends a visit, Chris.

1244
01:08:32,815 --> 01:08:34,955
Tomorrow's the day
and mum's the word.

1245
01:08:35,656 --> 01:08:37,141
I can't have that, can I, Baz?

1246
01:08:37,494 --> 01:08:38,740
No, Harry, you can't.

1247
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:41,362
I mean, it's a liberty.

1248
01:08:42,255 --> 01:08:43,999
I can't have a liberty taken,
can I, Chris?

1249
01:08:44,636 --> 01:08:46,161
No, Harry, you can't.

1250
01:08:47,474 --> 01:08:50,055
I mean, it's enough
to give me the arsehole.

1251
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:54,151
I can't have the arsehole,
can I, boys?

1252
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:56,583
No, Harry, you can't.

1253
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,791
that I won't find 'em.

1254
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:06,388
All right, that's it.
We're done.

1255
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,249
We're off.

1256
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:10,732
Ed, are you sure it's a good
idea taking this back to yours?

1257
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:12,734
It's the only place we can,
and the last place they'll look.

1258
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:16,003
Anyway, fuck it. The battle
is over and the war is won.

1259
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:20,224
Tom, take this to Nick the
Bubble and get rid of it quick.

1260
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:42,763
This skunk
is as good as it gets.

1261
01:09:39,373 --> 01:09:42,048
All right.
We'll take it. Half price.

1262
01:09:44,421 --> 01:09:45,807
I don't think he'll like that.

1263
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,161
You said three five a key.
That's a good price.

1264
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:53,552
Now it's today,
if I'm not mistaken.

1265
01:09:53,697 --> 01:09:56,507
We'll take it tomorrow.
Half price.

1266
01:09:57,572 --> 01:10:00,486
If he wants to get rid of it
quick, he'll have to take it.

1267
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:05,386
Look, I've got a race coming up,
so if you'd be kind enough...

1268
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:14,301
Lenny,

1269
01:10:14,606 --> 01:10:16,932
take that round to Snow White
and the three little chemists.

1270
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:19,331
They should have
a gander at that.

1271
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:21,037
I want a second opinion.

1272
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,628
Hang on a minute, Nathan,
something stinks.

1273
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:30,629
Yeah, your fucking aftershave.

1274
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:32,326
Fuck you, funny man.

1275
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:35,833
For God's sake, help me.

1276
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:39,603
I'm in pain.
I'm in so much pain!

1277
01:10:40,091 --> 01:10:41,436
Go in slowly, Nathan.

1278
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:43,464
Fuck you, funny man.
You go first.

1279
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:45,431
Get the fuck in there!

1280
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:49,098
I want this house searched
for bugs, stripped.

1281
01:10:49,463 --> 01:10:52,711
Even if there was a bug,
they'd have taken it with 'em.

1282
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,944
Bit late to start thinking.

1283
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,303
If it's a possibility,
that's good enough for me.

1284
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,874
Then I want every slag
this side of Ceylon pulled in

1285
01:11:02,415 --> 01:11:04,527
and tortured...badly.

1286
01:11:05,249 --> 01:11:06,734
I want to know
who's responsible for this,

1287
01:11:06,988 --> 01:11:08,709
otherwise I hold
you responsible.

1288
01:11:17,298 --> 01:11:18,602
Not a bad day.

1289
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:22,427
That pile takes care of Harry.

1290
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:25,427
What's left over?

1291
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,372
Give me half a chance
to count it.

1292
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,859
What about this gear, then?

1293
01:11:37,848 --> 01:11:39,840
0h, what, you want
a toke on that?

1294
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:42,448
No. I don't want any
of that horrible shit.

1295
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:44,543
Can we lock up
and get drunk now, please?

1296
01:11:47,624 --> 01:11:51,078
We shot one of them...
in the...er, throat.

1297
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:52,277
What d'you want, a medal?

1298
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,367
I'll shoot you
if I don't get my ganja back.

1299
01:11:57,288 --> 01:12:00,193
The one you shot.
Is he still in there?

1300
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:01,680
No, it was another one.

1301
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,666
That's more like it.
Where is he?

1302
01:12:05,835 --> 01:12:07,541
Well, they...they
took him with.

1303
01:12:08,488 --> 01:12:10,158
He's still, still alive.

1304
01:12:10,803 --> 01:12:13,924
What did you shoot him with?
An air gun?

1305
01:12:18,892 --> 01:12:23,670
Look, we grow weed.
We're not mercenaries.

1306
01:12:24,646 --> 01:12:26,553
You don't say.

1307
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:30,040
Who could it be?
Where do we start, Rory?

1308
01:12:30,338 --> 01:12:31,627
Mr Breaker.

1309
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:35,405
Today, my name is Mr Breaker.

1310
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,694
You think this
is a coincidence?

1311
01:12:38,349 --> 01:12:40,412
This white shite
steals my things

1312
01:12:40,718 --> 01:12:42,290
and thinks he can
sell it back to me!

1313
01:12:42,419 --> 01:12:44,209
He's got less brains
than you, Lenny!

1314
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:48,056
Get Nick - the greasy wop

1315
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:51,309
shistos pezavengy gammore
Greek bastard round here now,

1316
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:54,631
if he's stupid enough
to be on this planet.

1317
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,200
? Come with me,
I'll fill you with desire

1318
01:13:20,766 --> 01:13:25,554
? Take my hand and we'll walk
this land together ?

1319
01:14:27,931 --> 01:14:31,260
Your stupidity might be
your one saving grace.

1320
01:14:31,453 --> 01:14:32,199
Uuh?

1321
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:34,729
Don't uuh me, Greek boy.

1322
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:37,810
How is it your fucking stupid,
soon-to-be-dead friends

1323
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,748
thought that they could
steal my cannabis

1324
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,392
and then sell it back to me?

1325
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:44,519
Is this a declaration of war?

1326
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:45,919
Is this some white cunt's joke?

1327
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:51,768
'Cause I'm not fucking laughing,
Ni-ko-las!

1328
01:14:53,968 --> 01:14:55,524
You couldn't
have known my position,

1329
01:14:55,685 --> 01:14:58,220
'cause you're not that stupid
that if you did,

1330
01:14:58,457 --> 01:15:00,741
you wouldn't have turned up here
scratching your arse,

1331
01:15:00,741 --> 01:15:04,810
with that "what's going on" look
on your chevy chase.

1332
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:10,673
But you do know
where these people live.

1333
01:15:17,453 --> 01:15:19,697
If you hold back anything,
I'll kill you.

1334
01:15:19,677 --> 01:15:23,501
If you bend the truth, or
I think you are, I'll kill you.

1335
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:25,995
If you forget anything,
I'll kill you.

1336
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:29,744
In fact, you'll have to work
very hard to stay alive, Nick.

1337
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:32,769
Do you understand
everything I've said?

1338
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,939
Because if you don't,
I'll kill you.

1339
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:42,749
Now, Mr Bubble and Squeak...
you may enlighten me.

1340
01:15:47,574 --> 01:15:49,184
So we've got a bit
of a problem, ain't we?

1341
01:15:49,681 --> 01:15:51,635
Er, well...yeah, we do.

1342
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,028
In fact, this is a bit more
than a bit of a problem.

1343
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:58,232
It's the Mount
fucking Everest of problems!

1344
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:01,354
The reason it's such a fucking
monstrosity of a problem is...

1345
01:16:01,354 --> 01:16:04,741
you haven't got the first idea
who did this to us, have you?

1346
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:07,493
We've been up all night.
It's no one from round here.

1347
01:16:07,621 --> 01:16:08,959
We've had 'em all
lined up against the wall.

1348
01:16:09,183 --> 01:16:11,129
If it was a toerag
from the manor, we'd know.

1349
01:16:11,457 --> 01:16:14,738
- We'd know.
- You'd fucking know!

1350
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:17,254
You wouldn't know if it was
the next door neighbours!

1351
01:16:17,368 --> 01:16:19,589
Get out there and find them!

1352
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:23,469
I'm sick of
the fucking sight of you!

1353
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:38,289
"Scarface" -
I've watched "Scarface".

1354
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:42,573
If you want to know how to do
a drug deal, watch "Scarface".

1355
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:46,368
That really inspires confidence.

1356
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:49,090
This guy, Rory Breaker...

1357
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:52,620
Rory Breaker - psychotic
black dwarf with an afro?

1358
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:54,571
That'll be the same man, yes.

1359
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:57,096
I've heard of him -
he's a fucking lunatic.

1360
01:16:57,096 --> 01:17:00,101
He can afford the deal
at the price we're selling.

1361
01:16:59,778 --> 01:17:01,528
It's not worth him
giving us any trouble.

1362
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:04,013
He knows we'll be a pain
in the arse. Who needs that?

1363
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,092
I'd take a pain in the arse
for half a million quid.

1364
01:17:06,453 --> 01:17:07,903
You'd take a pain
in the arse for air miles.

1365
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:09,786
The fatter you get,
the sadder you get.

1366
01:17:10,763 --> 01:17:11,916
Will you stop flirting
for a minute?

1367
01:17:12,404 --> 01:17:16,294
After we pay Hatchet,
this deal puts us up...

1368
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:19,069
nearly £200,000 each.

1369
01:17:21,426 --> 01:17:23,336
Not bad for a morning's work,
I think you'll agree.

1370
01:17:34,843 --> 01:17:36,012
So they had the cash.

1371
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:37,299
And the puff.

1372
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:40,051
Cheeky bastards. Count it.

1373
01:17:40,812 --> 01:17:42,243
Shit, Dog. There's a lot.

1374
01:17:42,772 --> 01:17:44,150
Do you want to do it next door?

1375
01:17:45,758 --> 01:17:46,571
We're not going next door

1376
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:48,357
till we've flayed
them dead men walking.

1377
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:51,136
We'll count it upstairs.

1378
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,574
I don't want them to see you
fingering the money.

1379
01:17:54,515 --> 01:17:55,646
Dog, look...

1380
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:59,768
Give us it here...dozy bastard.

1381
01:18:03,056 --> 01:18:05,930
Check your guns.
Get yourselves well hid.

1382
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:09,271
Wait till they get right inside
the door, then give it 'em.

1383
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,112
Give me them shooters,
you can use your own.

1384
01:18:24,281 --> 01:18:24,859
Yeah.

1385
01:18:25,655 --> 01:18:26,788
That's no way
to answer the phone.

1386
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,628
Is that you, Dean?

1387
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,963
It's Lord fucking Lucan.
Who do you think it is?

1388
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:32,453
What can I do for you?

1389
01:18:33,369 --> 01:18:35,838
Those guns I sold you,
I need them back.

1390
01:18:35,838 --> 01:18:38,083
Not likely. I don't think
I'll be seeing them again.

1391
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:40,355
I've got the money
to pay for them.

1392
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:43,060
I'm sure you do.
But you don't understand.

1393
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:45,660
I ain't seeing them
or the guns again.

1394
01:18:46,128 --> 01:18:47,114
We can't get them.

1395
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:49,436
If we can't get them,
we can't get them.

1396
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,257
You'll have to get them.

1397
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:54,862
We made a deal for everything
inside the cabinet.

1398
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:57,217
Inside, outside -
I don't give a shit.

1399
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,002
Get those guns,
because if you don't...

1400
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:01,247
Yeah, Bazza, or what?

1401
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,030
Have you heard
of Harry Lonsdale?

1402
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:06,455
0therwise known as "Hack You
Up With an Hatchet Harry"?

1403
01:19:07,363 --> 01:19:08,384
Well, this is...

1404
01:19:09,964 --> 01:19:12,145
James Bond, need-to-know time.

1405
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:16,370
When you dance with the devil,
you wait for the song to stop.

1406
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:18,811
Know what I mean?

1407
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:26,247
I mean find 'em,
torture 'em and kill 'em.

1408
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,017
And bring back
what belongs to me.

1409
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:33,250
Because if you don't,
your family's bang in trouble.

1410
01:19:34,577 --> 01:19:35,259
Who was that?

1411
01:19:36,624 --> 01:19:38,035
That was Harry Horrible Hatchet.

1412
01:19:38,592 --> 01:19:39,613
Jesus, I've heard of him.

1413
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:42,687
Shit, they were his
fucking guns we sold.

1414
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,504
We've got to find them.

1415
01:19:45,428 --> 01:19:47,898
No fucking about, Nick.
Where can I find those guns?

1416
01:20:21,574 --> 01:20:23,731
Six black cocks
and a little white kitten

1417
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,181
sitting on the side
of the road.

1418
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:31,025
We're gonna do
a proper decoration job.

1419
01:20:32,509 --> 01:20:34,506
I want the grey skies
of London illuminated.

1420
01:20:36,254 --> 01:20:37,498
I want that house painted red.

1421
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:43,102
All right, there's this brass
standing on the corner.

1422
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:45,383
Dwarf walks up to her
carrying a suitcase...

1423
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,555
Winston there
is gonna come along

1424
01:20:48,555 --> 01:20:49,472
and see if he recognises
any of them.

1425
01:20:50,909 --> 01:20:52,742
Watch out for these fellas -

1426
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:57,928
they've got a bit of an arsenal
and they don't mind using it.

1427
01:20:58,191 --> 01:20:59,856
I'm taking down her panties...

1428
01:21:02,646 --> 01:21:04,487
Does everyone know
what they got to do?

1429
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:06,140
Yeah.

1430
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:18,347
What the fuck is going on?

1431
01:23:02,799 --> 01:23:04,328
You got something here
for me, have you?

1432
01:23:06,456 --> 01:23:08,547
Come on. Chop-chop.

1433
01:23:16,332 --> 01:23:18,036
Thank you very much.

1434
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:20,313
He's got the guns.

1435
01:23:20,313 --> 01:23:22,303
- You get them.
- Why me?

1436
01:23:23,355 --> 01:23:24,124
You're supposed
to be the hard case...

1437
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,762
You get the guns!
I drive the car!

1438
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:33,204
Good boy.

1439
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:36,648
- Get the fucking guns.
- Y0U get the fucking guns!

1440
01:23:36,932 --> 01:23:38,297
You fucking big...

1441
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:44,942
All right. Wrap them guns up.

1442
01:23:45,607 --> 01:23:46,466
Count the money.

1443
01:23:48,234 --> 01:23:49,015
Put your seat belt on.

1444
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:53,130
We've got to get the fucking
guns or we're dead!

1445
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:10,416
..so I made sure I fucked
the one that was coughing.

1446
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,089
Get out the car,
you yuppie fucker!

1447
01:24:57,113 --> 01:24:58,459
He's the one
we shot in the neck.

1448
01:24:58,899 --> 01:25:01,076
Is that right, Mr Botanical?

1449
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:29,037
Jesus!

1450
01:25:42,606 --> 01:25:45,759
I don't believe this.
What the fuck has happened here?

1451
01:25:46,315 --> 01:25:47,345
Jesus.

1452
01:25:49,112 --> 01:25:51,229
The money. The gear.

1453
01:26:03,218 --> 01:26:04,723
This is fucked.

1454
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:08,165
No money. No weed.

1455
01:26:09,322 --> 01:26:10,919
It's all been replaced
by a pile of corpses.

1456
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,554
All right. Don't panic.
Let's think about this.

1457
01:26:15,554 --> 01:26:18,318
Fuck that,
you can think about it.

1458
01:26:18,327 --> 01:26:20,328
I am panicking and I'm off.

1459
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:31,042
How did you get your hands
on these, then?

1460
01:26:31,205 --> 01:26:32,126
The boys had 'em.

1461
01:26:32,525 --> 01:26:33,618
I know you like
these sort of things -

1462
01:26:33,618 --> 01:26:35,108
wondered if you wanted 'em.

1463
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:37,573
Yeah, I'll have 'em.

1464
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:41,372
- Was it hard getting the money?
- Not especially.

1465
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:44,995
Upset a few characters, though.

1466
01:26:46,886 --> 01:26:47,962
Have you counted it?

1467
01:26:48,131 --> 01:26:50,268
Yeah, it's all there,
to the pound.

1468
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:52,538
- They were gonna pay?
- Looks like it.

1469
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:55,279
But who knows?
The opportunity was there.

1470
01:26:55,695 --> 01:26:58,372
In my experience, it's best
to take that opportunity -

1471
01:26:58,748 --> 01:26:59,690
if it's there.

1472
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:02,711
Good work, Chris.

1473
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:11,677
We've got to get those guns.

1474
01:27:12,305 --> 01:27:14,282
We don't know who lives there.

1475
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:17,148
I don't care who lives there!

1476
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,945
All's I know is it's preferable
to death by Hatchet.

1477
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,811
Fair enough. Let's go.

1478
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:48,161
I don't think
it's the right move.

1479
01:27:49,328 --> 01:27:50,529
It's either that,

1480
01:27:50,536 --> 01:27:53,291
the old boy's place
and we lose a digit daily.

1481
01:27:54,407 --> 01:27:57,882
- I'm gonna phone him.
- As if he'll care.

1482
01:27:57,882 --> 01:28:00,006
He'll care. That was
supposed to be his money.

1483
01:28:00,767 --> 01:28:02,976
Whether he cares about us
is different.

1484
01:28:03,386 --> 01:28:05,647
Pass me the phone.

1485
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:23,473
Yeah? That you, boy?

1486
01:28:24,143 --> 01:28:25,291
It's Ed,
if that's what you mean.

1487
01:28:26,072 --> 01:28:27,849
'Pay day, ain't it?'

1488
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:31,459
Yeah...I wanted
to talk to you about that.

1489
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:32,717
I'll bet you do.

1490
01:28:33,816 --> 01:28:35,452
I got half
a million nicker here,

1491
01:28:35,293 --> 01:28:37,469
which means
some poor sod doesn't.

1492
01:28:38,966 --> 01:28:40,937
You've upset a few people.

1493
01:28:41,569 --> 01:28:43,369
But that really
isn't my concern, is it?

1494
01:28:44,572 --> 01:28:47,614
What does concern me...
is the guns you had.

1495
01:28:49,378 --> 01:28:51,540
'I want to talk to you
about that.'

1496
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,677
So get your arse here now.
And I mean now!

1497
01:29:29,494 --> 01:29:33,421
Bastard! You fucking bastard!

1498
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:35,543
Bastard!

1499
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:45,548
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1500
01:29:47,004 --> 01:29:50,312
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1501
01:30:01,747 --> 01:30:05,816
Job well done. We made
a few quid out of that one.

1502
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,716
Son...?

1503
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,188
Made a few quid, did you?

1504
01:30:09,102 --> 01:30:10,195
Where's what I want?

1505
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,637
You all right there, mate?

1506
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:16,580
Very fucking funny.
Where's what I want?

1507
01:30:17,806 --> 01:30:19,112
I've just left it in the office.

1508
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:24,167
We'd better get it, if you want
your son to see his birthday.

1509
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:28,045
- Now chop-fucking-chop.
- All right. Fair enough.

1510
01:30:29,765 --> 01:30:30,790
Where you going?

1511
01:30:31,698 --> 01:30:34,372
It's a thirty second drive
or a five minute walk.

1512
01:30:35,252 --> 01:30:39,499
I couldn't have parked outside,
I'd have got a ticket.

1513
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:42,090
I suppose that don't
matter now, does it?

1514
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,540
Just be careful.

1515
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:44,903
Right.

1516
01:30:52,126 --> 01:30:53,504
You and me.

1517
01:30:53,552 --> 01:30:54,489
You and who?

1518
01:30:54,828 --> 01:30:56,593
You know where
the door handle is, Tom.

1519
01:30:59,423 --> 01:31:02,549
? "The Payback"
by James Brown

1520
01:31:04,445 --> 01:31:05,365
? Payback

1521
01:31:06,621 --> 01:31:08,974
? That's it, payback

1522
01:31:11,858 --> 01:31:14,872
? Revenge, I'm mad

1523
01:31:15,384 --> 01:31:17,318
? Get down with my girlfriend

1524
01:31:18,397 --> 01:31:19,954
? That ain't right ?

1525
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:22,339
0h, no. Not again.

1526
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:40,219
That's it. I'm off.

1527
01:31:41,701 --> 01:31:45,335
Tom...that is our bag.

1528
01:32:03,983 --> 01:32:05,808
- Ed...!
- Hold on.

1529
01:32:18,628 --> 01:32:20,582
This is our bag.

1530
01:32:23,693 --> 01:32:24,919
That's it. We're off.

1531
01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:27,582
- I'm gonna take these guns.
- Tom, don't fuck about!

1532
01:32:27,582 --> 01:32:31,407
It'll only take a minute.

1533
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,156
What is going on?

1534
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:53,157
I don't know, but I do know
there's no more Harry.

1535
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,768
Which means
there's no more debt.

1536
01:32:56,576 --> 01:32:59,297
If there's no more debt,
there's no more problem.

1537
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:03,492
And there's no problem with the
neighbours - they're all dead.

1538
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:06,843
And I think,
if I get this right,

1539
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:10,710
we haven't done anything wrong
and we're in the clear.

1540
01:33:45,015 --> 01:33:46,800
Never ever...

1541
01:33:47,389 --> 01:33:50,976
has anyone
been as fucking rude...

1542
01:33:51,057 --> 01:33:54,048
..to me as you!

1543
01:33:54,137 --> 01:33:57,048
You fucking...bastard!

1544
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:16,706
All right, mate?

1545
01:34:18,104 --> 01:34:20,183
Cheeky bastard!

1546
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:41,215
'This was an embarrassing
position for Tom to be in.

1547
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,324
'But Chris had to respect
the fact that he was holding

1548
01:34:44,324 --> 01:34:46,647
'what appeared to be
a pair of loaded shotguns.

1549
01:34:47,342 --> 01:34:50,467
'Tom had to respect the fact
they were not loaded.

1550
01:34:50,989 --> 01:34:53,663
'So without anybody
losing too much face,

1551
01:34:54,326 --> 01:34:57,944
'Tom left through a side door
and Chris left with the money.

1552
01:34:58,196 --> 01:35:00,249
'Everybody else got arrested.'

1553
01:35:01,337 --> 01:35:03,266
0dds, chaps,
gotta remember the odds.

1554
01:35:04,869 --> 01:35:06,114
He's not one of 'em.

1555
01:35:09,372 --> 01:35:13,384
? Sitting in the cheap seats
underneath the stiles

1556
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:17,933
? I'm heading back to base

1557
01:35:18,196 --> 01:35:21,077
? I'll drop you off
at my house ?

1558
01:35:21,727 --> 01:35:23,711
Your dad would like
a word with you, Ed.

1559
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:29,556
Where are the others?

1560
01:35:29,592 --> 01:35:31,690
They got out yesterday.
They're at the bar.

1561
01:35:47,277 --> 01:35:49,758
All right, Dad?

1562
01:35:49,758 --> 01:35:51,873
I'm all right.
How about yourself?

1563
01:35:52,091 --> 01:35:56,444
I'm all right.
Could do with a drink, though.

1564
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,694
All in good time.

1565
01:36:00,184 --> 01:36:02,606
So, are you in the clear?

1566
01:36:02,946 --> 01:36:05,298
More importantly...am I?

1567
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:08,279
It appears so.

1568
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:13,559
Appears? You'll have to do
better than fucking appears.

1569
01:36:14,547 --> 01:36:16,011
Well, everybody's dead, Dad.

1570
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:17,909
That's about as clear
as it can get.

1571
01:36:19,589 --> 01:36:20,687
How about that drink?

1572
01:36:21,159 --> 01:36:22,620
You know where the bar is.

1573
01:36:22,865 --> 01:36:23,730
Eh?

1574
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:27,096
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.

1575
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:29,859
Alan's got to sit there.
Alan!

1576
01:36:33,402 --> 01:36:35,203
You're lucky
you're still breathing,

1577
01:36:35,603 --> 01:36:37,428
let alone able to walk.

1578
01:36:38,029 --> 01:36:42,155
I suggest you take
full advantage of that fact.

1579
01:37:06,464 --> 01:37:09,639
You took your time.
Where the hell have you been?

1580
01:37:09,996 --> 01:37:11,440
Sit down. I'll tell you.

1581
01:37:17,728 --> 01:37:22,864
The traffic warden identified
the neighbours' bodies.

1582
01:37:24,384 --> 01:37:25,251
Which sort of
puts us in the clear.

1583
01:37:25,661 --> 01:37:27,598
The only thing connecting us
with the case...

1584
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:30,140
..is those shotguns.

1585
01:37:30,339 --> 01:37:31,735
And Tom took care of them.

1586
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,349
You did take care of the shotguns?

1587
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:40,039
I wanted to talk about that.

1588
01:37:40,519 --> 01:37:41,527
Well, talk.

1589
01:37:42,913 --> 01:37:45,307
Well, actually...no.

1590
01:37:47,005 --> 01:37:49,658
They're in the car.
I was gonna sell 'em to Nick,

1591
01:37:49,658 --> 01:37:51,953
but I couldn't get hold of him.

1592
01:37:52,467 --> 01:37:53,857
You dippy bastard.

1593
01:37:53,857 --> 01:37:59,867
So...the only thing
connecting us with the case

1594
01:38:00,168 --> 01:38:03,208
is in the back of your car,
which is parked outside?!

1595
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:06,898
They cost 700 quid.
I'm not gonna throw 'em away.

1596
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:10,116
They're hardly likely to trace
'em back to us, are they?

1597
01:38:11,147 --> 01:38:14,264
You think it's worth
the risk for £700?

1598
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:15,841
Tom, you're a dick!

1599
01:38:16,954 --> 01:38:19,292
Take those guns
and throw 'em off a bridge.

1600
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:21,952
And yourself while you're at it.

1601
01:38:22,264 --> 01:38:22,945
Now.

1602
01:38:28,262 --> 01:38:29,360
Look, all I'm...

1603
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,763
Now, Tom!

1604
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:40,142
Can I have a beer, please, Dad?

1605
01:38:40,142 --> 01:38:41,961
I'm busy. Get it yourself.

1606
01:38:58,927 --> 01:39:01,029
It seemed Hatchet
underestimated you lot.

1607
01:39:01,909 --> 01:39:03,287
And it seems to have cost him.

1608
01:39:05,192 --> 01:39:07,033
I ain't gonna make
the same mistake, am I?

1609
01:39:08,561 --> 01:39:10,392
So I've decided
to bring your bag back.

1610
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,370
I think the word you're looking
for, gentlemen, is "thank you".

1611
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:18,664
Thank you.

1612
01:39:20,169 --> 01:39:21,841
You've presented me
with a problem.

1613
01:39:23,115 --> 01:39:24,541
I've lost my employer.

1614
01:39:26,749 --> 01:39:30,230
So I've taken care
of meself and me son.

1615
01:39:31,607 --> 01:39:34,993
If you think that's unfair,
pay me a little visit.

1616
01:39:35,689 --> 01:39:37,770
But you better be
waving a white flag,

1617
01:39:37,812 --> 01:39:40,436
high and clear
so as I can see it.

1618
01:39:42,281 --> 01:39:46,878
0r it'll be the last
visit you ever make. Understand?

1619
01:39:49,293 --> 01:39:50,805
That's all I've come to say.

1620
01:39:53,525 --> 01:39:54,900
There is one more thing...

1621
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:59,069
It's been emotional.

sure a long road

1624
01:40:21,127 --> 01:40:26,212
? Winds on through the hills
for fifteen days ?

1625
01:40:27,684 --> 01:40:30,898
We are now officially in
the money-lending business, son.

1626
01:40:32,535 --> 01:40:33,776
Put your seatbelt on.

1627
01:40:34,633 --> 01:40:36,859
We're out of here.

1628
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:46,736
It's empty.

1629
01:40:57,276 --> 01:41:00,494
? The pack on my back is aching

1630
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:14,096
? The straps seem
to cut me like a knife

1631
01:41:17,668 --> 01:41:20,688
? I'm no clown
I won't back down

1632
01:41:29,305 --> 01:41:35,289
? I don't need you to tell me
what's going down...?

1633
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:59,283
What's his number?

1634
01:42:06,181 --> 01:42:08,906
You'll jam the line!
I'll call him!

1635
01:42:16,762 --> 01:42:18,451
My fucking batteries!

1636
01:42:18,451 --> 01:42:20,565
- You muppet!
- Give me the phone!

1637
01:42:21,337 --> 01:42:23,701
- I'll dial it!
- Tell me the number!

1638
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:38,253
- Give me your phone!
- You'll break it!

1639
01:42:38,253 --> 01:42:41,470
You'll break it
and it'll be fucked!

1640
01:42:43,015 --> 01:42:47,666
Shut it. It's fucking ringing!
