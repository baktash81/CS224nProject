1
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,982
Have you ever confused
a dream with life?

2
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,898
Or stolen something
when you have the cash?

3
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:54,819
Have you ever been blue?

4
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,978
Or thought your train moving
while sitting still?

5
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,378
Maybe I was just crazy.

6
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,578
Maybe it was the "60s.

7
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,659
Or maybe I was just a girl...

8
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,468
... interrupted.

9
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:17,740
Put her in restraints.
Withdraw blood.

10
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:18,745
Hold on.

11
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,417
Give her five milligrams
of Valium, lV.

12
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,620
Turn her head so she doesn"t aspirate.

13
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:25,865
There you go.

14
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,940
Aspirin fragments
and vodka, l think.

15
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,982
Don"t tell me what you think.
Take it to the lab.

16
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:36,145
You should check my hand.
There"s no bones in it.

17
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,259
A wrist banger.

18
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,148
-ls that why you did this?
-And other things.

19
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,700
Her parents are on the way.

20
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,465
Sometimes it"s hard...

21
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,139
...for me to stay in one...

22
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:51,942
...place.

23
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,424
Susanna...

24
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:57,063
... if you had no bones
in your hand...

25
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:00,185
...how did you pick up the aspirin?

26
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,578
What is my mother doing?

27
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,780
Would you answer my question, please?

28
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:20,379
How did you pick up the aspirin
if you had no bones in your hand?

29
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,699
By then, they"d come back.

30
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:28,097
l see.

31
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,783
No, you don"t.

32
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,184
Well...

33
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,422
...indulge me, then.

34
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,187
Explain it to me.

35
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,182
Explain what?

36
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,384
Explain to a doctor that the laws
of physics can be suspended?

37
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,581
That what goes up
may not come down?

38
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:57,982
Explain...

39
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,504
...that time...

40
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,781
...can move backwards and forwards...

41
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,901
...and now to then and back again...

42
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,346
...and you can"t control it?

43
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,741
Why can"t you control it?

44
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:15,899
What?

45
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,146
Why can"t you control time?

46
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,187
Where were you?
Everyone is here. Come on.

47
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,706
-Mary, you remember Susanna.
-Yes, l do.

48
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:52,617
You"re wearing this?

49
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,100
l didn"t know it was so early.
l would"ve changed.

50
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:58,817
Everybody, look who"s here.

51
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,545
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thanks, sweetie.

52
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,466
l"m sorry, l want to say hi to her.

53
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,584
Sweetie, would you hold this for me?
l just want to say hi to Susanna.

54
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,582
Excuse me. Susanna!

55
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,865
-Susanna!
-Professor Gilcrest"s wife.

56
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:17,179
Barbara Gilcrest.
You remember me?

57
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,619
Bonnie"s mom. l"m Bonnie"s mom.

58
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,019
Your skin is so beautiful.

59
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,106
Wasn"t Bonnie in your lit. class?

60
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:26,786
Yeah. How is she doing?

61
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,385
She just got accepted to Radcliffe.

62
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,108
What a conundrum.

63
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,782
l"m a Wellesley girl, myself.

64
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:36,425
But l think young women should
make up their own mind, don"t you?

65
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,387
Are you stoned?

66
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:47,381
Do you smoke pot?

67
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,587
Take LSD?

68
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,348
No drugs?

69
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,180
How do you feel right now?

70
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:08,988
l...

71
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,181
...don"t know.

72
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,780
l don"t know what l"m feeling.

73
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,980
You need a rest.

74
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:23,105
Well, l"ll go home, take a nap.

75
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,262
No. You need to go somewhere
where you can get a genuine rest.

76
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,787
And you"re very lucky.

77
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,338
The best place
for someone like you...

78
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,223
...is less than
a half an hour from here.

79
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,380
You don"t mean Claymoore?

80
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,300
Four days ago...

81
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,899
...you chased a bottle of aspirin
with a bottle of vodka.

82
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,780
l had a headache.

83
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,259
Your father is a friend of mine.

84
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,826
He"s a colleague.
He asked me to see you...

85
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,782
...even though l don"t do this anymore.

86
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,984
You"re hurting everyone around you.

87
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:13,184
Now, Claymoore is a topnotch place.

88
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,019
A lot of people go there.

89
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,338
Even writers.

90
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,942
Like you.

91
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:23,782
Great.

92
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,345
Yes, l"d like a cab
at 1 240 Milford, please.

93
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:43,507
My mother"s here.

94
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,985
lt"ll be less emotional
if we do it this way.

95
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,783
Your parents and l talked about it.

96
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,337
Now make sure, no stops.

97
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,980
Susanna, you there?

98
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:32,421
l want to see you again.

99
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,779
lt was a one-time thing, okay?

100
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,621
Just come to my office tonight.

101
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,262
We"re opening the presents!

102
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,619
Tell them you"re going to a friend"s.

103
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,308
Who should l tell first?

104
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,268
My parents, the department chairman,
or your wife?

105
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,305
No.

106
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,382
What did you do?

107
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:57,387
What did you do?

108
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,782
Excuse me?

109
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:04,747
Well, you look normal.

110
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,981
l"m sad.

111
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,180
Well, everyone"s sad.

112
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,466
l see things.

113
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,701
You mean, like tripping?

114
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,423
Kind of.

115
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,023
Then they should put
John Lennon away, huh?

116
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,185
l"m not John Lennon.

117
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,585
Don"t get too comfortable.

118
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,543
Shouldn"t my parents--?

119
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,501
You have to sign them, Miss Kaysen.

120
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:31,422
You"re over 1 8.
This is your decision.

121
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:44,861
l didn"t try to kill myself.

122
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,228
That"s the kind of thing you talk
about in therapy, honey. Not here.

123
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,902
Miss Kaysen?

124
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,582
You have the distinction
of being the only senior...

125
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,626
...not going on to college.

126
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,500
May l ask what you plan to do?

127
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:14,024
l plan to write.

128
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,621
Well, what do you plan to do?

129
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:23,699
Look, l"m not gonna burn my bra or
drop acid or go march on Washington...

130
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,867
...l just don"t want to end up
like my mother.

131
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,505
Women today have
more choices than that.

132
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,102
No, they don"t.

133
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:33,982
And here.

134
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,378
You forgot one, dear. Here.

135
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:46,504
Speaking for Dr. Wick and myself,
welcome to Claymoore, Susanna.

136
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,066
This is the women"s ward,
also known as South Bell.

137
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,984
This is where you"ll be staying,
and this is where l work.

138
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:00,057
All right, this is the second floor.

139
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,978
l need you to stay close to me
because it"s easy to get lost here.

140
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,180
This is our ward.

141
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,144
All right, let"s start with this room.

142
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,379
This is the art room.

143
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:24,018
Polly.

144
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:25,664
What are you doing here?

145
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,057
l feel very musical today.

146
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,982
-Can l just, for just a second?
-Not today, honey.

147
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:43,985
That"s Polly. Come on.

148
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,985
Margie, Polly was in
the art room by herself.

149
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:54,781
l"m sorry, Val.

150
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:59,782
The living room.

151
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,380
Everyone hates it.

152
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,139
And these are the phones.

153
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,381
To make a call, pick up
the handle, tell the nurse...

154
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,227
...she"ll connect you.

155
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:22,905
This is the nurses" station,
which is self-explanatory...

156
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,186
...and this is the TV room,
where everyone hangs out.

157
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,345
l want my fucking clothes!

158
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,184
Then you"ll have to
eat something, won"t you?

159
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:34,784
The check-in board.

160
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,623
You check in here to take
a walk on the grounds.

161
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,467
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of hay

162
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,587
Gotta jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of cotton

163
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,984
Jump down, spin around
Pick a bale of hay

164
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:47,787
She thinks that bothers me.

165
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,668
You"re an "" R,"" which means
"" restricted to the ward.""

166
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:53,343
But soon you"ll
move up to two-to-ones...

167
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,699
...which is two nurses
to every patient.

168
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,986
l won"t be here that long.
l"m just here for a rest.

169
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:02,983
lt"s all right. Everybody gets
the same tour free of charge.

170
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,746
Georgina, this is Susanna,
your new roommate.

171
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,786
Oh, great. Hi.

172
00:15:14,349 --> 00:15:16,909
You"re lucky.
Georgina"s an excellent roommate.

173
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,744
Why, thank you, Valerie.

174
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,582
You"re welcome.

175
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:24,029
The cops are bringing Lisa.
She was at the park.

176
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,225
Will you excuse me?
l have business l have to attend to.

177
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:34,264
Georgina, will you take Susanna
to the dining room in a half-hour?

178
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,341
Yes means yes, Georgina.

179
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,381
l know.

180
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,338
Groovy box.

181
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:58,988
That.

182
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,580
Yeah, they"re French.

183
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:04,582
The French Resistance
smoked them, l think.

184
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,346
-Read this?

185
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:17,781
No. l saw the movie
a bunch of times, though.

186
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:20,420
The movie"s based on the first book.

187
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:24,417
l read that one too, but there were
no ruby slippers in it originally.

188
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,701
They added that.
This takes place afterwards.

189
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,782
Dorothy doesn"t really have
such a big part in this one.

190
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,381
Fucking pig.

191
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,388
Get off me!

192
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,299
Thanks, Gretta.

193
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,625
Hey, Dais, let anyone
in your room yet?

194
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,982
Hey, girls! Hey, sexy.

195
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,386
lt"s good to be home.

196
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,540
-Hey, Torch.
-Hey, Lisa.

197
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,865
-You miss me?
-Not much.

198
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,388
Get her to her room.
Gretta will do the strip search.

199
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:22,708
Who"s that with Georgie-girl?

200
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,019
-Where"s Jamie?
-l can"t deal with this.

201
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,180
Don"t give me a hard time.

202
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,502
Where is she? Where"s Jamie?

203
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,468
Who are you?

204
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:39,179
Her name is Susanna, Lisa.
She smokes French cigarettes.

205
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,666
-Why is all your shit on her bed?
-Open the damn door!

206
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,308
Why? Where"s Jamie?

207
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,382
l don"t know what
you"re talking about!

208
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:50,980
What the hell are you doing, Lisa?

209
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:53,618
Back off her.

210
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,424
Back off!
You"ve been gone for two weeks.

211
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:59,422
A lot of shit has gone down.
Back off!

212
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:00,784
How"d she do it?

213
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,583
How"d she do it?

214
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:04,942
How did she do it, Valerie?

215
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:06,941
Get the fuck off me!

216
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:10,579
You weak people. You"re all weak
fucking people! You"re victims!

217
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,262
You people are fucking sick!

218
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,148
What? No, no.
Val, please. Please!

219
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,987
Get her legs.

220
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,105
Get her feet!

221
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,418
-l got her.
-Get off!

222
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,588
Help!

223
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:36,180
We have got to cut those nails again.

224
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:45,783
My God! What the hell was that?

225
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,861
That was Lisa.

226
00:18:49,189 --> 00:18:51,225
And Jamie was your roommate?

227
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,266
Jamie was Lisa"s best friend.

228
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:56,105
She was sad because Lisa ran away...

229
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,419
...so she hung herself with
a volleyball net.

230
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:09,787
Meds!

231
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,946
Cynthia Crowley.

232
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,385

233
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,100
Susanna Kaysen.

234
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:25,663

235
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:28,144

-They"ll help you sleep.

236
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,258
-lt"s 1 0:30. l"m not gonna--
-For chrissake.

237
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:34,222
You can discuss it in the morning
with your doctor.

238
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,699
ln the meantime,
we"ll agree to disagree.

239
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,339
Take them here. Have some water.

240
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,386
Polly Clark.

241
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,586
You can go now.

242
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,703

243
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,380

00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,580
Donna Smith.

247
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,267
Ryan Reed...

248
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:01,941
...yearbook editor and member
of the honour society.

249
00:21:02,189 --> 00:21:04,259
Heading off to Tulane University.

250
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:05,982
Congratulations, son.

251
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:11,584
Andrea Jacobs, president of
the French club and honour society...

252
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,384
...and on her way to Sarah Lawrence.

253
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,741
Susanna Kaysen.

254
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:22,742
-What is she doing?
-Some kind of a stunt.

255
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,580
Wake up, freak.

256
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,659
Checks.

257
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,785
Why do they do that?

258
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,185
They"re just doing checks.

259
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:05,387
They"ll space them out
after you"ve been here awhile.

260
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:12,986
That girl, Polly.

261
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:15,986
How did she get all...?

262
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,221
When she was 1 0...

263
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,621
...her mother told her
she had to give away her puppy...

264
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:25,548
...because he was giving her a rash.

265
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,862
And so Polly went...

266
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:32,183
...and found her father"s gas can...

267
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:36,258
...and she poured it all over
where she was getting the rash.

268
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:38,782
And then...

269
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,700
...she lit a match.

270
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,061
Oh, my God.

271
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,739
Well, what about you?
Why are you here?

272
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,303
Pseudologia fantastica.

273
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,382
What"s that?

274
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:05,189
l"m a pathological liar.

275
00:23:57,749 --> 00:23:59,785
-What are your plans this fall?
-What?

276
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,980
What are your plans this fall?

277
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,668
l don"t have any.

278
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:06,258
l"m gonna be an ethnobotanist.

279
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,228
Full scholarship to M.l.T.

280
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,266
l"m going to join the Krishnas.

281
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:14,984
Hare Krishna?
That"s interesting, actually.

282
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:17,181
l was kidding.

283
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,181
You"re Susanna, right?

284
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,503
l"m Toby.
Andrea Jacobs" brother.

285
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,180
l was at graduation.

286
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:49,347
You"re pretty when you sleep.

287
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,986
Checks. lt"s 7:00.

288
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,225
l mean, everybody thinks
about it at some point.

289
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,787
How would you do it?

290
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,428
l don"t know.

291
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:22,186
l guess l haven"t really
thought about it.

292
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:29,224
See, once it"s
in your head, though...

293
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:32,622
...you become this...

294
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,062
...strange, new breed.

295
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:40,545
A life form that loves
to fantasize about its own demise.

296
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,906
Make a stupid remark, kill yourself.

297
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:48,421
You like the movie, you live.
You miss the train, kill yourself.

298
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:50,825
What?

299
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:54,338
Let"s not talk about
this anymore, okay?

300
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:55,982
Why?

301
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,661
Because it"s...

302
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:04,381
...stupid.

303
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:12,945
What?

304
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:18,265
What are you doing?

305
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:23,508
What? Because l don"t want to kill
myself? That"s not cool to you?

306
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,545
l don"t wanna die.
l was just talking.

307
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,667
Look, Susanna, the world
is fucked up, okay?

308
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,945
lt"s so fucked up that if some...

309
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:35,181
...draft zombie pulls my
birthday out of a barrel...

310
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,862
...l"m gonna die.

311
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:39,304
When"s your birthday?

312
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,061
December 30th.

313
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:47,468
l"ll pray for you.

314
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:50,865
Checks.

315
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,587
You asked for this?

316
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:31,144
Are you gonna watch?

317
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:36,587
Afraid so. That"s why there"s
so many fuzzy-legged women here.

318
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:43,340
Has anybody ever watched you shave?

319
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:47,067
l got two kids and one bathroom.
What do you think?

320
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,778
l think you should lock the door.

321
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:56,178
-September 14th.

322
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:01,578
-Zero-zero-two.
-Bingo.

323
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,824
-Bingo. Bingo.
-December 30th.

324
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,587
Oh, my God.

325
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,187
-Bingo.
-Zero-zero-three.

326
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,624
A guy l know was just drafted.

327
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:17,738
What"s his name?

328
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:21,185
Toby.

329
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:24,787
He"s dead now.

330
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:32,424
Get out, Lisa!

331
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,899
l"m not in your room.
l"m right here.

332
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,982
-l was gonna offer you nail polish.
-Get out!

333
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:43,025
-You"re looking better, Lisa.
-Why, thanks, Margie.

334
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:45,225
-How"s the engagement?
-You know.

335
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:46,782
No, l don"t.
l"ve been away.

336
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:50,387
Joe wants me to--
Before the wedding.

337
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,989
Fuck his brains out.
Use a rubber.

338
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:56,587
Gosh, hell, no.

339
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,262
Can l bum one?

340
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,624
Go ahead.

341
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,467
So have you had your
first Melvin yet?

342
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:45,858
Who"s that?

343
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,988
Bald guy with a little pecker
and a fat wife.

344
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:51,108
Your therapist, sweet pea.

345
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:53,944
Unless...

346
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:56,305
...unless they"re giving you shocks.

347
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:58,585
Or, God forbid, letting you out.

348
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:01,297
Then you"ll see the great,
wonderful Dr. Dyke.

349
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,982
She means Dr. Wick.

350
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,539
l"ve seen his office
but haven"t met him.

351
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,865
He"s a she.
Dr. Wick"s a girl.

352
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,783
That"s right, M-G.
Wick"s a chick.

353
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:14,947
Hence the nickname.

354
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:19,262
Hey, Lil.
When the fuck is my checkup?

355
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:22,821
lt"s now, Lisa.
You said you"d be in your room.

356
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,543
Can"t sit too long
without popping the hood.

357
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,064
Asshole!

358
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,619
You have Melvin in half an hour.
l"ll take you there.

359
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:47,864
l"m sorry.

360
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:51,340
-Why are you using the past tense?

361
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,581
What do you mean?

362
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,547
Well, he was...

363
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:59,902
...only drafted today,
so chances are, he"s not dead yet.

364
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:03,746
He probably has several months...

365
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,940
...before he even reports.

366
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,940
He was just a nice guy, that"s all.
And it made me feel bad.

367
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:14,145
You"ve been feeling bad in general.

368
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:17,468
Right?
You"ve been feeling depressed.

369
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,460
l haven"t exactly been
a ball of joy, Melvin.

370
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:25,543
l understand you tried
to kill yourself last week.

371
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:28,863
Anything you want to
tell me about that?

372
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:30,947
l had a headache.

373
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:36,461
So l assume you took the recommended
aspirin dosage for a headache.

374
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:38,947
l didn"t try to kill myself.

375
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:40,741
What were you trying to do?

376
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:43,184
l was trying to make the shit stop.

377
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,624
The time-jumps, the depression...

378
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:49,905
...the headaches, the thing
with your hand?

379
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:52,742
All of the above.

380
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:55,898
l see.

381
00:31:58,189 --> 00:32:00,259
Paul is dead!

382
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:11,547
What is it?
Are you puzzled about something?

383
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:15,138
Yeah, l guess l am, Melvin.

384
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:18,625
l"m puzzled as to why
l have to be in a mental institution.

385
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:20,741
You put yourself here.

386
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,661
My parents put me here.

387
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:26,458
No, they didn"t.

388
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:29,145
Everyone here"s fucking crazy!

389
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:31,222
You wanna go home.

390
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:36,147
Same problem.

391
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,742
M-G, look at me.

392
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,422
Play with me.

393
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:45,545
Don"t be sad. Don"t be sad.

394
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:55,418
Thank you.

395
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:30,984
-What are these?
-Colace. lt"s just a laxative.

396
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:33,145
l don"t need them.

397
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:34,988
Are we going to have a problem?

398
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,180
Are we going to have a problem?

399
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,346
Are we going to have a problem?

400
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:43,343
May l see?

401
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:44,664
Thank you.

402
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,547
Surrender.

403
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:48,901
Are we going to have a problem?

404
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,622
No problem.

405
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,099
Phone call, booth one.

406
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:00,544
-Hello?
-Hold on.

407
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,460
-Susanna?
-Hi, Mom.

408
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,148
Hi, honey.
Your father"s on too.

409
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:09,102
He"s just back from reserves.
He got stuck at Dulles.

410
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,817
How are you, honey?

411
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,789
-l"m fine, Dad.
-You know, sweetheart--

412
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:19,786
lf you can"t give me Ex-Lax,
can l please have some Colace?

413
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:22,304
No. No more laxatives.

414
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,940
l can get her some prune juice.

415
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:28,148
Prune juice!

416
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:30,467
This is outrageous!

417
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:34,338
She was wondering if you"d
made new friends, and I said.:

418
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:37,502
""No, Mom, this isn"t Camp Winnetka. ""

419
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,985
-Daisy?
-Fuck off.

420
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:46,345
l have something you want.

421
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,137
Come in.

422
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:25,303
You"re all packed up.

423
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:27,945
Yeah, l"m leaving in a month.

424
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,861
My dad got me an apartment.

425
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:33,704
-Really? Where?
-lt"s near the airport.

426
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:37,988
One bedroom, two baths, eat-in chicken.
He fixed it up real nice for me.

427
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,503
You mean eat-in kitchen.

428
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,384
That"s what l said, asshole.

429
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,740
So what do you have that l want?

430
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:50,778
Put it on the bed.

431
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:52,418
Put yours on the bed.

432
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,467
Oh, Jesus. Get out!

433
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:55,983
Get out!

434
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:58,504
Don"t take advantage
just because she"s new.

435
00:35:58,749 --> 00:35:59,579
Pony up some Valium.

436
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,741
Get the fuck out,
or l"m calling Valerie! Valerie!

437
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:04,786
Why don"t you call Valerie?

438
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:09,028
Call Valerie and ask her for some
Colace, like Susie Q"s got in her hand.

439
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:10,901
Why does it stink in here?

440
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,057
l don"t take Valium.

441
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:14,822
l know. That"s the point.

442
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:17,537
They give them to you,
and you don"t take them.

443
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:19,387
Are you gonna eat that?

444
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:20,948
Checks.

445
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:22,861
You"ve got visitors, Daisy.

446
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:24,861
l want some fucking Colace.

447
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:27,339
Talk to Melvin tomorrow.

448
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:41,737
You know what l think?
l think you want to poop, Daisy.

449
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,746
l think it"s been days.

450
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,387
Look, it"s okay. l don"t care.

451
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,545
l do! l do care.

452
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:56,142
So Daddy buys you a private,
and no one gets in, huh?

453
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,824
You never leave except when Valerie
makes you go to the cafeteria...

454
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:04,027
...where you never eat.
You"re a laxative junkie.

455
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:09,944
l always thought you were like Janet,
but here you are with this chicken.

456
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:13,140
So what"s with that, huh?

457
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:17,024
My dad owns a deli, asshole,
with a rotisserie.

458
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:20,938
l like my dad"s chicken. When
l eat something else, l puke.

459
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,662
But why do you eat it here? Why don"t
you like to go to the cafeteria?

460
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:27,781
Which do you like better?

461
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,145
Taking a dump alone
or with Valerie watching?

462
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,138
Alone.

463
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:35,587
Everyone likes to be alone
when it comes out.

464
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,581
l like to be alone when it goes in.

465
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:40,707
To me, the cafeteria"s
like being with...

466
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,940
...20 girls all at once taking a dump.

467
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:45,946
That is fucked up, Daisy!

468
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,304
Come on.

469
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:56,538
All right, assholes.
Fine, here.

470
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:03,778
Here.

471
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:14,463
Lisa, don"t!

472
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,824
No, please--

473
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,826
Dios-fucking-mio!

474
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,220
That"s how Daddy
knows she"s eating.

475
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:28,547
When l get five, Valerie
makes me throw them away.

476
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:43,226
Scribble, scribble, scribble.

477
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,147
Written anything about me yet?

478
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,987
Don"t do that.

479
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:00,227
ls Daisy really getting out?

480
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:06,187
She coughed up a big one.

481
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:10,339
How can--?
l mean, she"s insane.

482
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,178
That"s what ""ther-rape-me""
is all about.

483
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:17,223
That"s why fucking Freud"s
picture"s on every shrink"s wall.

484
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:22,219
He created an industry. You lie down,
confess your secrets, and you"re saved.

485
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:26,904
The more you confess, the more they
think about setting you free.

486
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:29,498
But what if you don"t have a secret?

487
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,539
Then you"re a lifer, like me.

488
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:36,818
l was changing her diaper...

489
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:39,499
...and l turned to get the powder...

490
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:43,147
...and while my back was turned,
she rolled off the bed.

491
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,748
She rolled off the bed
and broke her leg.

492
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:52,860
The doctor put her in a body cast,
but also strapped her down.

493
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,339
-This has nothing--
-You never told me this.

494
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,585
Carl planned this trip
to Santa Monica.

495
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:02,027
He had a commitment at RAND.
So we took her with us.

496
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:05,667
On the back seat, strapped to this
board, 4000 miles.

497
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:09,219
lf you like, Mrs. Kaysen,
we can discuss this...

498
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:12,023
...further on the way out.

499
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:14,942
Just how long is my daughter
going to be here?

500
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:16,901
With all due respect, Mr. Kaysen...

501
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:21,188
...psychiatry and economics
are different.

502
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:24,426
The length of Susanna"s stay
isn"t fixed.

503
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,427
lt depends on her response
to treatment.

504
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,462
For what? Depression?

505
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:35,180
lt"s almost Christmas. What do we say
to the people who care about her?

506
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,820
See, what"s going on here is...

507
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:42,625
...my parents are having a little
holiday cocktail Christmas party crisis.

508
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:43,864
What?

509
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:48,468
What"s the "" borderline"" business
you mentioned?

510
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:53,904
l don"t think that"s useful to Susanna.

511
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:56,265
-l mean, not--
-What "" borderline business""?

512
00:40:56,509 --> 00:40:58,306
-The mind--
-Borderline what?

513
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:00,665
Borderline between what and what?

514
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,740
lt"s a condition, Susanna.

515
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:06,383
And it"s called
Borderline Personality Disorder.

516
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:08,665
Oh, God.

517
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,867
lt"s not uncommon.

518
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,385
Especially among young women.

519
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,940
What causes it?

520
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,827
We"re really not sure.

521
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,021
-ls it genetic?
-Oh, Christ!

522
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:24,378
lt is five times more common...

523
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,428
...among those with a borderline...

524
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:29,018
...parent.

525
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:35,780
l can"t do this. l"m sorry, l can"t.
l can"t do this.

526
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:53,548
"" Razors pain you; rivers are damp;
acid stains you; drugs cause cramp.

527
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:55,939
Guns aren"t lawful;
nooses give...

528
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:59,141
...gas smells awful;
you might as well live.""

529
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:00,544
Gin.

530
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,589
-Asshole.
-Fatso.

531
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:22,538
Call me a cab.

532
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:24,423
Okay, you"re a cab.

533
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:32,104
Lisa said you got into Daisy"s room.

534
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:35,340
And it was full of chickens.

535
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:37,744
Susanna, you have a phone call.

536
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:44,178
So what"s your ""diag-nonsense""?

537
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:47,540
-Who is this?
-What"d he say to Mom and Pop?

538
00:42:56,029 --> 00:42:57,985
l have a borderline personality.

539
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,780
Well, that"s nothing.
What else?

540
00:43:01,029 --> 00:43:03,862
He didn"t say. He thought
it would affect my recovery.

541
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,542
Tongue your meds tonight.

542
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,542
After 1 :00 checks,
Gretta always goes for a smoke.

543
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:13,185
Check the mirrors. If they"re
clear, go to Hector"s closet.

544
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,461
It"s near the art room,
and it will be open.

545
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:33,348
Torch!

546
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:35,903
Come on.

547
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,903
This is how Lisa gets out
when she escapes!

548
00:44:00,629 --> 00:44:04,463
We"re under administration, so....
No good here.

549
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,979
Good thing this place has
a sliding scale.

550
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:09,902
We get to mingle with
the lock-picking trash.

551
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:35,901
Good job!

552
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:39,587
Susanna, you"re up!

553
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:42,468
No, no, no. l"ve only done
this once in my life.

554
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:43,864
-Come on.
-Please.

555
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:47,306
-We came all the way here.
-Come on!

556
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,137
All right!

557
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:40,948
They put the tunnels in so the loons
didn"t have to go out in the cold.

558
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:43,185
l must"ve missed that in the brochure.

559
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:48,941
Hey, open the door.

560
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,741
What the fuck are you doing?

561
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:18,749
Dr. Wick"s office.

562
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:34,504
All right. Georgina Tuskin.

563
00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:48,140

564
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:52,341

00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:59,386
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

Fuck you, Melvin.

570
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,257
Wanna see mine?

571
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:49,941

No remission observed.""
That was before you ran away.

577
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:17,227
We"re very rare, and mostly men.

578
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,227
Lisa thinks she"s hot shit
because she"s a sociopath.

579
00:48:20,429 --> 00:48:22,306

That"s everybody.

00:48:49,149 --> 00:48:51,583
l mean, what kind of sex isn"t casual?

591
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,259
They mean promiscuous.

592
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:56,467

No. lt"s all right.

597
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:30,628
You know, taking us
for ice creams in a blizzard...

598
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:33,377
...makes you wonder who
the real whack jobs are.

599
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:35,261
You know, l think it"s
kind of nice.

600
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:39,667
l mean, l think it"s nice to do
something nice on Daisy"s last day.

601
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:08,383
Oh, fuck!

602
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:09,948

Can l have peppermint stick?

00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:13,388
Sure.

605
00:50:13,629 --> 00:50:15,745
lt"s just called peppermint.

606
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:17,342
Peppermint dick!

Peppermint clit!

608
00:50:23,709 --> 00:50:26,064
Okay. We"re just gonna
have four cones.

609
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:27,583
Four cones.

610
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:30,626
Susanna, do you want anything?

611
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:31,864

Yes.

615
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:45,739
Can l have a vanilla sundae

616
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:49,305
...and sprinkles.
Rainbow, not chocolate.

617

Let"s have a seat, ladies.

622
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:20,219
Melvin thought that l should
live in a halfway house.

623
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:24,346
But my father knew
that l deserved my own apartment.

624
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:26,785
So he got me the prettiest apartment.

625
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:29,139

626
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:33,501

...is like in the phone book.

630
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:42,743
There"s a sign
right outside that says:

"" lf you lived here...

00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,058

-That"s great.
-You know, l know all about you...

642
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:11,903
...and l hope they put you away forever.

643

ls this the professor"s wife?

644
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:15,784
What professor?

645
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:17,462
So you told everybody.

646

-Was l talking to you?
-Let"s go.

648
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,062
No, you"re spitting on me,
so mellow-fucking-out.

649
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,378
Don"t tell me what to do.

650
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:29,740
Look, she gave your husband
a rim job. Big fucking deal!

651
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:32,867
He was begging for it,
and l heard it was like a pencil.

652
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:34,337
How dare you!

653
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:38,264
Some advice: Don"t point your
fucking finger at crazy people!

654
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,583
Let go of me!

655
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:44,905
Mother?

656
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:47,105
Get that out of my face, asshole!

657
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,545
Let go!

658
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:51,825
Now.

659
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:54,578
Stop it!

660
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:58,745
"" Rank"" you!
Come again, Mrs. Professor!

661
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:01,345
You shared a man with that woman?

662
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:10,587
-Did you enjoy the fresh air?
-Yeah, thanks.

663
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:14,020
Good. Because it"s the last time
you"re leaving the ward.

664
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:17,743

665
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:24,627
Okay, raise your arms. Very good.
We"re going to be trees.

666
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:28,260
Feel the strength in your arms
as the branches.

667
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:31,069
And reach those branches up to the sky.

668
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,665
Come on, Susanna, reach.
Very good!

669
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:36,661
Lisa, all right.

670
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:39,702
Reach your arms, girls.
Reach. Really lift.

671
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:41,740
Feel the stretch through the hip.

672
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:44,383
Very good.
Let your arms be branches.

673
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,739
There"s strength in those branches.

674
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:51,819
Reach, reach all the way up
into the sky. Very good.

675
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:55,863
Let the wind blow the leaves
and let your fingers be the leaves.

676
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,464
Good, M-G, very good.
Feel the wind.

677
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,019
Good. Good, Lisa.

678
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:02,941
Very good.

679
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:06,426
Just lift up. Lift up.
Very good, girls.

680
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,978
Now feel your feet.
Feel your feet be rooted.

681
00:54:09,189 --> 00:54:11,419
Go down into a plie.
Very good.

682
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:14,229
Good, girls. Polly, very good.

683
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:17,939
Now stretch it. The wind"s blowing
really hard this way.

684
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,547
That is not fair.
That is not fair!

685
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:22,977
That is not fair!

686
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:26,140
Seventy-four is the perfect weight!

687
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,188
Good luck, crazy bitch.

688
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:34,859
What kind of tree can you be
down there on the floor?

689
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:37,629
l"m a fucking shrub, all right?

690
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,659
Martin Luther King Jr. was killed
tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.

691
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:03,657
He was shot as he stood
on the balcony of his hotel room.

692
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:05,827
Last night, he said this.:

693
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,338
I don"t know what will happen now.

694
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:11,498
We"ve got some difficult days ahead.

695
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:15,264
But it really doesn"t matter
with me now...

696
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:18,023
...because I"ve been
to the mountaintop.

697
00:56:29,309 --> 00:56:31,425
Susanna, you have a visitor.

698
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:37,058
What are you doing here?

699
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:44,018
l ship out next week.

700
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:46,818
Here.

701
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,022
Checks.

702
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:07,222
Sorry.

703
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:11,538
No. lt"s okay. We have
1 0 minutes till they come back.

704
00:57:21,589 --> 00:57:22,783
Hey, Torch.

705
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:25,620
What you doing?

706
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,624
Nothing.

707
00:57:28,189 --> 00:57:31,420
Well, why don"t you go to
your room and do nothing?

708
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:43,422
Checks.

709
00:57:45,509 --> 00:57:46,828
Checks.

710
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:51,258
Checks.

711
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:55,664
Hey, Margie.

712
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,820
-Hey, Lisa.
-What you doing?

713
00:57:58,029 --> 00:58:00,065
-Checks.
-How"s Joe?

714
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,027
He"s fine.

715
00:58:02,589 --> 00:58:04,102
l have to do my checks.

716
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:07,386
Taking five minutes for me
would be a dereliction of duty?

717
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:10,421
What if l had a punctured artery?

718
00:58:10,669 --> 00:58:12,819
You"d go on your rounds,
ignoring my wounds?

719
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:15,663
-Stop it.
-Stop what? Look at this.

720
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:17,144
Go ahead. Go ahead.

721
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:18,583
That"s enough!

722
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:21,303
Take one step
and l"ll jam this in my aorta!

723
00:58:21,549 --> 00:58:22,618
Stop it.

724
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:24,626
Your aorta is in your chest.

725
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:27,988
Good to know.

726
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:31,542
-l"ll make a note of that.
-Good.

727
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:42,668
You have grounds privileges.
Why don"t you take a walk?

728
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:45,345
Go get a cup of coffee.

729
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:51,107
We should get out of here.

730
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,188
The cafeteria"s this way.

731
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:09,822
My wheels are here.

732
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:11,866
Wait. What are we doing?

733
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,385
We"re going to Canada.

734
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:23,907
You"re not crazy.

735
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:26,464
Okay? You don"t need to be here.

736
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:30,469
l tried to kill myself, Toby.

737
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,862
-You took some aspirin.
-l took a bottle of aspirin.

738
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:40,307
That buys you a year in this place?
That"s bullshit, okay?

739
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:41,578
They"re breaking you.

740
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:44,902
Come on. All right?
Everything"s changing, man.

741
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,299
What do they know
about being normal?

742
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:51,701
l have friends in here.

743
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:55,463
Who? Them?

744
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:57,825
Those girls--
Susanna...

745
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:03,018
...they"re eating grapes
off of the wallpaper.

746
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:04,862
They"re insane.

747
01:00:05,389 --> 01:00:07,823
lf they are, l am.

748
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,587
No, baby.
Listen, come with me.

749
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:19,224
Look...

750
01:00:20,229 --> 01:00:22,459
...my dad gave me five grand.

751
01:00:23,029 --> 01:00:26,863
Okay? We can go up there.
We can build a cabin in the woods.

752
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:31,304
Look, l know that this sounds crazy...

753
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:35,221
...but l think l love you.

754
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:38,864
So come with me. Okay?

755
01:00:40,509 --> 01:00:42,227
Come with me.

756
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,266
You wanna leave, don"t you?

757
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:54,584
Yes.

758
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,020
l wanna leave.

759
01:01:00,269 --> 01:01:02,021
But not with you.

760
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:07,222
Not with you.

761
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:10,427
l"m sorry.

762
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:14,420
Susanna, wait a second.

763
01:01:57,989 --> 01:01:59,820
Why did you do that?

764
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:05,823
Fix the light bulb at night?

765
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:09,979
l"m not here in the morning...

766
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:13,785
...and that"s when you like to draw
your pictures and stuff.

767
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:15,104
So....

768
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:26,864
John?

769
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,620
Why do you like me?

770
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:40,545
l just like you.

771
01:02:41,709 --> 01:02:43,301
That"s all.

772
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,943
l wish you were getting
better, though.

773
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:49,222
l would....

774
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:54,218
l"d take you out to go see
a movie or something.

775
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,427
That"d be nice.

776
01:03:00,389 --> 01:03:01,504
My face!

777
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:05,548
My face!

778
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:07,780
l"m okay. l"m okay.

779
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:09,860
-Let her be. She"s fine.
-My face!

780
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:11,178
My face!

781
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:13,619
Seclusion.
Take her to Seclusion. Come on.

782
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:15,622
l got you.

783
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:19,822
-My face! Why?
-Open it.

784
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:22,621
My face!

785
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:24,182
My face!

786
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,627
Quieten down. Quieten down.
You"re all right.

787
01:03:30,189 --> 01:03:32,987
l"m ugly! My face!

788
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:36,386
l"m ugly! Why?

789
01:03:59,509 --> 01:04:01,227
What happened to Polly?

790
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,467
What needs to happen?
No one"s ever gonna kiss her.

791
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:11,423
They"re building a new
Disneyland in Florida.

792
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:15,146
lf l could have any job,
l"d be a professional Cinderella.

793
01:04:15,869 --> 01:04:17,461
You could be Snow White.

794
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:20,064
Polly could be Minnie Mouse and then...

795
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:22,146
...she"d be hugged, kissed
and loved...

796
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:25,625
...and no one would know
what"s inside that giant head.

797
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,820
Give me your keys.

798
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:55,825
Hey, Polly.

799
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,984
lt"s Susanna.

800
01:04:58,189 --> 01:04:59,702
Just play something.

801
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:03,226
lf talking did shit,
we"d be out of here by now.

802
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:27,461
When you"re alone
And life is making you lonely

803
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:30,706
You can always go

804
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:32,661
Downtown

805
01:05:40,669 --> 01:05:44,503
When you"ve got worries
All the noise and the hurry

806
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:48,179
Seems to help, I know

807
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,507
Downtown

808
01:05:57,909 --> 01:06:00,469
Just listen to the music

809
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:03,229
In the traffic in the city

810
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:07,947
Linger on the sidewalks
Where the neon lights are pretty

811
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:11,181
How can you lose?

812
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,267
The lights are much brighter there

813
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:20,185
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares and go downtown

814
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:22,021
Back to your room, please.

815
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:25,983
Things will be great when you"re
Downtown

816
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:28,339
McWilley is gonna wake up.

817
01:06:28,589 --> 01:06:29,908
Give me the guitar.

818
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,508
You"re gonna get me fired.

819
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:37,139
You"ll be dancing with him
Before the night is over

820
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:39,180
-Give me the guitar.
-Happy again

821
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,268
No. No.

822
01:06:42,629 --> 01:06:44,699
lt"s okay. lt"s okay.
Come here.

823
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:47,144
You"ll get me fired.
You know that?

824
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,868
Downtown

825
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,578
Everything"s great...

826
01:07:05,069 --> 01:07:09,187
... when you"re downtown

827
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:35,868
l"m writing you up.

828
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:38,418
l am sick of this bullshit.

829
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,027
ls she here?

830
01:07:45,509 --> 01:07:47,386
You can go in now.

831
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:56,865
-What did she do?
-They drugged Nurse McWilley.

832
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:05,264
-Good morning, Susanna.
-Good morning.

833
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:06,504
How are you?

834
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,425
l"m fine, l guess.

835
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:13,422
Sit down.

836
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:23,988
You look tired.

837
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:30,864
Polly freaked out last night and we
stayed up singing to her, Lisa and l.

838
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,228
Have you become friends with Lisa?

839
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:38,747
Why? ls that bad?

840
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,628
-Does it feel bad?
-No.

841
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:45,381
Before you came here, did you
have many girlfriends?

842
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:47,422
Not really.

843
01:08:49,389 --> 01:08:53,177
Would you say that before you came here,
your friends consisted mainly...

844
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:54,788
...of boys, of men?

845
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:58,624
Does it say in there
that l"m promiscuous?

846
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:01,220
Why do you choose that word?

847
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:04,865
How many guys would l have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous?

848
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:07,139
Textbook promiscuous?

849
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:09,062
What do you think?

850
01:09:09,309 --> 01:09:12,506
Ten. Eight. Five.

851
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:16,739
How many girls would a guy have to sleep
with to be considered promiscuous?

852
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:18,826
Ten? 20? 1 09?

853
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,940
Someone who"s compulsively
promiscuous...

854
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:24,386
...might engage in a sex act
with a guest in their room...

855
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:29,504
...and then engage in another sex act
during the same day with an orderly.

856
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:38,299
Am l in trouble for kissing an orderly
or giving my boyfriend a blowjob?

857
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,106
Melvin says...

858
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:46,507
...you have some very interesting
theories about your illness.

859
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:50,622
You believe there is
a mystical undertow in life.

860
01:09:50,829 --> 01:09:53,980
""Quicksands of shadows.""

861
01:09:54,189 --> 01:09:58,182
Another one of my theories is that you
people don"t know what you"re doing.

862
01:09:58,429 --> 01:10:01,262
You acknowledge a problem
coping with this quicksand.

863
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:05,297
l have a problem coping with this
hospital. l wanna leave.

864
01:10:07,229 --> 01:10:08,298
l can"t do that.

865
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:11,069
l signed myself in,
l can sign myself out.

866
01:10:11,309 --> 01:10:14,665
You signed yourself into our care.
We decide when you leave.

867
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:16,741
You"re not ready for it, Susanna.

868
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:19,868
Your progress has plateaued.

869
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,500
Does that disappoint you?

870
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:25,661
l"m ambivalent.

871
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:28,459
ln fact, that"s my new favourite word.

872
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:31,103
Do you know what that means,
ambivalence?

873
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:32,744
l don"t care.

874
01:10:32,989 --> 01:10:34,900
lf it"s your favourite word,
l would"ve--

875
01:10:35,109 --> 01:10:37,577
lt means "" l don"t care.""
That"s what it means.

876
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:40,263
On the contrary, Susanna.

877
01:10:40,509 --> 01:10:45,219
Ambivalence suggests strong
feelings in opposition.

878
01:10:45,469 --> 01:10:48,381
The prefix, as in ambidextrous...

879
01:10:48,589 --> 01:10:50,102
...means "" both.""

880
01:10:50,869 --> 01:10:54,145
The rest of it, in Latin,
means ""vigour.""

881
01:10:54,749 --> 01:10:57,502
The word suggests that you are torn...

882
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:00,544
...between two opposing courses
of action.

883
01:11:04,109 --> 01:11:06,179
Will l stay or will l go?

884
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:09,740
Am l sane or am l crazy?

885
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:11,707
Those aren"t courses of action.

886
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:15,939
They can be, dear, for some.

887
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,145
Well, then, it"s the wrong word.

888
01:11:18,509 --> 01:11:19,624
No.

889
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,947
l think it"s perfect.

890
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:37,982
""What world is this?

891
01:11:38,469 --> 01:11:39,948
What kingdom?

892
01:11:41,189 --> 01:11:44,181
What shores of what worlds?""

893
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:49,224
lt"s a very big question
you"re faced with, Susanna.

894
01:11:49,869 --> 01:11:52,508
The choice of your life.

895
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:56,820
How much will you indulge
in your flaws?

896
01:11:58,029 --> 01:12:00,862
What are your flaws?
Are they flaws?

897
01:12:01,629 --> 01:12:06,544
lf you embrace them, will you commit
yourself to hospital for life?

898
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:11,418
Big questions, big decisions.

899
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:16,622
Not surprising you profess
carelessness about them.

900
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:24,822
ls that it?

901
01:12:26,669 --> 01:12:28,227
For now.

902
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:39,019
This way, Susanna.

903
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:55,098
John was moved to the men"s ward.

904
01:12:56,589 --> 01:13:00,025
And Lisa never came back
from Dr. Wick"s office.

905
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:29,104
We live in a time of doubt.

906
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:33,420
The institutions we once trusted
no longer seem reliable.

907
01:13:37,909 --> 01:13:41,140
Daisy sent us a postcard
all about her new apartment.

908
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,825
She got a pussycat.

909
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:46,625
Where"s Lisa?

910
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:49,620
You know where she is.

911
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:53,264
They just put her in another ward.

912
01:14:04,269 --> 01:14:06,829
l think you need to get up.

913
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:10,858
l"m just gonna rest for a while,
just a little while.

914
01:14:18,669 --> 01:14:19,545
What are you doing?

915
01:14:22,669 --> 01:14:23,863
Fuck!

916
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:28,022
Sorry, too cold?

917
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:31,944
What the fuck are you doing?
Get me the fuck out of this tub!

918
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,504
Get yourself out.

919
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:35,781
Where"s Lisa?

920
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:38,421
Where the fuck is Lisa?

921
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:40,826
Can"t hack it without her?

922
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:45,108
You banish her for singing to Polly.
We were trying to help her!

923
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:50,379
We were trying to help her! This place
is a fucking fascist torture chamber!

924
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:51,738
No.

925
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:55,664
l worked in state hospitals.
This place is a five-star hotel.

926
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,381
Oh, lordy, pick a bale of cotton

927
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:04,865
You know, l can take a lot of crazy
shit from a lot of crazy people...

928
01:15:05,069 --> 01:15:06,138
...but you?

929
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:08,147
You are not crazy.

930
01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:10,061
Then what"s wrong with me?

931
01:15:10,309 --> 01:15:13,107
What the fuck"s going on
inside my head?

932
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,823
Tell me Dr. Val, what"s
your diag-nonsense?

933
01:15:16,029 --> 01:15:19,908
You are a lazy, self-indulgent
little girl...

934
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:22,868
...who is driving herself crazy.

935
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:29,463
ls that your medical opinion? Huh?

936
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:33,059
ls that what you"ve learned in your
studies at night school...

937
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:35,419
...for Negro welfare mothers?

938
01:15:36,189 --> 01:15:40,102
l mean, Melvin doesn"t have a clue.
Wick is a psycho. And you...

939
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:41,702
...pretend you"re a doctor.

940
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:46,061
You sign charts and dole out meds, but
you"s ain"t no doctor, Miss Valerie.

941
01:15:46,269 --> 01:15:49,227
You"s ain"t nothing
but a black nursemaid.

942
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:54,419
And you"re just throwing it away.

943
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:21,625
You still wanna go to Florida?

944
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:26,862
Lisa, we need money, don"t we?

945
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:29,782
-You"ve tongued your meds?
-Yeah, but l only have--

946
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:32,219
They gave me shocks again.

947
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,347
Jamie, l have to get out of here.

948
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:38,627
l"m Susanna.

949
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:41,859
l"m Susanna.

950
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:01,826
What are we doing?

951
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:06,227
What is it?

952
01:17:07,509 --> 01:17:10,945
"" Dear sir, please give
Daisy Randone assistance...

953
01:17:11,149 --> 01:17:14,619
...installing a telephone
at 23 Vicar Street.""

954
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,467
l thought we were going to Florida!

955
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:19,621
We just need a place to crash
till we get plane tickets.

956
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:23,028
Come on.

957
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:35,627
Nice coat.

958
01:18:37,389 --> 01:18:38,617
What?

959
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:42,138
You don"t want me, Tony.

960
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:44,266
Yes, l do, baby.

961
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:47,069
No, you don"t.
l"m a crazy girl.

962
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:49,539
You"re crazy, so we can"t
have one night?

963
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:52,781
l am a crazy girl. Seriously.

964
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:56,828
-You"ve been in a hospital?
-Yes.

965
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:04,261
Do you see purple people?

966
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:08,139
My friend, he saw purple people.

967
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:11,621
And so the state came
and took him away.

968
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:14,427
He didn"t like that.

969
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,665
Some time went by...

970
01:19:17,109 --> 01:19:19,862
...and he told them he didn"t see
purple people no more.

971
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:21,422
He got better.

972
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:24,942
No. He still sees them.

973
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:28,505
We gotta split.

974
01:19:28,749 --> 01:19:30,307
Somebody stop her!

975
01:19:30,549 --> 01:19:32,858
She took my fucking wallet!

976
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:45,020
ldentify yourself.

977
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:47,819
lt"s Susanna and--

978
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:50,827
lt"s Susanna. Daisy?

979
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,224
You got Valium?

980
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,024
Cool pad.

981
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:18,628
Peace, man, peace.

982
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:21,105
l"m sorry for being a bitch.
l was a drag.

983
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:22,822
That"s for you.

984
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:33,227
That"s Ruby.

985
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:35,820
My dad bought her for me.

986
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:40,264
This is a Castro Convertible.

987
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,741
-lt pulls out.
-Cool.

988
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:44,868
-Where"s your bathroom?
-Right there.

989
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:50,183
You don"t have a tub.

990
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:52,266
No, l don"t.

991
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:54,901
-What about upstairs?
-Nope.

992
01:20:57,509 --> 01:21:00,262
So, what, did you two
escape or what?

993
01:21:00,509 --> 01:21:03,023
Actually, we"re going to Florida.

994
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:06,067
All you have is mustard
and your chickens.

995
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,905
So what are you girls going
to do in Florida?

996
01:21:11,229 --> 01:21:14,221
l"m gonna be Cinderella at
Walt Disney"s new theme park.

997
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:16,860
Susanna"s gonna be Snow White.

998
01:21:17,309 --> 01:21:19,504
You can come if you want.

999
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:22,822
You can be the cocker spaniel
that eats spaghetti.

1000
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:25,943
l wanna make pancakes.

1001
01:21:26,309 --> 01:21:28,027
l"m tired.
l wanna go to bed.

1002
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:30,464
l want to make pancakes
in the morning.

1003
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:32,182
There"s a market on the corner.

1004
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:34,620
Pans are under the sink.

1005
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,740
Silver"s in that drawer.

1006
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,542
Do you have any money?

1007
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:45,827
Do you have some sort
of a safety net down there?

1008
01:21:47,309 --> 01:21:49,982
People you know down there in Florida?

1009
01:21:50,589 --> 01:21:52,022
Relatives?

1010
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:55,582
Friends? Anything?

1011
01:22:06,109 --> 01:22:08,225
This is for your pancakes.

1012
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:12,223
Don"t make a lot of noise
in the morning.

1013
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:15,225
l like to sleep late.

1014
01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:18,025
l"ll come down when l"m ready.

1015
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:47,668
Give me the Valium.

1016
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:50,700
We don"t need your daddy"s money.

1017
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:53,020
Then leave it there.

1018
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,029
Just give me the fucking Valium.

1019
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:02,818
What"s this?

1020
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:04,184
-What"s this?
-Let go.

1021
01:23:04,429 --> 01:23:07,262
-Trying out your new silver?
-Get the fuck off me.

1022
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,177
Less appealing for Daddy.

1023
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,386
Look at your own arm, asshole.

1024
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:14,585
l"m sick, Daisy. We know that.

1025
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:18,617
But here you are in so-called
recovery, cut up like a ham.

1026
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:20,706
Just stop it, okay?

1027
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:24,463
Help me understand.

1028
01:23:25,229 --> 01:23:28,460
l thought you didn"t do Valium.
Tell me how this works.

1029
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:32,939
Tell me that you don"t drag that blade
across your skin...

1030
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:36,664
...and pray for the courage
to press down.

1031
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:42,062
Tell me how your daddy
helps you cope with that.

1032
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:44,266
llluminate me.

1033
01:23:46,749 --> 01:23:48,865
My father loves me.

1034
01:23:51,309 --> 01:23:52,503
l bet.

1035
01:23:52,749 --> 01:23:55,582
With every inch of his manhood.

1036
01:23:55,829 --> 01:23:57,660
Oh, God.

1037
01:24:01,749 --> 01:24:03,660
l"m going to sleep now.

1038
01:24:12,629 --> 01:24:14,221
Please be gone in the morning.

1039
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,300
You"re just jealous, Lisa...

1040
01:24:20,629 --> 01:24:22,460
...because l got better.

1041
01:24:23,429 --> 01:24:25,260
Because l was released.

1042
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:28,664
Because l have a chance.

1043
01:24:30,109 --> 01:24:31,701
And a life.

1044
01:24:33,549 --> 01:24:36,063
They didn"t release you
because you"re better.

1045
01:24:36,469 --> 01:24:38,061
They just gave up.

1046
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:40,981
You call this a life?

1047
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:45,666
Taking Daddy"s money? Buying your
dollies and your knickknacks?

1048
01:24:45,869 --> 01:24:49,623
Eating his fucking chicken?
Fattening up like a prize heifer?

1049
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,585
You changed the scenery,
but not the situation...

1050
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:55,064
...and the warden makes house calls.

1051
01:24:55,269 --> 01:24:57,339
And everybody knows.

1052
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:00,662
Everybody knows that he fucks you.

1053
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:03,388
What they don"t know...

1054
01:25:04,749 --> 01:25:06,102
...is that you like it.

1055
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,537
-You like it.
-Shut the fuck up!

1056
01:25:10,749 --> 01:25:13,024
Man, it"s cool. lt"s okay.

1057
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:14,457
lt"s fucking fine!

1058
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,145
A man is a dick is a man
is a dick is a chicken...

1059
01:25:18,349 --> 01:25:19,668
...is a dad...

1060
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:23,418
...a Valium, a speculum, whatever.

1061
01:25:23,709 --> 01:25:25,267
Whatever.

1062
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:28,141
You like being Mrs. Randone.

1063
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:31,860
Probably all you"ve ever known.

1064
01:25:35,149 --> 01:25:37,265
Have fun in Florida.

1065
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:26,267
Has she come down yet?

1066
01:27:26,989 --> 01:27:27,978
No.

1067
01:27:29,469 --> 01:27:32,427
But she"s been playing
that shit all morning!

1068
01:27:34,109 --> 01:27:37,784
Why does my heart go on beating?

1069
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:44,348
Why do these eyes of mine cry?

1070
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,789
Don"t they know

1071
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:53,305
It"s the end of the world

1072
01:27:53,549 --> 01:27:56,621
It ended when you said

1073
01:27:57,749 --> 01:28:00,707
Goodbye

1074
01:28:48,349 --> 01:28:49,668
Daisy?

1075
01:29:08,349 --> 01:29:10,260
Oh, my God!

1076
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:23,461
What an idiot.

1077
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:35,618
-Yes, l need an ambulance.
-Make it a hearse.

1078
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:40,783
Daisy Randone. She killed herself.

1079
01:29:42,909 --> 01:29:47,539
23 Vicar Street.
Yes. Please hurry!

1080
01:29:58,549 --> 01:30:01,541
You pressed her buttons.
Now you"re taking her money.

1081
01:30:03,109 --> 01:30:05,748
l didn"t press shit.
She was waiting for an excuse.

1082
01:30:05,949 --> 01:30:07,348
Pack up.
We have to go.

1083
01:30:07,589 --> 01:30:09,739
All right?
We have to go!

1084
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:11,667
Now we have money.

1085
01:30:15,229 --> 01:30:17,265
Don"t be stupid.

1086
01:30:20,669 --> 01:30:23,263
All right, fine.
Be stupid.

1087
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:34,058
We should send someone
for a litter box.

1088
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:04,661
Can l pet the kitty?

1089
01:33:07,309 --> 01:33:08,867
Be careful.

1090
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:15,182
-Hello, puddy-cat.
-Kitty!

1091
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:18,065
You are so cute.

1092
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:31,427
Checks.

1093
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:34,861
Where"s Georgina?

1094
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:37,904
She"s staying with Polly tonight.

1095
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:40,824
They"re playing with your cat.

1096
01:33:44,589 --> 01:33:46,545
Did they find Lisa?

1097
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:48,858
No.

1098
01:34:06,829 --> 01:34:09,423
l couldn"t stand up to her.

1099
01:34:13,509 --> 01:34:16,819
A decent person would
have done something.

1100
01:34:19,109 --> 01:34:20,827
Shut her up.

1101
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:26,700
Gone upstairs.

1102
01:34:27,389 --> 01:34:29,220
Talked to Daisy.

1103
01:34:31,909 --> 01:34:34,218
Melvin said you went upstairs.

1104
01:34:36,429 --> 01:34:38,021
Too late.

1105
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:42,619
What would you have said to her?

1106
01:34:44,269 --> 01:34:46,021
l don"t know.

1107
01:34:47,709 --> 01:34:49,620
That l was sorry.

1108
01:34:54,909 --> 01:34:57,742
That l"ll never know what
it was like to be her.

1109
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:05,618
But l know what it"s like
to wanna die.

1110
01:35:09,589 --> 01:35:12,023
How it hurts to smile.

1111
01:35:13,909 --> 01:35:17,219
How you try to fit in,
but you can"t.

1112
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:21,860
How you hurt yourself
on the outside...

1113
01:35:22,069 --> 01:35:25,220
...to try to kill the thing
on the inside.

1114
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:32,019
Susanna, it"s all well and good
to tell me all this.

1115
01:35:32,989 --> 01:35:36,425
But you"ve got to tell
some of this to your doctors.

1116
01:35:42,509 --> 01:35:44,386
How am l supposed to recover...

1117
01:35:44,589 --> 01:35:47,342
...when l don"t even
understand my disease?

1118
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:50,584
But you do understand it.

1119
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:54,259
You spoke very clearly
about it a second ago.

1120
01:35:55,069 --> 01:35:58,106
But l think what you"ve got
to do is put it down.

1121
01:35:58,349 --> 01:36:00,624
Put it away.
Put it in your notebook.

1122
01:36:00,829 --> 01:36:02,740
But get it out of yourself.

1123
01:36:03,429 --> 01:36:07,217
Away, so you can"t
curl up with it anymore.

1124
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:16,224
Lisa thinks it"s a gift.

1125
01:36:18,909 --> 01:36:21,628
That it lets you see the truth.

1126
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:27,098
Lisa"s been here for eight years.

1127
01:36:35,309 --> 01:36:37,425
l"m so sorry.

1128
01:36:37,869 --> 01:36:40,827
-l was a pig.
-lt"s all right. Listen.

1129
01:36:43,309 --> 01:36:45,698
Do not drop anchor here.

1130
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:47,819
Understand?

1131
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:03,018
When you don"t want to feel...

1132
01:37:03,909 --> 01:37:06,628
... death can seem like a dream.

1133
01:37:07,589 --> 01:37:10,228
But seeing death...

1134
01:37:10,829 --> 01:37:12,740
...really seeing it...

1135
01:37:13,109 --> 01:37:17,022
...makes dreaming about it
fucking ridiculous.

1136
01:37:17,869 --> 01:37:21,623
Maybe there"s a moment,
growing up...

1137
01:37:21,829 --> 01:37:23,820
... when something peels back.

1138
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:28,427
Maybe we look for secrets because
we can"t believe our minds.

1139
01:37:28,629 --> 01:37:32,417
Though I missed Lisa,
life was easier without her.

1140
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:34,859
A thought is a hard thing
to control.

1141
01:37:36,789 --> 01:37:38,939
All I know is that
I began to feel again.

1142
01:37:39,149 --> 01:37:40,298
Crazy? Sane?

1143
01:37:40,509 --> 01:37:44,980
Whatever I was, I knew there was
only one way back to the world...

1144
01:37:45,189 --> 01:37:47,578
...and that was to use the place...

1145
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:49,228
... to talk.

1146
01:37:49,909 --> 01:37:53,663
So I saw the great and wonderful
Dr. Wick three times a week...

1147
01:37:53,869 --> 01:37:56,747
...and I let her hear
every thought in my head.

1148
01:38:00,509 --> 01:38:04,138
Do you think maybe l have ESP
or something, that l"m gifted?

1149
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:06,542
Perhaps.

1150
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:21,062
You think l can be home
by Thanksgiving?

1151
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,423
Nothing"s happened
in weeks, you know.

1152
01:38:28,189 --> 01:38:30,703
The point is control.

1153
01:38:30,949 --> 01:38:34,908
Yeah, and here l am,
in control, off meds...

1154
01:38:35,149 --> 01:38:38,221
...no headaches, sleeping sound.

1155
01:38:46,309 --> 01:38:48,504
Oh, will you help me?
Can you help me?

1156
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:50,540
You don"t need to be helped
any longer.

1157
01:38:50,749 --> 01:38:52,944
You"ve always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1158
01:38:53,789 --> 01:38:54,665
I have?

1159
01:38:54,869 --> 01:38:56,382
Then why didn"t you tell her before?

1160
01:38:56,589 --> 01:38:58,819
Because she wouldn"t have
believed me.

1161
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:00,468
She had to learn it for herself.

1162
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:02,660
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1163
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:08,747
I think that it...

1164
01:39:08,949 --> 01:39:12,783
... that it wasn"t enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em...

1165
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:17,506
...and if I ever go looking
for my heart"s desire again...

1166
01:39:17,709 --> 01:39:20,781
...I won"t look any further
than my own back yard.

1167
01:39:21,069 --> 01:39:23,378
Because if it isn"t there...

1168
01:39:23,589 --> 01:39:26,740
...I never really lost it
to begin with.

1169
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:30,024
-Is that right?
-That"s all it is.

1170
01:39:50,509 --> 01:39:52,022
Thanks, Joe.

1171
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:55,660
Go away. Go away!

1172
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:02,622
lt"s me.

1173
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:19,418
lt"s been a while...

1174
01:41:20,669 --> 01:41:23,422
...and l just wanted to say hey.

1175
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,827
You okay?

1176
01:41:30,069 --> 01:41:31,821
Fabulous.

1177
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:37,382
You"re gonna be late.
Gretta"s waiting for you.

1178
01:41:41,589 --> 01:41:44,820
l gotta go. Dr. Wick.

1179
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:49,020
They still fucking with you?

1180
01:41:52,509 --> 01:41:53,737
They"re....

1181
01:41:55,869 --> 01:41:58,429
Actually, they"re letting me out.

1182
01:42:02,109 --> 01:42:03,827
Oh, that"s great.

1183
01:42:06,909 --> 01:42:08,627
You better go.

1184
01:42:25,229 --> 01:42:28,665
Well, my dad got me a job,
a part-time job...

1185
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,064
...at a bookstore in Harvard Square.

1186
01:42:32,189 --> 01:42:34,942
And l got an apartment
with a phone so l can--

1187
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,298
Stay in touch.

1188
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:41,538
And l"ll be seeing Sonia
twice a week.

1189
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:45,464
ls that your long-term plan?
To work in retail?

1190
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:51,384
My plan? No.

1191
01:42:51,909 --> 01:42:53,820
Then what do you plan to do?

1192
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:58,188
l plan to write.

1193
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:07,307
Polly Clark.

1194
01:43:08,309 --> 01:43:10,220
Cynthia Crowley.

1195
01:43:13,509 --> 01:43:15,579
Susanna Kaysen.

1196
01:43:17,829 --> 01:43:20,468
-l don"t think l need--
-Sleeping pills, darling.

1197
01:43:20,669 --> 01:43:23,979
You want to be rested for tomorrow.
Last night"s a long one.

1198
01:43:24,309 --> 01:43:26,664
Good girl. Katie Cooper.

1199
01:43:29,029 --> 01:43:30,428
Rosemary Jones.

1200
01:43:32,869 --> 01:43:35,019
Teresa McCullian.

"" lf l spread my fingers out,
my hand looked more human.

So l did that.

01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:46,148
But it wasn"t tiring holding my
fingers apart, so l let them relax...

1205
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:48,186
...and then, l turned my hand over.

1206
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:50,181

What the fuck are you doing, Lisa?

1236
01:47:35,229 --> 01:47:37,379
l"m playing the villain,
like you want.

1237
01:47:37,629 --> 01:47:39,984
-l give you everything you want.
-No, you don"t.

1238
01:47:41,629 --> 01:47:42,948
You wanted your file?
l got it!

1239
01:47:43,149 --> 01:47:46,539
You wanted out, l got you out!
You needed money, l found you some!

1240
01:47:46,789 --> 01:47:49,701
l told you the truth!
l didn"t write it in a book!

1241
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:51,900
l told you to your face!

1242
01:47:52,149 --> 01:47:56,142
l told Daisy what everybody knew and
wouldn"t say, and she killed herself.

1243
01:47:56,349 --> 01:47:57,941
l played the fucking villain.

1244
01:47:58,189 --> 01:47:59,224
Just like you wanted.

1245
01:47:59,469 --> 01:48:00,902
Why would l want that?

1246
01:48:02,429 --> 01:48:04,659
Because it makes you
the good guy, sweet pea.

1247
01:48:04,869 --> 01:48:08,862
You come back here, all sweetness
and light and sad and contrite...

1248
01:48:09,069 --> 01:48:13,699
...and everybody wrings their hands,
congratulating you on your bravery.

1249
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:18,427
Meanwhile, l"m blowing guys at the
bus station for money!

1250
01:48:19,029 --> 01:48:20,462
Stop it, Lisa. She"s too--

1251
01:48:20,709 --> 01:48:21,903
Shut up, Polly!

1252
01:48:24,149 --> 01:48:25,298
Where are you going?

1253
01:48:26,109 --> 01:48:27,542
l"m talking to you!

1254
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:34,822
Where are you going?
l"m talking to you!

1255
01:48:39,109 --> 01:48:40,622
You don"t like me anymore?

1256
01:48:40,869 --> 01:48:42,700
No, l don"t!

1257
01:48:44,069 --> 01:48:45,821
Because you"re free?

1258
01:48:46,109 --> 01:48:47,622
You think you"re free?

1259
01:48:48,389 --> 01:48:49,617
l"m free!

1260
01:48:50,109 --> 01:48:52,669
You don"t know what freedom is!

1261
01:48:53,429 --> 01:48:54,782
l"m free!

1262
01:48:55,269 --> 01:48:57,658
l can breathe! And you...

1263
01:48:57,909 --> 01:49:00,901
...you"ll go choke on your
average fucking mediocre life!

1264
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:14,940
There are too many buttons
in the world.

1265
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:17,225
Too many buttons,
and they"re just....

1266
01:49:18,989 --> 01:49:21,298
There"s way too many,
begging to be pressed.

1267
01:49:21,589 --> 01:49:23,386
They"re just begging to be pressed!

1268
01:49:23,589 --> 01:49:26,057
You know, they"re just
begging to be pressed.

1269
01:49:26,789 --> 01:49:28,666
And it makes me wonder.

1270
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:32,658
lt makes me fucking wonder.
Why doesn"t anybody ever press mine?

1271
01:49:32,909 --> 01:49:34,228
Why am l so neglected?

1272
01:49:34,469 --> 01:49:37,506
Why doesn"t anybody reach in
and rip out the truth...

1273
01:49:37,709 --> 01:49:39,984
...and tell me
that l"m a fucking whore...

1274
01:49:40,309 --> 01:49:42,345
...and that my parents
wish l were dead?

1275
01:49:42,829 --> 01:49:45,468
Because you"re dead already, Lisa!

1276
01:49:52,029 --> 01:49:54,338
No one cares if you die, Lisa...

1277
01:49:55,709 --> 01:49:58,223
...because you"re dead already.

1278
01:49:58,909 --> 01:50:02,618
Your heart is cold!

1279
01:50:04,789 --> 01:50:06,984
That"s why you keep
coming back here.

1280
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:10,620
You"re not free.

1281
01:50:11,389 --> 01:50:14,699
You need this place.
You need it to feel alive.

1282
01:50:15,229 --> 01:50:16,184
lt"s pathetic.

1283
01:50:56,269 --> 01:50:59,022
l"ve wasted a year of my life.

1284
01:51:04,309 --> 01:51:07,426
And maybe everyone
out there is a liar.

1285
01:51:10,589 --> 01:51:13,626
And maybe the whole world...

1286
01:51:13,869 --> 01:51:17,225
...is stupid and ignorant.

1287
01:51:19,909 --> 01:51:22,218
But l"d rather be in it.

1288
01:51:24,069 --> 01:51:27,744
l"d rather be fucking in it...

1289
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:30,423
...than down here with you.

1290
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:50,743
Don"t. Don"t.

1291
01:51:52,109 --> 01:51:53,428
Don"t.

1292
01:52:03,789 --> 01:52:05,268
Oh, God.

1293
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:49,418
Did you get it?

1294
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:55,701
l had to trade with a transvestite
in the men"s ward.

1295
01:52:58,669 --> 01:53:00,022
Thanks.

1296
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:58,426
l"m not really dead.

1297
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:06,188
l know.

1298
01:54:10,509 --> 01:54:12,898
l"m gonna miss you, Susie Q.

1299
01:54:15,309 --> 01:54:18,540
No, you"re not.
You"re gonna get out of here...

1300
01:54:18,749 --> 01:54:21,024
...and you"re gonna come and see me.

1301
01:54:43,269 --> 01:54:45,021
Hey, Georgina.

1302
01:54:45,269 --> 01:54:48,022
You know all that stuff
l write in my journal...

1303
01:54:48,269 --> 01:54:50,260
...l don"t know what l"m saying.

1304
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:54,067
They"re just thoughts.

1305
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:56,620
Maybe l"m the liar.

1306
01:54:58,389 --> 01:55:00,027
Maybe not.

1307
01:55:08,269 --> 01:55:09,622
See you.

1308
01:55:20,109 --> 01:55:24,466
You think if l left Ruby here
you"d take care of her for me?

1309
01:55:24,909 --> 01:55:28,219
Let me play with her
when l come for my therapy?

1310
01:55:38,789 --> 01:55:40,108
Bye, Ruby.

1311
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:03,024
Remember me when you shave your legs.

1312
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:34,299
Declared healthy...

1313
01:56:34,509 --> 01:56:37,342
...and sent back into the world.

1314
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:40,058
My final diagnosis.:

1315
01:56:40,429 --> 01:56:42,818
A recovered borderline.

1316
01:56:43,869 --> 01:56:46,508
What that means, I still don"t know.

1317
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,620
Was I ever crazy?

1318
01:56:49,869 --> 01:56:52,337
-Maybe.

1319
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:55,464
Or maybe life is.

1320
01:56:57,069 --> 01:56:58,741
l remember you.

1321
01:57:01,029 --> 01:57:02,428
Where are you going?

1322
01:57:03,389 --> 01:57:05,584
1 7 Burlingame.

1323
01:57:05,789 --> 01:57:06,983
All right.

1324
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:10,948
Crazy isn"t being broken...

1325
01:57:11,229 --> 01:57:14,301
... or swallowing a dark secret.

1326
01:57:14,789 --> 01:57:16,780
It"s you or me...

1327
01:57:17,029 --> 01:57:19,020
...amplified.

1328
01:57:19,629 --> 01:57:22,143
If you ever told a lie...

1329
01:57:22,389 --> 01:57:24,220
...and enjoyed it.

1330
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:29,787
If you ever wished you
could be a child forever.

1331
01:57:31,069 --> 01:57:33,219
They were not perfect...

1332
01:57:33,669 --> 01:57:35,864
...but they were my friends.

1333
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:39,339
And by the "70s...

1334
01:57:39,549 --> 01:57:41,346
...most of them were out...

1335
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:43,500
... living lives.

1336
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:46,220
Some I"ve seen...

1337
01:57:47,389 --> 01:57:49,823
...some, never again.

1338
01:57:51,109 --> 01:57:54,419
But there isn"t a day my heart
doesn"t find them.

1339
