Executive Producer Han Se Min, Kim Young Min

3
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,257
Hey!

4
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,726
What's up?

5
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,870
How come you didn't go home?

6
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,069
Why'd you quit the student body?

7
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:22,713
I couldn't stand Si-won any more
He's a pompous idiot

8
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,647
Were you dancing again?

9
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,945
Hee-chul was driving me nuts

10
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,422
The guy can't dance
He needs to practice his moves.

11
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:35,621
Why can't he even do a basic break
dancing move? I can't believe him.

12
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,859
He says looks matter more
than his dancing skill.

13
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,796
Hell, yeah. He's so annoying,

14
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:46,635
Dancing won't get you anywhere
You think you can become a dancer?

15
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,468
Hey, that's not why I'm doing this.

16
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,739
I've got bigger goals than that.
Got that?

17
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,146
Have you heard of the B-Boy Contest?

18
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,975
- I'm gonna enter it and...
- You're just a high school kid...
KIM Ki-bum CHOI Si-won KIM Hee-chul
KIM Young-woon LEE Dong-hae LEE Hyuk-jae

19
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,686
Hey! Don't act like a know-it-all.

20
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:11,698
What's up with your blog homepage?
You call yourself, "The High School Kid."

Director: Lee Kwon

22
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,903
That's right.
We're high school kids.
High School Kid

23
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:25,136
We wake up before dawn breaks and some
of us get punished for being tardy.

24
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,375
- We finally make ourway to class.
- Hey you! You're breaking the rules!

25
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:35,581
From 8 till 6, we'll sit at our desks
all day, studying for hours and hours.

26
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,020
The Hips and legs of girls who are now starting
to mature as adults get larger.

27
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:46,555
And the guys... Well, their hormones
are raging but they get gray hairs.

28
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,066
But after 3 years of high school...

29
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:59,674
Either you get admitted to your first
choice or you get rejected.

30
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,244
We're just high school kids...

31
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,415
Did you hear about it?

32
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,887
Hear about what?

33
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,359
Nadam high school band were attacked.

34
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,024
Really?

35
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,300
It's heavy stuff.

36
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,667
Who'll be next?

37
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:36,209
It all started happening in February.
On Valentine's Day...

38
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,184
Anyway, in high school,

39
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,515
you hear about all these legendary dudes.

40
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:51,089
But some of the legends are big fat lies

41
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,058
There's the legend about the guy who
fought 17 bad dudes all by himself.

42
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,366
And there's the one about a girl who
has been haunting a school for 50 years.

43
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:07,070
Or the Taekwondo varsity team from an inner city
school that became the national champs.

44
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,406
And...

45
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:17,079
The legend about the handsome dude
who could make girls swoon...

46
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,465
Excuse me...

47
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,771
This is for you.

48
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,838
Thanks.

49
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,912
The popular guys who have it all...

50
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,525
Even when we're wearing the same
uniform, they'll look like a star.

51
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:32,020
You can even spot them in a crowd of
people because they have an aura.

52
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,531
Some guys have that special look.

53
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:42,968
And Lee Sung-min is one of those guys
He's a high school senior at Garam High

54
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,095
Do you have something to say to me?

55
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:20,940
We didn't know it at the time
but it was just the beginning.

56
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,041
March 14

57
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:28,105
We love you!

58
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,172
This guy. His name is Han-geng.
A high school junior at Geosang High.

59
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,639
He's not even a celebrity but he's got
three separate fan websites

60
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,680
He's a star basketball player
and an ultracool guy

61
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,950
Not only do the girls love him
but the guys also think he's the man

62
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,025
He's a handsome fella
with a killer jump shot

63
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,290
You're the man!
Pretty boy

64
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,729
Hey you!

65
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:09,376
He got attacked on the 14th of March.

66
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,347
People who were reading blogs
knew about these attacks.

67
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:22,161
But it was only until people heard about
the 3rd attack, did it become huge.

68
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,324
April 14th

69
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,157
Hey you!

70
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:05,855
That happened on April 14th After these
incidents happened, We started calling the incidents

71
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,966
"Attack on the pin-up boys"

72
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,478
Attack on the pin-up boys

73
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,515
Some crazy guy was on the loose
and attacking pretty boys.

74
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:34,585
The police wouldn't investigate the
Case because nobody got hurt

75
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,186
Plus, there were no
witnesses or evidence

76
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:43,525
We could only predict who'd be next...

77
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,741
The first victim was from Garam High
The second guy was from Geosang High

78
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,180
and the last attack happened to
a Nadam High school kid

79
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:02,152
It was pretty immature but the attacker
seemed to be following an order.

80
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,755
What is it?

81
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,398
I brought you a snack

82
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,465
Just hang in there for
one more year, OK?

83
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,872
So who would be the next target?

84
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,476
It had to be someone
from Neul Paran High

85
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,207
Hello

86
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:11,452
Neul Paran High School
Hey! You're not wearing your
school uniform correctly, Huh?

87
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,526
Close the gates

88
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,494
We're closing the gates!

89
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:31,234
Hey! Ki-bum! I saw you had a lot of
visitors to your website

90
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,641
So did you get over 1000 visitors?

91
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,612
It was closer to 3000 visitors.

92
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,774
Whoa, You're a popular guy

93
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,284
So do you really believe that someone
from our school will be next?

94
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,523
I don't know for sure
But I think so

95
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:52,359
You think so? Then it must be
either one of those three guys

96
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,373
At our school, we don't have a
star like the other three schools

97
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:11,141
But there are three privileged kids
who we call the Blue Troika

98
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,096
Teachers allowed only

99
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:48,714
This week's event will be
about keeping things simple.

100
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,951
The juniors will only take their
morning classes

101
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,884
but the seniors will take all of their classes
including the Late night study class

102
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,854
- There should be no exceptions...
- Excuse me,

103
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,996
you've heard of the
Attack on the pin-up boys, right?

104
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:10,807
There's a rumor going around that
someone at our school will be next.

105
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,843
Will we be OK?

106
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:40,801
Err... I was just asking...

107
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:50,774
I don't want to get splattered with shit!

108
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,976
No one should interrupt a
meeting to say such nonsense

109
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,378
His IQ score is equal to his height
in terms of centimeters.

110
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,981
Students say that he implanted an ultra
dual-core CPU directly into his brain.

111
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,926
He was always the top student in his
class for his entire school life.

112
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,122
He's school president Choi Si-won.

113
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,538
Hey! Forget it! Let's kick him out!

114
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,243
- He's irritating
- Why?!

115
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:11,153
Look at that hog! I told him to shave off
some pounds. He's not listening

116
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,056
Hey, if we keep practicing every day,
We'll be perfect by the tome of the festival.

117
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,960
Lose some weight!

118
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,962
Dong-hae, do you have to act like a star?
We're supposed to be a team

119
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,335
When will you cut out the crap?!

120
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:37,213
You know that attack on the pin-up boys?
They say our school is next

121
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,549
Really?

122
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,789
Your photo was posted as one
of three possible victims.

123
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:53,592
Hey, but why does the attacker
throw shit at people?

124
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,997
It would be so much nicer if he used
mud instead. Mud is good for your skin.

125
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:03,470
But I feel better after looking at my
handsome face. Hey guys. Look at me

126
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,403
and it'll make you feel better

127
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:16,151
Teachers call him a punk
but he's the cool kid

128
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,712
who wears his uniform with style.

129
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,185
Kim Hee-chul, the leader of the
school's ultra junior dance group.

130
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:08,337
He's the former high
school judo champion

131
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,400
He beat his opponent in just 1 second
He's Neul Paran High's star judo player

132
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:17,139
But they say he only
mastered the ippon move.

133
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:24,484
Nevertheless, he's the last macho
guy of our era! Kang In, our hero.

134
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,788
Are you guys, OK?
I'm so sorry.

135
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,525
Can you recruit some new guys instead
of using us as your sparring partners?

136
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,324
I'll treat you guys to lunch.

137
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,959
What will you buy us?

138
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,669
Let's have bear soup.

139
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,478
One of these three guys
will be the next victim!

140
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,444
Smart and handsome.
The perfect combination

141
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,456
Cute, cute, super cute!
My Hee-chul...

142
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,721
But the unsolved case
took a new unexpected turn

143
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,256
Captain, use that judo move on me, too.
People were more interested
in who'd be the next victim.

144
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:07,926
People were more interested
in who'd be the next victim.

145
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,195
What a resourceful guy...

146
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:19,809
I wonder where he gets the shit from?
It's not like you can just dig it out.

147
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,577
Perhaps he's using his own shit

148
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:28,647
- Kang In, are you practicing hard?
- Yes

149
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,019
- Ms. Kim!
- Yes?

150
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,523
Don't flirt with the students

151
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,058
You're so cute.

152
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:44,263
- Hee-chul, don't go out at night.
- Then can I skip the night classes?

153
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:50,604
- Did you ever come to one?
- I was just asking...

154
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,337
It's pathetic to watch you squirm
your body and call it dancing

155
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,040
Hey, close down your blog homesite.

156
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,946
Why?

157
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:03,020
Do you think you're some celebrity?
You keep posting photos of yourself.

158
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,721
You can make better use of
that time by reading a book.

159
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,619
You wouldn't be ranked at the bottom
of your class if you did some reading.

160
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:17,267
- I'm not going to college, Sir.
- Do you think you can even get in?

161
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:24,102
You're in the same situation as him!
How come you're in a slump?

162
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,578
What happened to your ippon move?
You were once the national champ.

163
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:35,342
We're not asking you to bring honor
to our school. Try not to embarrass us.

164
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,922
- Give it up.
- Do you wanna die?!

165
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,120
Give it your best shot
You're dead

166
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,893
Oh, Si-won...

167
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,794
You must have a lot of things on your mind

168
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:02,545
Don't let things bother you.
Keep doing your best, OK?

169
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,070
OK, Sir

170
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,279
You can go back to class.

171
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,086
- OK
- Alright.

172
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,985
Have a good day.

173
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,892
Kang In, he should throw in the towel...

174
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:33,210
Alright, let's place our bets now
You said you'd bet on Si-won, right?

175
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,281
- What's the minimum bet?
- Well, it starts at $50

176
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,251
- And the spread is...
- Si-won isn't the next victim.

177
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,790
The attacker will go after Kang In
You're gonna regret it

178
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,386
Haha... Sir, just go by your instincts

179
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:55,064
Alright, One more bet on Si-won

180
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,703
The vice principal calls a homepage
a "homesite?" That's a riot.

181
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,971
On the day I appear on that "Finding
Your Teacher" TV show, I'll rip into

182
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,877
him on national television
He'll be so embarrassed

183
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:16,615
Who'd pick you to appear on that show?

184
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,452
Oh, sometimes they randomly pick
a lucky viewer to be on the show.

185
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,756
Hey, I heard you used to be a boxer.

186
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:30,064
But you switched to judo because you
couldn't count down to 1 in English.

187
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,500
Who the hell said that?!

188
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:38,565
- Then what is the English word for 8?
- Do you know what it is?

189
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,703
I asked you first
You don't know it, right?

190
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,843
Yes, I do.
One, two... Dang... Why'd I say that?

191
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,382
What are you doing with your fingers?

192
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,651
Eight!

193
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:57,158
That was a Herculean effort.

194
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:01,928
- Damn it! That asshole!
- Damn it! That asshole!

195
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:11,532
- Jinx
- What a jerk

196
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:19,715
Jinx! Hey!
Jinx! Jinx!

197
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,110
Jinx!

198
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:28,119
Terrorist approved beauty!!!
"Anxiously waiting for the next victim!"
After the Pretty Boy Attacker case be-
came a top search word on the Internet

199
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,356
The media began covering this incident...

200
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,887
The blog websites of the previous
3 victims became overnight sensations.

201
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,266
One of the victims was picked up by music
label based on the media coverage

202
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:42,932
He received, He released his solo album with
success and went on a national tour

203
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:53,708
And they become legends
among high school kids

204
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,225
Teen Weekly
Sung-min, the pretty boy

205
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,768
He signed a 3-year contract
with a top talent agency

206
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:19,634
He used to be a nobody but
how'd he get so lucky?

207
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,838
He's also the new TV host for M-Net.

208
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,074
Hey!

209
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,950
We told you that no shoes
are allowed in this room!

210
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,192
- Who said you could wear shoes here?!
- Gosh!

211
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,590
- Ahem. Hi girls!
- Oh, hi

212
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,262
- We're holding rehearsals.
- We'd like to rehearse with you.

213
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,101
You want to learn how to break dance?
No, no, no. You should learn Judo.

214
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,198
- You can use the room for hours.
- Oh, OK. Go learn judo. Alright.

215
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:56,669
- We've got a lot of time.
- Oh, I see, What are you looking at?

216
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,810
What the!
Fine!

217
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:25,140
Wait a minute. Hey fatso!
Hold that still. OK?!

218
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,009
Hey, try doing this with all this fat!

219
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:34,312
Hey, you fatso. I'm doing this for our
team. Don't you want to become famous?!

220
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:39,083
Come on. Let's do this right.
You're killing my motivation. Damn it!

221
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:45,562
- Oh, brother
- Why aren't you taking pictures?

222
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:56,540
- Oh gosh. That is so uncool.
- I think I'm gonna throw up. Gross...

223
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:01,042
He's trying to get hit with shit
from that attacker. What a fool.

224
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,047
- You're the fool and not him.
- Why am I the fool?

225
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:11,551
Look. If he gets hit with shit, then
you'll be a loser. Don't you get it?

226
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:18,654
Look at your record. You were the champ
for 1 year but you've never won since.

227
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,899
But if you get hit by shit then it'll
change everything. You'll become a star.

228
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,898
And that will make the judo varsity
team popular. We'll get more members.

229
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,474
Make my life easier, dude.
Don't use me as your sparring partner.

230
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,948
Colleges will even admit students who
are good dancers or singers these days...

231
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:47,221
Really?
Do you think this will get me in?

232
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,525
Do you feel it? Do you?
Can you feel it? Will I get into college?

233
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,627
Will this get the attacker's attention?

234
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,799
Hey. Will this help me get hit by shit?

235
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,004
Will you stop flailing your arms!
Cut it out. That's awful.

236
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,635
Do you think he'll get hit by shit?

237
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,744
Come on. Try to be cute
Cute is in. OK?

238
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,346
Really?
Then what about this?

239
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:22,620
- Damn it.
- I give up!

240
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:31,330
- I won't do this!
- Don't you have any patience?

241
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,904
Don't you want to get hit by shit?

242
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,941
Why do I have to copy what
that girlie-boy does? Huh?

243
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,772
And what's with this outfit? Gosh

244
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:44,009
It's too small for me.
Do I have to wear this stupid shirt?!

245
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:50,651
Whoa. You've got a great figure.
Don't you think so?

246
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:56,253
Hey, can I feel your muscles?
Let me see. Your muscles are...

247
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:01,789
- Hey, don't be gay.
- This is how you get to be friends.

248
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:07,132
Suck in your stomach.
Right on, Good

249
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,400
Is this the right pose?

250
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,873
- Good! You've got the look.
- Ooh, that feels good.

251
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,968
What you're good at

252
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,980
- Alright. So strike another pose
- How about this?

253
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,076
- Perfect. Great. You look terrific.
- And this...

254
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,883
- OK. Turn your body a little.
- Like this?

255
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:30,384
- Yeah. That's great.
- How about this? That feels good.

256
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,593
Wow, he's got a muscular figure.
He really worked out

257
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,828
He stuck his head to a model's body.
I can tell. It's so obvious.

258
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,394
It looks real to me.

259
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,936
Hey... I've got a rock hard body
like that, too. I'm not kidding.

260
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:54,147
Do you want to see my body?
I'm gonna take my shirt off.

261
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:58,018
Don't stop me. Take a photo!
Come on. Hurry up. Hurry!

262
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:02,186
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Hey, don't stop me from doing this.

263
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,354
- Don't take a photo of him.
- Hey, just put it back on.

264
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:09,423
- I have to shoot this to get hit by shit!
- Don't take your jeans off. Don't!

265
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:14,598
- Don't shoot this. Put your clothes on.
- Hey, hey...

266
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,199
- Taking off your clothes won't help.
- It will. I'll get hit by shit.

267
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:21,406
- He's taking off his pants.
- Oh, he looks so sexy.

268
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,142
He's wearing boxers with heart patterns

269
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,311
- Don't take pictures. Wear your pants.
- Hurry up and snap a photo! Hey!

270
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:48,799
You! Watch where you're going.
Are you blind or what?

271
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,800
- You're such an annoying jerk.
- Sorry. I didn't see you, Shortie.

272
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:59,181
What the... Dang! When is the last
time you washed your uniform?

273
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,545
Don't open your mouth
The stench is unbearable

274
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,350
I heard that you can't remember
the English lines in your rap verse

275
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,358
You have to write down
"Yo, baby, check it out." Can't spell, huh?

276
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,157
Ha! What's it to you?
We're all about our image.

277
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,421
Do you know what "image" means?

278
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,998
You're only good at dancing.
Do you want to feel what it's like to

279
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,627
float in the air after I do my ippon?

280
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,968
Stupid people always try to use force.

281
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,907
You're a fool. Do you know that?

282
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,253
What are you doing in the hallways?
The bell rang already.

283
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,846
Are you guys gay?

284
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,621
May 14th

285
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,634
- Today is the 14th. He'll attack.
- Will the school prez get hit by shit?

286
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:57,470
- Oh, he wouldn't dare attack him.
- No, he might get hit by shit.

287
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,638
He was like that ever since he was born.

288
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:08,980
- He has a heart made out ofice.
- I know. That's why Kang In is better.

289
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,113
Don't forget Hee-chul.

290
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,014
Be quiet

291
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,543
On the second week of May...

292
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:38,047
If my predictions are correct, today
is the day when the attacker will strike.

293
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,116
Who will be his next victim?

294
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:46,556
- What if I get hit by shit?
- Stupid. Why'd he come after you?

295
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:52,921
- Dong-hae. Dong-hae.
- Huh?

296
00:33:53,264 --> 00:34:00,170
- Hey, are you gonna meet Hee-chul later?
- He can't wait to get hit by shit.

297
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:07,041
- Do you think he'll be the next victim?
- He needs to get shit all over him.

298
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,290
- Congratulations!
- For what?

299
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,586
Our class came in last
again in the entire grade.

300
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:37,305
Are you guys people or dunces?
This is the third consecutive year...

301
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:43,078
Will it make you feel bad
if you don't come in last?

302
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:49,512
- Is this what you want?
- Noooo.

303
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,691
Everyone will study after school for an
extra 3hours. Stay in class until 11 PM

304
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,021
No, Teacher.

305
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:09,165
You can't get good grades so you
should at least make an effort.

306
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:17,510
Stop packing your bags. Everyone
stays late after school.

307
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,342
Understoo?

308
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,151
- Understood?
- Yes

309
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:30,389
- Someone is gonna get hit by shit.
- Oh, gosh. I have to see who it'll be?

310
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,725
The teacher wants to keep
all the fun to himself.

311
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:38,228
- Why does it have to be today?
- He's so annoying.

312
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,848
I'm going to school

313
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,124
Hello?

314
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,636
What? It happened?

315
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,439
Who is it?

316
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,996
- It's the school president.
- Si-won?

317
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,468
Oh. What the...? What's going on?

318
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,874
Si-won got attacked?

319
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,342
Si-won got hit by shit?

320
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:22,436
Si-won... Si-won...
He's so handsome

321
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:27,536
Why'd he go in so fast?
Oh, Si-won...,

322
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,349
What the... Get out of here.

323
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,718
Si-won... Oh... Si-won...

324
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,077
What kind of music is this?

325
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,246
Aunt Mae. We'll have another coke.

326
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:11,314
I can't believe it. Why did he
choose that dopey-looking Si-won?

327
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,088
What a bummer

328
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:26,066
Hey. You know this pretty boy in this poster...
He's going out with BoA.

329
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,400
Son of a bitch.

330
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:40,044
I was a big fan of BoA ever since she
sang the song "Argentina Girl."

331
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:44,679
- How could she go out with him?
- BoA...

332
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,729
Thanks for the money.

333
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,901
It should have been Kang In.

334
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:04,363
You win some and lose some.
What can you do about it?

335
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,705
This is the place where it
supposedly happened

336
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:18,488
Until now all of the victims were
attacked in a 300-meter radius from

337
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,489
Their school. But this place is...

338
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,996
This place is off limits.

339
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,144
How are you feeling?

340
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:59,545
I didn't get punched at so I'm fine.
I'm just staying here to avoid the kids.

341
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:06,721
- But what brings you here?
- I looked around the crime site.

342
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,068
You seem to be bored after
quitting the student body.

343
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,331
Why are you snooping around?

344
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:21,738
I write a blog about the attacker.
And lots of kids are asking me

345
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:27,584
questions about last night's incident.
So I was curious about a few things.

346
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:35,222
At the alley last night...
Was the attacker in front of you?

347
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,486
No, he was behind me.

348
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:40,853
- Why'd you turn around then?
- Because someone called me.

349
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,455
Hey you!

350
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,663
Did the attacker say anything to
you when he flung the shit at you?

351
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:53,841
He said something.

352
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,106
Take this shit, Pretty Boy!

353
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:59,843
Was he a left-handed or right-handed?

354
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,249
He was right-handed.

355
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,582
Shouldn't you be back in class?

356
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:15,287
Let me ask you one more question.
What was the color of the plastic bag?

357
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,297
It was black.

358
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:25,664
That's right. I found a black
plastic bag at the location.

359
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,711
So I put some shit in
this little plastic bag here.

360
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,980
It looked like this, right?

361
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,294
What the...! How dare you throw
that at the school president?

362
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:58,575
This is the kind of plastic bag that was
used by the attacker on all 3 victims.

363
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:05,107
All of the victims were attacked in a
300-meters radius from their schools.

364
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:10,551
But you were attacked in a location
that was a kilometer away from school.

365
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:18,357
And the place where you were standing
was a hill. The shit can't reach you.

366
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:28,364
Then what are you saying?
You're accusing the prez of lying?

367
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,810
Huh? You think he doesn't
deserve to be hit by shit?

368
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,582
Owww... Owww. Owww.

369
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,281
Let me down. Owww...

370
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:58,290
You seem to have a lot of time on your
hands after quitting the school body.

371
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,467
Don't you have better things to do?

372
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:10,912
Look here. You're the one who
seems to have a lot of free time.

373
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,448
What?!

374
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,383
- Is that true?
- That's gross.

375
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:30,066
But I treated you to lunch after I
won the best. So give me $5 back.

376
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,326
It was a big hoax?

377
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,130
The game isn't over yet.

378
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,412
Then who is next?

379
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:46,042
- Hee-chul is gonna be the next victim.
- I don't know. I think it'll be Kang In.

380
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,481
You bitch!

381
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,965
BoA! BoA... Oh...

382
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:18,313
- Damn it. What is it?
- Hello?

383
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,915
- What?!
- What?!

384
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,318
The dopey-looking Si-won is out
of the picture. Now it's just him.

385
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,963
I can smell the shit
coming right at me...

386
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,911
Hello everyone. I'm Sung-min.

387
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:55,179
Right now I'm at the school where
there are a few possible victims.

388
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,450
As you can see here, their fans are
gathered here

389
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,513
and rooting for them

390
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,218
I am so surprised to see them

391
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,196
cheer
for their idols so passionately

392
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,398
I think they're excited to see me.

393
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,960
I'm the first one who got hit by shit.

394
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,838
Perhaps, they're going crazy
because of my movie star looks.

395
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:22,241
And as we speak, I see the
school president approaching...

396
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,713
I will try to ask him a few questions.
Could you tell us why you lied?

397
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:30,144
- Why did you plan that hoax?
- You! Which program is this?! Huh?!

398
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,646
Please cooperate with our interview.

399
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,661
- No, he couldn't have done that.
- I'm telling you. He's sleazy.

400
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,621
He's coming!

401
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,293
- He looks so sleazy.
- What's up with him?

402
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,501
It's not him.

403
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,033
- It's Kang In.
- Where?

404
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,951
- What the...?
- It's not him either

405
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:15,459
So that's how May passed by. The school
president made a big jerk out of himself

406
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,899
As another day passed by without any
news, the kids became restless.

407
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,973
Everyone couldn't believe it was over.

408
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,669
They kept waiting for the attacker.

409
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,144
I'm Hee-chul...
The loser has to buy spicy rice cakes
Why were the kids so interested in
this incident? Did it make them feel

410
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,310
good when a handsome
guy got hit by shit?

411
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:44,655
Or is because they wanted
some excitement in their lives?

412
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:18,582
Alright. Let's try to focus now!
Do you kids want to die?!

413
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:27,088
Oh, gosh. No one is focused
in class. Isn't it terrible?

414
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:34,202
Where is this so-called attacker?
He should just go ahead and do it.

415
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,266
Did he quit?

416
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:43,846
- Perhaps the attacker is sick.
- Does he have hemorrhoids?

417
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:50,952
I've thought about it and you know...
The problem lies with you.

418
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,950
- What?
- Look...

419
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,224
Let's say he's the attacker

420
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,931
Please throw shit at me. No
Just take a dump here

421
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,422
And take a shit on top of my face
Don't hold it in

422
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,371
Don't go overboard. Let's focus, OK?

423
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,309
Oh gosh. That smells terrible

424
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,343
Will you stop eating bamboo, Bear

425
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,980
Anyway, let's say he wants to
attack you.

426
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,748
Can you do it?

427
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,087
That's the problem.
You're no match for him.

428
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:35,527
The attacker probably knows who you are.
He knows you're a judo expert.

429
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,893
He would be crazy to throw shit at you.

430
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,405
Oh, that attacker is spineless...

431
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:49,836
But you know, I'm just big
because I've got big bones...

432
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,111
Yeah, I know that.
But you look like a bad-ass criminal.

433
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,250
- Then what should I do?
- You need to give him an advantage.

434
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,251
An advantage?

435
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,628
Bear! Are you ready?

436
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,296
Alright. Just bear with me.
Here I go.

437
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,806
- What is it?
- Hey, break my arm instead.

438
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,433
Your arm? You're such a weakling.

439
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,067
- I'm not a weakling.
- It's all the same.

440
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,670
- Breaking my arm will be better.
- Oh, brother.

441
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,446
- Here I go.
- Don't tell me in advance. Just do it.

442
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,883
What the hell are you doing to him?!

443
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,731
Will you stop pigging out?
Come on. Look at this.

444
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:50,401
There's a telephone pole here.

445
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:56,868
Here, here, and here...
Did you know this?

446
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:01,613
Every victim was attacked while
they stood next to a recycling bin.

447
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,749
And all the attacks occurred
between 9 PM and 10 PM.

448
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:09,854
- Hey, you're like that guy on C.S.I.
- So what do you want me to do?

449
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,928
So I'm trying to say that you
should wait at these places

450
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:23,767
That's a great idea
You're pretty smart

451
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:29,007
- If I wait here, the shit will come...
- Hey, how do you know all that stuff?

452
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:34,280
And the next day, I'll be more
popular than Kang In at school.

453
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,091
Bear..., you can go

454
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,566
You lazy fellas. This is why you
can't make it to the nationals

455
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,368
Listen here. Are you going to
become pro wrestlers or what?

456
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:03,344
What kind of nonsense is this?!
You're the captain of the Judo team

457
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:13,412
Don't give me that look!
Stand down!

458
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,671
- His bone is...
- What?

459
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,971
- He's got big bones.
- What?

460
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,048
- He doesn't need a cast
- I see

461
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,077
- I need a cast!
- He needs a cast!

462
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:57,060
Cause I can't stop thinkin' 'bout
you girl. You're mine.

463
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,964
I'm pretty handsome myself...

464
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:11,141
- What the...? Were you in there?
- Yeah

465
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:21,413
- Are you constipated?
- Do you have to ask that?

466
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,060
- Dong-hae...
- Yeah?

467
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:37,301
- Forget it. When are you going home?
- I'll go after rehearsals

468
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,336
- I'm going home.
- What?

469
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,907
Oh, brother

470
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:10,271
I'm a high school senior. I know I
shouldn't be wasting my time on this.

471
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,941
But I can't stop myself. I wonder why?

472
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:19,848
Just being a 18-year-old teenager
could be a bad thing

473
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,581
We don't know what our future holds.
We're still searching for ourselves.

474
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:30,991
Adults say that we've got potential.
But that just makes us more nervous.

475
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,303
Damn it. Hey!
You're too close!

476
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,909
If you keep following me like that,
the attacker will get spooked.

477
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,911
Use your brain for Pete's sakes

478
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,718
You can't do anything right.

479
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,254
You guys are so annoying.

480
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:42,063
He's so self-centered. We're trying
to help out but he has such an attitude.

481
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:48,031
- He's always been like that.
- I don't care if he gets shit on him.

482
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:54,065
- I'm going home. How about you?
- I don't know.

483
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,738
What do you mean you don't know?
He says he can do it himself. Bye.

484
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:06,086
Hello? Mom! I want to have barbecue
pork tonight. Oh, that's great.

485
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:56,031
Here it comes. I'm the perfect pretty
boy! I deserve to get hit by shit

486
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:59,438
Don't hesitate. Go ahead and do it
Get ready

487
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,945
You look like a fool.

488
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,518
What are you doing here?

489
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,255
What about yourself?

490
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,101
I came to get some fresh air.

491
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:34,505
- What happened to your arm?
- I said I came to get some fresh air!

492
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:55,790
Hey you

493
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,577
What are you doing here?

494
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:17,047
- I'm on my way home.
- But this isn't the way to your home.

495
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:23,257
I walk along this route, too.
What are you doing here?

496
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:29,229
Me? I came to ask you a few questions.

497
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,664
Are you saying you were following me?

498
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,801
- I guess so.
- What do you need to ask me about?

499
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,135
Did you know?

500
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,679
We're the only ones
who call our school Neul Paran High?

501
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,374
All the other schools call
our school Paran High.

502
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:53,447
They probably think our school starts
with the letter "P" instead of"N."

503
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,757
Really?

504
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:02,662
Remember when we had to stay at school
until 11PM because our class came in last?

505
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:08,670
I skipped class of course. That was the
day when the attacker was gonna strike.

506
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,503
Nothing happened that day. The
president just pretended he got attacked

507
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,813
So, you think someone in our
class is the attacker?

508
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:25,812
No...
I think it's you

509
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,224
Hey! That doesn't make any sense

510
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:42,262
It does. When I read your blog, you said
our school would be the next target

511
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:49,772
You didn't flush the toilet earlier.
What's in your bag?

512
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,740
What? You got a stupid cast over nothing?

513
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,045
You're trying hard to get hit by shit

514
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:30,085
I really got a fracture.
What kind of pose was that?

515
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,983
Were you posing for the camera?

516
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,720
- Do you want to die?
- You!

517
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,829
Geez! But why are you on the judo team?
It's not a popular sport any more.

518
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,629
Look at yourself. How will dancing
help you get into college?

519
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,342
That's not important.
Doing what you want to do is important.

520
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:05,948
Doing what you want to do...
But what are we doing here?

521
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:10,887
But is there really an
attacker out there?

522
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:27,576
Why'd you do it? You're a
straight-A student

523
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,943
Just because
I was bored

524
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:38,710
- That's it?
- I don't know

525
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,985
There are lots of kids who want
to become celebrities

526
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:48,356
I used to write insults on their blog
homepages

527
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,032
but it started to get lame

528
01:02:54,771 --> 01:03:00,607
I just wanted to teach some kids a
lesson. But my blog started to get hits.

529
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:06,574
The funny thing is that nobody
suspected me of being the attacker

530
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:15,988
The peculiar thing is that after
I got so many hits, it felt great

531
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:24,829
It was the first time I ever
got so much attention

532
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,499
So it felt that good to get so
many visitors to your blog?

533
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,843
It felt damn good at first
But when it became too much

534
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,343
I felt a little scared about
getting all that attention

535
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,309
I started it out as a prank
I just couldn't stop

536
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,021
I'm relieved that someone
I knew finally figured it was me

537
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:57,765
You're a really wacky guy
You throw shit at kids.

538
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,768
Hey, everyone had fun

539
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,233
You're right

540
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:11,035
So who were you planning to hit next?

541
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,174
Kang In? Or Hee-chul?

542
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,685
I don't know

543
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,025
Are you curious?

544
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,492
Hey!

545
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,393
What if we do this?

546
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:03,562
Hey, they say that Hee-chul is in love
with himself. How could you stand him?

547
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:07,668
Tell me about it.
I want to lose weight but I just can't.

548
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:15,701
Anyway, it's good to have you on our
team. We needed new recruits.

549
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,345
Do you have anything else to eat?

550
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,318
- I don't care about that attacker any more!
- What?

551
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,789
Hey fatso, what are you doing here?

552
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,225
What? Fatso?

553
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,332
I quit dancing. I'm going to
join the judo team

554
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:49,405
Oh. You're pretty strong
Welcome to our team

555
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:18,935
Dong-hae! Teach me how
ending routine! Please!

556
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:23,837
Where did he go?
Who is she? Hey, who are you?

557
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,750
Oh, that ballerina
Where'd your ballerina dress go?

558
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:36,314
I quit ballet. I thought
I'd join your dance group

559
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:39,883
Oh, stop joking. This isn't child's play

560
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:44,193
It's a lot much harder than ballet

561
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:43,353
Well, you've got some funky skills
Come over here

562
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:48,489
Can you do this? Look closely
It's a really hard move. Here I go

563
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:57,231
One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight. Dada

564
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,709
That was a basic move actually
A very basic move... This is a little

565
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,506
more difficult. It's an intermediate
level move. Watch it

566
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,449
I'll show it to you

567
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,751
Someone got hit!

568
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:09,601
Hey. Go back to your classrooms!

569
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:16,607
Go back inside!

570
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:42,810
And that's how the Pretty Boy
Attacker incident ended.

571
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:48,643
I didn't intend to mint celebrities with
my prank. Nor was I trying to make a

572
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,910
statement against the pursuit of the
perfect look

573
01:09:56,192 --> 01:10:00,356
And the kids got back to their usual routine

574
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,867
People started to forget...

575
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:10,136
about who would
be next or the attacker's identity.

576
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:18,676
What were the kids looking for?
Something to gossip about?

577
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:27,913
What did I want to get out of it?

578
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:12,967
As the SATs loomed ahead, the kids
forgot the incidents

579
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:17,499
We were still stuck as high school kids

580
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,440
And in our little world, a new legend
is bound to appear.

581
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,874
He could be a star
or idolized by his friends.

582
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:31,519
That's the world of high
school students...

583
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,090
Hey, you shit king!

584
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,722
What are you doing out here again?
You think you're some philosopher?

585
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:49,302
- How does it feel to be a star?
- Well it felt good at first

586
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,433
But it started to get old
and a little annoying

587
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:57,778
But you know... There's one thing
I've been waiting to ask you

588
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,369
What?

589
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:05,482
- Did you use your own shit?
- What? You want to know that?

590
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:10,991
I'm not exactly curious. But it's dirty

591
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:17,222
You collected your shit like this?

592
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,598
- Do you want me to show you how?
- No thanks

593
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:25,331
- Come over here
- You're messing up my hair

594
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:35,076
- So what are you gonna do tonight?
- Is there anything fun to do?

595
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:42,921
- Did you know that Shin-dong quit?
- Who is he? Oh, that fatso

596
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:51,064
- We have a girl in our group now.
- Really? Is she pretty?

597
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,100
Oh, she's got a sexy figure
When she dances...

598
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:59,432
Her "wave" dance will turn you on

599
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:04,670
- Dong-hae, can you introduce her to me?
- No. I can't...

600
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:11,316
- Hey, I'm a stud
- You need to hit the books.

601
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,484
- You're not my friend any more.
- Oh, come on

602
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:48,154
You can choose your future.
The concept of your life.

603
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:54,025
I'm doing well. I'm a fine person.
Trust yourself. Look into the mirror

604
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:59,796
With the light glimmering around
you as you smile

605
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:02,668
There could be sad memories
that make you cry

606
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:09,768
Don't forget that you have a shoulder
to lean on in this world

607
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:15,812
I've the whole world in my heart...

608
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:20,888
Let's keep running. For tomorrow
For our future

609
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:26,293
To become a shining light under the sun

610
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:27,522
Wonder Boy! Yeah!

611
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:33,491
He always has a secret but it's
easy to find the answers

612
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:39,337
Dance with me. Just move your body
to the music. Don't be afraid, girl

613
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:45,176
You don't have to fear
anything except fear itself

614
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:48,150
There could be sad memories
that make you cry

615
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:53,486
I'm the one who'll start and end it.

616
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:59,761
Let there be light and
become a shining star

617
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:04,832
The sun is welcoming me with
rays of light...

618
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:09,930
I just need one umbrella
and that'll be fine

619
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:22,281
Don't hide your tears from me. Yeah!
You can lean on my shoulder and cry out loud

620
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:27,954
Looking at the crimson red sun
setting in the sky...

621
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:37,730
It's a spectacle that the
heavens have given me

622
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:51,711
There is no end. A bright future
lies ahead of you

623
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:58,716
The sun bathes me with its warm
light under the blue sky

624
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:03,384
I just need one umbrella
and that'll be fine

625
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:07,122
To become a shining light
under the sun

626
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:18,730
Lalala, lalalalala, lalalala.
Lalalala, lalalalala, lalalalala

627
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:23,676
The sun is welcoming
me with rays of light...

628
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:29,047
I just need one umbrella
and that'll be fine

629
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,483
I'm Wonder Boy! Yeah

630
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,341
Are you done yet?

631
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,457
Did you have diarrhea?

632
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,094
Here. Well done.

633
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,909
Good-bye.
