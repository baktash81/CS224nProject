<i>We'll be back in a moment.</i>

00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:39,725
<i>Is it time for that big

19
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:43,183
<i>This may be the most important

35
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,274
<i>Ask any cop, he'll tell you,</i>

36
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:31,777
<i>"If you can't stand the heat, you

<i>Good luck, Frank.</i>

45
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:06,558
Attempted murder? It's not
like he killed someone.

46
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,985
This is a clear violation
of my client's civil rights.

47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,906
Make it aggravated assault,
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,735
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag,

49
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,946
and scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning!

50
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:22,999
Now get out of my police station,
and take laughing boy with you!

51
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:24,371
Get over there!

52
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,829
You have the right to remain silent.
Do you understand me?

53
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,004
Sure, sure.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,798
-Priors?
-No.

55
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:31,965
Hi.

56
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,921
Uh, Murphy. Transferring
in from Metro South.

57
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,505
Nice precinct.

58
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:39,591
Yeah, pretty good.

59
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,145
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armor and suit up.

60
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:50,776
Please take me home!

61
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,604
Not now, E.J. Get
a cup of coffee.

62
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:53,779
Oh, Sarge.

63
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,823
Stark, is there any word
on Frederickson?

64
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,616
They're still listing
him as critical.

65
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:00,036
His wife must be going
out of her mind.

66
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:01,704
-Murphy, huh?
-Yeah, that's me.

67
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:02,951
-Manson.
-Hi.

68
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,782
What brings you to this
little paradise?

69
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,540
Beats me, man. I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys up here.

70
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:11,543
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,340
They're gonna manage this
department right into the ground!

72
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,470
-Where are you from?
-Metro South.

73
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:19,638
Welcome to hell.

74
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,057
-Murphy.
-Yo.

75
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,055
You cut 10 guys loose
over on the east side.

76
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,683
You try to get backup
when you're in a jam.

77
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

78
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em!

79
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:45,077
Oh, boy.

80
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,783
The funeral's tomorrow.

81
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,539
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

82
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:57,010
Any donations for the family may
be given to Cecil as usual.

83
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,970
And I don't want to hear
any more talk about strike!

84
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:06,728
We're not plumbers.
We're police officers.

85
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,772
And police officers
don't strike.

86
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,811
Murphy, front and center.

87
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,589
Hello, tiger.

88
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,887
Hey, hey, hey!

89
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:50,183
Oh, yes!

90
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:55,818
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

91
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:57,270
Get on your feet!

92
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,527
This guy's gonna be
your new partner.

93
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,113
Murphy, meet Lewis. Show
him the neighborhood.

94
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,164
Glad to know you, Murphy.

95
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,912
Pretty neat.

96
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:16,498
I better drive until you
know your way around.

97
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,965
I usually drive when I'm
breaking in a new partner.

98
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:44,443
You really think the old
man is gonna be there?

99
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,118
Why would they invite us?

100
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,992
All division heads are bringing
their support teams.

101
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,414
It's big.

102
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,457
I figure they're
green-lighting Delta City.

103
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,537
What, are you kidding? They never
do anything ahead of schedule.

104
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,170
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series
online and now he wants to show off.

105
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,091
Oh, That's-That's a tough
break, Bob.

106
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,794
What? What?

107
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:06,381
Well, ED 209 ran into serious
delays and cost overruns.

108
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:08,558
The old man ordered
a backup plan.

109
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,510
<i>95th floor. Have a nice day.</i>

110
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:12,971
Probably just to light
a fire under Jones' ass.

111
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,523
-Yeah?
-Old Bob here gets the assignment.

112
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:16,724
Yeah.

113
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,940
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

114
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:23,315
It's a better plan. Fucking Jones! I'd go
straight to the Old Man if I could.

115
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:25,650
Don't mess with Jones, man.
He'll make sushi out of you.

116
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,782
Yeah, you better be careful, man.
I heard Jones is a real shark.

117
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:30,579
-Who asked you, twerp?
-Bob.

118
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:32,703
What about this police
thing, what's the problem?

119
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,830
Their union's been bitching ever
since we took over.

120
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,957
You know, the usual nonsense.

121
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,162
We'll turn things around.

122
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,545
Mmm-hmm. Good, very good.
Let's get started.

123
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,008
Now, friends,

124
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:55,438
I've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

125
00:07:56,806 --> 00:08:00,106
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

126
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,487
In six months, we begin
construction of Delta City.

127
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,453
Where Old Detroit now stands.

128
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:16,117
Old Detroit has a cancer.

129
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,786
The cancer is crime.

130
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,873
And it must be cut out before we employ
the 2 million workers

131
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,050
that will breathe life
into this city again.

132
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,217
Yes.

133
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,678
Although shifts
in the tax structure

134
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:35,011
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth,

135
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:38,310
community services, in this
case law enforcement,

136
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,433
have suffered.

137
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:45,397
I think it's time
we gave something back.

138
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:48,440
Dick.

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,754
Take a close look at the track
record of this company.

140
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,833
And you'll see that we have
gambled in markets

141
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,465
traditionally regarded
as nonprofit.

142
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:13,224
Hospitals, prisons,
space exploration.

143
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,012
I say good business
is where you find it.

144
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:21,982
As you know, we've entered
into a contract with the city

145
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:24,276
to run local law enforcement.

146
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,609
But at Security Concepts,

147
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:31,738
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution.

148
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,700
No. We need something more.

149
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,081
We need a 24-hour-a-day
police officer.

150
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:41,327
A cop that doesn't
need to eat or sleep.

151
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,874
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

152
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,801
Fellow executives,

153
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:54,553
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

154
00:09:58,093 --> 00:09:59,470
Ed 209.

155
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,391
The Enforcement Droid series 209
is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

156
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,690
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification,

157
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,517
but that is only the beginning.

158
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,695
After a successful tour
of duty in Old Detroit,

159
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,571
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

160
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,870
-Dr. McNamara.
-We'll need an arrest subject.

161
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,197
-Mr. Kinney.
-Yes, sir?

162
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,497
Would you come up and give
us a hand, please?

163
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,870
Yes, sir.

164
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,796
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

165
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:10,128
Mr. Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

166
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,462
-Point it at Ed 209.
-Yes, sir.

167
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:27,813
<i>Please put down your weapon.
You have 20 seconds to comply.</i>

168
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,484
I think you'd better do
what he says, Mr. Kinney.

169
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,659
<i>You now have 15
seconds to comply.</i>

170
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,915
<i>-You are in direct violation...
-Cut the power! Pull the board!</i>

171
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,415
<i>of Penal Code 113, Section 9.</i>

172
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,933
<i>You now have
five seconds to comply.</i>

173
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:50,088
Help! Help me!

174
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:52,758
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

175
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,263
<i>I am now authorized
to use physical force.</i>

176
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:17,901
It's horrible.

177
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,074
Somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic?

178
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,403
-Let's go, Johnson!
-You pull the plug on this thing!

179
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,743
All right, don't touch him.

180
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:28,666
Don't touch him!

181
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:29,913
He didn't hear the gun drop.

182
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,335
He didn't hear it?

183
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,663
Oh, God.

184
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,374
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

185
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,921
I'm sure it's only a glitch,
a temporary setback.

186
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,926
You call this a glitch?

187
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:47,013
We're scheduled to begin
construction in six months.

188
00:12:47,093 --> 00:12:51,018
Your temporary setback could cost us $50
million in interest payments alone.

189
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,815
Not necessarily, sir.

190
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,688
Perhaps you're aware
of the Robocop program

191
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,519
developed by myself
at Security Concepts

192
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:58,696
as a contingency against just
this sort of thing.

193
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:00,318
Thank you for your concern,
Mr. Morton.

194
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:00,966
I'm sure this is something

195
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,442
-Now, wait a minute.
-we can take up in my office...

196
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,308
Dick!

197
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,327
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

198
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:09,499
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

199
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:12,703
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton.
How long will it take?

200
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:13,786
We're ready to go, sir.

201
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,542
We've restructured
the police department

202
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:17,715
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor.

203
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,213
I'm confident that we can go
to prototype within 90 days.

204
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,920
Good, very good. Get your staff
together, Mr. Morton.

205
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,631
I'll expect a full
presentation in 20 minutes.

206
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:27,800
Thank you, sir.

207
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,313
Yes! Now, that's how it's done
in the big leagues, Johnson.

208
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,861
You see an opening,
you go for it.

209
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:43,157
You better watch your back, Bob. Jones
is going to come looking for you.

210
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:47,154
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

211
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,663
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

212
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,033
That's life in the big city.

213
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,668
When do we start?

214
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,463
As soon as some poor
schmuck volunteers.

215
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,458
<i>Unit 3509, proceed
to Hall and Grand.</i>

216
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,418
<i>411 involving indigents.</i>

217
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,845
<i>Roger, we're on our way.</i>

218
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:16,691
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

219
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:20,191
Yeah, my son, Jimmy, watches
this cop show, <i>TJ Lazer,</i>

220
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,239
and this Lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy.

221
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:25,692
So naturally, my kid thinks
every good cop should be...

222
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,698
And you don't want
to disappoint him.

223
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:32,411
Yeah, well, role models can
be very important to a boy.

224
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,291
Okay, okay, I get
a kick out of it.

225
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:43,467
<i>All units, all units, sector 9.</i>

226
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,385
-That's for...
<i>-211 in progress.</i>

227
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,551
Why don't you drive?

228
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:51,468
<i>the suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.</i>

229
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:55,270
Shit.

230
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,186
I don't believe it!

231
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,357
What?

232
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,652
You burned the fucking money!

233
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,775
I had to blow the door.
What do you want?

234
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,856
It's as good as marked,
you asshole!

235
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,318
You stupid, stupid asshole!

236
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,994
-Clarence!
-What? What do you want?

237
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,743
We got a cop on our tail.

238
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,838
Come on, man, speed it up!
Move it!

239
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,087
This crate ain't
gonna outrun a cop.

240
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,760
-Slow down, then.
-What, are you crazy, man?

241
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:29,760
Shut the fuck up and do it!
Just do it!

242
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,718
Central, this is 154. We're
in pursuit of 211 suspect.

243
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,972
Request backup.

244
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,936
<i>Roger, 154.</i>

245
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:38,605
<i>-Backup currently unavailable.</i>
-Give me your piece.

246
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:41,184
<i>Backup E.T.A., 15 minutes.</i>

247
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,855
Bobby, get the door!

248
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,194
Everybody load up!

249
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,022
All right, let's go. Come on!

250
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,650
-Okay.
-All right, here we go.

251
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:54,993
Now.

252
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,369
What the fuck? Where did he go?

253
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:01,578
Emil?

254
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,039
Here! He's up here!

255
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:08,545
He's on the side.

256
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,129
He's over here!

257
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:18,516
Get him!

258
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,443
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

259
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,775
Leon, pick him up.

260
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,902
-Ready?
-No, hang on.

261
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,037
Bobby.

262
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:38,912
-Can you fly, Bobby?
-Clarence, no!

263
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,500
Hit it!

264
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:44,126
No!

265
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:07,235
Central, this is unit 154.

266
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,905
We located that van
by the old mill in Sector 3D.

267
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,324
<i>-Now, where is that backup?
-Backup is still unavailable.</i>

268
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,826
Oh, man!

269
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,654
<i>We estimate 10 minutes
before units can arrive.</i>

270
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:19,157
Well, you call it.

271
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,660
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

272
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,668
Go.

273
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,004
Stay in touch.

274
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:16,971
Freeze.

275
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,352
Okay, let's see those hands.

276
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,558
Nice and easy.

277
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:25,514
Sure.

278
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,688
Mind if I zip this up?

279
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,836
We keep robbing banks, but we never
get to keep the money.

280
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,336
Takes money to make money.

281
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,588
We steal money to buy coke,

282
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,886
then sell the coke
to make even more money.

283
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,008
Capital investment, man.

284
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,761
Yeah, why bother making it
when we can just steal it?

285
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,514
Ain't no better way to steal
money than free enterprise.

286
00:19:02,593 --> 00:19:04,015
-Smoke?
-No.

287
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:06,597
-You know, those things will kill you.
-Yeah.

288
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:09,308
You want to live forever?

289
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,268
<i>Bixby!</i>

290
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,279
<i>What a cake! Oh, boy!</i>

291
00:19:21,612 --> 00:19:22,613
Hey.

292
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,449
Don't move.

293
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,538
Go ahead and do it.

294
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:33,961
Dead or alive, you're
coming with me.

295
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:43,141
<i>Lewis. Lewis!</i>

296
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,179
Lewis, I got a situation
here, girl.

297
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:49,640
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

298
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:52,101
Turn around. Spread your legs.
That's right.

299
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,654
<i>Lewis, where are you?
You all right?</i>

300
00:19:57,648 --> 00:20:00,071
Put your hands on your head.
Lewis?

301
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,991
Why don't you let us take
over from here, Emil?

302
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:28,270
-Your ass is mine.
-No.

303
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,766
Not yet it ain't.

304
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:45,700
Well, what have we here?

305
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,743
You a good cop, hotshot?

306
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,546
Sure you are.

307
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,587
Why, you got to be some kind of great
cop to come in here all by yourself.

308
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,222
Where's your partner?

309
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,723
Where's your partner?

310
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,430
Well, guys, the other
one was upstairs.

311
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,563
She was sweet, mmm, mmm, mmm.

312
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:17,103
I took her out.

313
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:23,867
I bet that really
pisses you off.

314
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,500
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy.

315
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,168
Do you?

316
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,251
Buddy, I think you're slime.

317
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,920
You see, I got this problem.

318
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:48,309
Cops don't like me,
so I don't like cops.

319
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,781
Well, give the man a hand.

320
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,594
He's all yours.

321
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:27,162
-All right, look out.
-Turn around, man.

322
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,538
Hey, pretty boy, hey, over here.

323
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,277
Shit! I'm out of ammo.

324
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:49,573
Me, too.

325
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:52,397
Does it hurt, does it hurt...?

326
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,223
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

327
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,420
Okay, fun's over.

328
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,352
Okay, let's get out of here.

329
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,585
Good night, sweet prince.

330
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,588
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

331
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,601
Murphy.

332
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,500
Get him over. Lift!

333
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,132
Get the ventilator.

334
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:00,884
Put him in OR 4.

335
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:08,020
Easy, easy. Turn.

336
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,809
Slow it down now. Slow
it down, slow it down.

337
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:14,519
Okay, hit the door.

338
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:20,399
Let me get pressure.

339
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:21,734
Mask him.

340
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,612
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

341
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,536
All right, we have
to intubate this guy.

342
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:29,666
Apply cricoid pressure.

343
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,913
Okay. All right, I got it in.
Breath sounds.

344
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:36,211
-You're in.
-Other side.

345
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,836
Okay, let's go ahead and get
the MAST trousers up.

346
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,199
Let's get the clothes off.

347
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:44,216
Okay, clothes off. Let's prep
him for a central line.

348
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:47,393
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

349
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,087
<i>His pressure's dropping.</i>

350
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:55,192
<i>Okay, I've got
a central line in.</i>

351
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,985
<i>I'm getting pressure back.
Normal saline.</i>

352
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,233
Can you do that, Dad?

353
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:03,822
I really have to tell
you something.

354
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,182
<i>-What's our blood pressure?
-I've got 40 palp.</i>

355
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,580
<i>All right.</i>

356
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,672
Coarse V-Fib. Okay,
we got to shock him.

357
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,420
Let's get the Ambu bag.

358
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:20,172
Clear the patches.

359
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,010
Put the Foley in.

360
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,214
Let's go ahead and blow
his MAST trousers.

361
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,468
Stand clear.

362
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:27,470
Stand clear. Shock him.

363
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:28,892
<i>All right.</i>

364
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:31,846
Coarse V-Fib.
Let's shock him again.

365
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:33,435
Clear.

366
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,312
<i>All right.</i>

367
00:25:36,392 --> 00:25:39,191
Flatline. Let's go
intracardiac epinephrine.

368
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,567
Let's go.

369
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:41,943
Okay.

370
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,530
All right, it's in.

371
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:46,735
There's no pulse.

372
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,789
All right, let's go ahead and shock
a flat line, and let's quit.

373
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,063
Okay, everybody, clear!

374
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,120
Stand clear.

375
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,050
All right, I think
that's all we can do.

376
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,344
Let's call it. What's the time?

377
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,009
6:15.

378
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,067
Sharp.

379
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,491
No, it's starting to roll.

380
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,323
Still rolling.

381
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:30,154
-Shit!
-Nope.

382
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,533
Let me see.

383
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:36,285
Bring in the L.E.D.

384
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:38,329
Let's lock it down.

385
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:48,005
-He's on.
-What's the story?

386
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:49,761
We were able
to save the left arm.

387
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,719
What? I thought we agreed
on total body prosthesis.

388
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,520
-Now, lose the arm, okay?
-Jesus, Morton.

389
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,774
Can he understand
what I'm saying?

390
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,147
It doesn't matter. We're gonna
blank his memory, anyway.

391
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:03,820
Well, I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think, Johnson?

392
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,115
Well, he signed the release
forms when he joined the force.

393
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,569
He's legally dead. We can do
pretty much what we want to.

394
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:12,704
Lose the arm.

395
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,874
Shut him down. Prep
him for surgery.

396
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:22,881
The entire outer skin
will be like this.

397
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:25,084
It's titanium laminated
with Kevlar.

398
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,215
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

399
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:31,223
Come here often? How you doing?

400
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:34,184
Oh, God!

401
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,187
He's got a hell of a grip.

402
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:41,312
It's 400 foot-pounds. He could
crush every bone in your hand.

403
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,770
All right. Attach
it to his shoulder.

404
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:45,399
I like that.

405
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:53,912
You are gonna be
a bad motherfucker.

406
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:03,543
Hey, look, look!
He's watching us!

407
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:04,965
How you doing?

408
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,508
-Hi!
-Hi!

409
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,171
Happy new year!

410
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:11,506
This is for you.

411
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,180
Happy new year.

412
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,022
We get the best of both worlds.

413
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:26,604
The fastest reflexes modern
technology has to offer,

414
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:28,439
on board computer-assisted
memory,

415
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,696
and a lifetime of on-the-street
law enforcement programming.

416
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:34,904
It is my great pleasure
to present to you,

417
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:37,865
Robocop.

418
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,662
Come on, come on, COME on.

419
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:45,793
Come on. That's for you.
That's for you.

420
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:47,125
Go, Robo.

421
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,403
I am what you call
a repeat offender.

422
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,823
I repeat, I will offend again.

423
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,151
I get my orders
from a higher source.

424
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:14,485
Shut up, asshole.

425
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,242
Does your mother know
you talk like that?

426
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:21,078
Bring him
in through the side door.

427
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,956
This holding cell has
been set up for observation.

428
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:24,036
Looks perfect.

429
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,839
-What is this all about?
-Who is this guy?

430
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:27,714
-Sergeant John Reed.
-What's this all about?

431
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:31,339
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

432
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:33,045
I think we've got four
or five days setup...

433
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:36,507
Hey, this is bullshit!
I take my orders from...

434
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,617
What is this shit?

435
00:29:55,943 --> 00:29:57,183
Yeah, good question.

436
00:29:57,736 --> 00:30:00,785
-Hey, wait for me, partner.
-Let's go.

437
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:02,703
There they are.

438
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,201
Go.

439
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,016
When you are at rest, you
will sit in the chair.

440
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,809
<i>Yes. I understand.</i>

441
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,553
What about tracking?

442
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:25,227
We can check his exact location
at all times with one of these.

443
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,396
How does he eat?

444
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:30,603
His digestive system
is extremely simple.

445
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,734
This processor dispenses
a rudimentary paste

446
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,111
that sustains
his organic system.

447
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,999
Tastes like baby food.

448
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:48,249
Knock yourself out.

449
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,422
Mmm.

450
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:00,849
Okay, let's start with tracking.

451
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:02,016
-Give me a grid.
-Got it.

452
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,139
There.

453
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:04,265
-Target?
-Check.

454
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,681
-Target.
-Check.

455
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:08,106
Now follow.

456
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:12,443
Check.

457
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:16,031
Voice stress analyzer,
one, two...

458
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,198
Ahhh.

459
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:18,491
-... three.
-Ahhh.

460
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,534
-Check.
-Record.

461
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,611
Ahhh.

462
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:22,488
-Now playback.
-Bring it up 50%.

463
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,207
<i>-Now playback.
-Bring it up 50%.</i>

464
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:26,454
<i>Give me a full frame.</i>

465
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,285
-We got it.
-All right, clear out.

466
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,747
What are your prime directives?

467
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:36,461
<i>Serve the public trust, protect
the innocent, uphold the law.</i>

468
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,473
That's good.

469
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,217
That's very good.

470
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,100
Huh?

471
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:53,602
I fucking love that guy!

472
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:32,933
Hey, Lewis, it's Supercop.

473
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:34,984
Look at that fucking gun.

474
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,993
Shit!

475
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,797
-This guy's really good.
-He's not a guy. He's a machine.

476
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,795
What are they gonna
do, replace us?

477
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:06,676
Come on.

478
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:13,356
-Reed.
-Yeah?

479
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:14,809
He needs a car.

480
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,937
<i>Thank you.</i>

481
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,068
Sure. Anytime.

482
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,943
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

483
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:00,233
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

484
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,752
Will there be
anything else, sir?

485
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:18,455
Yeah, empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

486
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:19,881
Excuse me?

487
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:23,798
I said give me your money
and all of it, and don't fuck with me!

488
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:25,129
Now move!

489
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:27,597
Open the safe, Pops.

490
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:30,467
Open the goddamn safe!

491
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,097
We don't have a safe.

492
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:36,023
Shit! There's your goddamn safe!
Open that son of a bitch!

493
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,974
Quit stalling, man! I'm
gonna count to three!

494
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:39,401
You better open
that son of a bitch.

495
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,944
Come on! Come on!

496
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,067
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

497
00:34:44,523 --> 00:34:47,197
-I'll open the safe.
-Good boy.

498
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:48,534
Come on.

499
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,576
Well, you better open
that on the count of three.

500
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,783
One, two...

501
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:57,870
Fuck me.

502
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:00,922
<i>Drop the gun. You
are under arrest.</i>

503
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:03,591
Fuck me! Fuck me!

504
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,796
Fuck me! Fuck me!

505
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,132
Fuck me! Fuck me!

506
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,058
Fuck me!

507
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,982
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.</i>

508
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,367
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

509
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,596
Don't touch me! Get away!
Get away!

510
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:51,264
We don't want your bag!

511
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:52,803
We want you!

512
00:35:54,926 --> 00:35:58,021
Take it easy! We don't
want to hurt you!

513
00:35:58,096 --> 00:35:59,143
That's too much hair.

514
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,566
I know, we'll give
her a haircut!

515
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,654
-Hey, hey.
-What?

516
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,825
There's more hair down there!

517
00:36:12,444 --> 00:36:14,321
No, don't!

518
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:18,415
Please!

519
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,417
No!

520
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:21,954
Help me!

521
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:24,589
Help me!

522
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:27,710
<i>Let the woman go. You
are under arrest.</i>

523
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:28,918
Shit!

524
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,596
You better back up, pal!

525
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:33,594
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

526
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:35,471
He's gonna kill her!

527
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,427
You fucking bitch!

528
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,353
He's gonna kill her, man!

529
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,306
He's gonna kill her!

530
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,316
<i>Your move, creep.</i>

531
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:52,571
Okay!

532
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,493
It's okay!

533
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,079
I was so scared. Thank you.

534
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:04,796
Thank you.

535
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,418
<i>Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.</i>

536
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:12,050
<i>I will notify a rape
crisis center.</i>

537
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,019
<i>All units, Sector 6, please
close intersections...</i>

538
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,573
I don't care. Get those
men by the stairs now!

539
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:36,904
Hit it!

540
00:37:39,614 --> 00:37:42,743
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

541
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:45,705
But that changed today when
former city councilman Ron Miller

542
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,460
entered City Hall with a gun.

543
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:48,916
He's now on the second floor

544
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,593
holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

545
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:55,514
We do believe that Miller has
killed one of the hostages.

546
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,633
Lieutenant, what's next?

547
00:37:57,716 --> 00:37:59,889
We wait. Terrorism
is a very tricky business.

548
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,096
Maximum and immediate
retaliation is the best policy.

549
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,179
But unfortunately...

550
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:05,394
Excuse us.

551
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:07,271
Where are you going?

552
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:11,029
Statement, please.

553
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:18,995
Let's have some crowd control!
Come on, get these people back!

554
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,913
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

555
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,741
<i>Keep him talking.</i>

556
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:27,704
Who made you?

557
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,169
Are you invincible?

558
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:38,139
<i>Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.</i>

559
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:41,927
First, don't fuck with me!
I'm a desperate man!

560
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:45,806
And second, I want
some fresh coffee!

561
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,767
And third, I want a recount!

562
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,195
And no matter how it turns
out, I want my old job back!

563
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,487
<i>Okay.</i>

564
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,657
And I want a bigger office!

565
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,901
And I want a new car!

566
00:38:57,984 --> 00:38:59,827
And I want the City
to pay for it all!

567
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:02,122
<i>What kind of car, Miller?</i>

568
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,165
Something with reclining
leather seats,

569
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,164
that goes really fast and gets
really shitty gas mileage!

570
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:10,247
<i>How about the 6000 SUX?</i>

571
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,591
Yeah! Okay, sure!

572
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:18,471
What about cruise control? Does
it come with cruise control?

573
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:23,473
<i>Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor
go, we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.</i>

574
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:27,522
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

575
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:30,521
When people jerk me
off, I kill them!

576
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,227
You want to see?

577
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,196
Get up, Your Honor, get up.
Get up!

578
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:40,868
Your public wants to see you!

579
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:44,868
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

580
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,496
We'll get serious now!

581
00:39:47,575 --> 00:39:49,669
And kiss the Mayor's ass
good-bye!

582
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,266
<i>Robocop. Who is he?</i>

583
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:05,810
<i>What is he? Where
does he come from?</i>

584
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,229
<i>He's OCP's newest soldier</i>

585
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:10,773
<i>in their revolutionary
crime management program.</i>

586
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,398
<i>OCP Spokesmen claim
that the fearless machine</i>

587
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,570
<i>has crooks on the run
in Old Detroit.</i>

588
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:18,068
<i>Today, kids at Lee lacocca
Elementary School</i>

589
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,491
<i>got to meet in person</i>

590
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:22,445
<i>what their parents only read
about in comic books.</i>

591
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:24,905
<i>Robe, excuse me, Robo.
Any special message</i>

592
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,990
<i>for all the kids
watching at home?</i>

593
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:30,334
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

594
00:40:31,494 --> 00:40:33,747
<i>More fighting
in the Mexican crisis today</i>

595
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,333
<i>when American troops
participated in a joint raid</i>

596
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:37,508
<i>with Mexican nationals</i>

597
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,212
<i>against rebel rocket
positions in Acapulco.</i>

598
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:41,838
<i>Now this.</i>

599
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:44,470
<i>Red alert. Red alert. Red alert.</i>

600
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:48,186
<i>You crossed my line of death.</i>

601
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:50,605
<i>You haven't dismantled
your MX stockpile.</i>

602
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,728
<i>Pakistan is threatening
my border.</i>

603
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:55,526
<i>That's it, buster. No
more military aid.</i>

604
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,149
<i>Nukem, get them
before they get you.</i>

605
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:08,122
<i>Today, labor leaders agreed
to sanction construction</i>

606
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:09,745
<i>of OCP's Delta City,</i>

607
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:13,044
<i>thereby creating an estimated
one million much-needed new jobs,</i>

608
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,874
<i>despite questions about worker
safety in dangerous Old Detroit.</i>

609
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:20,586
<i>Robert Morton, vice president,
Security Concepts, OCP.</i>

610
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,762
<i>I'm afraid I can't
comment on Delta City.</i>

611
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:24,384
<i>That's not my division.
But I will tell you this.</i>

612
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:27,555
<i>At Security Concepts,
we 're projecting the end of crime</i>

613
00:41:27,759 --> 00:41:29,978
<i>in Old Detroit within 40 days.</i>

614
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:33,105
<i>There's a new guy in town.
His name's Robocop.</i>

615
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:39,904
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy. Vice president.
Congratulations.

616
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,196
Handball Tuesday night?

617
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:43,695
Bill, I'd love to.
But I got a date.

618
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:45,994
Couple models coming over to my place.
Know what I mean?

619
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,946
I'd buy that for a dollar.

620
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:53,205
Welcome to the club, Bob.

621
00:41:54,786 --> 00:41:56,413
and that's a true story.

622
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,051
Making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

623
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,593
I try.

624
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,675
I'm in on the bottom line, pal.

625
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:07,303
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

626
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,886
Oh, you know, he's got this killer
rep, but it's a smokescreen.

627
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,019
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

628
00:42:15,098 --> 00:42:16,850
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

629
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,062
Hey, he's old, we're
young, and that's life.

630
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:31,994
I got to...

631
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:34,955
I got to go. I got a meeting.

632
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:46,883
Congratulations, Bob.

633
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,056
Thanks.

634
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:53,266
I remember when I was a young
executive for this company.

635
00:42:53,845 --> 00:42:56,143
I used to call the old
man funny names.

636
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:57,770
Iron Butt,

637
00:42:58,808 --> 00:42:59,900
Boner.

638
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:04,822
Once, I even called him asshole.

639
00:43:10,737 --> 00:43:12,660
But there was always respect.

640
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:16,292
I always knew where
the line was drawn.

641
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:21,043
And you just stepped
over it, buddy boy.

642
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:26,215
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

643
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:27,796
with that bastard
creation of yours!

644
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:31,258
I had a guaranteed
military sale with Ed 209!

645
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:35,221
Renovation program. Spare
parts for 25 years.

646
00:43:35,303 --> 00:43:37,931
Who cares if it worked or not?

647
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:41,813
The old man thought it
was pretty important,

648
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,026
Dick.

649
00:43:50,902 --> 00:43:54,657
You know, he's a sweet old man.

650
00:43:57,992 --> 00:43:59,539
And he means well.

651
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:03,798
But he's not going
to live forever.

652
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,878
And I'm number two around here.

653
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,552
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

654
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:16,056
You just

655
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,723
fucked with the wrong guy.

656
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:22,104
You're out of your fucking mind.

657
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:29,028
You better pray

658
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:33,161
that that unholy monster
of yours doesn't screw up.

659
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,179
-You hungry?
-No, thanks.

660
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:38,725
No.

661
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:47,061
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport
in Acapulco yesterday.

662
00:45:47,143 --> 00:45:50,022
Great. We were going there next week.
Wait, what was that?

663
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,783
Hey, look! Bucket boy's online.

664
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:19,718
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

665
00:46:20,134 --> 00:46:21,556
What the hell's going on?

666
00:46:21,636 --> 00:46:24,139
-I don't know. He just left.
-Just left?

667
00:46:25,848 --> 00:46:27,191
Roosevelt!

668
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:30,019
Rosie, we got a problem.

669
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,656
Out of the way!

670
00:46:35,024 --> 00:46:36,822
Take a look at this.

671
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:41,705
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

672
00:46:51,832 --> 00:46:54,836
Jerry, book him. I'll catch
up with you later.

673
00:46:59,924 --> 00:47:03,724
Hello. I haven't really had
a chance to introduce myself.

674
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:05,809
I'm Anne Lewis.

675
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,142
Do you have a name?

676
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:18,075
<i>How can I help you,
Officer Lewis?</i>

677
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:23,240
That's not really what I meant.
Don't you have a name?

678
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:25,161
Hold it. Just sign
right here, sir.

679
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,868
You don't understand. I'm OCP.

680
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:30,792
Murphy, it's you.

681
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:38,546
You really don't
remember me, do you?

682
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:39,972
<i>Excuse me.</i>

683
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:41,849
<i>I have to go.</i>

684
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,678
<i>Somewhere there
is a crime happening.</i>

685
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,852
Stop!

686
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,024
What did you talk to him about?
What did you say?

687
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,521
-Nothing.
-Shit.

688
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:52,693
Shit.

689
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:56,689
Stop!

690
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:58,399
You there, stop!

691
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:07,575
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer!
Come on!

692
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:12,038
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct, buddy,

693
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:14,001
and if it gets screwed
up by one of your grunts,

694
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,173
I'm gonna have your job.

695
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:17,047
-What's the update?
-It's hard to be 100%.

696
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:18,173
We have a glitch or what?

697
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:21,052
This system was never designed
to experience detailed somatic response.

698
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,007
He had a dream, a dream.

699
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:26,348
-This cop saw fit to question him.
-I didn't question him.

700
00:48:26,427 --> 00:48:28,600
I asked him his name.
He didn't know.

701
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,523
Great. Let me make it
real clear for you.

702
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,977
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

703
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,279
He's product. Is that clear?

704
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:37,693
Sure.

705
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:39,615
I say we pull him in, run
a systems check, the works.

706
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,907
Take a week. Maybe 10 days.

707
00:48:40,983 --> 00:48:43,077
You want to take him offline
because he had a dream?

708
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:44,404
What, are you kidding?

709
00:48:44,654 --> 00:48:46,452
Let's get out of here.

710
00:48:46,864 --> 00:48:47,956
-Listen, Reed.
-Yeah?

711
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:52,003
Try to keep one thing in mind.
This project doesn't concern cops.

712
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:54,627
It's classified. It's OCP.

713
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:56,666
You got it, mister?

714
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:00,924
Yeah, I got it.

715
00:49:01,337 --> 00:49:02,429
Good.

716
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,632
Right, we keep him
on the street...

717
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:06,183
Sorry, Sarge.

718
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:08,306
I fucked up.

719
00:49:10,262 --> 00:49:12,811
Forget it, kid. This
guy's a serious asshole.

720
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:48,722
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

721
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,813
Now fill it up on number 7.

722
00:50:02,982 --> 00:50:05,201
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

723
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:08,700
I'm a good shot.

724
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:13,122
I could hit you
in the eye from here.

725
00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:27,431
Hey, man, what you
reading in there?

726
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:36,433
You a college boy or something?

727
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:40,983
I bet you think
you're pretty smart?

728
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:43,690
Think you could
outsmart a bullet?

729
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:45,984
What do you say we find out?

730
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:48,569
I'm talking to you!
What do you say?

731
00:50:50,237 --> 00:50:51,955
I'm talking to you!

732
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:55,291
<i>Drop it.</i>

733
00:50:59,371 --> 00:51:01,999
<i>Dead or alive, you
are coming with me.</i>

734
00:51:06,128 --> 00:51:07,505
I know you.

735
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:10,132
You're dead.

736
00:51:11,425 --> 00:51:12,927
We killed you!

737
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,597
We killed you!

738
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:19,726
We killed you!

739
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,322
<i>You're dead.</i>

740
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:34,411
<i>We killed you!</i>

741
00:52:19,994 --> 00:52:21,462
<i>Who are you?</i>

742
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:26,592
<i>Who are you?</i>

743
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:40,981
Jerry, Jerry. Look who it is.

744
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:42,774
Can I help you, sir?

745
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:46,604
<i>-No.</i>
-What is it exactly that you want?

746
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:51,571
You can't enter here!
Wait a second!

747
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,243
Just a minute!

748
00:52:53,736 --> 00:52:56,660
This is a restricted area!

749
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,127
He's in.

750
00:54:02,554 --> 00:54:04,898
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

751
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:07,068
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

752
00:54:07,142 --> 00:54:09,565
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

753
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,148
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

754
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,209
<i>Welcome, shopper.</i>

755
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:11,882
<i>Let's take a stroll
through your new home.</i>

756
00:55:11,957 --> 00:55:15,177
<i>This is a one-family house
built by ZEM Industries.</i>

757
00:55:15,252 --> 00:55:17,471
<i>Situated near schools
and shopping centers,</i>

758
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,971
<i>this progressive development
has a growth factor of 7.</i>

759
00:55:42,863 --> 00:55:44,080
Wow.

760
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,000
Can you do that, Dad?

761
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:59,134
<i>and, say, it doesn't matter
who cooks in your family,</i>

762
00:55:59,213 --> 00:56:03,844
<i>because this kitchen by Food
Concepts makes everything a snap.</i>

763
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:24,826
Dad.

764
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:31,628
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

765
00:56:31,703 --> 00:56:33,000
Get in the picture.

766
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,377
Come on, come on.

767
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,063
I really have to tell
you something.

768
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,273
I love you.

769
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:06,326
<i>That's the master bedroom.</i>

770
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:10,626
<i>A functional space
with a touch of elegance.</i>

771
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:12,999
<i>Have you thought it all over?</i>

772
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:15,289
<i>Why not make me an offer?</i>

773
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,453
<i>Where is Clarence Boddicker?</i>

774
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:57,877
Okay?

775
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:06,720
-Shit!
<i>-Let's talk.</i>

776
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,222
Son of a bitch!

777
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:20,191
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

778
00:58:21,688 --> 00:58:23,110
Vice president.

779
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:25,947
It just turns me on.

780
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:28,070
God, you girls are so great.

781
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:30,872
I mean I just... I love to be
with intelligent women.

782
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:33,497
Smart is so sexy.

783
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:35,373
I know.

784
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:38,000
Sometimes I could just
think of something,

785
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,210
and it could just
get me so horny.

786
00:58:44,002 --> 00:58:47,381
Yeah, well, a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

787
00:58:47,464 --> 00:58:48,841
Yeah.

788
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:50,722
I get bored so easily.

789
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:53,308
Yep.

790
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:56,523
And you need lots
of stimulation, Bobby.

791
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,482
-Yes, I do. Don't move.
-I won't.

792
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,112
Bob?

793
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:08,068
What?

794
00:59:08,443 --> 00:59:11,663
-Bob, save some for me.
-Don't worry. I'll...

795
00:59:15,575 --> 00:59:17,998
Must be the champagne.
Stay here.

796
00:59:24,334 --> 00:59:25,631
How you doing...

797
00:59:28,005 --> 00:59:29,552
Bitches, leave.

798
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:34,261
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

799
00:59:35,095 --> 00:59:37,769
-You gonna call me?
-Come on.

800
00:59:37,848 --> 00:59:40,067
What the fuck are you doing?

801
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,860
Do you know who I am?

802
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:44,696
If you think you're gonna
get away with this...

803
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:49,155
Goddamn it!

804
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,930
Stop! I'll give you
anything you want!

805
00:59:54,956 --> 00:59:57,689
Just please, please don't
kill me, all right?

806
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,130
<i>Hello, buddy boy.
Dick Jones here.</i>

807
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:10,347
<i>I guess you're on your knees
about now, begging for your life.</i>

808
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:13,179
<i>Pathetic.</i>

809
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:15,598
<i>You don't feel so cocky
now, do you, Bob?</i>

810
01:00:15,677 --> 01:00:18,681
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it right now.

811
01:00:18,805 --> 01:00:21,433
<i>You know what the tragedy
is here, Bob?</i>

812
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:25,274
<i>We could have been friends.</i>

813
01:00:25,354 --> 01:00:28,358
<i>But you wouldn't go
through proper channels.</i>

814
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,317
<i>You went over my head.</i>

815
01:00:32,027 --> 01:00:33,370
<i>That hurt.</i>

816
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:38,709
<i>But life goes on. It's an old story,
the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?</i>

817
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:43,373
<i>It helps if you think
of it as a game, Bob.</i>

818
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:48,044
<i>Every game has
a winner and a loser.</i>

819
01:00:56,551 --> 01:01:00,021
<i>I'm cashing you out, Bob.</i>

820
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:17,072
We need more tubing.

821
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,918
I don't think I want
to pay you that, Sal.

822
01:01:25,747 --> 01:01:29,843
I don't give a shit what you wanna pay.
I set the prices here.

823
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:33,968
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

824
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:36,512
You want space
in my marketplace,

825
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:39,390
you're gonna have to give
me a volume discount.

826
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:42,018
I'm not into discounts.

827
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:45,442
Joe, show the man what we brought
him for Christmas.

828
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:57,113
Think about it, chum. Good
business is where you find it.

829
01:02:03,785 --> 01:02:06,629
Okay, let me try to put
this in perspective.

830
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:10,004
You killed a bunch of cops.

831
01:02:10,834 --> 01:02:14,964
The word around is that you've got
a lot of heavy connections downtown.

832
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:18,554
You make a lot
of my friends nervous.

833
01:02:21,928 --> 01:02:25,978
A lot of people would love
to see a guy like me

834
01:02:26,683 --> 01:02:28,856
put a guy like you
out of business.

835
01:02:29,644 --> 01:02:32,147
I don't know. I don't know.

836
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:35,283
Maybe I'm just not
making myself clear.

837
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:40,664
I don't want to fuck
with you, Sal.

838
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:46,253
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organization.

839
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:49,877
I got the muscle to shove
enough of this factory

840
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:55,008
so far up your stupid wop ass
that you'll shit snow for a year.

841
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:57,839
Frankie, blow this
cocksucker's head off.

842
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:01,184
Guns, guns, guns!

843
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:05,055
Come on, Sal!

844
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:07,732
The Tigers are playing tonight.

845
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:11,357
I never miss a game.

846
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:18,660
Just kidding.

847
01:03:31,706 --> 01:03:32,707
Go!

848
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:38,551
Go.

849
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:59,781
<i>Come quietly or there
will be trouble.</i>

850
01:04:01,778 --> 01:04:02,995
Fuck you!

851
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:42,672
<i>Clarence Boddicker,
you are under arrest.</i>

852
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:44,506
<i>You have the right
to remain silent.</i>

853
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:46,887
Fuck you!

854
01:05:52,597 --> 01:05:55,271
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

855
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,648
I'm protected, man.
I've got protection!

856
01:05:57,727 --> 01:05:59,274
<i>You have the right
to an attorney.</i>

857
01:05:59,354 --> 01:06:01,106
What is this shit?

858
01:06:05,568 --> 01:06:06,945
Goddamn it.

859
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:09,030
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

860
01:06:09,489 --> 01:06:12,709
Listen to me, you fuck!
There's another guy.

861
01:06:12,826 --> 01:06:15,545
He's OCP. He's a senior
president.

862
01:06:15,954 --> 01:06:19,174
<i>Anything you say may
be used against you.</i>

863
01:06:19,249 --> 01:06:21,092
It's Dick Jones!

864
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,850
Don't you get it?
You cocksucker!

865
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:32,555
I work for Dick Jones.
Dick Jones!

866
01:06:33,138 --> 01:06:37,314
He's the number two guy at OCP.
OCP runs the cops!

867
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:40,570
You're a cop.

868
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:45,445
Cop.

869
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:58,418
<i>Yes. I am a cop.</i>

870
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,969
I don't like it any more
than you do, Reed, but listen!

871
01:07:05,044 --> 01:07:06,512
You listen to me, you asshole!

872
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:10,593
You're talking about shutting
down a major metropolitan police force.

873
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:13,849
Without cops, this city
would tear itself apart.

874
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:16,852
The Union thinks you should know
there was a strike vote last night.

875
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:18,558
We lost five guys last week.

876
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:20,643
We're getting creamed
out there, Reed.

877
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,321
<i>Book him.</i>

878
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:33,115
What's the charge?

879
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:38,749
<i>He's a cop killer.</i>

880
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:46,632
Shit!

881
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,594
Just give me
my fucking phone call.

882
01:07:57,305 --> 01:07:58,477
I understand.

883
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:00,604
Look, the lawyers will have
you out in 24 hours.

884
01:08:00,683 --> 01:08:02,560
Just don't say anything else.

885
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:05,818
Jesus, you really screwed up.

886
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:11,839
<i>Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!</i>

887
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:13,465
<i>Dick Jones!</i>

888
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,144
<i>I work for Dick Jones!</i>

889
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:21,519
<i>He runs OCP. OCP runs the cops.</i>

890
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:27,854
Come in, Officer.

891
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:30,490
You know, I don't usually see
anyone without an appointment,

892
01:09:30,565 --> 01:09:32,317
but in your case,
I'll make an exception.

893
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,243
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

894
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,112
On what charge?

895
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:38,368
<i>Aiding and abetting
a known felon.</i>

896
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:41,914
Sounds like I'm
in a lot of trouble.

897
01:09:43,786 --> 01:09:45,003
You better take me in.

898
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,376
<i>I Will.</i>

899
01:09:59,886 --> 01:10:01,604
What's the matter, Officer?

900
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:07,026
I'll tell you what's the matter.

901
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:10,651
It's a little insurance
policy called Directive 4.

902
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:13,950
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

903
01:10:15,526 --> 01:10:18,496
Any attempt to arrest
a senior officer of OCP

904
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:20,414
results in shutdown.

905
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:25,286
What did you think?

906
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:29,382
That you were an ordinary
police officer?

907
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:31,209
You're our product.

908
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:35,555
And we can't very well have our products
turning against us, can we?

909
01:10:39,217 --> 01:10:41,436
Still a little fight
left in you.

910
01:10:47,016 --> 01:10:49,690
Maybe you'd like to meet
a friend of mine.

911
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:58,779
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

912
01:10:58,861 --> 01:11:01,410
Now it's time to erase
that mistake.

913
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,735
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower!

914
01:13:27,093 --> 01:13:28,595
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

915
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,440
-Hey, wait a second!
-He's a cop, for God's sakes!

916
01:13:32,515 --> 01:13:35,485
-Hedgecock! You can't do that!
-We have orders to destroy it.

917
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,938
-Oh, shit!
-You're maniacs!

918
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:39,655
<i>Fire at will.</i>

919
01:13:57,915 --> 01:13:59,337
<i>Move in.</i>

920
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,268
Murphy!

921
01:14:58,976 --> 01:15:00,569
Murphy, it's me.

922
01:15:03,773 --> 01:15:05,070
Lewis.

923
01:15:15,868 --> 01:15:16,994
Move down!

924
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:18,671
On the next level.

925
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,796
Lieutenant! Level 3, level 3.
He's on level 3!

926
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,338
Over here! Over here!

927
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:24,964
<i>Open fire!</i>

928
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,322
<i>It's back.</i>

929
01:15:45,231 --> 01:15:47,654
<i>Big is back,
because bigger is better.</i>

930
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:48,985
<i>6000 SUX.</i>

931
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:54,870
<i>Good evening. I'm Jesse
Perkins with Casey Wong.</i>

932
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:56,951
Top story, Santa Barbara.

933
01:15:57,159 --> 01:16:01,039
<i>10,000 acres of wooded residential
land were scorched in an instant</i>

934
01:16:01,122 --> 01:16:04,797
<i>when a laser cannon aboard the strategic
defense peace platform</i>

935
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,378
<i>misfired today during routine
start-up tests.</i>

936
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:08,428
<i>Casey.</i>

937
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:09,881
<i>Yes, it was a day of mourning</i>

938
01:16:09,964 --> 01:16:13,218
<i>for the families of 113 people
known dead at this hour,</i>

939
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:15,554
<i>among them, two former
United States Presidents</i>

940
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:18,105
<i>who had retired
in the Santa Barbara area.</i>

941
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,182
<i>A day of mourning for a country.</i>

942
01:16:20,349 --> 01:16:24,399
<i>Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today</i>

943
01:16:24,478 --> 01:16:27,903
<i>in hopes of averting
a citywide strike by police,</i>

944
01:16:27,982 --> 01:16:30,576
<i>scheduled to begin
tomorrow at midnight.</i>

945
01:16:30,651 --> 01:16:32,403
<i>Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.</i>

946
01:16:32,486 --> 01:16:35,535
<i>They're still on duty,
but what about tomorrow?</i>

947
01:16:35,614 --> 01:16:38,959
<i>That's the question we put to people
in the crime-plagued Lexington area.</i>

948
01:16:39,035 --> 01:16:42,255
<i>They're public servants.
They got job security.</i>

949
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,082
<i>They're not supposed to strike.</i>

950
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:45,166
<i>It's a free society,</i>

951
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:47,965
<i>except there ain't nothin' free</i>

952
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:49,796
<i>'cause there's no
guarantees, you know?</i>

953
01:16:49,879 --> 01:16:51,722
<i>You're on your own.</i>

954
01:16:51,797 --> 01:16:53,390
<i>It's the law of the jungle.</i>

955
01:16:57,053 --> 01:16:58,896
Be very careful.

956
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:00,348
Excuse me, please.

957
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:04,151
They must be remodeling.

958
01:17:09,023 --> 01:17:10,570
Hiya, Barbara.

959
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:14,696
Listen, I'm here
to see Dick Jones.

960
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:17,998
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

961
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:21,161
Maybe you could fit me in.

962
01:17:23,162 --> 01:17:25,631
He's expecting you,
Mr. Boddicker.

963
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:30,548
You can keep the gum.

964
01:17:33,506 --> 01:17:35,053
-This looks good.
-Get a measurement on that.

965
01:17:35,132 --> 01:17:36,133
Bring a hammer, too.

966
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,517
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

967
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,731
That thing is still alive.

968
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:44,817
I don't know what you're
talking about.

969
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:48,237
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

970
01:17:48,312 --> 01:17:52,909
Hey. Take a look
at my face, Dick.

971
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:55,869
He was trying to kill me.

972
01:17:55,945 --> 01:17:57,947
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

973
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,751
He recorded every word you said.

974
01:18:01,951 --> 01:18:04,545
His memory's admissible
as evidence.

975
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:06,498
You involved me.

976
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:10,592
You're gonna have to kill it.

977
01:18:14,171 --> 01:18:15,923
Well listen, chief.

978
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:19,810
Your company built
the fucking thing.

979
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:22,596
Now I got to deal with it?

980
01:18:23,013 --> 01:18:25,562
I don't have time
for this bullshit.

981
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:27,689
Suit yourself, Clarence.

982
01:18:27,768 --> 01:18:30,191
But Delta City begins
construction in two months.

983
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:32,444
That's 2 million workers
living in trailers.

984
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,820
That means drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

985
01:18:37,778 --> 01:18:41,828
Virgin territory for the man who knows
how to open up new markets.

986
01:18:42,491 --> 01:18:44,744
One man could control it all,

987
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:46,750
Clarence.

988
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:50,671
I guess we're gonna
be friends after all,

989
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:52,919
Richard.

990
01:19:00,426 --> 01:19:01,473
Destroy it.

991
01:19:03,471 --> 01:19:05,724
Gonna need some major firepower.

992
01:19:08,517 --> 01:19:10,485
You got access
to military weaponry?

993
01:19:12,146 --> 01:19:14,490
We practically are the military.

994
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:54,443
<i>Did you bring the gun?</i>

995
01:19:54,522 --> 01:19:55,819
The precinct was deserted.

996
01:19:55,898 --> 01:19:58,367
Half the force didn't
show up for work today.

997
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:00,444
Everyone else walks
out at midnight.

998
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,121
I guess we're on strike.

999
01:20:02,196 --> 01:20:05,871
I wasn't sure what you needed.
I sort of grabbed things.

1000
01:20:08,536 --> 01:20:09,833
Your gun.

1001
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:13,048
You asked for this?

1002
01:20:17,002 --> 01:20:18,800
I brought you some food.

1003
01:20:20,381 --> 01:20:22,975
<i>No, thank you. I'm not hungry.</i>

1004
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:49,334
<i>You may not like what you're
going to see.</i>

1005
01:21:23,777 --> 01:21:26,621
It's really good to see
you again, Murphy.

1006
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:34,584
<i>Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?</i>

1007
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:39,256
Well, after the funeral,
she moved away.

1008
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:41,386
<i>Where did they go?</i>

1009
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:46,350
She thought you were dead.
She started over again.

1010
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,143
<i>I can feel them.</i>

1011
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,479
<i>But I can't remember them.</i>

1012
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:04,819
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

1013
01:22:52,074 --> 01:22:55,044
<i>Happy birthday, Dave.
She's from me.</i>

1014
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:59,419
<i>Well, can I have you both?</i>

1015
01:23:00,207 --> 01:23:03,211
<i>-Sure. We've had our shots.
-Sure. We've had our shots.</i>

1016
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:07,135
<i>I'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

1017
01:23:13,053 --> 01:23:14,475
Hey, Emil.

1018
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:16,432
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

1019
01:23:16,515 --> 01:23:18,859
Not bad. They let
me keep the shirt.

1020
01:23:18,934 --> 01:23:20,311
Nobody popped my cherry.

1021
01:23:20,394 --> 01:23:22,567
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

1022
01:23:22,646 --> 01:23:23,989
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey!

1023
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:25,987
First they let me
out of jail for free,

1024
01:23:26,066 --> 01:23:28,819
then what do I find
in the prison parking lot

1025
01:23:28,902 --> 01:23:31,325
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

1026
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:33,328
Still got the factory
sticker on it!

1027
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:35,000
Clarence.

1028
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:37,294
Joey's got a car just
like yours, man.

1029
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:40,919
Yo, Clarence, what do
you think, buddy?

1030
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:48,676
What do you got there, Clarence?

1031
01:23:48,756 --> 01:23:50,258
Wait up for me!

1032
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,436
Whoa! A new toy! Can I play?

1033
01:23:57,014 --> 01:23:58,482
Watch this.

1034
01:23:58,557 --> 01:24:01,060
Wait... Wait a minute,
Clarence, Clarence!

1035
01:24:02,478 --> 01:24:04,276
Shit!

1036
01:24:06,732 --> 01:24:07,824
What the fuck?

1037
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,868
-Nice car, Joe.
-Fuck you, Clarence.

1038
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:10,990
Let me try that.

1039
01:24:11,069 --> 01:24:14,994
Cobra Assault Cannon. State of the art.
Bang! Bang!

1040
01:24:21,997 --> 01:24:23,544
I like it!

1041
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,761
-Give it up, faggot. Let a man...
-No, butthole! Get your own!

1042
01:24:27,836 --> 01:24:29,088
Come on!

1043
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:37,016
Get the other gun, Emil!

1044
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,107
No car is safe!

1045
01:24:40,182 --> 01:24:41,354
Do it, Emil!

1046
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,192
Heads up, you guys.

1047
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:02,083
He's in the steel mill.
Let's go.

1048
01:25:02,162 --> 01:25:04,915
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

1049
01:25:04,998 --> 01:25:07,376
Come on, Emil! Get
your ass in the van!

1050
01:25:07,459 --> 01:25:09,177
Come on, lard ass,
let's move it!

1051
01:25:09,253 --> 01:25:11,347
I'll get you, faggot!

1052
01:26:05,642 --> 01:26:06,814
What are you doing?

1053
01:26:08,687 --> 01:26:10,940
<i>My targeting system
is a little messed up.</i>

1054
01:26:13,984 --> 01:26:15,531
Can I help you?

1055
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,913
<i>Aim for me.</i>

1056
01:26:28,957 --> 01:26:30,584
Are you locked in now?

1057
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:31,759
<i>Yes.</i>

1058
01:26:33,128 --> 01:26:34,505
A little more to the left.

1059
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:36,548
Here.

1060
01:26:44,848 --> 01:26:46,725
I figure that's dead-on.

1061
01:26:46,808 --> 01:26:48,151
<i>Thank you.</i>

1062
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:08,713
-All right. Let's do it.
-Come on, man, let's smoke him!

1063
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:14,007
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic mother?

1064
01:27:14,086 --> 01:27:15,679
Zip it up, Emil!

1065
01:27:16,088 --> 01:27:18,261
Nothing fancy. Just kill him.

1066
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:20,555
Emil, in the van.

1067
01:27:23,637 --> 01:27:25,355
<i>You should get out of here now.</i>

1068
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:27,103
Hey, we're partners.

1069
01:27:28,141 --> 01:27:29,518
<i>Get the car.</i>

1070
01:28:05,595 --> 01:28:07,347
Damn it! Shit!

1071
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:08,978
<i>Looking for me?</i>

1072
01:28:21,778 --> 01:28:23,746
Cut him off! Come on!

1073
01:28:23,822 --> 01:28:25,369
Go on, cut him off!

1074
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:26,871
Go, go!

1075
01:28:58,565 --> 01:29:01,193
Okay! Now I got you!

1076
01:29:48,115 --> 01:29:49,116
Shit!

1077
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:05,014
Help me.

1078
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:07,013
Don't touch me, man!

1079
01:30:08,718 --> 01:30:10,140
Help me.

1080
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,187
God!

1081
01:30:29,197 --> 01:30:30,323
Shit!

1082
01:30:58,185 --> 01:30:59,562
Bye-bye, baby.

1083
01:30:59,644 --> 01:31:01,146
<i>Clarence!</i>

1084
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:28,177
Okay.

1085
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,217
I give up.

1086
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:32,344
<i>I'm not arresting you anymore.</i>

1087
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,930
Now, wait a second.

1088
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:43,317
Wait a minute.

1089
01:31:43,396 --> 01:31:45,569
You're taking this kind
of personal, aren't you?

1090
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:49,119
Come on, man. Come on, now.
You're making me nervous.

1091
01:31:49,194 --> 01:31:50,821
Come on, you can't do this.

1092
01:31:50,904 --> 01:31:52,906
Come on now! Don't mess around!

1093
01:31:53,406 --> 01:31:55,079
Hey! Hey!

1094
01:31:55,242 --> 01:31:57,040
Come on, man, now,
don't get cute!

1095
01:32:01,498 --> 01:32:03,421
Die, you bastard!

1096
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,501
Yeah!

1097
01:32:04,584 --> 01:32:06,382
Yeah! All right!

1098
01:32:06,753 --> 01:32:08,221
All right!

1099
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,724
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

1100
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,878
Sayonara, Robocop!

1101
01:32:54,968 --> 01:32:56,220
<i>Lewis!</i>

1102
01:32:57,971 --> 01:32:59,143
<i>Lewis!</i>

1103
01:33:02,475 --> 01:33:04,773
Murphy, I'm a mess!

1104
01:33:07,897 --> 01:33:09,490
<i>They'll fix you.</i>

1105
01:33:10,442 --> 01:33:12,194
<i>They fix everything.</i>

1106
01:33:22,329 --> 01:33:24,206
The police strike could
really work for us.

1107
01:33:24,289 --> 01:33:27,589
By the end of the week, we can have
Ed 209s in place all over the city

1108
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,761
and expect immediate
public support.

1109
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:33,056
I've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

1110
01:33:40,013 --> 01:33:42,983
<i>You are illegally parked
on private property.</i>

1111
01:33:43,183 --> 01:33:46,062
<i>You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.</i>

1112
01:34:21,888 --> 01:34:23,310
because whatever happens,

1113
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:26,644
this corporation will live up to the guiding
principles of its founder.

1114
01:34:26,726 --> 01:34:30,196
Courage, strength, conviction.

1115
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:38,072
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

1116
01:34:40,407 --> 01:34:41,704
What is it?

1117
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:44,627
I don't know.

1118
01:34:47,539 --> 01:34:49,507
How can we help you, Officer?

1119
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:52,093
<i>Dick Jones is wanted for murder.</i>

1120
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:56,974
This is absurd! That thing
is a violent mechanical psychopath.

1121
01:34:57,048 --> 01:35:01,394
<i>My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.</i>

1122
01:35:01,886 --> 01:35:04,605
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

1123
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:18,450
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

1124
01:35:19,446 --> 01:35:22,074
<i>Now it's time to erase
that mistake.</i>

1125
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:26,704
<i>I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.</i>

1126
01:35:27,537 --> 01:35:30,131
<i>Now it's time to erase
that mistake.</i>

1127
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,758
He's got a gun!

1128
01:35:32,834 --> 01:35:34,131
Get up!

1129
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:36,008
I want a chopper. Now!

1130
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:39,424
We will walk to the roof
very calmly.

1131
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:42,598
I will board the chopper
with my hostage.

1132
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:46,639
Anybody tries to stop me,

1133
01:35:47,932 --> 01:35:49,809
the old geezer gets it.

1134
01:35:52,812 --> 01:35:54,814
Dick, you're fired!

1135
01:35:56,691 --> 01:35:57,692
<i>Thank you.</i>

1136
01:36:23,134 --> 01:36:25,728
Nice shooting, son.
What's your name?

1137
01:36:28,515 --> 01:36:29,687
<i>Murphy.</i>
