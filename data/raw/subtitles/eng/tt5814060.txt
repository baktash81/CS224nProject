2
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,073
<i>I had a vision
in Amityville.</i>

3
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,343
<i>I had a premonition
of your death.</i>

4
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:58,981
<i>We have both seen the same
inhuman spirit.</i>

5
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:02,120
Mom, who's that?

6
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:16,168
<i>The demon
in your painting is real.</i>

7
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,520
Are you certain we're
making the right decision?

8
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,289
We have no other choice.

9
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,344
Will the relic truly save us?

10
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,416
Have faith, Sister.

11
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,000
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

12
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,404
hallowed be thy name.

13
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,537
Thy kingdom come,

14
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,008
thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

15
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:07,244
Give us this day
our daily bread.

16
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:09,413
And forgive us our trespasses

17
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,350
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

18
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:25,495
Take it!

19
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,765
This evil needs a vessel
to escape.

20
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,634
It will come after you next.

21
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,202
Don't let it have you.

22
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:35,807
- You know what you must do.
- I can't.

23
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:39,311
Then not even God can save...

24
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,312
Forgive me, Father,

25
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,216
for the sin
I'm about to commit.

26
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:24,684
Forgive me, Lord.

27
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:46,797
Oh, God.

28
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,347
Father Burke?

29
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,617
Bishop.

30
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,852
So the last time you were here

31
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:08,986
was what night?

32
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:11,556
Six, seven years ago?

33
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,125
After my time as a chaplain

34
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,426
ended in the war, yes.

35
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,762
Well, we appreciate you
coming again

36
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:17,996
under such short notice.

37
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:22,301
Father Burke.

38
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,370
Sit.

39
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,474
We have received news

40
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:32,677
that a nun has taken
her own life

41
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:35,547
at an abbey
in the mountains of Romania.

42
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:38,652
Suicide is a terrible,
terrible sin.

43
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,520
But it doesn't strike me

44
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:43,655
as strong enough reason
for a reunion.

45
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:45,557
But the news of it
would not bolster

46
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,358
our argument to keep

47
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,560
with the faith and the Church.

48
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,163
You're not telling me something.

49
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:52,363
Why do you say that?

50
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,466
Because we're in the Vatican.

51
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,601
Let me put it this way,
Father.

52
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:01,740
In this, albeit,
rare instance,

53
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,041
we do not believe

54
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:05,379
we're the ones
with the secret.

55
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,081
Those are
your travel documents

56
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,281
and contact information

57
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:13,485
on the man
who discovered the nun.

58
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:14,753
He lives near the abbey

59
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,655
in a small village
called Biertan.

60
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,289
You will want
to talk to him first.

61
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,592
Also in the file is the name
of a postulant who can help

62
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:24,262
assist you in your inquiries

63
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:26,264
since it is
a cloistered convent

64
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,802
and your access
will be limited.

65
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,408
She's also familiar
with the territory.

66
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:47,385
<i>I have survived
many terrifying encounters.</i>

67
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:51,289
<i>But nothing could have ever
prepared me for this.</i>

68
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:56,294
My only hope now was that
the beast could not smell me.

69
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:59,933
But then,
the wind changed and...

70
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:07,706
Run for your lives!

71
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,875
Mother Superior says
that dinosaurs

72
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:11,176
were never really alive.

73
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,780
God just put their bones here
to test our faith.

74
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:17,582
That seems like a pretty
dirty trick, don't you think?

75
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,384
But they're not
in the Bible.

76
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:22,221
Well, do you believe
in penguins and koala bears?

77
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:23,388
Yes.

78
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,858
They aren't in
the Bible either.

79
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,927
The Bible is
God's love letter to us,

80
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:32,363
but it doesn't mean that He
doesn't want us to ask questions

81
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,331
about the wonders
of His creation.

82
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,102
But Mother Superior says...

83
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:39,105
Wait a minute. You've got a
little something on your nose.

84
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:40,706
There.

85
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,275
Ahem.

86
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,381
Ooh!

87
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,884
- The Vatican?
- I'm as surprised as you.

88
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,586
I haven't even taken
my vows yet.

89
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,588
Oh, he's aware of that.

90
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,692
He's waiting for you
in the garden.

91
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:02,662
And change into your habit.

92
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:04,666
This is an official visit.

93
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,970
It shouldn't take
more than a few days, at most.

94
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,671
You were recommended
for the journey

95
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:15,807
because of your familiarity
with the territory.

96
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,342
"The territory"?

97
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,479
Yes. Romania.

98
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,419
I'd never been
in that part of the world.

99
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,285
Really?

100
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,887
There must've been
some mistake.

101
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,923
I apologize if you coming here
was a waste of your time.

102
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,558
Oh, no, no.
No apology necessary.

103
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,796
Every decision the Vatican
makes is with purpose.

104
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:40,101
I'm sure they had their
reasons for selecting you.

105
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,137
What is it?

106
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,573
Mr. Theriault?

107
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,076
Hi.

108
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:26,312
Jealous husband
or angry father?

109
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm sorry, what?

110
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:30,116
Well, usually
it's one of the two

111
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:34,987
when an older man
and a young, beautiful,

112
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,923
not-so-innocent girl
show up on my doorstep

113
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,691
at this hour of the morning.

114
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,826
I beg your pardon,
Mr. Theriault,

115
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:42,362
but you and I have never met.

116
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:43,829
Oh.

117
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:46,501
Oh. Then perhaps
it's time we did.

118
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:48,870
Call me Frenchie.

119
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:50,803
Everyone does.

120
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,738
Mr. Theriault, we are here

121
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,009
because of the nun
you found at the abbey.

122
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,146
How'd you...

123
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,416
Are you priest?

124
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,550
And she is a nun.

125
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:06,188
Oh.

126
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:10,224
Forgive me for
my impure thoughts, Sister.

127
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,558
I had no idea.

128
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,195
Never seen a nun
out of her vestments.

129
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,665
Not that I'm opposed to it.

130
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,166
Excuse me.

131
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,468
Monsieur Theriault,

132
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:24,470
the abbey.

133
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,139
Is it far?

134
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:29,777
In matter of distance, no,
but it takes time to get to.

135
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:33,913
If I may ask,
why were you there?

136
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,249
I was delivering
the quarterly supplies.

137
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:40,354
Apparently, the abbey has had
some kind of arrangement

138
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:42,755
with the village
for centuries.

139
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:45,960
Do you think you
could take us there sometime soon?

140
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,396
I don't think so, Father.

141
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,564
Is there someone else
in the village, then?

142
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,866
Everyone in this village

143
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,168
pretend like the abbey
doesn't exist.

144
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,605
Even talking about it
might get you in trouble.

145
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:01,576
It's settled, then.
You will take us.

146
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,111
With all due respect,
Father, I...

147
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,548
Please, Frenchie.

148
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:20,526
You took a plane from Rome,
a bus from Bucharest.

149
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,430
Now, my friends,
you're in the Dark Ages.

150
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:26,299
In the backwoods of Romania.

151
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,577
Now, you travel by horse.

152
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,214
Where are your things?

153
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,916
"The postman's charge."

154
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,819
Ten letters with an "L."

155
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:21,989
Deliveries.

156
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,027
You have a knack for this,
Sister.

157
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,596
What brings a Frenchman

158
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,164
to the countryside of Romania?

159
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,634
Actually, I'm French-Canadian,
but don't tell anyone.

160
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,138
Doesn't sound as romantic.

161
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,704
I came here looking for gold

162
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,207
but when I met
the people here,

163
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,775
I just knew this was the place
I was meant to be.

164
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:45,978
Wanted to help them.
Any way I could.

165
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,217
That's very noble of you.

166
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,352
I know.

167
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:54,189
Tell me, Sister,
how long have you been a nun?

168
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:59,326
I'm not a nun yet.
I'm still just a novitiate.

169
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:02,095
You still haven't taken
your temporary vows?

170
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,296
"Temporary"?

171
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:05,432
I didn't think
there was anything temporary

172
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:06,732
about being a nun.

173
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,135
Temporary vows
would help prepare me

174
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,903
for a life
of total consecration.

175
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,674
"Would," Sister? Or "will"?

176
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,312
Whoa.

177
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:18,348
What happened?

178
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:22,315
Everything all right?

179
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:25,185
We walk
the rest of the way.

180
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:27,020
The horse won't go
any further.

181
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:31,825
Maybe you should get
a new horse.

182
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,960
Well, it's not the horse,
Father.

183
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:36,964
It's what lies ahead.
He's scared.

184
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,000
The locals say
it's a cursed place

185
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,236
and the horse agrees.

186
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,042
<i>If I may ask, Father,</i>

187
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,445
why is it the Church sends you
on such tasks?

188
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:54,047
The Church reaches out to me
when it needs an investigation

189
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:59,420
into unusual phenomenon
associated with Catholicism.

190
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:02,089
Unofficially, they call it
"miracle hunting."

191
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,091
I thought we were here
because of a suicide.

192
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:07,328
We are, but it's only part
of our investigation.

193
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,864
I also have orders
from the Vatican to determine

194
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:14,435
if the grounds
are still... holy.

195
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,802
Well, I can give you
my opinion

196
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,105
on that now, Father.

197
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,718
A result of the war?

198
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:32,919
Bombing raids, yes.

199
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:36,357
I've heard stories of how the
ground shook for days after them.

200
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,593
I've tried to find more
information on the castle itself,

201
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:41,295
but there's no record of it
in the village.

202
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:43,997
And the locals only spit
when it's mentioned.

203
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,837
- "Spit"?
- Yeah, to ward off evil.

204
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:51,405
It's an old
and silly superstition.

205
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,473
And if you ask me,

206
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,642
these crosses that surround
the abbey

207
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:58,212
they keep the evil in,
not out.

208
00:16:58,214 --> 00:17:00,847
Did you try to contact someone
inside when you found the nun?

209
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,186
I did.
No one responded.

210
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,319
But then again,

211
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,722
in the two years I've been
delivering supplies,

212
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,492
she was the first one
I'd seen.

213
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,931
Frenchie, when you
found the nun, what did you do?

214
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,367
I moved it to protect
the body from the elements.

215
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,435
Where did you move it to, son?

216
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:23,137
The icehouse.

217
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,672
It's where
I leave my deliveries.

218
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,211
When I found the sister,
I thought

219
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:34,317
maybe moving her in here
would help preserve her.

220
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,585
Uh...

221
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,257
I should tell you
one more thing, Father.

222
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:17,892
What?

223
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:19,429
That's not how I left her.

224
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,930
What do you mean?

225
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,667
She was laying down
when I left her here.

226
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,171
Not like that, sitting up.

227
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,022
There have been cases

228
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:51,193
of bodies twitching
or sitting up,

229
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,094
not long after death.

230
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,396
Yeah, but, Father, who knows

231
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:55,930
how long she was dead
when I found her?

232
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,733
You're not helping.

233
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:58,968
Sorry.

234
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,046
Father, what is it?

235
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,450
It seems to be a key
of some kind.

236
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,558
That's the door the nuns
would enter from

237
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,026
to retrieve the supplies.

238
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,668
So they wouldn't have
to leave the castle.

239
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:32,902
We should give her
a proper burial.

240
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,218
It was common practice

241
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,487
during the plague.

242
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,456
When people feared to be
buried alive.

243
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,659
If you were unfortunate enough
for it to happen,

244
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:02,130
you could ring the bell
to let those above ground know

245
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:03,365
they have made a mistake.

246
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,436
I think being here
is a mistake.

247
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,682
That's where I found her.

248
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:11,300
How is that possible?
It's been weeks.

249
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:15,170
I told you. This place is...

250
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,274
What's the opposite
of a miracle, Father?

251
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,281
Hello?

252
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,555
Please excuse us
for our unannounced arrival.

253
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,394
Hello?

254
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,665
What is it you want?

255
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,267
I'm Father Anthony Burke.

256
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,237
This is Sister Irene.

257
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:30,307
Are you the Reverend Mother?

258
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,309
I am.

259
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:37,613
You haven't taken
your vows yet.

260
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:38,884
Uh...

261
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,183
No.

262
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:43,954
- Please...
- Why are you here, Father?

263
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,655
We come on behalf of Rome,

264
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,058
to inquire about the
recent death in your convent.

265
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,695
"Recent death"?

266
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,730
One of your nuns.

267
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,336
I found her outside.
Hanged from the neck.

268
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,785
Would you
allow us a moment, please?

269
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:26,532
You should leave
with him.

270
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,166
Are you saying
you weren't aware

271
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,602
of the recent passing
of the nun?

272
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,302
Rome is concerned
about the safety

273
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,738
and well-being
of your cloister.

274
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,339
I'd like to speak
with the sisters

275
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,509
so I can offer my assurances
to the Church.

276
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:44,280
I can offer
the assurance you seek.

277
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,518
I'm afraid that won't suffice.

278
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,454
They will just send more,
and, uh,

279
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,523
perhaps less diplomatic,
church officials.

280
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,959
Yes, Father.

281
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,895
However, the gate
will be closing shortly

282
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,065
as we are about to take
our vespers.

283
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:07,536
Followed by the Great Silence
which ends midmorning.

284
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,505
Come back tomorrow

285
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,810
and you will find the answers
you seek.

286
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,180
There is lodging
in the convent.

287
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,551
You may stay there.

288
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,258
Thank you.

289
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,404
Why could you
not talk to the sisters now?

290
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,340
Why must it wait till morning?

291
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,108
The sisters take
a vow of silence

292
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,375
from sunset to sunrise

293
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,377
that must be respected.

294
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,312
You should begin
heading back yourself.

295
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:53,075
I imagine you don't want to be caught
on those roads when night falls.

296
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,321
Better the roads than here,
Father.

297
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,126
We'll be fine, son.
Come back in a few days.

298
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,530
That should give us enough
time to get what we need.

299
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,700
Yes, Father.

300
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,811
Hello?

301
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,106
Hey.

302
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,108
Hey!

303
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,339
I'll take that.

304
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,680
Okay.

305
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,185
All right.

306
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:43,014
- Father?
- Hmm?

307
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,549
You mentioned
"miracle hunting" before.

308
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,819
Is that...

309
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,421
Is that a role you sought out?

310
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,723
No.

311
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:52,990
God, no.

312
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:56,327
I'm a part
of a small select few

313
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,098
the Church relies on to

314
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,634
look into their more

315
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:05,270
unusual matters.

316
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,739
So, you know Bishop Forne?

317
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,739
How do you...

318
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,775
Because he helped me
when I was younger.

319
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:13,744
I had a series of visions
when I was a girl.

320
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,781
My father believed
I was mentally unstable.

321
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,251
Or worse, a liar.

322
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,819
But word of my visions
reached the Church.

323
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,554
Cardinal Conroy, specifically.

324
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,857
And he sent Bishop Forne
to meet with me.

325
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,261
What were your visions?

326
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,999
There were many.

327
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,932
Never the same one repeated.

328
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,835
But after each one ended,

329
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,638
the same thought
would be stuck in my head.

330
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,875
Which was... what?

331
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,180
"Mary points the way."

332
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:57,690
What is it, Father?

333
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,827
I was thinking
of a similar incident

334
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:06,764
I encountered in France.
During the war.

335
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>I was stationed there.
Near Lyon.</i>

336
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,672
I was told to investigate
a boy with visions.

337
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,312
But, unlike your case,

338
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,682
after what I believe
was careful evaluation...

339
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,752
I made the judgment
he was possessed,

340
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,122
and proceeded
to act accordingly

341
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:31,891
within the laws of the Church.

342
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,864
My God. Daniel...

343
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,237
What have they done to you?

344
00:31:53,614 --> 00:31:55,048
Was it a success?

345
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,317
The Church thought so.

346
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,655
They believed the evil
was cast out.

347
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,324
But not you.

348
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:09,361
Most Glorious Prince

349
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:13,498
of the Heavenly Armies,
Saint Michael, the archangel...

350
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:23,142
Help me, Father!

351
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:25,178
Come to the assistance
of Daniel,

352
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,414
whom God has made
in His likeness!

353
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,916
Behold the Cross of the Lord!

354
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,350
Why won't you help me?

355
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,519
Ye hostile forces!

356
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,794
Daniel sustained
severe injuries

357
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,996
during the exorcism.

358
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,533
<i>Ones from which
he could not recover.</i>

359
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:49,770
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

360
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,847
He died days later.

361
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,686
I often wonder
if I was too eager

362
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,156
with my determination.

363
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,160
That is a puzzle.

364
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,154
Father.

365
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,218
Father.

366
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,494
Daniel?

367
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:55,782
Wait! No! Help!

368
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:58,720
Help! No!

369
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,465
Help!

370
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,167
Somebody.

371
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:14,749
Help! Sister Irene! Help!

372
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:19,756
Father! Father?

373
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:24,861
Father?

374
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,640
Father?

375
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:16,512
Help!

376
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:20,249
Help me!

377
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:36,898
- Father?
- Sister?

378
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,701
- Sister Irene!
- Father, I can hear you!

379
00:41:39,703 --> 00:41:41,702
I'm right here!

380
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:45,308
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.

381
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:51,039
Hurry!

382
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:57,548
Wait! Wait!

383
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:15,999
Thank you. Thank you, Sister.

384
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:28,043
How did you get in there?
The ground was covered.

385
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:30,948
There is a powerful
evil presence in this place.

386
00:43:38,856 --> 00:43:41,692
Maybe those books will help
shine a light on our answer.

387
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:47,596
There's more of it.

388
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:49,430
How is that possible?

389
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,032
Another puzzle.

390
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:07,651
Abbess?

391
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:12,721
As requested,

392
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:14,725
we are here to speak
with the nuns.

393
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:27,270
It seems like that's as much
as an invitation as we'll get.

394
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:28,639
I'll go find the Abbess.

395
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:31,109
Take this.

396
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:35,610
See what you can find out
about it.

397
00:44:35,612 --> 00:44:38,048
It was obviously important
to the deceased.

398
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:41,752
Sister. Be careful, please.

399
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:43,921
I will, Father.

400
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:07,711
Hello?

401
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:09,914
Wait!

402
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:13,575
Sister?

403
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:39,135
Sister!

404
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:42,505
We mustn't stop praying,
even for a second.

405
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,772
This convent has had

406
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:45,342
perpetual adoration
for centuries.

407
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,145
The sisters pray in shifts
to maintain a constant vigil.

408
00:46:48,147 --> 00:46:50,213
I am so sorry
to have disturbed her.

409
00:46:50,215 --> 00:46:51,481
Sister Ruth has withstood

410
00:46:51,483 --> 00:46:54,351
more than just someone
sneaking up behind her.

411
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,686
I'm Sister Oana.
We were told you were coming.

412
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:59,157
Please, follow me.

413
00:47:17,942 --> 00:47:19,043
What?

414
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,646
Another round.

415
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:25,616
I told Luca
it was on the house.

416
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:29,885
Why did she cover
the mirror?

417
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:31,921
It's tradition here
when someone dies.

418
00:47:31,923 --> 00:47:33,356
You cover the mirror,

419
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:35,225
so the deceased
doesn't see their reflection

420
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,694
and become a ghost.

421
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,062
Someone died?

422
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,800
You didn't hear? Luca's
daughter committed suicide.

423
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:50,039
I can't believe it.
She was just a kid.

424
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,845
Twelve years old.
Hanged herself in his barn.

425
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:58,348
Hanged herself? Why?

426
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,952
Why did Addi Constantine's
crop turn to dust?

427
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:04,454
Why was little Stefan
struck blind?

428
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:08,024
It is that place. The abbey.

429
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:10,626
Whatever evil is up there,
it's leaking out,

430
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:12,362
poisoning us.

431
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,668
And that, uh, couple you took
up there yesterday.

432
00:48:18,703 --> 00:48:21,638
- Who were they?
- Priest and a nun.

433
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,975
Are they still up there?

434
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:27,110
Yeah. Pick them up tomorrow.

435
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,479
You recently discovered a body
up there, didn't you?

436
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:31,248
Yeah, Grigore, yeah.

437
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,952
Well, I believe you're about
to discover two more.

438
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,700
And out of the ground

439
00:48:50,702 --> 00:48:53,669
formed every beast
of the field

440
00:48:53,671 --> 00:48:56,441
and every bird of the sky.

441
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,411
And whatever the man
called the demon creature,

442
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:03,382
that was its name.

443
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:08,287
Valak.

444
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:11,156
The Defiler.

445
00:49:11,857 --> 00:49:13,091
The Profane.

446
00:49:14,393 --> 00:49:15,892
The Marquis of Snakes.

447
00:49:26,737 --> 00:49:27,939
Sister!

448
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:33,078
Sister Irene!

449
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:40,750
Sister Victoria's death

450
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:43,887
was a terrible tragedy
for the convent,

451
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:46,389
but we still
feel her presence.

452
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:48,858
She was the most devoted
out of any of us.

453
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,233
Excuse me, Sister.

454
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:09,848
Sister Vic...

455
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:18,855
Forgive us,

456
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:21,125
we're highly protective
of our privacy.

457
00:50:21,127 --> 00:50:22,660
Some of the sisters
would prefer

458
00:50:22,662 --> 00:50:24,063
I not speak to you at all.

459
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:27,300
We appreciate your willingness
to do so.

460
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:29,467
Sister Oana,

461
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:32,004
can you tell me about
the history of this abbey?

462
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,342
It was built by a duke
in the Dark Ages.

463
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,911
<i>The Duke of Saint Carta.</i>

464
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:45,516
<i>He wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals,</i>

465
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:48,753
in which to call upon
the forces of hell.

466
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,555
Hell used him
to open a gateway

467
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:52,956
so that an unspeakable evil

468
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,527
<i>would walk amongst us.</i>

469
00:51:09,409 --> 00:51:11,444
<i>But the Church
stormed the castle.</i>

470
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:20,950
They sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic

471
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,456
<i>containing the blood
of Jesus Christ.</i>

472
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,293
<i>The Church claimed the castle
for their own</i>

473
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,228
<i>and our perpetual
praying began</i>

474
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,199
<i>to secure the abbey
and contain the evil.</i>

475
00:51:35,201 --> 00:51:40,071
<i>For centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay</i>

476
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:43,708
<i>until the bombs of war
shook the abbey</i>

477
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:47,977
and evil found another way
to open the gateway.

478
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,015
Sister Oana,
last night in the chapel,

479
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:53,218
I saw a nun.

480
00:51:54,587 --> 00:51:59,859
She was...
She felt anything but holy.

481
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,195
Do you see her, too?

482
00:52:03,563 --> 00:52:06,664
I've seen her stalking
the hallways at night.

483
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,632
<i>We all have.</i>

484
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:11,635
<i>She looks like us,
but she's not one of us.</i>

485
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:13,237
It's something unholy.

486
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,339
It takes on different forms
to deceive us

487
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,940
and prey on our weaknesses.

488
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:19,242
It appears as a nun so it can
hide among our cloister

489
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:21,480
<i>until it can corrupt us all.</i>

490
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:25,282
I fear her presence means
the portal has opened again.

491
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:27,619
It made Sister Victoria
commit the ultimate sin.

492
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:28,955
Sister Oana.

493
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:34,961
Sister Ruth is nearly finished
with her prayers.

494
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:37,927
It's time you attend to yours.

495
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:39,132
Yes, Sister.

496
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:47,574
You haven't taken
your vows yet?

497
00:52:48,274 --> 00:52:49,206
No.

498
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,342
Then this is not a place
for you.

499
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:54,347
- You need to leave now.
- She can't.

500
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:56,914
The gates have closed.

501
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:58,616
You must stay
until they open again.

502
00:52:58,618 --> 00:53:00,017
When do they open?

503
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,455
Sunrise.
You must stay the night.

504
00:53:13,734 --> 00:53:15,067
Sister Irene.

505
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:30,481
Good night, Sister.

506
00:53:30,483 --> 00:53:31,484
Sister, wait.

507
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:33,454
Yes?

508
00:53:35,222 --> 00:53:36,388
Sister Victoria had this

509
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,691
in her possession
when she died.

510
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,527
Do you happen to know
what it's for?

511
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,463
No.

512
00:53:46,999 --> 00:53:48,602
Now, please, I must go pray.

513
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:27,508
Where are you?

514
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:33,580
You won't find
another way in, Father.

515
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:36,450
Abbess?

516
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:51,798
What is it
that concerns you?

517
00:54:57,538 --> 00:54:59,704
I'm afraid

518
00:54:59,706 --> 00:55:04,208
there's something very wrong
with this place, Abbess.

519
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,144
Like many places
in this world,

520
00:55:07,146 --> 00:55:10,315
the abbey has a long history.

521
00:55:10,317 --> 00:55:15,188
Not all good but we repent.

522
00:55:16,423 --> 00:55:19,057
That nun, I found her

523
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:21,059
clutching the key
in her hands.

524
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,295
What does it open, Abbess?

525
00:55:23,297 --> 00:55:25,964
It's too late, Father.

526
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:29,668
Sister Irene is lost.

527
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,146
Abbess?

528
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:50,624
Abbess?

529
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:37,268
<i>Sister Irene.</i>

530
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,737
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

531
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:40,939
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

532
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:42,807
<i>Mary points the way.</i>

533
00:57:12,106 --> 00:57:14,442
Who are you?

534
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:12,500
God save you.

535
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:40,428
Sister, please come.

536
00:58:41,195 --> 00:58:42,663
Sister Oana?

537
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:15,690
Oh, God.

538
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,084
Quiet.

539
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,892
The evil grows stronger.

540
01:01:57,894 --> 01:02:00,660
Get your things and meet me
in the chapel, Sister.

541
01:02:00,662 --> 01:02:02,698
Only prayer will
get us through the night.

542
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:05,701
Go. Leave.

543
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:08,904
Now.

544
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:52,913
Hello?

545
01:03:34,258 --> 01:03:35,923
Sister Oana?

546
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:49,072
How long
have I been dead, Father?

547
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:53,076
How long?

548
01:03:57,713 --> 01:03:58,915
Daniel?

549
01:04:00,217 --> 01:04:01,351
I'm sorry.

550
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:06,420
Why won't you help me?

551
01:04:51,168 --> 01:04:53,301
We need to pray, now.

552
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:56,070
And whatever happens,
whatever you may see or hear,

553
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:59,306
keep your eyes forward
and don't stop praying.

554
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,717
<i>That's the door
the nuns would enter from</i>

555
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,386
<i>to retrieve the supplies.</i>

556
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:20,357
<i>So they wouldn't have
to leave the castle.</i>

557
01:07:14,746 --> 01:07:15,877
No, no.

558
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:36,334
Holy mother of God.

559
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,034
Frenchie!

560
01:07:39,036 --> 01:07:40,369
Thought you could use
some help.

561
01:07:42,774 --> 01:07:44,339
Thank you.

562
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:51,079
But please, by all means,
next time, do use the shotgun.

563
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:53,882
Well, I'm saving that
for emergencies, Father.

564
01:08:45,937 --> 01:08:47,138
Sister!

565
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,606
Sister Irene!

566
01:08:52,643 --> 01:08:53,977
Father Burke.

567
01:09:01,885 --> 01:09:04,587
It's Father Burke.
He will help us.

568
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:07,124
Sister!

569
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:16,601
Sister Irene!

570
01:09:21,339 --> 01:09:22,738
Oh, thank God, Father.

571
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,142
Are you all right, Sister?

572
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:27,510
Frenchie?

573
01:09:27,512 --> 01:09:28,744
What happened?

574
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:32,649
We, we've been praying,
all of us together.

575
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,183
Perpetual adoration,

576
01:09:34,185 --> 01:09:36,305
it's the only thing that's
been holding back the evil.

577
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:39,288
Who's been praying?

578
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,359
All of us. The other nuns.

579
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:05,981
They were here.

580
01:10:05,983 --> 01:10:08,119
They were praying
when we were attacked.

581
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:12,655
The nuns tried to warn me.

582
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:13,789
Visions.

583
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,226
They felt so real.

584
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:08,547
There's no one left.

585
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:13,652
We have our answer, Father.

586
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,987
As if there was
any doubt before,

587
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:18,757
this place is no longer holy.

588
01:11:25,296 --> 01:11:27,698
Oh, Father. Lord Jesus...

589
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,707
Father, what do we do?

590
01:11:37,509 --> 01:11:40,377
Get my bag, Sister!
Hand me the cross!

591
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,346
Put some holy water on it.
Here, hurry!

592
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:44,915
Please, Father, hurry!

593
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:49,285
Hold it down! Cover its face!

594
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,524
I cast out the demon in you,

595
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:58,528
in the name
of God the Father Almighty!

596
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,397
And the power
of the holy spirit,

597
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,768
I ask this in the name
of our Father, Jesus Christ,

598
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,837
who is coming to judge
both the living and the dead,

599
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:10,840
and the world of fire!

600
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,196
That felt like an emergency.

601
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:34,333
We're too late.

602
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:36,933
The evil is free.

603
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,269
No.

604
01:12:39,337 --> 01:12:41,071
For the demon
to enter our world,

605
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:43,908
it must possess a human soul.

606
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:46,911
Sister Victoria must have been
the last nun in this cloister.

607
01:12:46,913 --> 01:12:48,478
You know what you must do.

608
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,679
I can't.

609
01:12:49,681 --> 01:12:51,717
Then not even God can save...

610
01:12:55,854 --> 01:12:57,389
It wasn't suicide.

611
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:00,392
<i>It was a sacrifice,</i>

612
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:05,229
<i>so the evil
wouldn't take her soul.</i>

613
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:09,800
I did not understand a word
you just said, but, uh...

614
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,170
Sounds like
your investigation's complete.

615
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:14,170
So, let's get outta here.

616
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,305
We can't just leave.

617
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,676
Oh, come on. Why the hell not?

618
01:13:19,845 --> 01:13:23,515
We have to seal the gateway,
to contain the evil.

619
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,356
The gateway
is in the catacombs.

620
01:13:33,358 --> 01:13:34,925
But we can't close it

621
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:37,830
without the relic.
The blood of Christ.

622
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:41,333
"Christ." Jesus Christ?

623
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:45,535
Did the sisters tell you
where it is?

624
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:46,770
The Abbess was found dead

625
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,440
in the tunnel
to the catacombs.

626
01:13:50,642 --> 01:13:52,575
I think I know
where that tunnel is.

627
01:13:52,577 --> 01:13:56,447
Good. Then, that's where
we look first.

628
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:58,283
But, Father, before we do,

629
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,588
I'd like to take my vows.

630
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,391
Are you certain?

631
01:14:07,225 --> 01:14:09,225
My visions.

632
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:11,862
I now know
they are a miracle of God.

633
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,731
And I am ready to commit
my life to Him.

634
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:16,802
Now, that, Sister,
is a noble act.

635
01:14:18,104 --> 01:14:19,505
It's a shame, but...

636
01:14:21,074 --> 01:14:24,175
By the authority
entrusted to me,

637
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:26,477
and in the name of the Church,

638
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:28,748
I receive the vows
you have taken.

639
01:14:31,851 --> 01:14:34,284
I earnestly
commend you to God.

640
01:14:34,286 --> 01:14:37,654
That your gift of self,
is made one

641
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:40,390
with the sacrifice
of the Eucharist.

642
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,193
And might be brought
to perfection.

643
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:47,366
May the love of God
unite you forever and ever.

644
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:14,692
Well, there's nothing here.

645
01:15:14,694 --> 01:15:16,260
There has to be.

646
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:19,563
They told me this key unlocks
a door to the relic.

647
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:21,434
That could be
anywhere in the castle.

648
01:15:23,236 --> 01:15:26,773
It is here.
Don't you see it, Sister?

649
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,341
What?

650
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:33,646
Mary points the way.

651
01:16:32,705 --> 01:16:34,074
The blood of Christ.

652
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:37,844
Holy shit.

653
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,613
The holiest.

654
01:16:49,122 --> 01:16:55,528
Only a true bride of Christ
can wield something so sacred.

655
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,068
Wait.

656
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,835
What is it?

657
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:08,673
Shouldn't we say
a prayer or something, first?

658
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:12,409
There's a time for prayer,
and a time for action, son.

659
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,212
Now is the time for action.

660
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:17,617
Also still feels like a time
for prayer as well, Father.

661
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:30,830
<i>"Finit hic, Deo."</i>
God ends here.

662
01:17:43,509 --> 01:17:45,043
We need
to search everywhere

663
01:17:45,045 --> 01:17:46,445
to find the gateway.

664
01:19:03,023 --> 01:19:06,126
Sister Irene, this way.

665
01:19:11,565 --> 01:19:12,697
Hello?

666
01:19:18,272 --> 01:19:19,639
Sister Irene!

667
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,908
Sister!

668
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:40,053
Irene!

669
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:04,976
Lord Jesus, in your Holy Name,

670
01:21:04,978 --> 01:21:09,282
I bind all evil spirits
to this fire!

671
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:13,352
Protect us from evil
with your holy light!

672
01:21:36,612 --> 01:21:39,247
Frenchie. Help me.

673
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:44,116
Of course.

674
01:23:22,251 --> 01:23:23,416
No!

675
01:23:23,418 --> 01:23:25,084
You failed.

676
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:28,155
Just as you have failed
everyone in your life.

677
01:23:35,464 --> 01:23:39,532
Tomorrow, a village will be
missing its idiot.

678
01:23:39,534 --> 01:23:40,799
You should've kept running

679
01:23:40,801 --> 01:23:43,836
when you had the chance,
Frenchman.

680
01:23:43,838 --> 01:23:45,804
I am French-Canadian.

681
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,385
Run!

682
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:00,487
Frenchie!

683
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:04,459
No!

684
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:22,044
Sister!

685
01:24:22,745 --> 01:24:24,044
Sister Irene!

686
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:42,490
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

687
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:35,539
No, no, no, no, no!

688
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:45,081
Come on.

689
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:04,768
Okay.

690
01:28:16,212 --> 01:28:18,145
I hope you don't mind.

691
01:28:18,147 --> 01:28:20,682
It's called
"the kiss of life."

692
01:28:20,684 --> 01:28:23,385
It's just called that way.
It's just, it's not really...

693
01:28:23,387 --> 01:28:26,322
Frenchie,
what's your real name?

694
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:28,825
Maurice.

695
01:28:30,059 --> 01:28:32,228
Thank you
for saving my life, Maurice.

696
01:28:33,797 --> 01:28:34,798
You're welcome.

697
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:11,733
We should get going.

698
01:29:11,735 --> 01:29:13,468
<i>Into your hands, O Lord,</i>

699
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,870
we humbly deliver
your servants.

700
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:18,440
The nuns of Saint Carta.

701
01:29:18,442 --> 01:29:21,612
They served you in this life
with strength and faith.

702
01:29:22,913 --> 01:29:25,379
Deliver them now
from every evil.

703
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:28,651
And let them live with you
in perfect grace, forever.

704
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,822
Amen.

705
01:29:32,322 --> 01:29:34,458
Thought this ground
wasn't holy anymore.

706
01:29:38,962 --> 01:29:40,163
It is now.

707
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:44,499
Will you stay on in Biertan?

708
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:47,002
Oh, I think
I've had my fill of Romania.

709
01:29:47,004 --> 01:29:49,372
My father was a tomato farmer.

710
01:29:50,674 --> 01:29:53,642
Maybe I'll try that
for a while.

711
01:29:53,644 --> 01:29:56,177
Sounds a little boring
for a world traveler like you.

712
01:29:56,179 --> 01:29:58,448
Certainly hope so.

713
01:30:17,768 --> 01:30:19,602
An exorcism can be
very dangerous.

714
01:30:19,604 --> 01:30:23,105
Not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

715
01:30:23,107 --> 01:30:24,606
Take Maurice Theriault,

716
01:30:24,608 --> 01:30:26,307
his friends
called him Frenchie.

717
01:30:26,309 --> 01:30:27,910
He was a French-Canadian farmer.

718
01:30:27,912 --> 01:30:30,178
Nothing more
than a third grade education.

719
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,479
Yet, after he was possessed...

720
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:36,718
<i>...spoke some of
the best Latin I'd ever heard.</i>

721
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,688
And like that,
an upside-down cross

722
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,956
started to appear
from within his body.

723
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,793
Which brings me
to the three stages

724
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:45,695
of demonic activity.

725
01:30:45,697 --> 01:30:51,000
