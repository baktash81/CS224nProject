1
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,166
<i>Call on Dolly</i>

2
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,347
<i>If your neighbour needs a new romance</i>

3
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:23,905
<i>Just name the kind of man
your sister wants, and she'll snatch him up</i>

4
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,820
<i>Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts
and she'll match 'em up</i>

5
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:29,627
<i>Call on</i>

6
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,048
"Mrs. Dolly Levi."

7
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,384
<i>She's the one the spinsters recommend</i>

8
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:38,943
<i>She even found a lovely bride
for poor cousin Isadore</i>

9
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:41,133
"Social introductions arranged."

10
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:45,198
<i>Drag your single relations out</i>

11
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,881
<i>In a week you'll have to
send engraved invitations out</i>

12
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,030
"In an atmosphere of elegance
and refinement."

13
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:54,869
<i>Call on Dolly</i>

14
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,901
"Object: matrimony."

15
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,043
<i>If your eldest daughter needs a friend</i>

16
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:05,141
<i>Just name the kind of man your sister
wants, and she'll snatch him up</i>

17
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:09,516
<i>Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts
and she'll match 'em up</i>

18
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,354
<i>Call on Dolly</i>

19
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:20,486
<i>If your eldest daughter needs a friend</i>

20
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:30,234
<i>I have always been a woman
who arranges things</i>

21
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:36,175
<i>For the pleasure and the profit it derives</i>

22
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,823
<i>I have always been a woman
who arranges things</i>

23
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:49,611
<i>Like furniture and daffodils and lives</i>

24
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,468
<i>If you want your sister courted,
brother wed or cheese imported</i>

25
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,539
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

26
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,952
<i>If you want your roof inspected,
eyebrows tweezed or bills collected</i>

27
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,907
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

28
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:09,750
<i>If you want your daughter dated,
or some marriage consummated</i>

29
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,588
<i>For a rather modest fee</i>

30
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:16,114
<i>If you want a husband spotted,
boyfriend traced or chicken potted</i>

31
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,185
<i>I'll arrange for making all arrangements</i>

32
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:24,251
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

33
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,964
- Business or pleasure, Mrs. Levi?
- Mr. Jones, business is always a pleasure.

34
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,686
And you've got more businesses
than a dog has fleas!

35
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:33,985
As my late husband, Ephraim Levi,
used to say:

36
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,055
"If you have to live from hand to mouth,
you better be ambidextrous!"

37
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,199
<i>If you want your ego bolstered,
muscles toned or chair upholstered</i>

38
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:45,193
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

39
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,759
<i>Charming social introductions,
expert mandolin instructions</i>

40
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,633
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

41
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:55,165
<i>If you want your culture rounded,
French improved or torso pounded</i>

42
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,701
<i>With a ten-year guarantee</i>

43
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:01,610
<i>If you want a birth recorded,
collies bred or kittens boarded</i>

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,834
<i>I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure</i>

45
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:09,507
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

46
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,460
- Where to, Dolly?
- Yonkers.

47
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:16,643
To handle a highly personal
matter for Mr. Vandergelder,

48
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,096
the well-known
unmarried half-a-millionaire.

49
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,748
- Gonna marry him yourself?
- Why, Mr. Sullivan,

50
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:25,163
whatever put such
a preposterous idea into my head?

51
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,696
Your head.

52
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:31,837
<i>If you want a law abolished,
jury swayed or toenails polished</i>

53
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,832
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

54
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:38,474
<i>If you want your liver tested,
glasses made, cash invested</i>

55
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,622
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

56
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,072
<i>If you want your children coddled,
corsets boned or furs remodelled</i>

57
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:48,253
<i>Or some nice, fresh fricassee</i>

58
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,786
<i>If you want your bustle shifted,
wedding planned or bosom lifted</i>

59
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:55,041
<i>Don't be ashamed, girls!
Life is full of secrets and I keep 'em!</i>

60
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:58,270
<i>I'll discreetly use my own discretion</i>

61
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,530
<i>I'll arrange for making all arrangements</i>

62
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,523
<i>I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure</i>

63
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:10,461
<i>Just leave everything</i>

64
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:16,370
<i>To me</i>

65
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:29,792
- And I'm telling you that I will marry her!
- Not without my permission, you won't!

66
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,238
This is a free country,
not a private kingdom.

67
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,388
She's consented and I'll marry her.

68
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,005
- I'm telling you that you won't.
- I'm telling you I will.

69
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,729
- Never.
- Tomorrow. Today.

70
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:42,606
Ermengarde is not for you.
You can't support her. You are an artist.

71
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:45,138
- I make a good living.
- A living, Mr. Kemper,

72
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:48,586
is made by selling something that
everybody needs at least once a year.

73
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:53,108
And a million is made by producing
something everybody needs every day.

74
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,991
You artists, you painters, produce
nothing that nobody needs, never.

75
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:58,563
You might as well know,

76
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,198
any way we can find to get married
is right and fair and we'll do it.

77
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:05,766
You are an impractical,
seven-foot-tall nincompoop.

78
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,952
- That's an insult.
- All the facts about you are insults.

79
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:13,139
- Thank you for the honour of your visit.
- Ermengarde is of age and there's no law...

80
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:18,816
Law? The law is there to prevent crime. Men
of sense are there to prevent foolishness.

81
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,962
It is I that will prevent you
from marrying my niece.

82
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,711
And I've already taken the necessary steps.
Mrs. Dolly Levi is on her way here even now.

83
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:28,674
Dolly Levi? Your marriage broker?

84
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:32,661
Never mind that. She'll pick up Ermengarde
and take her to New York,

85
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:35,270
and keep her there
until this foolishness is over.

86
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,069
- We'll see about that.
- Thank you again for the honour...

87
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,607
You have to sit still, Mr. Vandergelder.

88
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,056
If I cut your throat
it will be practically unintentional.

89
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:46,504
90% of the people in this world are fools

90
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:49,462
and the rest are
in great danger of contamination.

91
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,760
Enough of this.
I'm a busy man with things to do.

92
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,947
A scraped chin is the least of them.

93
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:58,473
I did the best I could, Mr. Vandergelder.

94
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,238
- Joe.
- Yes?

95
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:06,263
I've got special reasons
for looking my best today.

96
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:09,599
Is there something a little extra
you can do? A little special?

97
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:10,710
What?

98
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,329
You know, do some of those things
you do to the young fellas.

99
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,359
Smarten me up a little bit.

100
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,232
Face massage. A little perfume water.

101
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:24,721
All I know is 15 cents' worth, like usual,
and that includes all that's decent to do.

102
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:28,433
Listen, I don't want you blabbing this,
but I need something extra today

103
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,281
because I'm going to New York
to call on a very refined lady,

104
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,160
name of Miss Irene Molloy.

105
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:36,305
Your callin' on ladies is none
of my business, Mr. Vandergelder.

106
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,370
- Hold your horses, Joe.
- Uncle Horace!

107
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:41,213
- Uncle Horace!
- Yes, what is it?

108
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,316
- What have you done to Ambrose?
- I had a quiet talk with him.

109
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,730
- You did?
- Yes, I explained to him that he's a fool.

110
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:51,373
- Oh, Uncle!
- Weeping, weeping - a waste of water.

111
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:54,485
I've done you a good turn.
You'll thank me when you're 50.

112
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,822
But, Uncle, I love him.

113
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,936
Save your tears for New York,
where they won't be noticed.

114
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,664
- But I love him!
- You don't.

115
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:03,384
- But I do!
- Leave those things to me.

116
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,605
If I don't marry Ambrose, I know I'll die!

117
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,951
- Of what?
- A broken heart.

118
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,206
Never heard of it. Are you ready
for Mrs. Levi when she comes?

119
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:12,286
Yes.

120
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,847
Well, get ready some more and
stay in your room until she arrives.

121
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,638
Cornelius!

122
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,062
Barnaby!

123
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,283
Barnaby!

124
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:31,080
Cornelius! Barnaby!

125
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:40,747
- You stamped, Mr. Vandergelder?
- Yes, I stamped.

126
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,739
Are my niece's bags at the railroad station?

127
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:45,279
- Yes.
- And you, did you label them properly?

128
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,851
- Yes.
- Good.

129
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,221
I'm going to New York
on important business,

130
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:51,184
then I'll be marching in the parade.

131
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:54,668
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
- I'm planning to stay at the Central Hotel.

132
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:57,090
We've never been here alone,
Mr. Vandergelder.

133
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:01,274
Now, in honour of the occasion, I'll promote
you both. Cornelius, how old are you?

134
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,687
28¾, Mr. Vandergelder.

135
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:08,944
Is that all? That's a foolish age
to be at. I thought you were 40.

136
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,979
No, I'm 28¾.

137
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:15,156
Well, a man's not worth a cent till he's 40.

138
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,345
We pay him wages until then
to make mistakes.

139
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:20,219
- Anyway, I'm promoting you to chief clerk.
- Chief clerk?

140
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,670
- Yes.
- Well, what am I now?

141
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:27,973
You're an impertinent fool. If you behave,
I'll promote you from fool to chief clerk,

142
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,114
with a raise in your wages.

143
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,300
Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.

144
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:36,260
You, Barnaby, I'm promoting you from
idiot apprentice to incompetent clerk.

145
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:39,824
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.
- Mr. Vandergelder? Mr. Vandergelder?

146
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:41,128
What is it?

147
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,767
Does the chief clerk get
one evening off a week?

148
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:49,720
So that's how you thank me, eh?
No, sir. You'll attend to the store as usual.

149
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:55,815
You keep on asking for evenings free
and you'll find you have all your days free.

150
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,167
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

151
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:00,464
And when I come back I wanna hear
that you ran the place perfectly.

152
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,758
If I hear of any foolishness, I'll fire you both.

153
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:03,838
Yes.

154
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,414
You might as well know it now.

155
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:09,125
When I return there will be
some changes around here.

156
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:13,086
- You're going to have a mistress.
- I'm too young, Mr. Vandergelder.

157
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:19,410
Not yours, idiot. Mine. I mean,
I'm planning to get married.

158
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,752
- Married?
- Yes, married. Any objections?

159
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:22,782
No, but...

160
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,932
No, many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder.

161
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,118
- And to the lady.
- That's none of your business.

162
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,121
- Any questions?
- No, but...

163
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:30,923
- But what?
- But I mean...

164
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,147
- Speak up.
- Why?

165
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:35,601
- Why what, damn it! Speak up!
- Why are you getting married?

166
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,853
Let me tell you something, son.

167
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:44,687
I've worked hard and I've become
rich and friendless and mean.

168
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:49,911
And in America it's about
as far as you can go.

169
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,312
It's time to be doing
something a little bit foolish.

170
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,383
Besides, I need a steady housekeeper.

171
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,679
<i>It takes a woman, all powdered and pink</i>

172
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:09,477
<i>To joyously clean out the drain in the sink</i>

173
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:13,918
<i>And it takes an angel
with long, golden lashes</i>

174
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:19,449
<i>And soft Dresden fingers
for dumping the ashes</i>

175
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:24,320
<i>Yes, it takes a woman, a dainty woman</i>

176
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,389
<i>A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife</i>

177
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:30,685
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

178
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,721
<i>A fragile woman</i>

179
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,052
<i>To bring you the sweet things in life</i>

180
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,157
<i>The frail young maiden,
who's constantly there</i>

181
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:47,185
<i>For washing and blueing,
and shoeing the mare</i>

182
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:51,780
<i>And it takes a female for setting the table</i>

183
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:57,191
<i>And weaning the Guernsey
and cleaning the stable</i>

184
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:59,874
<i>Yes, it takes a woman</i>

185
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,138
<i>A dainty woman</i>

186
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,060
<i>A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife</i>

187
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:08,433
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

188
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,500
<i>A fragile woman</i>

189
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,576
<i>To bring you the sweet things in life</i>

190
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:25,503
<i>And so she'll work until infinity</i>

191
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:33,674
<i>Three cheers for femininity</i>

192
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:45,067
<i>God bless fem-i-nin-i-ty</i>

193
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:50,627
<i>And in the winter she'll shovel the ice</i>

194
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,618
<i>And lovingly set out the traps for the mice</i>

195
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,414
<i>She's a joy and treasure
for, practically speaking,</i>

196
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:05,202
<i>To whom can you turn
when the plumbing is leaking?</i>

197
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:10,964
<i>To that dainty woman</i>

198
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,410
<i>That fragile woman</i>

199
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:17,218
<i>That sweetheart, that mistress, that wife</i>

200
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:22,163
<i>That womanly wife</i>

201
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:25,733
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

202
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,988
<i>A husky woman</i>

203
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:32,406
<i>To bring you the sweet things in life</i>

204
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:35,319
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

205
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,432
<i>A dainty woman</i>

206
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:40,992
<i>A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife</i>

207
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,610
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

208
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,640
<i>A fragile woman</i>

209
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,624
<i>To bring you the sweet things in life</i>

210
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,344
Well, well, well, well, well.

211
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:56,990
Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.

212
00:17:58,215 --> 00:18:00,987
Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.

213
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,510
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning, ma'am.

214
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,277
Uh, morning, Mrs. Levi.

215
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:10,608
How handsome you look today. Ooh,
you absolutely take my breath away.

216
00:18:10,682 --> 00:18:12,298
Ermengarde is crying her eyes out.

217
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:14,836
You can take her to New York,
but blow her nose first.

218
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:17,325
If only Irene Molloy could see you now.

219
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,618
Find someplace else to loaf. And you two
get back to the store. Go on!

220
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,070
And don't forget to put
the lid on the sheep dip.

221
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:25,921
I don't know what's come over you lately,

222
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,530
but you seem to be growing
younger every day.

223
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:32,903
Well, if a man eats careful, there's
no reason why he should look old.

224
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:38,655
- You never said a truer word.
- Even if I never see 40... uh, 35, again.

225
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:42,684
35. I can see that you're the sort
that will be stamping about at 100,

226
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:46,015
eating five meals a day, like
my Uncle Harry, may he rest in peace.

227
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:49,013
Let me see your hand, Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, show me your hand.

228
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,198
- Why?
- I'm a judge of hands. I read hands.

229
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:55,687
- And I use them to get things done.
- Oh! Lord in heaven! Goodness gracious!

230
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,866
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's such a long lifeline.

231
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,821
- Where?
- From here I don't know where it goes.

232
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:05,429
It runs right off your hand.
They'll have to hit you with a mallet.

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,805
They'll have to stifle you with
a sofa pillow. You'll bury us all.

234
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,955
I will?

235
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:14,369
Say, you're all spiffed up
today, aren't you?

236
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:17,891
- Yes.
- And not for this smelly horse, either.

237
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:22,233
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say you was goin' somewhere.

238
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,983
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi. How do you do it?

239
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:30,359
Two and two is four, Mr. Vandergelder.

240
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,086
With a head like yours
you'll be a rich woman someday.

241
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:35,160
That's exactly what I had in mind.

242
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:38,841
Then I suggest you go about your
business and pick up Ermengarde,

243
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:43,331
- for which I am paying you good money.
- Speaking of business, Mr. Vandergelder,

244
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,585
I suppose you've given up
all idea of getting married?

245
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,276
- Is that what you suppose?
- Uh-huh.

246
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:51,269
Then suppose you listen to this, Mrs. Levi.

247
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:56,219
I've decided I've practically decided
to ask Irene Molloy to be my wife.

248
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,744
- You have?
- Yes, I have.

249
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:02,742
I'm going to New York and discuss it
with her this very afternoon.

250
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:09,678
Well, that is just about the best news
I have ever heard, Mr. Vandergelder.

251
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:13,442
Oh, yes, indeed. Marvellous news.
Oh, dear me. Isn't it wonderful?

252
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:17,736
I mean, I'm racking my brain, trying to
think of something that's made me happier,

253
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,192
but I just can't come up with a thing,
because this is just too wonderful.

254
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,839
Well, it's all your fault, you know.

255
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:28,328
You put me into this marryin' frame of mind
with all your introductions and scheming.

256
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,662
- A widow has to earn a living.
- One day I wake up

257
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,815
- and the house seems like an empty shell.
- Certainly is.

258
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,695
- And messy, too.
- Certainly is.

259
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:38,305
A man needs someone
to take out the garbage.

260
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:42,327
And Irene Molloy's just the one
to do it. Oh, darling girl.

261
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:46,316
Well, I think it's perfectly wonderful
what's going to happen in your household.

262
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,757
I never did like the idea of all that money
of yours lying around in piles in the bank,

263
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,750
so useless and motionless. As my late
husband, Ephraim Levi, used to say:

264
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,550
"Money should circulate like rainwater."

265
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,654
"It should flow down among the people,
through little dressmakers and restaurants,

266
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,606
setting up a business here,
furnishing a good time there."

267
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:12,828
I just know that you and Mrs. Vandergelder
will see that all your hard-earned wealth

268
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,235
starts flowing in and around
many people's lives, just flowing...

269
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,536
- All right. Stop saying that!
- Pouring out...

270
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,917
So there's nothing more for me to do
but wish you happiness

271
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:24,792
- and say goodbye.
- Yes, well, goodbye.

272
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,363
And when I get to New York,
I'll tell the girl I had lined up for you,

273
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:29,285
the heiress, not to wait.

274
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:33,193
- What did you say?
- Oh, nothing, nothing. A word. "Heiress."

275
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:37,909
Well, just a minute. That's kind of
unusual, isn't it, Mrs. Levi?

276
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:42,250
Well, I haven't been wearing myself to the
bone hunting up usual girls to interest you.

277
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:45,504
But now all that's too late.
You're engaged to marry Irene Molloy.

278
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,351
- I am not engaged.
- I cannot keep upsetting

279
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:50,883
the finest women around
unless you mean business.

280
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:54,637
- Who said I don't mean business?
- You're playing a very dangerous game.

281
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,590
- Dangerous?
- Of course it's dangerous. It's called

282
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,201
"tampering with a woman's affections".

283
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:02,116
The only way to save yourself
from that charge

284
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:05,648
is to get married
to someone soon, very soon.

285
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,105
- Don't worry.
- I won't.

286
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:11,326
I'll meet you in front of
Irene Molloy's hat shop at 2. 30.

287
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:14,849
- Never mind. You've done your work.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

288
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:17,391
I want to be there to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

289
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:21,417
Just tend to Ermengarde or else I'll ask
you to return the fee I gave you for that.

290
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:24,365
- Speaking of money...
- Oh, no. How much?

291
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:30,428
Well, I left my money in the handbag I took
to the cleaner's just before it burned down.

292
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:35,453
20! Oh, bless you, and don't you worry
your handsome head about a thing.

293
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:39,168
Just keep all your thoughts
on that lovely Irene Molloy.

294
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:07,710
<i>It takes a woman to quietly plan</i>

295
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:15,886
<i>To take him and change him
to her kind of man</i>

296
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:21,979
<i>And to gently lead him
where fortune can find him</i>

297
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:32,185
<i>And not let him know</i>

298
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,901
<i>That the power behind him</i>

299
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:44,773
<i>Was that dainty woman</i>

300
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:52,023
<i>That fragile woman</i>

301
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:55,629
<i>That sweetheart</i>

302
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,504
<i>That mistress</i>

303
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:02,611
<i>That wife</i>

304
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:23,898
<i>Da, da, da, da</i>

305
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,278
<i>Da, da, da</i>

306
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:34,407
If he had any taste at all,
he'd have the shutters done over in green.

307
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:38,630
Mm, forest-green shutters.

308
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:43,308
-  What are you doing?
-  Hurry!

309
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,454
- My uncle...
- He just left.

310
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:47,178
Now quick! We're running away.

311
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:49,874
- Running away?
- Hurry, before the train gets here!

312
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,056
- Train?
- To New York, to get married.

313
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:55,968
- We're going to elope.
- Elope? That's such an awful word.

314
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,531
- Oh, Ermengarde.
- My, what a romantic scene.

315
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,098
Oh, Mrs. Levi, please explain to Ambrose.
I wanna marry him, but not elope.

316
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:07,903
- This doesn't concern Mrs. Levi.
- Everything concerns Dolly Levi.

317
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,076
- Don't listen to her. I know why you're here.
- To help. Love needs all the help it can get.

318
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:15,806
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.
- There's no time.

319
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:18,836
Can we climb in? I feel
an updraught in my underpants.

320
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,369
- Oh, Mrs. Levi!
- This is no way to elope.

321
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:24,512
If you follow my suggestions,
not only will he let you marry

322
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,467
but he'll dance at your wedding.

323
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:30,182
And not alone, either.
Mr. Kemper, can you dance?

324
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:34,066
- Dance? I'm an artist, Mrs. Levi. I paint.
- No problem.

325
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,743
- "Mrs. Levi. Painters taught how to dance."
- Here's what we'll do.

326
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:40,619
- I'm going to take you to New York.
- See? I told you.

327
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:44,914
You will stay close by. Tonight you will
take her to dinner at the Harmonia Gardens.

328
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:47,907
There's this man, Rudolph Reisenweber.
He knows me well.

329
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,206
We'll enter you in the polka contest.

330
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,741
The prize is a gold cup and
some money, and you'll win it.

331
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:56,767
- Oh, the cups we won, my husband and I.
- Now, wait a minute.

332
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,722
I'm surprised you have
acquaintances in a place like that.

333
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:05,292
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.
Dear friends from days gone by.

334
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:10,085
My late husband, Ephraim Levi, believed
in life, any place you could find it,

335
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,422
wherever there were people,
all kinds of people.

336
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:16,528
And every Friday night,
even when times were bad,

337
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,749
every Friday night, like clockwork,

338
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:25,081
down those stairs of the Harmonia
Gardens we came, Ephraim and I.

339
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:30,065
Not acquaintances, Ermengarde. Friends.

340
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:33,172
It's all very well for you,
but you're suggesting that we...

341
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:37,359
Mr. Kemper, do you or do you not wish to
show Horace that you mean business?

342
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:38,425
Yes!

343
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:41,993
All right, then. Go to the Harmonia
Gardens and say that Mrs. Levi sent you.

344
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:48,206
And, oh... yes, well, tell Rudolph...
Tell Rudolph that Dolly's coming back.

345
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:49,517
Dolly's coming back?

346
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:52,430
And I want a table for two
and a chicken for eight o'clock.

347
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:57,107
Mr. Vandergelder will learn of your triumph
and everything will work out beautifully.

348
00:26:57,183 --> 00:27:00,030
- But how, Mrs. Levi? How?
- How?

349
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,556
Oh.

350
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:07,891
28¾ years old and I still don't
get an evening free.

351
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:10,111
When am I gonna begin to live?

352
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:16,447
Barnaby? How much money have you got?

353
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,323
- H uh?
- I mean, that you can get your hands on?

354
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:25,078
- About three dollars. Why?
- Barnaby, you and I are going to New York.

355
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,456
Cornelius, we can't. Close the store?

356
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:31,410
We'll have to, cos some rotten cans
of chicken mash are going to explode.

357
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:33,135
Holy cabooses! How do you know?

358
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:35,352
Because I'll light some candles under them.

359
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:39,237
They'll make such a stink that customers
won't be able to come in for 24 hours.

360
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:43,602
That'll get us an evening free. We are going
to New York and we are gonna live.

361
00:27:43,676 --> 00:27:47,669
We're gonna have a good meal,
be in danger, get almost arrested.

362
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:50,469
- And we're gonna spend all our money.
- Holy cabooses!

363
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,732
And one more thing.

364
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:56,031
We are not coming back to Yonkers
until we've each kissed a girl.

365
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:00,483
Cornelius, you can't do that.
You don't know any girls.

366
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,508
I'm 28¾. I gotta begin sometime.

367
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:09,378
I'm only 19½.
With me it's not so urgent.

368
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:12,108
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?

369
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:13,406
Mrs. Levi.

370
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,168
- I just couldn't help hearing.
- We'll be fired.

371
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:20,701
- We were only talking.
- Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,

372
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:26,185
there is nothing that makes me happier
than the thought of two fine young men

373
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,983
enjoying the company of two lovely ladies.

374
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:32,404
- What ladies? Where?
- In New York, Mr. Hackl,

375
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:35,351
to which, unless my ears
play me tricks, you are bound.

376
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,805
Now, there's this millinery shop
run by a charming woman.

377
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:44,326
- "Irene Molloy"?
- And her attractive assistant, Minnie Fay.

378
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,249
And now that you've noted
the address, I have only this to say.

379
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:51,776
Two o'clock in the afternoon there
is the ideal time for friendly conversation.

380
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:53,883
Definitely no later than 2. 30.

381
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:56,495
And if you ever say that
this was my suggestion,

382
00:28:56,561 --> 00:29:00,522
well, I should denounce you both
for the terrible liars that you are.

383
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:08,148
- A millinery shop.
- Women who work!

384
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:10,378
- Adventure, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.

385
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,521
- Living, Barnaby.
- I'm scared.

386
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:15,782
- Will ya come, Barnaby?
- Yes, Cornelius! Yes!

387
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:21,039
The lights of Broadway! Elevated trains!
The stuffed whale at Barnum's museum!

388
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,567
Stuffed whale! Wow!

389
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,528
Women who work! Wow!

390
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:29,943
All clear up here, Cornelius!
You gonna light 'em all?

391
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,588
Cornelius, look out! That bottom row,

392
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:35,081
they're swelled up
like they're ready to burst!

393
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:39,640
- Holy cabooses! What a smell!
- Let's get dressed, Barnaby.

394
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,758
We're going to New York!

395
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,867
<i>Out there</i>

396
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,738
<i>There's a world outside of Yonkers</i>

397
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:52,380
<i>Way out there beyond
this hick town, Barnaby</i>

398
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:55,182
<i>There's a slick town, Barnaby</i>

399
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,676
<i>Out there</i>

400
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:01,783
<i>Full of shine and full of sparkle</i>

401
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:06,539
<i>Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby</i>

402
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,875
<i>Listen, Barnaby</i>

403
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:20,612
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes,
there's lots of world out there</i>

404
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:24,490
<i>Get out the brilliantine and dime cigars</i>

405
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:30,239
<i>We're gonna find adventure
in the evening air</i>

406
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:32,311
<i>Girls in white in a perfumed night</i>

407
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,310
<i>Where the lights are bright as the stars</i>

408
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:39,679
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes,
we're gonna ride through town</i>

409
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:44,287
<i>In one of those new horse-drawn open cars</i>

410
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,853
<i>We'll see the shows at Delmonico's</i>

411
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:49,390
<i>And we'll close the town in a whirl</i>

412
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:53,952
<i>And we won't come home
until we've kissed a girl</i>

413
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:59,361
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out</i>

414
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:03,042
<i>Strut down the street
and have your picture took</i>

415
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:08,907
<i>Dressed like a dream
your spirits seem to turn about</i>

416
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:11,366
<i>That Sunday shine is a certain sign</i>

417
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,816
<i>That you feel as fine as you look</i>

418
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:19,035
<i>Beneath your parasol
the world is all a smile</i>

419
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:23,372
<i>That makes you feel brand-new
down to your toes</i>

420
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:26,130
<i>Get out your feathers, your patent leathers</i>

421
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:28,629
<i>Your beads and buckles and bows</i>

422
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:31,694
<i>For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday</i>

423
00:31:31,768 --> 00:31:33,885
<i>No Monday in your Sunday</i>

424
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:37,992
<i>No Monday in your Sunday clothes</i>

425
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:43,476
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out</i>

426
00:31:44,044 --> 00:31:47,274
<i>Strut down the street
and have your picture took</i>

427
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:52,795
<i>Dressed like a dream
your spirits seem to turn about</i>

428
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,552
<i>That Sunday shine is a certain sign</i>

429
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:58,433
<i>That you feel as fine as you look</i>

430
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:03,041
<i>Beneath your parasol
the world is all a smile</i>

431
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:07,568
<i>That makes you feel brand-new
down to your toes</i>

432
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,251
<i>Get out your feathers, your patent leathers</i>

433
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,514
<i>Your beads and buckles and bows</i>

434
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:17,309
<i>For there's no blue Monday
in your Sunday clothes</i>

435
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:42,285
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out</i>

436
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:46,845
<i>Strut down the street
and have your picture took</i>

437
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,099
<i>Dressed like a dream
your spirits seem to turn about</i>

438
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,672
<i>That Sunday shine is a certain sign</i>

439
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:57,318
<i>That you feel as fine as you look</i>

440
00:32:57,812 --> 00:33:02,263
<i>Beneath your bowler brim
the world's a simple song</i>

441
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:06,136
<i>A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose</i>

442
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,130
<i>Get out your slickers</i>

443
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:11,394
<i>Your flannel knickers</i>

444
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,039
<i>Your red suspenders and hose</i>

445
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:17,268
<i>For there's no blue Monday</i>

446
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,061
<i>In your Sunday</i>

447
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:27,085
<i>No blue Monday</i>

448
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:31,227
<i>In your Sunday clothes</i>

449
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:38,056
Ermengarde, keep smiling.
No man wants a little ninny.

450
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,551
Ambrose, do a turn, let me see.

451
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:43,776
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,
don't forget Irene and Minnie,

452
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:46,693
just forget you ever heard a word from me.

453
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,837
<i>All aboard! All aboard!</i>

454
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:53,975
<i>All aboard!</i>

455
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,380
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes,
there's lots of world out there</i>

456
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:06,097
<i>Put on your silk cravat and patent shoes</i>

457
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:12,927
<i>We're gonna find adventure
in the evening air</i>

458
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:15,650
<i>To town we'll trot to a smoky spot</i>

459
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:19,061
<i>Where the girls are hot as a fuse</i>

460
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:24,631
<i>Put on your silk high hat
and at the turned-up cuff</i>

461
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,701
<i>We'll wear a handmade
grey suede buttoned glove</i>

462
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:30,190
<i>You're gonna take New York by storm</i>

463
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:33,065
<i>We'll join the Astors at Tony Pastor's</i>

464
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,909
<i>And this I'm positive of</i>

465
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,863
<i>That we won't come home</i>

466
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,779
<i>No, we won't come home</i>

467
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:51,284
<i>No, we won't come home
until we fall in love</i>

468
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:09,236
Do get done with that, Minnie. The men
are eyeing us for the wrong reason.

469
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:12,084
- A banana a day keeps the doctor away.
- An apple a day.

470
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,420
Do doctors slip on apple peels?

471
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,523
- How are you, Miss Molloy?
- If I felt any better I'd be indecent.

472
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:20,671
- You are in a mood today.
- I certainly am.

473
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:26,881
Not that it's any of my business...
Oh, but is it because...? I mean...

474
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,606
I don't mind that you never finish lunch,
but I mind that you never finish sentences.

475
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:34,371
Well, what I meant was,
are you really going to?

476
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:37,318
Silly girl, say it. Am I going to
marry Horace Vandergelder?

477
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:40,119
Yes, I'm seriously
considering it, if he asks me.

478
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:43,804
Oh, I'd rather die on the rack than
ask you such a personal question,

479
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,762
but why would you?

480
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:50,206
Because he's rich, that's why. He can rescue
me from the millinery business. I hate hats.

481
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,511
- Hate hats?
- A good afternoon to you, Officer Gogarty.

482
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,426
And the rest of the day to you, Miss Molloy.

483
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,143
Ah, Minnie, why is it that all the attractive
men in New York are married?

484
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:03,096
Blarney, Miss Molloy! Blarney!

485
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:04,862
Come on now, get going, all of you.

486
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:12,309
- Oh, the way you talk!
- It's natural to talk about men.

487
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:16,447
- I mean, what you said about hating hats.
- Particularly the women who buy them.

488
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,331
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do, Minnie Fay.

489
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:23,161
All lady milliners are suspected
of being wicked women.

490
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:27,150
Half the time those dowagers who come in,
come in merely to stare and wonder.

491
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:28,411
Oh, how dare they!

492
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,521
And if they were sure,
they'd not set foot in the shop again.

493
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:35,087
- Well, good riddance. Who needs them?
- We do, unfortunately.

494
00:36:35,547 --> 00:36:38,852
So, do I go out to restaurants?
No, it would be bad for business.

495
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,607
Do I go to balls or theatres or operas?

496
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:44,533
No, it would be bad for business.

497
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:48,513
The only men I ever meet are the feather
merchants who come to sell me things.

498
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:51,281
Minnie, I'm tired of being suspected of being

499
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:54,385
a wicked woman with
nothing to show for it.

500
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,996
Miss Molloy!

501
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,914
Why does everybody
have adventures but me?

502
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:01,217
- Adventures?
- Because I have no spirit, no gumption.

503
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:05,661
Either I marry Horace Vandergelder
or I'm gonna burn this shop down,

504
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:08,847
break out like a fire engine
and find myself some excitement.

505
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:12,108
The things you're saying today.
They're just awful.

506
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:15,564
Oh, aren't they, though?
And I'm enjoying every word of it.

507
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:19,168
What's this? A return from
Miss Mortimer again?

508
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,117
Same old story. She wants cherries
and feathers. To catch a beau, I suppose.

509
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:26,883
If you ask me, she'd do better
with a heavy veil.

510
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:31,636
I told her ribbons down the back
is the thing to catch a gentleman's eye.

511
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:34,207
But she'd have none of it.

512
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,273
Minnie, make another hat
for Miss Mortimer.

513
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,625
I'm wearing this one myself.

514
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:40,881
- Oh, but you can't.
- Why not?

515
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:44,760
Oh, because it's... it's provocative.
That's why not.

516
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:49,622
Well, who knows that "provocative"
isn't just what I might wanna be today.

517
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:54,653
<i>I'll be wearing ribbons down my back</i>

518
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,571
<i>This summer</i>

519
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:04,052
<i>Blue and green and
streaming in the yellow sky</i>

520
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:08,845
<i>So if someone special comes my way</i>

521
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,874
<i>This summer</i>

522
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:16,166
<i>He might notice me</i>

523
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:20,233
<i>Passing by</i>

524
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:30,131
<i>And so I'll try to make it easier to find me</i>

525
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:34,856
<i>In the stillness of July</i>

526
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:44,059
<i>Because a breeze might stir
a rainbow up behind me</i>

527
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,904
<i>That might happen to catch</i>

528
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:51,233
<i>The gentleman's eye</i>

529
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:59,060
<i>And he might smile
and take me by the hand</i>

530
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,586
<i>This summer</i>

531
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,871
<i>Making me recall how lovely love can be</i>

532
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:25,265
<i>And so I will proudly wear</i>

533
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:35,117
<i>Ribbons down my back</i>

534
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:43,483
<i>Shining in my hair</i>

535
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:51,033
<i>That he might notice me</i>

536
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:06,307
Miss Molloy, you don't love
Horace Vandergelder, do you?

537
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:09,988
- Of course I don't love him.
- Then how can you... I mean...?

538
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:13,245
Minnie, look. There are two men
staring at the shop.

539
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,161
- Men?
- Uh-huh. Aren't they delicious?

540
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,968
You don't think...?

541
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:20,848
Yes, I do believe
they mean to come in here.

542
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:24,145
- Men in the shop? What'll we do?
- Why, flirt with them, of course.

543
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,485
- I'll give you the short one.
- You're terrible.

544
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:30,046
We'll heat them up and drop them cold.
Good practice for married life.

545
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:33,428
- Let's pretty ourselves up a bit.
- If you say "vamp", I'll scream.

546
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,156
- Vamp!
- Agh!

547
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,752
I must say, I like the tall one.

548
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:42,863
Adventure, Barnaby.

549
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:45,400
We can still catch the train back to Yonkers.

550
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:47,963
I feel dizzy.

551
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,502
Or go see the stuffed whale at the museum.

552
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:52,031
Women, Barnaby.

553
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:55,750
Stuffed women!

554
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:04,152
There's no one here. We can leave.

555
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:08,601
I'd never forgive myself. Agh!

556
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,598
Are you sure this is an adventure,
Cornelius?

557
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:16,047
You don't have to ask. When you're
in one, you'll know it all right.

558
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:18,844
- How much money is left?
- 40 cents for the train,

559
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,612
30 cents for dinner and
20 cents to see the whale.

560
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,451
Well, when they come out,
we'll pretend we're rich.

561
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:28,206
- That way we won't have to spend a thing.
- Why not say that Mrs. Levi sent us?

562
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,929
No, we're not supposed to
ever say that. Shh!

563
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,303
We're two men about town
looking for hats for ladies.

564
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:36,956
What ladies?

565
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:40,862
"Good afternoon, ma'am.
Wonderful weather we're having."

566
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:44,200
"How do you do, ma'am?
And how are your hats?"

567
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,695
"Charmed to make your acquaintance.
Lovely place you have here."

568
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:49,767
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

569
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:55,940
- Cornelius Hackl here.
- Barnaby Tucker here.

570
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:58,584
Irene Molloy here.

571
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:04,305
I'm very happy to meet you.
Is there anything I can do for you?

572
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,589
See, we're two ladies about town
lookin' for hats to Molloy...

573
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:17,651
We're hats, you see, and wondered if we
could buy a lady or two to Molloy with for...

574
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:22,213
We want a hat. Well, for a lady, of course.

575
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,704
And everyone said to go to
Miss Molloy's cos she's so pretty.

576
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,780
I mean her hats are so pretty.

577
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:34,606
And what sort of hat
would Mrs. Hackl be liking?

578
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:37,633
Oh, no, Miss Molloy, there is no Mrs. Hackl.

579
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,981
Yes, there is. Your mother.

580
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,705
She didn't mean that.

581
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:47,534
- Did you, Miss Molloy?
- Now, this lady friend of yours,

582
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,456
couldn't she come in with you
someday and choose the hat herself?

583
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,904
Impossible. There is no lady friend.

584
00:42:54,896 --> 00:42:58,049
But I thought you said that
you were coming here to choose...

585
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,616
- I mean, she's Barnaby's.
- Huh? What?

586
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,142
Yes, but she lives in Yonkers and she said
to pick out something reasonable.

587
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,754
- Under a dollar.
- Don't be silly, Barnaby.

588
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,777
Money's no object with us. None at all.

589
00:43:12,503 --> 00:43:16,573
Oh, this is my assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay. Mr. Hackl. Mr. Tucker.

590
00:43:16,876 --> 00:43:20,182
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Afternoon ma'am.

591
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:29,310
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker, did you say Yonkers?

592
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,036
Yes, ma'am, we're from Yonkers.

593
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:33,994
Well, are you?

594
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:40,201
Yes. And, forgive me for saying this,
but you should see Yonkers, Miss Molloy.

595
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:44,773
Well, perhaps you and your gentleman
friend here in New York might like to see it.

596
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:48,029
Some say it's the most
beautiful town in the world.

597
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:50,940
- That's what they say.
- So I've heard.

598
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:54,051
But I'm afraid I don't have
a gentleman friend here in New York.

599
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:57,616
You don't? Barnaby, she doesn't
have a gentleman friend.

600
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:02,382
Hey, that's too bad. You know, if you
should happen to have a Sunday free...

601
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:06,409
You're Catholic, aren't you? Don't let that
worry you. I'd be willing to change.

602
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,631
If you're free in the near future, I'd...

603
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:15,228
Well, <i>we'd</i> like to show you Yonkers
from top to bottom.

604
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:16,882
It's very historic.

605
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:20,059
As a matter of fact, I might
be there sooner than you think.

606
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:22,905
- This Sunday?
- I have a friend who lives in Yonkers.

607
00:44:23,048 --> 00:44:24,739
- You do?
- Perhaps you know him.

608
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:25,969
I do?

609
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,998
It's always so foolish to ask
in cases like that, isn't it?

610
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:33,528
Why should you know him?
It's a Mr. Vandergelder.

611
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:35,255
Mr. Vandergelder? Oh!

612
00:44:35,745 --> 00:44:38,398
- Horace Vandergelder?
- Of Vandergelder's Hay and Feed?

613
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,584
- Yes. Do you know him?
-  Oh, no! No!

614
00:44:42,651 --> 00:44:43,764
No, no, no, no, no, no...

615
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:47,337
As a matter of fact, he's coming here
to see me this very afternoon.

616
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:49,174
- Coming here?
- This afternoon?

617
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,398
Cornelius! Cornelius, look!

618
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:54,239
It's a wolf trap.

619
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:56,044
Look out!

620
00:44:57,765 --> 00:45:00,187
- Begging your pardon.
- What are you doing?

621
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:03,793
- We'll explain later. Help us just this once.
- Come out of there this minute.

622
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:06,213
We're as innocent as can be, Miss Molloy.

623
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:10,779
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker, I insist that
you both come out or I'll be forced to...

624
00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:13,224
Mr. Vandergelder, how nice to see you.

625
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:17,185
- And Dolly Levi, what a surprise.
- Irene, my darling, how well you look.

626
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:20,056
- You must be in love.
- Afternoon, Miss Molloy.

627
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:23,053
What a pleasure to have you
in New York, Mr. Vandergelder.

628
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:26,580
Yes, Yonkers lies up there decimated today.

629
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:29,374
We thought we'd pay you a little visit, Irene.

630
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,143
Unless it's inconvenient?

631
00:45:31,215 --> 00:45:34,859
Inconvenient? Whatever gave you that idea?

632
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:39,933
Mr. Vandergelder thought he saw two
customers in the shop. Two, uh, men?

633
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:44,033
Men? In a ladies' hat shop?

634
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:48,940
Come, let's go into my workroom.
I'm so eager for you to see it.

635
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:52,240
- I've already seen it twice.
- But I need your advice.

636
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:56,460
Advice from Mr. Vandergelder. The whole
city should hear this and grow rich.

637
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:59,686
Advice is cheap. It's what comes
gift-wrapped that counts.

638
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:04,284
- I have never heard it put more beautifully.
- Thank you, Mr. Vandergelder.

639
00:46:04,397 --> 00:46:08,587
Chocolate-covered peanuts. Unshelled.
They're the expensive kind.

640
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:12,918
- Why don't we open them in the workroom?
- I've come here today

641
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,456
because I've important
business to discuss with you,

642
00:46:15,944 --> 00:46:18,748
just as soon as Mrs. Levi says goodbye.

643
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:22,090
Pay no attention to me. I'm just browsing.

644
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,848
Business, Mr. Vandergelder?
The hay and feed business?

645
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,030
- Well, not exactly.
- A new hat shop in Yonkers?

646
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:30,986
I hear it's a very beautiful city
and quite historic, according...

647
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:37,895
Yes, go on. Who's been telling you
about Yonkers, may I ask?

648
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:40,005
Nobody. A friend.

649
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:41,684
What friend?

650
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:44,335
Well, you see, he...

651
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:49,130
- He?
- Yes, uh... he...

652
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,243
- H is name, Miss Molloy?
- What?

653
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:52,818
His name?

654
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,415
Oh, I believe it was... is...
Mr. Cornelius Hackl of Yonkers.

655
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:03,052
- Cornelius Hackl?
- Yes. Do you know him?

656
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,546
- He's my head clerk.
- He is?

657
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,075
He's been with me for ten years.
Where would you have known him?

658
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,147
Ah, just one of those chance meetings.

659
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:13,720
Yes, oh, yes, one of those chance meetings.

660
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:17,785
Chance meetings? Cornelius Hackl has
no right to chance meetings. Where was it?

661
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,237
Really, it's very unlike you
to question me in such a way.

662
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:24,725
Well, the truth might as well
come out now as later.

663
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,535
Your head clerk is
better known than you think.

664
00:47:26,604 --> 00:47:27,717
Nonsense.

665
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:29,757
He's here all the time. He goes everywhere.

666
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,129
He's well-liked. Everybody
knows Cornelius Hackl.

667
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:37,006
He never comes here. He works all day and
then goes to sleep in the bran room at nine.

668
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:40,416
- So you think, but it's not true.
- Dolly Levi, you are mistaken.

669
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:41,795
Horace Vandergelder,

670
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:45,058
you keep your nose so deep in your
accounts you don't know what goes on.

671
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:48,285
By day, Cornelius Hackl
is your faithful, trusted clerk,

672
00:47:48,393 --> 00:47:51,927
but by night... oh, by night...
He leads a double life, that is all.

673
00:47:51,998 --> 00:47:56,036
Why, he is... why, he's...
why, he's here... at the opera.

674
00:47:56,103 --> 00:47:59,486
At the great restaurants,
in all the fashionable homes.

675
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:02,399
He's even at the Harmonia Gardens
three times a week.

676
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:06,541
The fact is, Mr. Vandergelder, he is
the wittiest, the gayest, the naughtiest,

677
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:12,026
most delightful man in New York City.
He's <i>the</i> famous Cornelius Hackl.

678
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:18,164
It ain't the same man. If I thought Cornelius
Hackl came to New York, I'd discharge him.

679
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:20,812
Who took the horses out of Jenny Lind's
carriage and pulled her through the streets?

680
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:27,062
Who dressed up as a waiter and took
an oyster and dropped it right down...?

681
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,594
- It's too wicked. I can't say it.
- Say it!

682
00:48:29,669 --> 00:48:33,084
- No, but it was Cornelius Hackl.
- Where'd he get the money?

683
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,160
- Oh, he's very rich.
- Rich? I keep his money in my old safe.

684
00:48:36,228 --> 00:48:38,848
He has $145. 36

685
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:41,909
Oh, you are killing me.
He is one of <i>the</i> Hackls.

686
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,361
- <i>The</i> Hackls?
- Yes, they built the Raritan Canal.

687
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:46,554
- Then why work for me?
- Well, I'll tell ya.

688
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,778
I don't wanna hear it. I have
a headache. It ain't the same man.

689
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,491
He sleeps in my bran room.
I just made him my chief clerk.

690
00:48:53,568 --> 00:48:58,750
If you had sense, you'd make him a partner.
Irene, I can see you're quite taken with him.

691
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:00,590
But I only met him once.

692
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,322
Now, don't you be thinking of marrying him.

693
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:06,390
- Darling, what are you saying?
- He breaks hearts like hickory nuts.

694
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,149
-  Who?
- Cornelius Hackl.

695
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,568
Miss Molloy, how long
has he been calling on you?

696
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:15,787
Mr. Vandergelder, suppose I were to tell you
that he has not been calling on me?

697
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,585
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Minnie.

698
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:27,258
- Aaagh!
- Stop singing.

699
00:49:27,325 --> 00:49:28,984
- There's a man!
- That's not amusing.

700
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:30,902
And we don't wish to be interrupted.

701
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,621
Go back to the workroom
immediately. Immediately.

702
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:38,306
- The poor dear is tired from overwork.
- If there's a man in there, we'll get him out!

703
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,866
- Whoever you are, come out of there!
- Do you realise what you're saying?

704
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,240
- I certainly do.
- Now just a minute.

705
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:49,310
Before you make another move or say
another word that you might regret,

706
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:50,927
- allow me.
- Dolly.

707
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,533
Stand back.

708
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:04,996
There, you see? So much for this nonsense
about that darling girl hiding a man in there.

709
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:08,572
I think we'll just forget
you ever said it. It's forgotten.

710
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,139
Because there's nobody in there.

711
00:50:11,862 --> 00:50:13,782
- Atchoo!
- God bless you.

712
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:25,529
Miss Molloy?

713
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,555
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder,
there <i>is</i> a man in there.

714
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:32,846
- I see.
- There also happens to be an explanation.

715
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:37,643
For the present, I think I should just thank
you for your visit and say good afternoon.

716
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:40,978
Atchoo!

717
00:50:44,046 --> 00:50:46,589
- Another?
- Another.

718
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,535
Good Lord, the whole room is crawling
with men. Irene, darling, congratulations.

719
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:57,630
Miss Molloy, I shan't trouble you
again. And I hope vice versa.

720
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:01,585
Horace, where are you going?

721
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:06,415
To march in the 14th Street parade
with the kind of people I can trust.

722
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:08,254
700 men.

723
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,628
Shut up!

724
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,970
Now.

725
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:34,799
- Have you met Miss Minnie Fay?
- Leave my shop or I'll call Officer Gogarty.

726
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:36,566
Irene, there's no fun in the jailhouse.

727
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,131
Everybody, don't talk at once.

728
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:42,553
- Just because you're rich...
- Don't deny it.

729
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:45,166
Doesn't mean you shouldn't
make up for this.

730
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,615
- We'll do anything.
- This is Cornelius Hackl.

731
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:50,568
- We've already met. How do you do?
- Jail is absolutely out.

732
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:53,564
- Cornelius, explain to her.
- I'm Cornelius Hackl.

733
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:56,175
- It seems to me...
- Yes, the only way to make up for it...

734
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,971
Irene, send for the law at once.

735
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,038
You can have them put away
for years on a charge like this.

736
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:03,491
Help, police! Only,
have dinner with them first.

737
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:05,947
That's to show that
you tried to settle amicably.

738
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:09,209
That's how to do it.
Dinner first, life imprisonment later.

739
00:52:09,284 --> 00:52:13,277
It'll be a lovely evening. Who knows what'll
happen before you send them off to jail?

740
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:15,732
- Mr. Hackl?
- Oh, by all means.

741
00:52:15,805 --> 00:52:19,952
- It's what we had in mind all along.
- Minnie, we've been respectable for years.

742
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:22,981
Now we're in disgrace,
we might as well make the most of it.

743
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:25,980
- It is the only sensible thing to do.
- Cornelius...

744
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:30,431
Now, I know a doughnut shop in the station.

745
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:33,378
Doughnut shop? Certainly not.

746
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,103
We want a fine dinner in a fashionable place.

747
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:39,786
And I know just the place.
The Harmonia Gardens on 14th Street.

748
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,509
- Your favourite restaurant.
- Wait a minute...

749
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:46,650
The finest food that money can buy and a
lovely orchestra. A polka contest tonight.

750
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:50,488
- Ooh, dancing.
- Rudolph will give you the best table.

751
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,713
- We could never go there.
- It sounds marvellous.

752
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:57,513
Come, Minnie. We'll close the shop
and take the whole afternoon off.

753
00:52:57,618 --> 00:52:59,538
Oh, I mean, we could never...

754
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:03,450
Don't misunderstand me,
it isn't the money or anything...

755
00:53:03,526 --> 00:53:05,752
It's the... the...

756
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,401
What, Mr. Hackl?

757
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:11,094
It's the dancing. You see, I don't know how.

758
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,652
And they have contests
at the Harmonia... whatever it is.

759
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:19,299
You said so yourself, and I don't know how.
It would take weeks, months, years to learn.

760
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:25,243
"Mrs. Dolly Levi. 28¾-year-old
chief clerks taught how to d..."

761
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:28,850
Now, you just put one arm
here and one arm there.

762
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:31,386
It's no use. I have no sense of rhythm.

763
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,110
Absolutely no sense of rhythm

764
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:36,910
is the primary requirement
for learning by the Levi method.

765
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:40,207
Just give me five minutes.
I'll have you dancing in the streets.

766
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:42,424
the waltz kick turn.

767
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,959
Right foot, touch, left foot, touch,
under, back, around, touch.

768
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:49,369
Back, through, around, behind.
Out, over... release... unfurl!

769
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:52,826
Oh, oh, that's just
absolutely wonderful, Mr. Hackl.

770
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,585
When I think of the lucky women
who'll find heaven in your arms!

771
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:58,772
I think we'll go back to lesson one, shall we?

772
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:02,261
Put your hand on her waist

773
00:54:02,985 --> 00:54:04,262
and stand,

774
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,662
with her right in your left hand.

775
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,933
And...

776
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:15,846
One. That's right.

777
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:20,676
And one, two, three.

778
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:21,941
Ah!

779
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:26,200
One, two, three.

780
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:32,337
Oh, no. This one. And one, two, three.

781
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:36,863
One, two, three.

782
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:39,822
Look! I'm dancing!

783
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:44,419
- I was.
- Of course you were, Mr. Hackl.

784
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:52,056
<i>Take the someone whose arms you're in</i>

785
00:54:53,238 --> 00:54:55,703
<i>Hold on to her tight</i>

786
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:57,689
<i>And spin</i>

787
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:00,568
<i>And one, two, three</i>

788
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:02,333
<i>One, two, three</i>

789
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:04,021
<i>One, two, three</i>

790
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,282
Look! I'm dancing!

791
00:55:06,587 --> 00:55:08,890
Ah! Come here.

792
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:13,266
<i>Turn around and turn around,
try floating through the air</i>

793
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:16,335
<i>Can 't you be a little more aesthetic?</i>

794
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,857
<i>Don't you think my dancing
has a polish and a flair?</i>

795
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:23,817
<i>The word I think I'd use is athletic.</i>

796
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,846
<i>Well, my heart is about to burst</i>

797
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,377
<i>My head is about to pop</i>

798
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:37,087
<i>And now that I'm dancing
who cares if I ever stop?</i>

799
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:38,706
That's wonderful.

800
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,451
Look, everybody!
I, Cornelius Hackl, sport, I'm dancing!

801
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:48,331
You're next, Mr. Tucker.

802
00:55:51,738 --> 00:55:55,469
<i>Glide and step</i>

803
00:55:56,034 --> 00:56:01,141
<i>And then step and glide</i>

804
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:05,091
And everyone stand aside!

805
00:56:05,163 --> 00:56:09,812
Not... not yet, Mr. Tucker. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three, one...

806
00:56:09,882 --> 00:56:13,145
- Look! <i>He's</i> dancing!
- I think he's holdin' out on us.

807
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:17,292
<i>You could learn to polka
if you worked a week or so</i>

808
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:20,668
<i>Or the tango filled with passion seething</i>

809
00:56:21,122 --> 00:56:24,886
<i>I might join the chorus
of the Castle Garden show</i>

810
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:27,262
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker,
keep breathing.

811
00:56:27,758 --> 00:56:30,868
<i>For my heart is about to burst</i>

812
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,327
<i>My head is about to pop</i>

813
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,846
<i>And now that we're dancing
who cares if we ever stop?</i>

814
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:43,688
Oh.

815
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:43,411
<i>When there's someone you hardly know</i>

816
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,631
<i>And wish you were closer to</i>

817
00:58:46,738 --> 00:58:53,919
<i>Remember that he can be
near to you while you're dancing</i>

818
00:58:55,217 --> 00:58:59,287
<i>Though you've only just said hello</i>

819
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:06,964
<i>She's suddenly someone who
can make all your daydreams appear to you</i>

820
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:10,142
<i>While you're dancing</i>

821
00:59:11,788 --> 00:59:14,670
<i>Make the music weave a spell</i>

822
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:17,897
<i>Whirl away your worry</i>

823
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:22,037
<i>Things look almost twice as well</i>

824
00:59:22,107 --> 00:59:24,912
<i>When they're slightly blurry</i>

825
00:59:24,985 --> 00:59:28,444
<i>As around and around you go</i>

826
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:31,509
<i>Your spirits will hit the top</i>

827
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:35,805
<i>And now that we're dancing
who cares if we ever stop?</i>

828
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:39,262
<i>One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three</i>

829
00:59:39,332 --> 00:59:43,521
<i>And now that we're dancing
who cares if we ever stop?</i>

830
01:02:15,037 --> 01:02:16,151
Dolly!

831
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:21,066
Dolly, Cornelius is taking us to see
the parade. Everyone will be marching.

832
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:26,516
- Come on, Mrs. Levi.
- Dolly, the world is full of wonderful things.

833
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:32,574
Hurry, before the parade passes by!

834
01:02:33,872 --> 01:02:35,913
Yes, I will. I will.

835
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:49,876
Before the parade passes by.

836
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:55,510
<i>Before it all moves on</i>

837
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:58,923
<i>And only I'm left</i>

838
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:06,910
<i>Before the parade passes by</i>

839
01:03:08,435 --> 01:03:10,585
<i>I've got to get in step</i>

840
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:14,734
<i>While there's still time left</i>

841
01:03:16,146 --> 01:03:23,172
<i>I'm ready to move out in front</i>

842
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:31,039
<i>Life without life has no reason or rhyme left</i>

843
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,673
<i>With the rest of them</i>

844
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:39,440
<i>With the best of them</i>

845
01:03:40,045 --> 01:03:47,682
<i>I wanna hold my head up high</i>

846
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:51,249
<i>I need a goal again</i>

847
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:54,628
<i>I need a drive again</i>

848
01:03:54,698 --> 01:04:02,871
<i>I wanna feel my heart coming alive again</i>

849
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:12,308
<i>Before the parade</i>

850
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:18,720
<i>Passes by</i>

851
01:04:26,998 --> 01:04:29,573
Ephraim, let me go.

852
01:04:31,678 --> 01:04:33,598
It's been long enough, Ephraim.

853
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:43,650
Every night, just like you'd want me to, I've
put out the cat, made myself a rum toddy,

854
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:49,363
and, before I went to bed, said a little prayer
thanking God that I was independent.

855
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:55,117
That no one else's life
was mixed up with mine.

856
01:04:57,993 --> 01:04:59,423
But lately, Ephraim,

857
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:02,566
I've begun to realise that

858
01:05:04,285 --> 01:05:09,118
for a long time I have not shed one tear.

859
01:05:10,882 --> 01:05:14,222
Nor have I been for one moment

860
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:17,521
outrageously happy.

861
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:24,159
Now, Horace Vandergelder, he's always
saying the world is full of fools.

862
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:29,299
And in a way, he's right, isn't he?
I mean, himself, Cornelius, Irene, myself...

863
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:35,399
But there comes a time when you've got to
decide if you want to be a fool among fools,

864
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:38,008
or a fool alone.

865
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,770
Well, I have made that decision, Ephraim,

866
01:05:42,377 --> 01:05:47,527
but I would feel so much better about it
if... if you could just give me a sign,

867
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:50,059
any kind of a sign that you approve.

868
01:05:51,008 --> 01:05:52,470
I'm going back, Ephraim.

869
01:05:53,271 --> 01:05:55,998
I've decided to join the human race again.

870
01:05:56,685 --> 01:06:01,104
And, Ephraim, I want you to give me away.

871
01:06:02,555 --> 01:06:07,509
<i>Before the parade passes by</i>

872
01:06:07,772 --> 01:06:12,343
<i>I've got to go and taste Saturday's high life</i>

873
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,369
<i>Before the parade passes by</i>

874
01:06:17,822 --> 01:06:22,241
<i>I've got to get some life back into my life</i>

875
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:26,380
<i>I'm ready to move out in front</i>

876
01:06:26,952 --> 01:06:31,099
<i>I've had enough of just passing by life</i>

877
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:33,092
<i>With the rest of them</i>

878
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,168
<i>With the best of them</i>

879
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:39,002
<i>I can hold my head up high</i>

880
01:06:39,073 --> 01:06:41,190
<i>For I've got a goal again</i>

881
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,105
<i>I've got a drive again</i>

882
01:06:43,179 --> 01:06:47,096
<i>I'm gonna feel my heart coming alive again</i>

883
01:06:47,206 --> 01:06:50,392
<i>Before the parade</i>

884
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,879
<i>Passes by</i>

885
01:08:31,548 --> 01:08:34,625
Waah! Waah!

886
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,092
Present arms!

887
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,356
Present arms!

888
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:18,664
Dolly Levi!

889
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:20,502
Hi!

890
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:22,691
Gussie Granger?

891
01:09:23,411 --> 01:09:25,223
What are you doing here?

892
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,669
Earning an honest dollar,
which is more than I've made

893
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,895
on a legitimate stage in two years.

894
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:32,665
Pity on you. But the meat packers' float?

895
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:36,307
Ha! Listen, if there was more money
in it, I'd play one of the pigs.

896
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:54,452
I came here for some privacy.

897
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:58,708
I owe you an apology and I didn't
want to let it go another minute.

898
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,592
You owe me the fee I gave you

899
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,082
for getting me tangled up
with that collector of men's hats.

900
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:06,000
Yes, Irene, she was
a disappointment, darling girl.

901
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:09,800
I'll have you know the confectioner
gave me back every cent for the peanuts.

902
01:10:09,866 --> 01:10:12,408
I'm sorry. I never give cash refunds.

903
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:16,664
However, being a woman who believes
in giving service that's been paid for,

904
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:20,421
- I've arranged to make it up to you.
- Let me make one thing clear.

905
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:24,104
You have been discharged as my
marriage broker. I have no use for one.

906
01:10:24,175 --> 01:10:26,902
From now on, you are just
a woman like anyone else.

907
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:29,353
- I am?
- And I'm just a man like anyone else,

908
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:34,111
and, like anyone else, I'll do what I can
to avoid the introductions you specialise in.

909
01:10:34,187 --> 01:10:39,107
Well, I can understand your feelings,
and I am here today, marching beside you,

910
01:10:39,174 --> 01:10:43,593
to assure you that there will be no further
need for my services after dinner tonight.

911
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:48,348
- Dinner?
- 7. 30 at the Harmonia Gardens.

912
01:10:48,418 --> 01:10:50,884
It's all arranged.
Private room. She'll be waiting.

913
01:10:51,525 --> 01:10:55,018
- Who? Who-who-who'll be waiting?
- Who-who-who'll be waiting?

914
01:10:55,094 --> 01:10:57,013
The very rich,
very beautiful lady I referred to

915
01:10:57,088 --> 01:10:59,161
when I saw you in Yonkers this morning.

916
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:02,469
The heiress to a fortune, remember?

917
01:11:05,987 --> 01:11:08,487
I'm not interested. What's her name?

918
01:11:08,558 --> 01:11:10,477
Uh... Ernestina.

919
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,360
I'm not interested. What's her last name?

920
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,464
Simple... uh, Simple. Ernestina Simple.

921
01:11:18,532 --> 01:11:21,074
- Can she cook?
- Can she cook?

922
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,904
Frankly, I never understood why a girl
who could afford every servant around

923
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:28,239
makes all her own meals,
on a solid gold stove.

924
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:32,429
- She's a fool. I'm not interested in fools.
- Neither am I. Good day.

925
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:35,113
- Good day.
- Don't forget. 7. 30, Harmonia Gardens.

926
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,526
And rent some evening clothes. She's fussy.

927
01:11:37,674 --> 01:11:40,936
Dolly Levi, you are
a damned exasperating woman!

928
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:46,229
Why, Horace Vandergelder, that is
the nicest thing you have ever said to me.

929
01:11:52,135 --> 01:11:56,129
<i>When the parade passes by</i>

930
01:11:56,201 --> 01:12:00,119
<i>Listen and hear
that brass harmony growing</i>

931
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:04,032
<i>When the parade passes by</i>

932
01:12:04,104 --> 01:12:08,098
<i>Pardon me if my old spirit is showing</i>

933
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:12,054
<i>All of those lights over there</i>

934
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:15,810
<i>Seem to be telling me where I'm going</i>

935
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:18,146
<i>When the whistles blow</i>

936
01:12:18,221 --> 01:12:20,140
<i>And the cymbals crash</i>

937
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:24,056
<i>And the sparklers light the sky</i>

938
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:25,972
<i>I'm gonna raise the roof</i>

939
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:28,043
<i>I'm gonna carry on</i>

940
01:12:28,156 --> 01:12:30,152
<i>Give me an old trombone</i>

941
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:31,919
<i>Give me an old baton</i>

942
01:12:31,992 --> 01:12:35,407
<i>Before the parade</i>

943
01:12:36,173 --> 01:12:44,385
<i>Passes by</i>

944
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:26,113
Cornelius, are you sure
they're just changing their clothes?

945
01:15:26,186 --> 01:15:30,682
- Don't worry, they'll be here.
- I get dressed in less than three minutes.

946
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:34,823
- Women wear more.
- They do?

947
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:37,124
Underneath.

948
01:15:38,194 --> 01:15:40,888
Cornelius, maybe we should
leave while there's time.

949
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:42,767
- Never.
- We've seen everything.

950
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:46,328
The parade, the Statue of Liberty,
the stuffed whale at Barnum's museum.

951
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:50,168
- I could die a happy man now.
- It'll be worth it, no matter what happens.

952
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,739
The worst anybody can do is put us in jail.

953
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:56,232
But as long as we live we'll never forget

954
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:02,062
the night we took Irene Molloy and
Minnie Fay to dinner at Harmonia Gardens,

955
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:05,932
- on less than a dollar.
- Cornelius, wake up.

956
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:08,352
And there's another reason
we can't go back.

957
01:16:08,423 --> 01:16:10,802
One more thing we promised to do

958
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:13,574
before we go and turn into
a couple of Vandergelders.

959
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:17,449
Cornelius! You're not thinking
of kissing Miss Molloy?

960
01:16:18,168 --> 01:16:20,514
- Maybe.
- She'll scream.

961
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,391
Barnaby, you don't know
anything about women.

962
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:28,758
- Only that we can't afford 'em.
- You should know that everyone except us

963
01:16:28,832 --> 01:16:31,834
goes through life
kissing right and left all the time.

964
01:16:33,436 --> 01:16:34,593
They do?

965
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,314
Yes.

966
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:39,653
I often wondered about that.

967
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:49,674
- Smile, Barnaby.
- I'm smiling.

968
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,352
- Look rich and gay and charming.
- I'm looking gay and charming.

969
01:16:56,799 --> 01:16:57,988
Hello.

970
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:03,597
- Here we are.
- Hello.

971
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:07,891
Cornelius.

972
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,457
Haa... I'm pleased to meet you, Miss Molloy.

973
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:14,717
No last names. After all we've been through
together this afternoon,

974
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,558
it's Irene and Minnie.

975
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:19,481
Irene.

976
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,892
- Ohh...
- Ohhh...

977
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,462
- Does that count, Cornelius?
- I don't think so.

978
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:27,999
Count?

979
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:31,368
You see, we were counting here,
while we were waiting.

980
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,323
I hear all rich people do nothing
but count their money.

981
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:39,119
I'm so hungry. Why don't we go in here
and have some hors d'oeuvres first?

982
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,494
- No, no, no.
- It's very fashionable.

983
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:44,569
- It would spoil our appetites.
- Or we could have an apéritif.

984
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:48,676
It's out of the question. Barnaby and I
don't agree with that sort of thing.

985
01:17:48,743 --> 01:17:52,354
- But all those people do.
- Well, they simply don't know that a...

986
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:57,611
...a... péritif is no longer considered elegant.

987
01:17:58,064 --> 01:18:00,946
- Oh, it isn't?
- Hasn't been for years.

988
01:18:01,019 --> 01:18:04,553
In that case, it's on to Harmonia
Gardens for dinner. Call a hack.

989
01:18:04,624 --> 01:18:07,549
- Hack?
- All my life I've wanted to ride in a hack.

990
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:10,961
- Oh, there's one. Yoo-hoo!
- No, no. We can't do that.

991
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,910
I mean, it isn't the money or anything

992
01:18:15,827 --> 01:18:21,971
it's just that, nowadays, really
elegant people never take hacks.

993
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:24,693
- Hacks is out.
- They all go by streetcar.

994
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:26,806
Then, by all means, we go by streetcar.

995
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,418
I've been elegant all my life
and I never knew it.

996
01:18:29,484 --> 01:18:33,248
Of course, if you really want
to be really elegant...

997
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,477
- Oh, we do.
- We do.

998
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:37,202
You'll walk.

999
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,796
<i>Yes, New York</i>

1000
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:49,673
<i>Barnaby and Cornelius</i>

1001
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:55,305
<i>All the guests of Mr. Hackl
are feeling great and look spectacular</i>

1002
01:18:55,379 --> 01:18:57,071
<i>What a knack</i>

1003
01:18:57,144 --> 01:19:01,061
<i>There is to that acting like a born aristocrat</i>

1004
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:03,207
<i>We got elegance</i>

1005
01:19:03,282 --> 01:19:06,009
<i>If you ain't got elegance</i>

1006
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,923
<i>You can never, ever carry it off</i>

1007
01:19:21,005 --> 01:19:23,810
<i>All who are well-bred agree</i>

1008
01:19:23,882 --> 01:19:26,609
<i>Minnie Fay has pedigree</i>

1009
01:19:26,682 --> 01:19:29,410
<i>Exercise your wildest whims tonight</i>

1010
01:19:29,483 --> 01:19:32,255
<i>We are out with Diamond Jims tonight</i>

1011
01:19:32,323 --> 01:19:35,126
<i>Could they be misleading us?</i>

1012
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,971
<i>Silver spoons were used for feeding us</i>

1013
01:19:38,038 --> 01:19:40,035
<i>We got elegance</i>

1014
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,958
<i>If you ain't got elegance</i>

1015
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:47,172
<i>You can never, ever carry it off</i>

1016
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,292
<i>Snobs that slobs</i>

1017
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,936
<i>Throw roses at. We look down</i>

1018
01:20:05,007 --> 01:20:06,088
<i>Our noses at</i>

1019
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:08,886
<i>Pity all the other girls around</i>

1020
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:11,840
<i>When I swing my perfect pearls around</i>

1021
01:20:11,913 --> 01:20:14,531
<i>Snubbing folks is chic to us</i>

1022
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:17,446
<i>Sometimes we don't even speak to us</i>

1023
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,197
<i>If you ain't got elegance</i>

1024
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,959
<i>You can never, ever carry it off</i>

1025
01:20:26,145 --> 01:20:27,803
If you please.

1026
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:50,860
<i>Middle class don't speak of it</i>

1027
01:20:50,928 --> 01:20:53,580
<i>Savoir-faire, we reek of it</i>

1028
01:20:53,652 --> 01:20:56,074
<i>Some were born with rags and patches</i>

1029
01:20:56,145 --> 01:20:59,255
<i>But we use dollar bills for matches and</i>

1030
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:02,024
<i>Vanderbilt kowtows to us</i>

1031
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:04,895
<i>JP Morgan scrapes and bows to us</i>

1032
01:21:04,968 --> 01:21:07,010
<i>We got elegance</i>

1033
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:10,810
<i>We were born with elegance</i>

1034
01:21:11,337 --> 01:21:13,879
<i>I behave like Walter Raleigh</i>

1035
01:21:13,946 --> 01:21:16,749
<i>When the streets are full of mud</i>

1036
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:18,978
<i>And the bluest huckleberry</i>

1037
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:21,776
<i>Isn't bluer than my blood</i>

1038
01:21:22,232 --> 01:21:25,080
<i>Have you noticed when I hold my cup</i>

1039
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:27,526
<i>The saucer never moves</i>

1040
01:21:28,178 --> 01:21:31,179
<i>And the way I keep my pinkie up</i>

1041
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:36,277
<i>Indubitably proves that</i>

1042
01:21:36,387 --> 01:21:38,428
<i>We got elegance</i>

1043
01:21:38,497 --> 01:21:41,150
<i>We got built-in elegance</i>

1044
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,875
<i>And with elegance</i>

1045
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:44,835
<i>Elegance, elegance, elegance</i>

1046
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:46,978
<i>Elegance</i>

1047
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:51,397
<i>We'll carry it off</i>

1048
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:47,935
<i>Horace, Horace Vandergelder</i>

1049
01:22:48,817 --> 01:22:53,007
<i>Mrs. Horace Vandergelder</i>

1050
01:22:54,264 --> 01:22:58,302
<i>Just leave everything to me</i>

1051
01:23:00,134 --> 01:23:04,357
<i>Though it won't be like the first time</i>

1052
01:23:05,121 --> 01:23:09,879
<i>How can it be like the first time?</i>

1053
01:23:11,259 --> 01:23:17,828
<i>But why does it have to be?</i>

1054
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:26,725
<i>Don't look for shooting stars</i>

1055
01:23:28,215 --> 01:23:32,329
<i>For love is only love</i>

1056
01:23:33,471 --> 01:23:38,267
<i>You touch, and still you touch the ground</i>

1057
01:23:44,904 --> 01:23:50,512
<i>Don't listen for those bells</i>

1058
01:23:50,581 --> 01:23:56,037
<i>For love is only love</i>

1059
01:23:57,026 --> 01:24:01,216
<i>And if it's love you've found</i>

1060
01:24:01,284 --> 01:24:08,540
<i>Your heart won't hear a sound</i>

1061
01:24:10,261 --> 01:24:16,176
<i>And when you hold his hand</i>

1062
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:20,814
<i>You only hold his hand</i>

1063
01:24:22,115 --> 01:24:28,215
<i>The violins are all a bluff</i>

1064
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:34,090
<i>But if you're really wise</i>

1065
01:24:34,659 --> 01:24:40,498
<i>The silence of his eyes</i>

1066
01:24:40,568 --> 01:24:45,489
<i>Will tell you love is only love</i>

1067
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:53,304
<i>And it's wonderful enough</i>

1068
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:02,099
<i>Without the shooting stars</i>

1069
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:07,845
<i>Without the sound of bells</i>

1070
01:25:08,534 --> 01:25:13,139
<i>Without the violins</i>

1071
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:19,470
<i>Love is wonderful</i>

1072
01:25:20,619 --> 01:25:27,875
<i>Enough</i>

1073
01:25:54,723 --> 01:25:56,764
Good evening. Good evening.

1074
01:25:59,825 --> 01:26:01,790
Straighten up. Walk erect.

1075
01:26:03,661 --> 01:26:05,964
Pleasure. Good evening.

1076
01:26:06,846 --> 01:26:08,734
How nice to see you.

1077
01:26:10,183 --> 01:26:13,566
Psst! No expression. Let the food smile.

1078
01:26:14,787 --> 01:26:16,675
And how are you this evening?

1079
01:26:17,971 --> 01:26:19,783
Charming, charming.

1080
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:21,779
You! You there!

1081
01:26:22,306 --> 01:26:23,997
Come up here at once.

1082
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:26,685
Yes, you.

1083
01:26:28,368 --> 01:26:30,790
How dare you keep me
standing here this long?

1084
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:34,593
As soon as Mr. Vandergelder arrives,
you will be seated, Miss Simple.

1085
01:26:34,659 --> 01:26:36,351
Now look here, <i>garçon.</i>

1086
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:39,654
My name is Rudolph. Rudolph Reisenweber.

1087
01:26:39,723 --> 01:26:42,986
And why, may I ask,
can I not wait at the table?

1088
01:26:43,061 --> 01:26:44,904
Please. Please.

1089
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:50,161
Harmonia Gardens does not
consider it proper, a lady alone.

1090
01:26:50,235 --> 01:26:54,501
- Perhaps if you'll let me take your wrap.
- Ohh! Don't touch me.

1091
01:26:55,989 --> 01:26:57,266
Where?

1092
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,334
- If you will excuse me.
- Certainly not.

1093
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:05,125
Yes? What can I do for you?

1094
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:07,923
How are ya, Adolf? How's my old friend?

1095
01:27:07,996 --> 01:27:10,801
- I am Rudolph.
- Oh, of course.

1096
01:27:11,717 --> 01:27:13,223
Rudolph.

1097
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:16,867
We'd like a little something
to eat. You know?

1098
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,510
In what name is the reservation, please?

1099
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:23,460
- Reservation?
- I'm afraid there is nothing available.

1100
01:27:23,533 --> 01:27:25,649
- Come on, let's go.
- Do you know who he is?

1101
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,569
This is Cornelius Hackl. <i>The</i> Cornelius Hackl.

1102
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:32,519
- Tell him about the Rockefellers.
- The Rockefellers? I see.

1103
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:34,965
Look, I know a little place up the block.

1104
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:40,454
I think I have something. Yes, I think
I have something. Follow me, if you will.

1105
01:27:52,613 --> 01:27:54,150
Dining room number two.

1106
01:27:54,568 --> 01:27:57,035
- It is the last one. Very private.
- It is?

1107
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:58,759
- Very exclusive.
- It is?

1108
01:27:58,827 --> 01:28:01,675
- Very fashionable.
- Don't say another word.

1109
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:03,707
And very expensive.

1110
01:28:04,275 --> 01:28:05,781
That was the word.

1111
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,040
- How beautiful!
- How elegant!

1112
01:28:10,106 --> 01:28:11,339
How much?

1113
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:13,985
Cornelius, I thought you said
everyone knew you.

1114
01:28:14,057 --> 01:28:16,523
Oh, don't worry. They will after tonight.

1115
01:28:19,505 --> 01:28:23,149
She is? She is? I don't believe it!

1116
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:26,184
Eight o'clock, table for two, and a chicken.

1117
01:28:26,257 --> 01:28:30,327
Mrs. Dolly Levi coming here
after such a long absence!

1118
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,092
It is too happy to be true.

1119
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:33,899
That's the message she told me to give you.

1120
01:28:33,967 --> 01:28:35,931
Who? Who are these people?

1121
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,539
They look truthful.

1122
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:47,478
If you're gonna spend all evening acting
like a scared rabbit, maybe I'll order lettuce.

1123
01:28:47,548 --> 01:28:49,774
Oh, how can you be so brave? It's unfair.

1124
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:52,420
Just try to keep remembering
Mrs. Levi's advice.

1125
01:28:52,689 --> 01:28:56,606
I only wanted to marry you,
not perform in public.

1126
01:28:56,678 --> 01:29:00,094
- There's nobody here who knows us.
- Oh, Ambrose, are you sure?

1127
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:02,592
Sweetheart, have I ever been wrong?

1128
01:29:17,778 --> 01:29:18,967
Sir?

1129
01:29:20,387 --> 01:29:23,158
- Vandergelder's the name.
- Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.

1130
01:29:24,491 --> 01:29:28,104
There's a Miss Ernestina Simple
supposed to be waiting.

1131
01:29:28,175 --> 01:29:29,941
Right there, Mr. Vandergelder.

1132
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:34,510
No, you didn't understand what I said...

1133
01:29:34,581 --> 01:29:38,422
But perfectly. Mr. Vandergelder
is here, Miss Simple.

1134
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:41,143
Yes, so I see.

1135
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:48,090
- Oh, good evening, Miss Simple.
- I hope so, Mr. Vandergelder.

1136
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,348
- All right, my good man.
- Fritz, private dining room number one.

1137
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:55,067
- Follow me, if you will.
- You may take my arm.

1138
01:29:56,677 --> 01:30:01,021
And, unless you are suffering from
a head cold, kindly remove your hat.

1139
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:09,836
<i>Achtung!</i>

1140
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:13,989
I have an important announcement to make.

1141
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:19,744
After an absence of several years, there will
return to the Harmonia Gardens tonight

1142
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:23,499
the lady who always had
the happiest smile, the warmest heart,

1143
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,571
and the largest appetite
in the city of New York.

1144
01:30:26,677 --> 01:30:28,031
- It's Dolly.
- Dolly?

1145
01:30:28,097 --> 01:30:32,014
- Dolly!
-  Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly!

1146
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:33,670
Attention!

1147
01:30:36,153 --> 01:30:40,267
It is therefore my order, as head waiter
of the Harmonia Gardens,

1148
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:42,332
and your supreme commander,

1149
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:49,239
that tonight of all nights our usual lightning
service will be twice as lightning as ever.

1150
01:30:49,696 --> 01:30:50,884
Or else!

1151
01:31:46,664 --> 01:31:51,269
Waiter, write this down. Mock turtle soup,
roast pheasant under glass.

1152
01:31:51,652 --> 01:31:54,761
- Pheasant?
- I'll have the same, and some champagne.

1153
01:31:55,104 --> 01:31:56,872
- Champagne?
- What would you like, sir?

1154
01:31:57,214 --> 01:31:59,178
Six months off for good behaviour?

1155
01:32:52,418 --> 01:32:55,299
What do you mean,
"oysters aren't in season"?

1156
01:32:55,372 --> 01:32:59,213
Anybody can have oysters in season.
I want them out of season.

1157
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,862
They don't have any, Miss Simple.

1158
01:33:01,394 --> 01:33:03,588
Then tell 'em to go out and dig for some.

1159
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,017
Oh!

1160
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:48,590
- Hello again.
- Here we are.

1161
01:35:48,657 --> 01:35:51,352
- We thought something happened.
- Don't worry. It will.

1162
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:56,031
Barnaby, Irene, Minnie,

1163
01:36:59,283 --> 01:37:01,356
I feel so good about everything,

1164
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:03,850
so good about this whole day,

1165
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:08,455
that I am now going to become
an honest man and tell the truth.

1166
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:09,762
Cornelius?

1167
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:14,023
I'd forgotten what strange things
happen to men when they drink.

1168
01:37:15,357 --> 01:37:20,115
If I tell you the truth, will you let me
put my arm around your waist?

1169
01:37:20,843 --> 01:37:24,412
Good heavens! You can do that
even if you lie to me.

1170
01:37:37,147 --> 01:37:39,297
I've never touched a woman before.

1171
01:37:39,411 --> 01:37:41,833
You still haven't. That's my corset.

1172
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:47,898
- You're a wonderful person, Irene.
- Thank you, Cornelius.

1173
01:37:48,886 --> 01:37:51,003
And that's why I have to tell you the truth.

1174
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:53,301
If it'll make you feel better.

1175
01:37:54,257 --> 01:37:57,214
It's all those fancy things
that Mrs. Levi said about me.

1176
01:37:57,633 --> 01:37:59,096
Oh, yes.

1177
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:02,781
Well, they're just not so.

1178
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:05,008
Indeed?

1179
01:38:06,341 --> 01:38:09,145
Irene, I'm not rich.

1180
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:10,906
Not rich?

1181
01:38:11,443 --> 01:38:14,216
I'm not any of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.

1182
01:38:14,283 --> 01:38:17,665
And neither is Barnaby. We're not
sports, we don't know anybody.

1183
01:38:17,773 --> 01:38:20,655
We never come to New York.
We never do anything

1184
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,761
except work for Mr. Vandergelder all day
and clean up the store at night.

1185
01:38:24,755 --> 01:38:27,833
And we wanted so much
to have one day of adventure,

1186
01:38:29,091 --> 01:38:31,469
that we ran away from Yonkers
and told a lot of lies.

1187
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:34,585
Ah, well, look at us.

1188
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:37,498
A pair of penniless pretenders.

1189
01:38:37,837 --> 01:38:40,140
But, Cornelius, I've known that all along.

1190
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:41,565
You have?

1191
01:38:41,635 --> 01:38:44,592
Why else would you have hidden
in my cupboard and under my table?

1192
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:46,510
And made us walk all over New York?

1193
01:38:47,466 --> 01:38:50,161
You're the nicest ladies
a man ever went to jail for.

1194
01:38:50,957 --> 01:38:52,146
Jail?

1195
01:38:52,223 --> 01:38:54,526
We don't have the money
to pay for this dinner.

1196
01:38:54,602 --> 01:39:00,549
Of course you don't. Minnie, show these
two sports what I've got in my purse.

1197
01:39:01,507 --> 01:39:04,508
What a pleasure to know that
selling all those silly hats

1198
01:39:04,959 --> 01:39:07,612
can pay for an evening
as delightful as this one.

1199
01:39:10,752 --> 01:39:12,444
I can't help myself.

1200
01:39:16,047 --> 01:39:17,280
Wow!

1201
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:22,996
I...

1202
01:39:24,985 --> 01:39:28,291
No, no, Minnie, my white
handbag, not that one.

1203
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,581
- My white handbag.
- When we changed for the evening.

1204
01:39:36,034 --> 01:39:37,114
Minnie...

1205
01:39:37,185 --> 01:39:39,759
Only my mad money...
a nickel for the horsecar.

1206
01:39:43,822 --> 01:39:45,665
Would you like your check now, sir?

1207
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:57,712
Take this away, my good man.
Bring us another bottle of champagne.

1208
01:40:06,954 --> 01:40:11,559
- What's this? What are you doing?
- It's eight o'clock. I really must be going.

1209
01:40:12,172 --> 01:40:15,205
Going? You haven't finished
your dinner yet, Miss Simple.

1210
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:17,745
That's expensive.
If I had food like that every night,

1211
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:20,538
I'd be out of business inside a year.

1212
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:25,260
I suggest you have the waiter put it in a bag
and take it home to your horses and pigs.

1213
01:40:25,484 --> 01:40:28,288
I don't have pigs, Miss Simple,
I have chickens,

1214
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,281
and I did not get them
by being extravagant.

1215
01:40:30,778 --> 01:40:34,117
I see no point in this trivial
discussion, Mr. Vandergelder,

1216
01:40:34,191 --> 01:40:36,462
nor in my remaining here any longer,

1217
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:41,759
inasmuch as it is quite clear to me that
you are, if you forgive the expression,

1218
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:46,009
- entirely unsuitable.
- Unsuitable?

1219
01:40:46,085 --> 01:40:51,039
Nevertheless, I will never say a word to
Mrs. Levi about this unfortunate evening.

1220
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:55,066
And I suggest you do likewise
when she arrives here.

1221
01:40:55,176 --> 01:40:58,439
Wait a minute.
Did you say "arrives here"?

1222
01:40:58,591 --> 01:41:00,478
Yes, she planned to join us at eight.

1223
01:41:00,547 --> 01:41:03,275
You may say I left
because I felt sick to my stomach.

1224
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,506
It's quite true, you know.

1225
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,802
Good night.

1226
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:16,238
Any man who goes to a big city
deserves what happens to him.

1227
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:29,252
- He's all yours, honey.
- Good. Mr. Cassidy?

1228
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:32,244
- Yes, Mrs. Levi?
- It's all right now. You can let me out.

1229
01:41:36,877 --> 01:41:38,339
Whoa.

1230
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:44,015
- Mr. Reisenweber, come here! Hurry!
- How often have I told you not to shout?

1231
01:41:44,089 --> 01:41:46,009
- It's her. She's outside.
- You mean...?

1232
01:41:46,084 --> 01:41:48,004
- What's going on?
- Are you sure?

1233
01:41:48,078 --> 01:41:52,192
I know that voice. I heard her.
In a beautiful carriage with two horses.

1234
01:41:52,299 --> 01:41:54,874
- That's her. She's come.
- Who? Who's come?

1235
01:41:54,945 --> 01:41:56,986
A lady. You wouldn't know her. Mrs. Levi.

1236
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,627
- Is it true?
- Yes, it's Dolly. Tell the men to get ready.

1237
01:42:02,695 --> 01:42:06,995
- You saw her?
- In a long carriage pulled by four horses.

1238
01:42:07,069 --> 01:42:08,879
It's like old times.

1239
01:42:10,482 --> 01:42:13,178
Reisenweber. Rudolph!

1240
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:15,550
Rudy!

1241
01:42:16,812 --> 01:42:18,046
She is here.

1242
01:42:55,981 --> 01:43:00,356
<i>Hello, Rudy</i>

1243
01:43:01,122 --> 01:43:05,650
<i>Well, hello, Harry</i>

1244
01:43:06,454 --> 01:43:15,053
<i>It's so nice to be back home where I belong</i>

1245
01:43:16,966 --> 01:43:22,607
<i>You are lookin' swell, Manny</i>

1246
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,513
<i>I can tell, Danny</i>

1247
01:43:28,858 --> 01:43:33,812
<i>You're still glowin', you're still crowin'</i>

1248
01:43:33,883 --> 01:43:36,154
<i>You're still</i>

1249
01:43:37,183 --> 01:43:38,950
Mmm.

1250
01:43:39,062 --> 01:43:41,103
<i>Goin' strong</i>

1251
01:43:41,518 --> 01:43:49,539
<i>I feel the room swayin'</i>

1252
01:43:49,612 --> 01:43:54,031
<i>For the band's playin'</i>

1253
01:43:54,101 --> 01:44:01,510
<i>One of my old favourite songs
from way back when</i>

1254
01:44:02,003 --> 01:44:04,503
<i>So</i>

1255
01:44:05,341 --> 01:44:08,419
<i>Bridge that gap, fellas</i>

1256
01:44:08,487 --> 01:44:13,058
<i>Find me an empty lap, fellas</i>

1257
01:44:13,128 --> 01:44:21,422
<i>Dolly'll never go away again</i>

1258
01:44:24,983 --> 01:44:28,213
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>

1259
01:44:28,282 --> 01:44:31,742
<i>Well, hello, Dolly</i>

1260
01:44:31,812 --> 01:44:38,151
<i>It's so nice to have you back
where you belong</i>

1261
01:44:38,679 --> 01:44:42,716
<i>You're lookin' swell, Dolly</i>

1262
01:44:42,783 --> 01:44:46,165
<i>We can tell, Dolly</i>

1263
01:44:46,235 --> 01:44:49,728
<i>You're still glowin', you're still crowin'</i>

1264
01:44:49,804 --> 01:44:52,956
<i>You're still goin' strong</i>

1265
01:44:53,064 --> 01:44:57,102
<i>We feel the room swayin'</i>

1266
01:44:57,169 --> 01:45:00,781
<i>For the band's playin'</i>

1267
01:45:00,852 --> 01:45:07,071
<i>One of your old favourite songs
from way back when</i>

1268
01:45:07,143 --> 01:45:08,758
<i>So</i>

1269
01:45:09,484 --> 01:45:12,594
<i>Here's my hat, fellas</i>

1270
01:45:12,707 --> 01:45:16,241
<i>I'm stayin' where I'm at, fellas</i>

1271
01:45:16,312 --> 01:45:21,190
<i>Promise you'll never go away again</i>

1272
01:45:27,897 --> 01:45:32,045
<i>I went away from the lights of 14th Street</i>

1273
01:45:32,885 --> 01:45:37,610
<i>And into my personal haze</i>

1274
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:44,858
<i>But now that I'm back
in the lights of 14th Street</i>

1275
01:45:45,046 --> 01:45:49,841
<i>Tomorrow will be brighter
than the good old days</i>

1276
01:45:54,905 --> 01:45:58,091
<i>Those good old days</i>

1277
01:45:58,166 --> 01:46:00,011
<i>Tell it to me sweet</i>

1278
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:04,537
<i>Hello! Well, hello, Dolly</i>

1279
01:46:04,611 --> 01:46:07,765
<i>Well, hello! Hey, look! Here's Dolly</i>

1280
01:46:07,834 --> 01:46:12,515
<i>Glad to see you, Hank,
let's thank my lucky star</i>

1281
01:46:12,629 --> 01:46:14,135
<i>Your lucky star</i>

1282
01:46:14,202 --> 01:46:18,469
<i>You're lookin' great, Stanley</i>

1283
01:46:18,537 --> 01:46:21,723
<i>Lose some weight?
I think, I think you did, Stanley</i>

1284
01:46:21,798 --> 01:46:25,988
<i>Dolly's overjoyed and overwhelmed and...</i>

1285
01:46:26,593 --> 01:46:27,827
<i>Over par</i>

1286
01:46:27,898 --> 01:46:29,512
<i>I hear the ice</i>

1287
01:46:29,585 --> 01:46:31,124
<i>Do you hear the ice tinkle?</i>

1288
01:46:31,196 --> 01:46:32,855
<i>See the lights</i>

1289
01:46:32,923 --> 01:46:34,811
<i>Can you see the light twinkle?</i>

1290
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:39,331
<i>And you still get glances
from us handsome men</i>

1291
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:42,865
<i>Look at you all, you're all so handsome</i>

1292
01:46:43,357 --> 01:46:45,628
<i>Golly, gee, fellas</i>

1293
01:46:45,698 --> 01:46:49,081
<i>Find me an empty knee, fellas</i>

1294
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:53,793
<i>Dolly'll never go away again</i>

1295
01:47:53,715 --> 01:47:55,330
<i>Well, hello</i>

1296
01:47:55,403 --> 01:47:56,680
Look who's here.

1297
01:47:56,746 --> 01:47:57,902
<i>Dolly</i>

1298
01:47:57,973 --> 01:47:59,087
<i>This is Louis</i>

1299
01:47:59,162 --> 01:48:00,167
Hello, Louis.

1300
01:48:00,237 --> 01:48:01,317
<i>Dolly</i>

1301
01:48:01,388 --> 01:48:05,577
<i>It's so nice to have you back
where you belong</i>

1302
01:48:05,646 --> 01:48:07,413
I am so glad to be back.

1303
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:09,408
<i>Ah, you're lookin' swell</i>

1304
01:48:09,482 --> 01:48:10,759
Thank you, Louis.

1305
01:48:10,825 --> 01:48:11,861
<i>Dolly</i>

1306
01:48:11,937 --> 01:48:12,941
<i>I can tell</i>

1307
01:48:13,011 --> 01:48:14,016
Does it show?

1308
01:48:14,086 --> 01:48:15,046
<i>Dolly</i>

1309
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:17,850
<i>You still glowin', you still crowin'</i>

1310
01:48:17,922 --> 01:48:21,152
<i>You still goin' strong</i>

1311
01:48:21,221 --> 01:48:24,070
<i>I feel the room swayin'</i>

1312
01:48:24,905 --> 01:48:27,752
<i>And the band playin'</i>

1313
01:48:28,203 --> 01:48:32,775
<i>One of our old favourite songs
from way back when</i>

1314
01:48:32,845 --> 01:48:34,154
<i>I remember it</i>

1315
01:48:34,226 --> 01:48:35,732
<i>- So</i>
- <i>It was my favourite</i>

1316
01:48:35,799 --> 01:48:38,648
<i>Show some snap, fellas</i>

1317
01:48:38,944 --> 01:48:41,902
<i>Find her an empty lap, yeah</i>

1318
01:48:42,206 --> 01:48:47,738
<i>Dolly'll never go away again</i>

1319
01:48:48,344 --> 01:48:53,526
<i>Well, well, hello, Dolly</i>

1320
01:48:53,599 --> 01:48:56,982
<i>Well, hello, Dolly</i>

1321
01:48:57,052 --> 01:49:02,923
<i>It's so nice to have you back
where you belong</i>

1322
01:49:03,497 --> 01:49:07,032
<i>You're lookin' swell, Dolly</i>

1323
01:49:07,295 --> 01:49:10,329
<i>We can tell, Dolly</i>

1324
01:49:10,518 --> 01:49:13,780
<i>You're still glowin', you're still crowin'</i>

1325
01:49:13,855 --> 01:49:17,161
<i>You're still goin' strong</i>

1326
01:49:17,385 --> 01:49:20,799
<i>I hear the ice</i>

1327
01:49:20,914 --> 01:49:23,030
<i>I hear it tinkle</i>

1328
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:24,716
<i>See the lights</i>

1329
01:49:24,789 --> 01:49:26,633
<i>I see them twinkle</i>

1330
01:49:26,707 --> 01:49:32,731
<i>And you still get glances
from us handsome men</i>

1331
01:49:33,344 --> 01:49:35,111
<i>So</i>

1332
01:49:35,185 --> 01:49:38,448
<i>Mmm, wow, wow, wow, fellas</i>

1333
01:49:39,213 --> 01:49:41,788
<i>Look at the old girl now, fellas</i>

1334
01:49:42,282 --> 01:49:45,545
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1335
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:49,418
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1336
01:49:49,724 --> 01:49:56,173
<i>Dolly'll never go away again</i>

1337
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:25,679
<i>One more time!</i>

1338
01:50:27,128 --> 01:50:30,358
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1339
01:50:30,772 --> 01:50:34,308
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1340
01:50:34,533 --> 01:50:36,529
<i>Dolly'll never...</i>

1341
01:50:37,563 --> 01:50:40,062
Horace Vandergelder.

1342
01:50:41,707 --> 01:50:45,470
- Do we know each other?
- Much too well.

1343
01:50:46,118 --> 01:50:48,464
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Levi.

1344
01:50:48,535 --> 01:50:49,888
Yes.

1345
01:50:51,488 --> 01:50:53,181
Well, do you, uh...?

1346
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:57,172
Do you think you have
the figure for that sort of get-up?

1347
01:50:57,626 --> 01:50:59,820
That's for others to say, Mr. Vandergelder.

1348
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,466
I bought it from a friend,
not being a rich lady

1349
01:51:02,538 --> 01:51:05,920
who has nothing better to do than
dilly-dally with seamstresses.

1350
01:51:06,335 --> 01:51:13,013
- Which reminds me. Where is Miss Simple?
- Miss Simple? Well, she had to... uh... uh...

1351
01:51:13,355 --> 01:51:15,975
She got called away by
a sick friend. Had to leave.

1352
01:51:16,347 --> 01:51:20,647
Oh. Well, that's Ernestina.
Always thinking of other people.

1353
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:24,365
We'll just have to make do without her
for the time being. Rudolph?

1354
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,597
My dear Mrs. Levi, I have saved
the very best table for you.

1355
01:51:27,665 --> 01:51:29,739
- How I've missed you.
- This way, please.

1356
01:51:29,814 --> 01:51:31,625
- Come along.
- I've eaten.

1357
01:51:31,693 --> 01:51:35,262
Don't stand here, you'll get run over
by a waiter. Oh, hello. Good evening.

1358
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:39,021
Oh, hello. How are you?
Hi, nice to see you.

1359
01:51:39,097 --> 01:51:41,246
- You know too many people.
- Total strangers.

1360
01:51:41,322 --> 01:51:44,355
- So why greet them?
- It feels good to have so many friends.

1361
01:51:44,698 --> 01:51:46,815
- Well, say hello for me too.
- I already did.

1362
01:51:47,191 --> 01:51:49,996
- Lovely, Rudolph. Perfect.
- What are we doing down here?

1363
01:51:50,069 --> 01:51:53,025
There's someone in the dance
competition I want you to see.

1364
01:51:53,099 --> 01:51:56,559
- I have no interest in dancing.
- Rudy, this is Mr. Vandergelder of Yonkers.

1365
01:51:56,629 --> 01:51:59,662
In fact, Yonkers' most influential citizen.

1366
01:51:59,736 --> 01:52:03,501
And Mr. Vandergelder insists on buying the
finest dinner you have and served promptly.

1367
01:52:03,573 --> 01:52:06,802
- I never said that.
- I'm watching my waist. Can't eat a thing.

1368
01:52:06,871 --> 01:52:09,599
- What's ready immediately?
- You ordered a chicken...

1369
01:52:09,672 --> 01:52:12,935
I couldn't face a chicken.
Not after all I've been through today.

1370
01:52:13,009 --> 01:52:15,051
- Good, cancel the chicken.
- And bring a turkey.

1371
01:52:15,158 --> 01:52:17,962
- Yes.
- With everything on the side.

1372
01:52:18,879 --> 01:52:20,342
Now, tell me about you and Ernestina.

1373
01:52:20,414 --> 01:52:23,033
I can't wait to hear.
It was short, but was it sweet?

1374
01:52:23,099 --> 01:52:26,252
I mean, do you think you and she...?
I mean, did it go well?

1375
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:30,315
Mrs. Levi, you've a habit of asking
very personal questions.

1376
01:52:30,388 --> 01:52:33,923
Mr. Vandergelder, if you're thinking
of marriage, you might as well learn

1377
01:52:33,994 --> 01:52:36,264
that you have to let women be women.

1378
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:38,953
Now, tell me, did you like her?
Did she like you?

1379
01:52:40,209 --> 01:52:42,555
Always putting your nose
into other people's affairs.

1380
01:52:42,626 --> 01:52:44,852
Anybody who lived with you
would get as nervous as a cat.

1381
01:52:46,615 --> 01:52:48,689
- What did you say?
- Anybody who lived with you...

1382
01:52:49,032 --> 01:52:52,873
Horace Vandergelder, you get that idea
right out of your head this minute.

1383
01:52:53,214 --> 01:52:56,324
Why, the idea of you
even mentioning such a thing.

1384
01:52:56,398 --> 01:52:59,279
Understand once and for all that
I have no intention of marrying you.

1385
01:52:59,889 --> 01:53:03,119
- I didn't mean <i>that.</i>
- You've been hinting around for some time.

1386
01:53:03,188 --> 01:53:05,491
- I have not.
- So put that right out of your head.

1387
01:53:05,797 --> 01:53:09,715
- Stop saying that. That's not what I meant.
- I should hope not.

1388
01:53:09,787 --> 01:53:11,020
You go your way and I'll go mine.

1389
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:15,543
I am not some Irene Molloy whose head you
can turn with chocolate peanuts. Unshelled.

1390
01:53:15,618 --> 01:53:18,346
- The idea of you suggesting it.
- You misunderstood me.

1391
01:53:18,419 --> 01:53:22,030
I certainly hope so. Let's not
discuss it any more. Here's our food.

1392
01:53:22,101 --> 01:53:24,218
- I don't feel well.
- I'll serve Mr. Vandergelder.

1393
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:28,432
Here is a lovely, a lovely wing, for you.

1394
01:53:28,508 --> 01:53:31,814
And some dumplings.
Oh, lighter than air, they are.

1395
01:53:31,922 --> 01:53:34,497
- That's what I need, some air.
- And some giblets.

1396
01:53:34,569 --> 01:53:37,341
Very, very tender and very good for you.

1397
01:53:37,408 --> 01:53:40,408
No, as I said before,
you go your way and I'll go mine.

1398
01:53:40,477 --> 01:53:42,550
Here, have some wine, you'll feel better.

1399
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:45,353
Since you brought it up,
there's one thing I oughta say...

1400
01:53:45,426 --> 01:53:47,925
- I didn't bring it up.
- before we forget about it.

1401
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:53,263
It's true, I like to manage things, but not
anything as disorderly as <i>your</i> household.

1402
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:57,704
As out of control, as untidy. Oh, no,
Horace, you can do that for yourself.

1403
01:53:57,779 --> 01:54:00,474
- It is not out of control.
- Let's not say another word.

1404
01:54:00,541 --> 01:54:04,459
- Oh, have some beets.
- I'm not hungry and I don't like beets.

1405
01:54:04,531 --> 01:54:08,950
No, a complaining, quarrelsome, friendless
soul like you is no sort of companion for me.

1406
01:54:09,019 --> 01:54:12,479
You salt your beets and I'll salt mine.
I won't say another word.

1407
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,398
Besides, I'm not those things you said I am.

1408
01:54:14,466 --> 01:54:17,118
You're the only person that knows it.

1409
01:54:17,344 --> 01:54:20,268
No, Horace, I have decided to enjoy life.

1410
01:54:20,336 --> 01:54:23,980
You can find a housekeeper
who'll cook for a dollar a day.

1411
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:27,059
It can be done, if you like cold
baked beans. I can see you now,

1412
01:54:27,165 --> 01:54:30,013
ending your days listening at keyholes
for fear of being cheated.

1413
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:34,424
- Have some more beets. They're delicious.
- I hate beets.

1414
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:36,336
There, that's the difference between us.

1415
01:54:36,717 --> 01:54:39,183
I'd be nagging you,
to get some spirit into you,

1416
01:54:39,249 --> 01:54:42,937
and the pity of it is you could be
a charming, amiable man if you wanted to.

1417
01:54:43,315 --> 01:54:48,543
- I don't want to be charming.
- But you are. You can't help yourself.

1418
01:54:49,376 --> 01:54:52,378
Listening at keyholes! You have
no right to say such things.

1419
01:54:52,714 --> 01:54:54,406
At your age you ought to enjoy the truth.

1420
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,206
My age, you're always talking about my age.

1421
01:54:57,625 --> 01:55:01,586
I don't know what your age is, but with
bad temper you'll double it in six months.

1422
01:55:01,653 --> 01:55:06,302
Now siddown. Before we change
the subject, there's one thing I'll say.

1423
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:11,092
I don't wanna hear it. You're wasting your
time. I have no intention of proposing.

1424
01:55:11,358 --> 01:55:15,626
Oh! I suppose you want me to ask you?
Well, I'm sorry. I'm turning you down.

1425
01:55:15,694 --> 01:55:18,465
How can you turn me down
when I haven't asked ya anything?

1426
01:55:18,532 --> 01:55:21,839
It's no use arguing. I've made up your mind.
Here, let me cut your wings.

1427
01:55:22,292 --> 01:55:25,784
- I don't want my wings cut.
- No man does, Horace. No man does.

1428
01:55:25,975 --> 01:55:28,398
I've got a headache. I'm leaving.

1429
01:55:28,699 --> 01:55:31,164
Oh, no, the dance competition
is about to begin.

1430
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:35,115
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may
have your attention please.

1431
01:55:35,681 --> 01:55:40,406
It is my pleasure to announce on behalf of
the management of the Harmonia Gardens,

1432
01:55:40,476 --> 01:55:43,662
that our dance contest
is about to commence.

1433
01:55:44,274 --> 01:55:49,032
The judges for tonight's competition
are Mr. Hermann Fleishacker,

1434
01:55:51,831 --> 01:55:53,446
Mr. Llewellyn Codd,

1435
01:55:55,093 --> 01:56:00,090
and our special guest-of-honour
judge, Mrs. Dolly Levi.

1436
01:56:09,248 --> 01:56:10,525
Siddown!

1437
01:56:15,578 --> 01:56:18,229
Ladies and gentlemen
who wish to participate,

1438
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:22,186
will you please come to the dance floor.
To the lucky winning couple

1439
01:56:22,253 --> 01:56:27,589
goes the grand prize of 50 silver dollars
or an engagement at the Harmonia Gardens.

1440
01:56:28,046 --> 01:56:29,083
50.

1441
01:56:29,351 --> 01:56:31,423
Everybody, dance!

1442
01:56:37,445 --> 01:56:40,708
- Your check, sir.
- Another bottle of champagne.

1443
01:57:07,253 --> 01:57:13,243
Mm! Look at him. What grace, what talent,
what a living he could earn with his feet!

1444
01:57:14,004 --> 01:57:15,663
- Horace, look.
- Where?

1445
01:57:20,948 --> 01:57:23,294
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, isn't he wonderful?

1446
01:57:23,672 --> 01:57:26,247
That's Ambrose Kemper, so-called artist.

1447
01:57:26,511 --> 01:57:30,080
- Why, so it is.
- No wonder his pictures are so awful.

1448
01:57:30,539 --> 01:57:33,725
- He must paint with his feet.
- He's sure to win first prize.

1449
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,495
Ermengarde should see him now,
dancing with another girl.

1450
01:57:37,176 --> 01:57:40,907
- And such a pretty little thing too.
- It's shameful, that's what it is. Shameful.

1451
01:57:51,907 --> 01:57:54,864
Look, there's that Molloy
woman dancing with a man.

1452
01:57:56,242 --> 01:57:57,596
I think it's a man.

1453
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:02,919
And only a few hours ago
she was waiting for me to propose.

1454
01:58:03,186 --> 01:58:05,914
- Shocking.
- No faithfulness left in this world.

1455
01:58:05,987 --> 01:58:09,598
I agree. I certainly do. And it's
very selfish that people like us

1456
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:13,314
don't jump right up and marry someone
just to set the world a good example.

1457
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:20,307
My hat!

1458
01:58:34,988 --> 01:58:36,342
Ermengarde!

1459
01:58:37,904 --> 01:58:40,098
- Uncle...
- My niece!

1460
01:58:40,283 --> 01:58:41,516
Agh!

1461
01:58:43,889 --> 01:58:46,846
You are a disgrace to Yonkers!

1462
01:58:49,183 --> 01:58:50,765
Grrrr!

1463
01:58:57,162 --> 01:59:00,927
- Mr. Vandergelder, the contest!
- I'll show you a contest!

1464
01:59:04,106 --> 01:59:05,689
Call the police!

1465
01:59:10,589 --> 01:59:12,477
Uncle Horace, we can explain.

1466
01:59:12,623 --> 01:59:14,620
Exp...? I'll give you...

1467
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:37,334
Cornelius Hackl!

1468
01:59:37,405 --> 01:59:40,515
- What are you doing in New York?
- Delivering some oats.

1469
01:59:40,589 --> 01:59:42,663
Oats? With my former intended?

1470
01:59:42,738 --> 01:59:45,160
- You're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.

1471
01:59:45,231 --> 01:59:46,464
So do I.

1472
01:59:46,574 --> 01:59:49,379
- And you're discharged!
- You can't fire me. I quit.

1473
01:59:49,451 --> 01:59:50,640
So do I.

1474
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,692
I'm sorry.

1475
02:00:11,548 --> 02:00:12,781
Grrr!

1476
02:00:15,346 --> 02:00:16,536
Oh!

1477
02:00:22,942 --> 02:00:27,590
Horace Vandergelder, flat on
your back you are still charming.

1478
02:00:29,502 --> 02:00:32,273
Cornelius, Barnaby,

1479
02:00:33,837 --> 02:00:38,212
perhaps there's a way I can get
Mr. Vandergelder to give you back your jobs.

1480
02:00:38,747 --> 02:00:40,821
What? How?

1481
02:00:42,162 --> 02:00:44,780
I could become his wife.

1482
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:49,689
- No, that's impossible.
- It is?

1483
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:52,253
- Yes.
- But why, Cornelius?

1484
02:00:53,363 --> 02:00:56,245
- Because. That's why.
- But you have to give me a reason.

1485
02:00:56,318 --> 02:01:00,082
Never mind the reason. Never mind
the reason! And don't tell me to shush!

1486
02:01:00,384 --> 02:01:03,112
- What's going on there?
- Cornelius, quick!

1487
02:01:03,645 --> 02:01:07,835
Hey, you! What's all this noise?
What's happening here?

1488
02:01:08,248 --> 02:01:10,901
- Now, you stay out of this.
- Are you all right, Miss?

1489
02:01:10,972 --> 02:01:13,088
- I'll let you know.
- Young man...

1490
02:01:13,158 --> 02:01:15,200
I'm only trying to tell her something.

1491
02:01:15,269 --> 02:01:18,575
Well, it's too late and
you're disturbing the peace.

1492
02:01:18,645 --> 02:01:22,289
No, it's not too late.
That's why I'm shouting.

1493
02:01:22,634 --> 02:01:26,518
For 28 years, my whole life,
I never did anything.

1494
02:01:26,624 --> 02:01:30,236
I just worked, took orders, never
went anywhere. Stayed in Yonkers.

1495
02:01:30,461 --> 02:01:32,730
- Yonkers?
- And today

1496
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,831
the most important thing that can happen
to a man, and might never have happened,

1497
02:01:37,903 --> 02:01:42,551
happened to me because I left Yonkers
and came to New York and met this lady.

1498
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:44,736
Met her this afternoon.

1499
02:01:45,653 --> 02:01:49,067
Mister... just what are you talking about?

1500
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:54,328
Officer, I'm talking about
none other than love.

1501
02:01:54,897 --> 02:01:56,556
-  Love?
- Love?

1502
02:01:57,008 --> 02:02:01,459
Young man, are you trying to tell me
that after 28 years in Yonkers

1503
02:02:01,534 --> 02:02:04,000
you've fallen in love with
this young lady in one day?

1504
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:08,485
Oh, no, Officer, I didn't fall in love with
Miss Irene Molloy of this city in just a day.

1505
02:02:08,555 --> 02:02:11,207
It was much quicker than that. An hour.

1506
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,159
No, even that's too long.
What's less than a minute?

1507
02:02:14,232 --> 02:02:15,618
- A second?
- Less than that.

1508
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:17,840
- A moment.
- That's it.

1509
02:02:18,184 --> 02:02:22,756
That is it. Now, all of you, listen to me.

1510
02:02:24,744 --> 02:02:26,130
Please.

1511
02:02:28,081 --> 02:02:34,912
<i>It only takes a moment</i>

1512
02:02:35,408 --> 02:02:43,123
<i>For your eyes to meet, and then</i>

1513
02:02:43,849 --> 02:02:47,188
<i>Your heart knows</i>

1514
02:02:47,724 --> 02:02:51,258
<i>In a moment</i>

1515
02:02:51,751 --> 02:02:56,546
<i>You will never be alone again</i>

1516
02:03:03,298 --> 02:03:07,183
<i>I held her</i>

1517
02:03:07,826 --> 02:03:10,979
<i>For an instant</i>

1518
02:03:12,007 --> 02:03:20,759
<i>But my arms felt sure and strong</i>

1519
02:03:21,636 --> 02:03:26,432
<i>It only takes a moment</i>

1520
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:35,411
<i>To be loved</i>

1521
02:03:36,252 --> 02:03:44,087
<i>A whole life long</i>

1522
02:03:46,418 --> 02:03:49,267
Isn't the world full of wonderful things?

1523
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:52,178
I have lost so many things.

1524
02:03:52,249 --> 02:03:55,589
My job, my future,
everything that people think is important,

1525
02:03:55,703 --> 02:04:00,198
but I don't care. Cos, even if I have to
dig ditches for the rest of my life,

1526
02:04:00,728 --> 02:04:04,994
I shall be a ditch-digger
who once had a wonderful day.

1527
02:04:05,523 --> 02:04:09,168
Mister, do you mind?
I came in late. Right after...

1528
02:04:09,245 --> 02:04:11,514
<i>It only...</i>

1529
02:04:11,623 --> 02:04:14,853
<i>Takes a moment</i>

1530
02:04:15,613 --> 02:04:23,143
<i>But his arms felt sure and strong</i>

1531
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:32,885
<i>It only takes a moment</i>

1532
02:04:35,446 --> 02:04:43,849
<i>He held me, for an instant</i>

1533
02:04:44,423 --> 02:04:53,251
<i>But his arms felt safe and strong</i>

1534
02:04:54,743 --> 02:05:02,807
<i>It only takes a moment</i>

1535
02:05:03,758 --> 02:05:08,553
<i>To be loved a whole life long</i>

1536
02:05:15,535 --> 02:05:19,573
<i>And that is all</i>

1537
02:05:20,484 --> 02:05:25,013
<i>That love's about</i>

1538
02:05:25,509 --> 02:05:30,114
<i>And we'll recall</i>

1539
02:05:30,651 --> 02:05:36,641
<i>When time runs out</i>

1540
02:05:38,247 --> 02:05:43,932
<i>That it only</i>

1541
02:05:44,922 --> 02:05:50,454
<i>Took a moment</i>

1542
02:05:51,597 --> 02:05:56,392
<i>To be loved a whole life long</i>

1543
02:06:10,701 --> 02:06:13,004
Tell Rudolph not to worry
about the damage.

1544
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:16,888
Just send the bill to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store, Yonkers, New York.

1545
02:06:19,448 --> 02:06:22,219
- There's your life for you.
- I don't want to hear about it.

1546
02:06:22,287 --> 02:06:24,829
Without niece, without bride,
without clerks.

1547
02:06:24,896 --> 02:06:26,740
Look, I'm tired. I've got a backache.

1548
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:30,428
- That's <i>all</i> you have. I hope you're satisfied.
- Never mind.

1549
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:35,181
There's only one thing for me to say.
I've been meaning to say it all night.

1550
02:06:35,253 --> 02:06:38,516
If it's to ask me to marry you, Dolly Levi,
never - not in a million years.

1551
02:06:39,474 --> 02:06:43,282
It wasn't that at all, Horace.
All I wanted to say was...

1552
02:06:43,655 --> 02:06:45,084
<i>Goodbye</i>

1553
02:06:45,151 --> 02:06:46,188
What?

1554
02:06:46,264 --> 02:06:47,224
<i>Goodbye</i>

1555
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:48,336
What are you talking about?

1556
02:06:48,411 --> 02:06:54,250
<i>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye</i>

1557
02:06:54,665 --> 02:06:57,284
<i>Goodbye, goodbye</i>

1558
02:06:57,389 --> 02:07:01,382
- Nonsense.
- Don't try to stop me, Horace, please.

1559
02:07:01,608 --> 02:07:04,490
<i>Wave your little hand
and whisper "So long, dearie"</i>

1560
02:07:04,563 --> 02:07:07,138
<i>You ain't gonna see me any more</i>

1561
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,593
<i>And when you discover
that your life is dreary</i>

1562
02:07:10,662 --> 02:07:13,041
<i>Don ' t you come a-knockin' at my door</i>

1563
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:16,041
<i>Cos I'll be all dolled up
and singin' that song</i>

1564
02:07:16,148 --> 02:07:19,105
<i>That says "You dog, I told you so"</i>

1565
02:07:19,601 --> 02:07:22,372
<i>So wave your little hand
and whisper "So long, dearie"</i>

1566
02:07:22,439 --> 02:07:25,626
<i>Dearie should have said "So long"
so long ago</i>

1567
02:07:27,274 --> 02:07:30,230
<i>Because you treated me
so rotten and rough</i>

1568
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,534
<i>I have had enough of feeling low</i>

1569
02:07:33,834 --> 02:07:36,637
<i>So wave your little hand
and whisper "So long, dearie"</i>

1570
02:07:36,749 --> 02:07:39,903
<i>Dearie should have said "So long"
so long ago</i>

1571
02:07:41,545 --> 02:07:47,569
<i>For I can hear that choo-choo
calling me on to a fancy new address</i>

1572
02:07:47,644 --> 02:07:53,744
<i>Yes, I can hear that choo-choo calling me
on, on board that Happiness Express</i>

1573
02:07:53,821 --> 02:07:57,280
<i>I'm gonna learn to dance
and drink and smoke a cigarette</i>

1574
02:07:57,388 --> 02:08:04,721
<i>I'm going as far away
from Yonkers as a girl can get</i>

1575
02:08:05,828 --> 02:08:07,716
<i>So</i>

1576
02:08:11,697 --> 02:08:14,961
<i>And on those cold winter nights, Horace,</i>

1577
02:08:19,217 --> 02:08:22,480
<i>you can snuggle up to your cash register.</i>

1578
02:08:26,582 --> 02:08:29,202
<i>It's a little lumpy, but it rings.</i>

1579
02:08:30,955 --> 02:08:34,720
<i>Don't come a-knockin', I'll be
all dolled up and singin' that song</i>

1580
02:08:34,831 --> 02:08:38,245
<i>That says "You dog, I told you so"</i>

1581
02:08:38,321 --> 02:08:41,508
<i>So, Horace, you will find
your life a sad old story</i>

1582
02:08:41,582 --> 02:08:44,506
<i>You'll be living in that lonesome territory</i>

1583
02:08:44,689 --> 02:08:47,342
<i>When you see old Dolly shuffle off to glory</i>

1584
02:08:47,413 --> 02:08:50,186
<i>Oh, I should have said "So long"</i>

1585
02:08:50,483 --> 02:08:53,439
<i>How could I have been wrong?</i>

1586
02:08:53,551 --> 02:08:58,080
<i>Oh, I should have said "So long"</i>

1587
02:09:01,378 --> 02:09:09,628
<i>So long ago</i>

1588
02:09:24,741 --> 02:09:29,313
Quiet! Quiet, down there,
you little monsters.

1589
02:09:29,383 --> 02:09:31,118
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1590
02:09:33,218 --> 02:09:34,986
D'ya hear me down there?

1591
02:09:35,367 --> 02:09:36,982
Ermengarde!

1592
02:09:37,708 --> 02:09:39,093
What the devil is this?

1593
02:09:39,894 --> 02:09:41,935
What's this chicken mash doing all over?

1594
02:09:49,063 --> 02:09:50,755
Cornelius! Barnaby!

1595
02:09:51,211 --> 02:09:53,938
Get up here this minute
and clean up this mess.

1596
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:04,759
Well, good riddance. Didn't need you
before and I don't need you now.

1597
02:10:05,789 --> 02:10:08,975
Ermengarde! I'm ready for my breakfast!

1598
02:10:09,702 --> 02:10:14,656
I want three eggs with crisp bacon,
and hot porridge with cream, and grits...

1599
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:23,407
It's not fair.

1600
02:10:26,006 --> 02:10:28,625
It's worse than that. It's lonely.

1601
02:10:34,944 --> 02:10:40,095
Not in a million years, Dolly Levi.

1602
02:10:40,775 --> 02:10:44,006
You go your way and I'll go mine.

1603
02:10:49,714 --> 02:10:53,174
- Good morning, Uncle Horace.
- Good morning, Mr. Vandergelder.

1604
02:10:54,778 --> 02:10:56,927
Oh, come crawling back, have you?

1605
02:10:57,003 --> 02:11:00,114
I've a good mind not to take you,
but as I'm so softhearted

1606
02:11:00,188 --> 02:11:02,686
go get your aprons
and start cleaning up this mess.

1607
02:11:03,218 --> 02:11:05,597
We're not coming back to work for you.

1608
02:11:05,673 --> 02:11:06,753
What?

1609
02:11:07,477 --> 02:11:09,779
Barnaby and I
are stopping by for our money.

1610
02:11:09,855 --> 02:11:11,852
You see, we've decided to go into business.

1611
02:11:11,926 --> 02:11:13,313
Business?

1612
02:11:13,423 --> 02:11:17,383
And since the only business we know is
hay and feed, we're opening our own store.

1613
02:11:17,451 --> 02:11:19,873
Mrs. Levi's found the perfect location for us.

1614
02:11:19,944 --> 02:11:22,868
- Right across the street from you.
- She wouldn't dare.

1615
02:11:23,282 --> 02:11:25,049
Hackl and Tucker Incorporated.

1616
02:11:25,775 --> 02:11:27,925
H uh! You'll last for a week.

1617
02:11:28,729 --> 02:11:30,770
- What about my breakfast?
- Uncle Horace,

1618
02:11:33,755 --> 02:11:36,177
I think you'd better start
learning how to make it yourself.

1619
02:11:39,471 --> 02:11:41,970
All right, all right. My conscience is clear.

1620
02:11:42,041 --> 02:11:45,271
A man can do only so much to keep
fools from their own natural folly.

1621
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:50,447
Why, Horace Vandergelder, as I live
and breathe, how well you look today.

1622
02:11:51,056 --> 02:11:54,167
I just came by to return your cane,
so don't let me interrupt.

1623
02:11:54,241 --> 02:11:56,783
You were doing something?
What were you doing?

1624
02:11:57,118 --> 02:11:59,082
We were getting their money.

1625
02:11:59,151 --> 02:12:01,617
$ 146.35.

1626
02:12:01,683 --> 02:12:04,607
- Plus $6. 12 of mine.
- And the money my mama left me.

1627
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:08,251
That's right. $52.48.

1628
02:12:08,474 --> 02:12:12,314
- 38, idiot.
- 48... Uncle.

1629
02:12:16,682 --> 02:12:19,531
All right, all right. If all you can think about

1630
02:12:19,637 --> 02:12:21,907
at a time like this is money,
the safe is upstairs.

1631
02:12:26,389 --> 02:12:28,430
And I have the combination.

1632
02:12:28,998 --> 02:12:32,107
- You stay here.
- If you insist, Horace.

1633
02:12:49,407 --> 02:12:53,367
Ephraim Levi, I'm gonna get married again.

1634
02:12:54,509 --> 02:12:57,432
I'm gonna marry Horace Vandergelder.

1635
02:12:59,419 --> 02:13:01,034
And I'm asking your permission.

1636
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:05,176
It won't be a marriage
in the sense that we had one,

1637
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:07,629
but I shall certainly make him happy.

1638
02:13:07,705 --> 02:13:09,364
You can be sure of that.

1639
02:13:10,008 --> 02:13:16,304
I am going to marry Horace Vandergelder
and send his money out into the world,

1640
02:13:16,376 --> 02:13:18,492
doing all the things you taught me.

1641
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:21,135
As you always used to say, Ephraim:

1642
02:13:21,209 --> 02:13:25,432
"Money, pardon the expression,
is like manure."

1643
02:13:25,736 --> 02:13:31,225
"It's not worth a thing unless it's spread
around, encouraging young things to grow."

1644
02:13:31,989 --> 02:13:37,064
Anyhow, that's the opinion
of the future Mrs. Vandergelder.

1645
02:13:37,859 --> 02:13:43,620
And, Ephraim, I'm still waiting
for that sign that you approve.

1646
02:13:49,828 --> 02:13:52,206
- Mr. Vandergelder.
- Outside. Front and back.

1647
02:13:59,802 --> 02:14:03,108
Bossy, scheming, meddling,

1648
02:14:03,715 --> 02:14:06,978
irritating, inquisitive, exasperating.

1649
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:12,128
Horace, I know you're no longer interested,

1650
02:14:12,845 --> 02:14:16,577
but I have found you the ideal wife.

1651
02:14:16,682 --> 02:14:19,638
Dolly Levi, I don't want you
to find me any ideal wife.

1652
02:14:19,712 --> 02:14:21,829
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own,

1653
02:14:21,899 --> 02:14:24,049
and I have found her and it's you, damn it!

1654
02:14:26,656 --> 02:14:32,189
I know I've been a fool and I probably always
will be, but Dolly, forgive me and marry me.

1655
02:14:37,129 --> 02:14:38,406
No, Horace, I...

1656
02:14:39,355 --> 02:14:41,657
- I don't dare. I don't dare.
- What do you mean?

1657
02:14:42,231 --> 02:14:47,458
Well, you know as well as I do
that you're the first citizen of Yonkers

1658
02:14:48,254 --> 02:14:50,906
and your wife would
have to be a... a somebody.

1659
02:14:50,978 --> 02:14:53,401
You are! You are a wonderful woman.

1660
02:14:53,702 --> 02:14:56,550
Yes, but, uh, do you really
think I have it in me...

1661
02:14:56,618 --> 02:14:59,804
to forgo fancy clothes
and expensive jewels,

1662
02:14:59,879 --> 02:15:02,683
and instead be a benefactress
to half the town?

1663
02:15:05,556 --> 02:15:08,283
In other words, to be a credit to you?

1664
02:15:10,467 --> 02:15:13,653
Dolly, everybody knows that you
could do anything you wanted to do.

1665
02:15:16,259 --> 02:15:19,752
By the way, Horace, here's the money
I borrowed from you yesterday.

1666
02:15:20,595 --> 02:15:21,871
Keep it, keep it.

1667
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:26,283
Oh, Horace.

1668
02:15:28,574 --> 02:15:31,269
I never thought I'd ever
hear you say anything like that.

1669
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:36,678
You know it's bad business
to let 'em open a store over there?

1670
02:15:37,014 --> 02:15:39,240
- It was your idea.
- Let him be your partner.

1671
02:15:39,469 --> 02:15:41,968
And Barnaby can have Cornelius's old job.

1672
02:15:42,039 --> 02:15:44,658
That way we can all dance
at Ermengarde's wedding.

1673
02:15:44,763 --> 02:15:50,142
That does it. You've gone too far. I'll dance
at no wedding. Besides, I don't know how.

1674
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:53,288
- All right, I'll dance.
- Excuse me, Mr. Vandergelder.

1675
02:15:53,357 --> 02:15:57,394
- I said outside! Now get moving.
- Horace, what is going on around here?

1676
02:15:57,461 --> 02:16:01,575
Oh, nothing, I just thought I'd have
the shutters done over in forest green.

1677
02:16:02,448 --> 02:16:05,143
- Forest-green shutters?
- The paint's still good,

1678
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:08,212
but that fellow's just set up
a business and needs a good start.

1679
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:13,312
You see, Dolly, I've always felt that money,
pardon the expression, is like manure.

1680
02:16:13,804 --> 02:16:19,260
It's not worth a thing unless it's spread
around, encouraging young things to grow.

1681
02:16:20,556 --> 02:16:21,985
Thank you, Ephraim.

1682
02:16:23,241 --> 02:16:26,351
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>

1683
02:16:26,425 --> 02:16:30,189
<i>Well, hello, Dolly</i>

1684
02:16:30,645 --> 02:16:37,290
<i>It's so nice to have you here
where you belong</i>

1685
02:16:39,967 --> 02:16:44,157
<i>I never knew, Dolly</i>

1686
02:16:44,532 --> 02:16:48,494
<i>Without you, Dolly</i>

1687
02:16:48,561 --> 02:16:56,930
<i>Life was awfully flat and,
more than that, was awfully wrong</i>

1688
02:17:15,108 --> 02:17:18,948
<i>Here's my hat, Horace</i>

1689
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:23,440
<i>I'm stayin' where I'm at, Horace</i>

1690
02:17:23,509 --> 02:17:29,118
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1691
02:17:29,187 --> 02:17:30,845
Wonderful woman.

1692
02:17:31,258 --> 02:17:35,372
<i>Again</i>

1693
02:17:39,544 --> 02:17:43,583
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes
when you feel down and out</i>

1694
02:17:44,034 --> 02:17:47,296
<i>Strut down the street
and have your picture took</i>

1695
02:17:48,752 --> 02:17:52,899
<i>Dressed like a dream
your spirits seem to turn about</i>

1696
02:17:53,125 --> 02:17:55,428
<i>That Sunday shine is a certain sign</i>

1697
02:17:55,504 --> 02:17:58,123
<i>That you feel as fine as you look</i>

1698
02:17:58,764 --> 02:18:02,224
<i>Take the someone whose arms you're in</i>

1699
02:18:02,831 --> 02:18:06,061
<i>Hold on to her tight and spin</i>

1700
02:18:06,168 --> 02:18:10,436
<i>And one, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three, look!</i>

1701
02:18:11,233 --> 02:18:15,575
<i>I held her</i>

1702
02:18:15,644 --> 02:18:18,951
<i>For an instant</i>

1703
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:26,004
<i>But my arms felt sure and strong</i>

1704
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:32,143
<i>It only takes a moment</i>

1705
02:18:32,945 --> 02:18:39,472
<i>To be loved a whole life long</i>

1706
02:18:40,388 --> 02:18:42,854
<i>Yes, it takes a woman</i>

1707
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,579
<i>A dainty woman</i>

1708
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:47,299
<i>A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife</i>

1709
02:18:48,214 --> 02:18:50,560
<i>Oh, yes, it takes a woman</i>

1710
02:18:50,631 --> 02:18:52,476
<i>A fragile woman</i>

1711
02:18:52,550 --> 02:18:55,321
<i>To bring you the sweet things in life</i>

1712
02:18:55,772 --> 02:19:02,264
<i>Well, well, hello, Dolly</i>

1713
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:05,556
<i>Well, hello, Dolly</i>

1714
02:19:05,631 --> 02:19:11,011
<i>It's so nice to have you back
where you belong</i>

1715
02:19:11,961 --> 02:19:15,692
<i>You're lookin' swell, Dolly</i>

1716
02:19:15,759 --> 02:19:18,945
<i>We can tell, Dolly</i>

1717
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:22,282
<i>You're still glowin', you're still crowin'</i>

1718
02:19:22,357 --> 02:19:25,697
<i>You're still goin' strong</i>

1719
02:19:26,155 --> 02:19:33,259
<i>Just see the crowd swayin'</i>

1720
02:19:33,329 --> 02:19:37,552
<i>While the band's playin'</i>

1721
02:19:37,626 --> 02:19:44,762
<i>One of your old favourite songs
from way back when</i>

1722
02:19:45,222 --> 02:19:47,339
<i>So</i>

1723
02:19:47,907 --> 02:19:51,476
<i>Wow, wow, wow, fellas</i>

1724
02:19:52,549 --> 02:19:55,473
<i>Look at the old girl now, fellas</i>

1725
02:19:55,848 --> 02:19:59,537
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1726
02:20:00,145 --> 02:20:03,876
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1727
02:20:04,556 --> 02:20:10,317
<i>Dolly'll never go away</i>

1728
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:18,758
<i>Again</i>
