1
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,800
Shh. Hey.

2
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,173
<i>Bathsheba Everdene.</i>

3
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,175
<i>Bathsheba.</i>

4
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,212
<i>The name has always
sounded strange to me.</i>

5
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,514
<i>I don't like to hear it
said out loud.</i>

6
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,252
<i>My parents died
when I was very young,</i>

7
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,621
<i>so there's no one to ask
where it came from.</i>

8
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,459
<i>I've grown accustomed
to being on my own.</i>

9
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,528
<i>Some say even too accustomed.</i>

10
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,199
<i>Too independent.</i>

11
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,326
Miss!

12
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,931
Miss!

13
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,981
My scarf.

14
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,983
I lost it.

15
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,852
You must be Farmer Oak.

16
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,454
Gabriel, yes.

17
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,823
My aunt's told me
about you.

18
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,345
I'm working on her farm
for the winter.

19
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,630
This is your land.

20
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,499
I'm trespassing.

21
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,369
You're welcome here.

22
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,750
Good afternoon, Farmer Oak.

23
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,852
Good afternoon, miss.

24
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,484
Come by, George.

25
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,488
George, away!
Enough, George!

26
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,822
Enough!

27
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,892
Stand. Stand.

28
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,727
George, stand.

29
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,664
Away!

30
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,432
Away!

31
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,735
George, away!

32
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,472
He doesn't know when to stop,
Young George.

33
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,441
What's this one called?

34
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,776
Old George.

35
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,913
Old George.

36
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,288
So you find me amusing,
do you?

37
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,800
Goodness, it's Mr. Oak.

38
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,047
...and after that
she was gonna be a governess.

39
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,582
But she was far too wild.

40
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,417
Always has been.

41
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,451
Oh!

42
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,995
Miss Bathsheba Everdene.

43
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,098
I've brought you a lamb.

44
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,567
Oh!

45
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,440
Thank you, Mr. Oak.
He's such a dear thing.

46
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,575
He's come too soon
and won't last the winter,

47
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,778
so I thought you'd like to
rear it instead.

48
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,733
Thank you,
that's very kind.

49
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,183
I'll make some tea.

50
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,121
The lamb is not why I came.

51
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,823
Go on.

52
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,495
Well, Miss Everdene,
I wanted to ask...

53
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,531
Would you like to marry me?

54
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,469
I've never asked
anyone before.

55
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,705
No.

56
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,675
I should hope not.

57
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,178
Well...

58
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,714
Perhaps I, erm, I should...

59
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,118
Perhaps I should leave.
Mr. Oak,

60
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,853
there are things to consider.

61
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,190
Is someone waiting for you?

62
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,525
No, but that doesn't mean
I'll marry you.

63
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,062
Good day to you, then.

64
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,673
Mr. Oak!

65
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,577
Mr. Oak! Wait!

66
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,149
I didn't say I wouldn't
marry you, either.

67
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,487
I haven't ever
really thought about it.

68
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,890
I have 100 acres and 200 sheep.

69
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,528
If I pay off the money,
the farm is ours.

70
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,532
You could have a piano
in a year or two.

71
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,768
Flowers and birds
and a frame for cucumbers.

72
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,770
A baby or two.

73
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,092
Mr. Oak...
Or more.

74
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,075
I will always
be there for you.

75
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,945
Mr. Oak,
I don't want a husband.

76
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,115
I'd hate to be
some man's property.

77
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,218
I shouldn't mind
being a bride at a wedding

78
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,260
if I could be one
without getting a husband.

79
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,289
That's stupid talk.

80
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,560
You are better off
than I, Mr. Oak.

81
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,229
I have an education
and nothing more.

82
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,831
You could do much,
much better than me.

83
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,299
That's not the reason.

84
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,573
I'm too independent for you.

85
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,675
If I ever were to marry,

86
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,043
I'd want somebody
to tame me

87
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,365
and you'd never
be able to do it.

88
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,682
You'd grow to despise me.

89
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,619
I would not.

90
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,989
Ever.

91
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,829
Good-bye, Miss Everdene.

92
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,691
What is it, old boy?

93
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,895
Stay here.

94
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,768
Stay here, Old George.

95
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,236
Stay here.

96
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,180
George!

97
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,662
George!

98
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,776
No!

99
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,378
It's all yours.

100
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,825
We take
no pleasure in this.

101
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,962
We wish
you well, Mr. Oak.

102
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,212
Bathsheba.

103
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,852
What is it?

104
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,889
My love. It's your
poor uncle's will.

105
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,392
What does it say?

106
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,228
Read it.

107
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,870
He's left you everything.
It's all yours.

108
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,972
Oh!

109
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,508
Oh, my goodness.

110
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,278
Take care, you hear.

111
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,988
Walk on.

112
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,995
Bye.

113
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,317
So who will join us, lads?

114
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,020
Which one of you fine boys

115
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,488
will put on
the scarlet uniform

116
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,958
and proudly serve
his Queen and country?

117
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,227
See the world.

118
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,398
Form an orderly line,
gentlemen, at the front.

119
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,901
This gentleman
in the straw hat,
step forward, sir.

120
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,543
That's my sweetheart,
right there.

121
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,306
You, sir,
next to the pretty lady.

122
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,042
There's a good strong
figure of a man.

123
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,610
Join us, sir.

124
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,179
Go on.
You'd make a fine soldier.

125
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,048
Always room in the ranks
for a gentleman
of your caliber.

126
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,516
It's a roof
over your head. Food.

127
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,388
Who wants a fine wage?

128
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,056
Excuse me.

129
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,959
You might try Weatherbury.
If you're looking for work,

130
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,928
there's a farm there
needs all the help it can get.

131
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,562
Yes.
The young lad there.

132
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,932
I will. Thank you.

133
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,968
You should have a cloak
for a day like this.

134
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,171
Francis will
take care of me.

135
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,375
We are to be married soon.

136
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,978
Good-bye.

137
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,613
Come on, a decent wage.

138
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,315
Make your family proud.

139
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:53,351
Food, shelter.
Who will join us?

140
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,773
Go and wake up
the other farms!

141
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,042
Get them down here!
We need more hands!

142
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,176
We need more men now!

143
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,211
Wake them up!

144
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,781
Go and get
the Smith brothers first.

145
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,183
Protect yourself,
the fire's spreading!

146
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,186
Who's in charge here?

147
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,223
We're losing the ricks!
The rick is lost.

148
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,232
We need to save the barn.
Come on, help me!

149
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,662
Come on, get some more water!
Get some more water!

150
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,233
We need to push this out.
Come on!

151
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,601
Heave!

152
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,371
Heave!

153
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,040
Heave!

154
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,110
Come on, push!

155
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,269
Everybody out!
Everybody out!

156
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,209
Water!
More over here!

157
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,412
Get the sacks out,
the roof's about to go!

158
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,098
What's he doing up there?

159
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,300
We lose the barn,
we lose everything.

160
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,276
Joseph,
bring those brooms over

161
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,844
and let's get this sorted out.

162
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,648
Look sharp, men,
the farmer's here.

163
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,831
Mr. Oak, is that you?

164
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,997
Perhaps you want
a shepherd, ma'am?

165
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,911
I owe you an immense
debt, Mr. Oak.

166
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,813
If I'd have lost
all of this,
I'd have lost my farm.

167
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,915
Your farm?

168
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,950
My inheritance.

169
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,619
My home, too, for a while
when my parents died.

170
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,790
When my uncle passed away,
he left it to me.

171
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,561
Of course,
it's a little ragged now,

172
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,464
but this once used to be
the finest farm for miles.

173
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,900
And I intend to
make it so again.

174
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,023
Perhaps you find
the idea preposterous.

175
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,240
I no longer have
that luxury.

176
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,678
I'm truly sorry to hear
of your loss, Mr. Oak,

177
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,213
but if our reversal
of fortune

178
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,647
causes you any embarrassment...

179
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,983
Not at all, ma'am.

180
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,357
Billy Smallbury?
9 and 8 pence.

181
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,994
Joseph Poorgrass?

182
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,829
Go on, Joseph.

183
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,297
Go on, lad.

184
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,665
Hat off.

185
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,902
And what do you do, Joseph?

186
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,437
I does general things.

187
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,771
And in spring
I shoot the rooks

188
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,939
and help at
pig killing, sir.

189
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,841
I mean ma'am.

190
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,513
7 and 9 pence.
And another 9
because I'm new.

191
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,282
Thank you, ma'am.

192
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,488
Now, Fanny Robbin?

193
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,859
Where is Fanny Robbin?

194
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,928
Where is she?

195
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,298
She's run away, ma'am.

196
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,567
She's gone off
with a soldier, ma'am.

197
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,669
Not a soldier, a sergeant.

198
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,642
Bailiff Pennyways?

199
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,049
Here is 10 shillings
and a further 10.

200
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,018
Why?

201
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,621
This ends our association.
You are dismissed.

202
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,623
I beg pardon, miss?

203
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,791
When my uncle was alive,

204
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,993
this was a fine,
productive farm.

205
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,296
Since his death,
it has fallen into ruin.

206
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,832
I can only assume...
Now see here, miss.

207
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,067
You can't get rid
of people like that.

208
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,435
I have resolved to have
no bailiff at all,

209
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,505
Mr. Pennyways, if you'll
listen to me for a moment.

210
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,441
Mr. Pennyways,
a fire threatened
to destroy the barn

211
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,510
and you are nowhere
to be found.

212
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,418
I have no use for a man
like you, Mr. Pennyways.

213
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,553
You are dismissed.

214
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,898
Get out
while you can,
if I were you.

215
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,264
Now you've all met
our new shepherd, Mr. Oak.

216
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,000
You understand
your duties, Mr. Oak?

217
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,085
If I don't, I'll ask, ma'am.

218
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,060
From now on,
you have a mistress,
not a master.

219
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,396
I don't yet know
my talents in farming,

220
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,864
but I shall do my best.

221
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,367
Don't suppose,
because I'm a woman,

222
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,534
I don't know
the difference between

223
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,503
bad goings-on and good.

224
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,625
I shall be up
before you're awake.

225
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,814
I shall be a-field
before you are up.

226
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,378
It is my intention
to astonish you all.

227
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,882
Back to work, please.

228
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,437
Perhaps I should wait here?

229
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,605
No.

230
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,709
Nonsense, Liddy.
You're my companion.

231
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:32,843
All of these?

232
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,845
All of them.

233
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,481
Head high, Liddy.

234
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,323
If they stare,
do not hesitate.

235
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,026
Remember, we have as much
right to be here as anyone.

236
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,598
Good morning.

237
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,150
Liddy, if you lay things out.

238
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,718
Yes, miss.

239
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,590
Gentlemen, shall we
get back to business?

240
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,601
There you go, sir.

241
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,203
If you feel it,
you can feel the quality.

242
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,951
This is
fine grain, miss.
Thank you.

243
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,677
Perhaps we should
leave, miss.

244
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,949
But none of it
as good as this lot.

245
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,484
It's good stuff,
I'll grant you that.

246
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,585
Well, it's up to you.
If you wanna go elsewhere...

247
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:48,752
No, no, no...

248
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:49,987
Farmer Stone?

249
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,024
It's Miss Everdene.
Farmer Everdene's niece.

250
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,947
He talked about you with
such great admiration.

251
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,600
Of course, you're welcome
to try elsewhere,

252
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,968
but I think you'll find
the grain as good

253
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,603
as it's ever been.

254
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,642
Mr. Stone?
How much?

255
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,777
£5 a quarter.

256
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,713
£3-10 shillings.

257
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,147
It's the same grain,
Mr. Stone.

258
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,517
You paid my uncle £5.

259
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,552
£3-10.

260
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,623
This gentleman
will pay me the proper price.

261
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,060
Apparently not, no.

262
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,630
£4.
£4-10.

263
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,298
£4-05.

264
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,967
Perhaps I should move on.

265
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,037
Liddy, would you help me
with this gentleman?

266
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,672
Of course.

267
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,347
Perhaps you'd like a sample?

268
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,696
How much?
£5 a quarter.

269
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,079
Very well.

270
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,783
£4-10.

271
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:30,120
He's rich, he's handsome.
He sends
the local girls mad.

272
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,091
The Taylor sisters
worked on him for two years.

273
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,260
Jane Perkins spent £20
on new clothes

274
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,595
and might as well have

275
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,697
thrown the money
out the window.

276
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,736
It's said, when he was young,
his sweetheart jilted him.

277
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,340
People always say that.

278
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,977
Women don't jilt men.
Men jilt us.

279
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,813
Did someone
jilt you, miss?

280
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,015
Certainly not.

281
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,721
A man did ask
to marry me once.

282
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,022
Some time ago.

283
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,058
But I was too restless
to be tied down.

284
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,295
What a luxury,
to have a choice.

285
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,767
"Kiss my foot, sir,
my face is for mouths
of consequence."

286
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,769
It wasn't like that
at all.

287
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:20,838
Why?

288
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,407
Did you love him?

289
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,343
No, but I rather liked him.

290
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,847
Anyway, it's impossible now.

291
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,862
Mr. Boldwood.

292
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,378
I had no intention
of shooting you.

293
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,171
It's Miss Everdene.
Your neighbor.

294
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,741
Farmer Everdene's niece.

295
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,146
I'm managing the farm
alone now.

296
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,348
Perhaps you've heard?

297
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,783
Yes, I'm sure
you'll do very well.

298
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,452
In the circumstances.

299
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,826
Well, as you say,
we're neighbors.

300
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,307
Look what
I've got here.

301
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,710
What is it?

302
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,977
Listen to this.

303
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,813
"The rose is red
The violet blue

304
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:38,716
"Carnation's sweet
And so are you"

305
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,720
It's a Valentine's card.

306
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,888
I'm going to send it
to Joseph Poorgrass

307
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,791
just to see
the look of panic
on his stupid face.

308
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,294
Poor boy. It's a little bit
far-fetched, isn't it?

309
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,864
What about Mr. Oak, then?

310
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,300
No. Not Mr. Oak.

311
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,036
Imagine if we sent it
to Mr. Boldwood.

312
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,941
Ignoring you like that,
all high and mighty.

313
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,176
Mr. Boldwood?

314
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,513
Perhaps not?

315
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,782
Why not?

316
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,144
Because I don't think
he'll see the humor.

317
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,919
Perhaps he wouldn't,

318
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,054
perhaps it's too much.

319
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,389
Mr. Boldwood.

320
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,458
You're right.
Perhaps it is.

321
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,428
So we're gonna toss for it.

322
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,529
Liddy!

323
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:26,864
Come on.

324
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,268
Open, Joseph.

325
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,303
No, Jan Coggan.

326
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,107
Open, Jan Coggan.
Closed, Boldwood.

327
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,612
Sergeant Troy, 11:00.

328
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,314
Yes, Sergeant Troy. And?

329
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,182
Miss Fanny Robbin.

330
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,852
Welcome.
Step down the front.

331
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,353
Where is she?

332
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,921
I don't know.

333
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,391
Here she comes.

334
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,178
Oh.

335
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,175
Sorry I'm late, old boy.

336
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,978
Not long now.

337
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,603
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here
in the sight...

338
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,543
I can only wait
a few more minutes.

339
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,078
She'll be here.

340
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,473
What do you think is happening?

341
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,743
I don't think
she's coming, old boy.

342
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,376
Come on. Go on, off you go.
That's it. Go on.

343
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,444
Morning, my love.

344
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,013
Come on.

345
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,517
Bring them in, John.

346
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,057
Grab this one.

347
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,458
Miss Everdene's here now,

348
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,626
so you better do
your best work.

349
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,161
I'm looking at you, Coggan.

350
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,629
Yeah,
you keep quiet, Liddy.

351
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,040
What you doing?

352
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,310
Perhaps you'd care
to lend a hand?

353
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,080
You don't think I would?

354
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:11,281
No, you wouldn't.

355
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,084
Come here.

356
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,223
There,
she's getting in.

357
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,127
Well done, ma'am.

358
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,352
Gangway through.
Hey, Joseph. Joseph, look.

359
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,326
Good morning,
Mr. Boldwood.

360
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,830
Miss Everdene.

361
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,634
Mr. Boldwood wondered
if he might have a word
with you.

362
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:44,574
Mr. Boldwood. Of course.

363
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:50,180
One thousand acres.
A mix of arable and livestock.

364
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,249
Adjacent to Everdene.

365
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,852
An orchard. Glasshouse.

366
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,289
I have some interesting pigs.

367
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,827
Some other time, perhaps.

368
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,267
Thank you.

369
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,947
You have a very beautiful house.

370
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,720
Mr. Boldwood?

371
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,325
Miss Everdene.

372
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,461
I want

373
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,632
very much,
more than anything,

374
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,535
to have you as my wife.

375
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,306
Miss Everdene, marry me.

376
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,544
I...

377
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,315
I feel...

378
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,987
Though I respect you
very much,

379
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,659
I do not feel
what would justify me

380
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,599
in accepting your offer.

381
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,373
I have known
disappointments before,

382
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,743
but I would never have
asked in this instance

383
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,445
had I not been, er,

384
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,348
led to believe...

385
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,286
Unless...
Unless I am mistaken.

386
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,522
The valentine.

387
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,392
No, you're not mistaken,

388
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,394
but I should
never have sent it.

389
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,465
Forgive me, it was
thoughtless to disturb
your peace of mind.

390
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,267
So you meant it
as a joke?

391
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,403
No. No, not as a joke.

392
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,775
Not exactly.
It was impetuous.

393
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,943
I see.

394
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,647
Perhaps you think
I am too old?

395
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,569
But I will care for you
more than anyone
your own age.

396
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,491
I'm sure you would...
I will protect you.

397
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,355
You shall have dresses,

398
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:16,459
a gig. Uh, a piano.

399
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,331
I amuse you?

400
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,301
No.

401
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,970
It's only...

402
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,340
I have a piano.

403
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,077
And I have my own farm.

404
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,813
And I have no need
for a husband,

405
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,917
no matter how honored
I am by the offer.

406
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,958
I think
I'd like to return home.

407
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,828
Yes, er... I'll, er...

408
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,898
I'll get someone
to drive you.

409
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,368
Mr. Boldwood,
I've made you miserable.

410
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,803
It was very wicked of me.

411
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,771
Will you reconsider?

412
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,442
Let me think.

413
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,113
Yes.

414
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,483
Yes, I'll give you time.

415
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,119
I will wait.

416
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,632
You're working late,
Mr. Oak.

417
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,453
Will you teach me?

418
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,756
Here.

419
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,759
Spin the wheel.

420
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,561
Incline it, like that.

421
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,230
And slide it gently.
Spin the wheel.

422
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,171
Bit faster. Like that.
Very good.

423
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,840
Now slide it.

424
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,509
I... It's...

425
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,912
Getting stuck.

426
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,654
I wanted to ask,

427
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,557
did the men say anything
today about Mr. Boldwood?

428
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,691
They did.

429
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,026
What did they say?

430
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,096
That you'd be married
before the end of the year.

431
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,931
Come on.

432
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,442
Well, I'd like you
to contradict it,
to the men.

433
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,571
Well, Bathsheba...

434
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,473
"Miss Everdene," please.

435
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,611
If Mr. Boldwood did really
speak of marriage,

436
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,773
I'm not going to tell
stories just to please you.

437
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,717
I just said I wanted you
to mention to the men

438
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,886
that it might not be true
I was going to marry him.

439
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,456
I could say that
if you wish.

440
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,458
But I could also
give you an opinion
on what you've done.

441
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,060
I dare say,
but I don't want
your opinion, Mr. Oak.

442
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,731
I suppose not.

443
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,178
Well, what is your opinion?

444
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,014
That you're greatly
to blame
for playing pranks

445
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,083
on a man like Mr. Boldwood.

446
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,820
Your actions were
unworthy of you.

447
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,722
Unworthy?

448
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,526
May I ask
where my unworthiness lies?

449
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,167
In rejecting you,
perhaps?

450
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,397
I've long given up
thinking of that.

451
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,600
Or wishing it, either.

452
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,837
But I will say this.

453
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,273
Leading on a man
you don't care for
is beneath you.

454
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,679
I cannot allow a man
to criticize
my private conduct.

455
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:59,601
You will please
leave the farm
at the end of the week.

456
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,958
I'd prefer to go at once.

457
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
Then go. I never want to
see your face again.

458
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,798
Very well,
Miss Everdene.

459
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,338
Whoa, there we are. There.

460
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,610
What's wrong with them?

461
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,946
They broke fence
and ate the young clover.

462
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,147
Makes their stomachs swell.

463
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,686
Nothing.
The whole flock is blasted.

464
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,654
You mean they're all
going to die?

465
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,376
Most probably.
Another one
gone here, ma'am.

466
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,892
Only one way
of saving them.

467
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,628
You must pierce
their side with a tool.

468
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,898
A hollow tube.
Pricker inside.

469
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,700
Well, can you do it?

470
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,201
This one's still alive.

471
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,769
No.

472
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,638
Can I?
Oh, good Lord, no.

473
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,873
One inch to the right
or the left,

474
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,042
and you kill the ewe
for sure.

475
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,779
Not even a shepherd
can do it, as a rule.

476
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,048
Well, who, then?

477
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,399
Gabriel!

478
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,636
Gabriel!

479
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,704
Gabriel Oak, wait!

480
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,307
Miss Everdene needs you.

481
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,783
Why are you alone?
Did you find him?

482
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,418
Yes, miss.

483
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,787
So what did he say?

484
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,923
He said...

485
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,826
Joseph?

486
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,429
He said you're to go
in person

487
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,111
and request him civilly
in a proper manner.

488
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,934
Where does he get his airs?
I'll do no such thing.

489
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,271
He said you'd say that.

490
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:38,708
He said to reply,
"Beggars can't be choosers."

491
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,064
Mr. Oak.

492
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,967
Gabriel.

493
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,471
Gabriel.

494
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,848
Please don't
desert me, Gabriel.

495
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,145
I need your help.

496
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,267
Make room for me.

497
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,431
I wanna see.

498
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,932
No, don't you start,
Liddy, be quiet.

499
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,534
Find the spot.

500
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,438
Between the ribs.

501
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,909
Oh, Lord!
No, no, no, no, no.

502
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:21,477
Now...

503
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,946
I can see
his heart beating.

504
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,552
- Come on.
- Come on, girl.

505
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,288
Come on.

506
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,890
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right.

507
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,391
You all right?
You all right, Pixie?

508
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,926
Yeah, come on.

509
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:38,227
All right, Pixie! Pixie!

510
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,998
Hey! Come here!

511
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,411
Get out.

512
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,294
Please, quiet.

513
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,992
Miss. Mr. Boldwood is here.

514
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:19,095
Thank you. Thank you, Jan.
Jan, thank you.

515
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,233
Mr. Boldwood.

516
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,936
What a pleasant surprise.
Will you join us?

517
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,287
Nice to have you, sir.

518
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,926
A song, ma'am.

519
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,928
I have no voice.

520
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:55,531
Come on, ma'am,
you've got a lovely voice.

521
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,503
I thought we were
rather good together.

522
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,105
So did I.

523
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,141
We would make a fine duo.

524
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,077
I wanted to thank you
for not approaching me

525
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,678
on that subject again.

526
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,216
Well, it has not been easy.

527
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,726
Do you wish me to, er,

528
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,361
accompany you
back to the house?

529
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,631
No, I like to walk around
the farm every night

530
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,300
to make sure all is safe.

531
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,838
Then I...
I can walk with you.

532
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,939
I've done it
many times alone.

533
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,176
Good night, Mr. Boldwood.

534
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,578
You've been very kind.
A pleasure to see you.

535
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:35,384
Who are you?
I'm sorry.
I seem to be lost.

536
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,521
We're entangled.
Are you hurt?

537
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,289
No.

538
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,323
I'm looking for Weatherbury.

539
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,658
I hope I didn't startle you.

540
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,793
We've got
hitched together somehow.

541
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,428
Here, allow me.

542
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,831
No. No. Please,
let me do it myself.

543
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,235
If you lift your foot
for a moment.

544
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,218
Please don't stare.

545
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,554
I don't think I've ever seen
a face as beautiful as yours.

546
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,795
You shouldn't be here.
Please let me
have the lamp.

547
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,409
A mighty impressive
harvest this looks like.

548
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,355
Miss,

549
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,591
look.

550
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,396
Who is he, Liddy?

551
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,665
Sergeant Francis Troy.

552
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,787
Noble blood,
full of promise.
Very sharp and trim.

553
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,271
Well-educated.

554
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,473
There was good things
expected of him.

555
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,028
He threw it all in
to be a soldier.

556
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,412
Well, I won't have it.

557
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,780
What are you doing, miss?

558
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,949
I'm going to
tell him to leave.

559
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:23,259
I must absolutely insist
that you leave
at this very moment.

560
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,860
I can't.

561
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,595
Will you follow me, please?

562
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,784
What angers you, exactly?

563
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,320
Please.

564
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,055
What I said
or the way I said it?

565
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,657
You must know.

566
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,626
Who tells you
that you're beautiful.

567
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,329
Oh, not to my face, not...

568
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,930
But there is someone
who kisses you?

569
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,132
I've never been kissed.

570
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,841
Why couldn't you have just
passed by and said nothing?

571
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,544
Do you forgive me?

572
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,848
I do not.
Why?

573
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,484
Because the things you say...

574
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,420
I said that
you were beautiful.

575
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,593
I wonder if you fight
as well as you speak.

576
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:32,861
Better.

577
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:42,071
Meet me. Tomorrow.

578
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,374
I can't.

579
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,775
You don't want to?

580
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,344
Yes, but...

581
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,706
Then you must.
I mustn't.

582
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,547
Nobody would know.

583
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,918
Please go now.

584
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,387
Tomorrow.

585
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,389
8:00.

586
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,392
The hollow in the ferns.

587
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,613
Do you trust me?

588
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,549
I do.

589
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,190
I give you my word
as a soldier,

590
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:17,159
I will not harm you.

591
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,161
The sword is blunt,

592
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,631
but you must not flinch.

593
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,100
I'll try not to.

594
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,714
You cut my hair.

595
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,586
This sword could
skin you alive.

596
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,621
But you told me I was safe.

597
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:22,925
And you were.
Entirely safe.

598
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,661
I gave you my word.

599
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,698
Now I will take this.

600
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,977
Miss Everdene.

601
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,347
Perhaps I could
walk with you?

602
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,816
I'm quite happy
to walk by myself.

603
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,221
You should have nothing
to do with him.

604
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,009
He's not
good enough for you.

605
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,092
He's a perfectly decent man.

606
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,695
That's not what I believe.

607
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,031
Why? What have you heard?

608
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,236
You don't know him at all.
It's all rumors.

609
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:18,874
I like soldiers.
But not this one.

610
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:21,276
I believe him to have
no conscience at all.

611
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,846
Stay clear.
Don't listen to him.

612
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,348
Don't believe him.

613
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,016
Get rid of him.

614
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,185
And what is it to you?

615
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,157
I'm not such a fool
as to imagine

616
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:38,293
I might stand a chance now
that you are so above me.

617
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:41,963
But don't suppose
I'm content to stay
a nobody all my life.

618
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,659
One day I will leave you.
You can be sure of that.

619
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,903
But for now,
I care for you too much

620
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,072
to see you go to ruin
because of him.

621
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,876
So if you
don't mind, I'll...

622
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,980
I'll stay by your side.

623
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,151
Good evening.

624
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,371
<i>Mr. Boldwood,</i>

625
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,341
<i>you have been a dear friend
to me these past months.</i>

626
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:28,877
<i>And it is because
I value our friendship</i>

627
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:31,012
<i>so greatly that I am writing.</i>

628
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:35,016
<i>I am honored by your proposal</i>

629
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:37,352
<i>and have given it
much thought,</i>

630
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:39,921
<i>but I must tell you that,
to my own surprise,</i>

631
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,890
<i>I have undergone
what can only be described</i>

632
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:44,459
<i>as a change of heart</i>

633
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:47,028
<i>and I'm afraid
I cannot accept your offer.</i>

634
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,821
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

635
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,290
Where else would I be?

636
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,394
You ready?

637
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,932
Are you sure?

638
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:30,238
How does this sound?

639
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,242
Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

640
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,159
All right?

641
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,150
Walk on.

642
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,128
Gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

643
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:46,134
A short time ago,
I had the privilege

644
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:52,040
and the simple fortune
of meeting this angel.

645
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,209
Your mistress.

646
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,179
And now I stand before
you her husband,

647
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,548
your master,

648
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,552
and the proudest man
you will ever see.

649
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:09,057
So, please,
charge your glasses

650
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:14,095
and sing out
to my most beautiful wife,

651
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,233
Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

652
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,575
Miss Everdene,
there's going to be a storm.

653
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:31,379
Oak, you big lump. To me.

654
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,515
There's going to be a storm.

655
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:36,551
We need to protect the ricks
or we'll lose the harvest.

656
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,821
I need five to six men
for an hour, no more.

657
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:41,489
Frank,
perhaps we ought to...
No.

658
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:43,191
Darling, it's our
wedding celebration.

659
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,496
It will not rain tonight.
My wife forbids it.

660
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,166
Now if you'll excuse me.

661
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,202
Friends!

662
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,104
One more thing.

663
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:02,077
I may no longer
be Sergeant Troy,

664
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,214
but I remain a soldier
in this one respect!

665
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:10,852
The finest bottles
of French brandy,

666
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,223
a triple-strength dose
for every man.

667
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,759
Cheers! To your health!

668
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:58,686
Gabriel!

669
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:02,357
Gabriel!

670
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,927
What can I do?

671
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,862
It's too dangerous!

672
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:09,364
I'm coming up!

673
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:20,908
Hold it down.

674
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,878
Still no rain.

675
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,047
It'll come.

676
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:44,065
Come on, hold me!
Come here. Come here.

677
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,806
Come here. Come on.

678
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,529
Gabriel, I've been a fool.

679
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,966
I've always had contempt
for silly girls

680
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:22,470
dazzled by flattery
in a scarlet uniform and...

681
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:25,473
And now I've done
what I swore I would never do.

682
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,944
But he told me
about another woman,

683
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,514
a woman more beautiful
that he'd loved before,

684
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,116
and I couldn't bear it.

685
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,953
So somewhere between
jealousy and distraction,

686
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:40,121
I married him.

687
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:43,458
I don't want an opinion
on the subject, I just...

688
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,960
In fact, I forbid it.

689
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,733
Go to bed.

690
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,504
I'll finish it on my own.

691
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:58,973
Gabriel...

692
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,412
Thank you.

693
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,772
Sir?

694
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,010
Mr. Boldwood, sir!

695
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:40,081
I wanted to ensure your
mistress' crops were safe.

696
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,650
Good work, Gabriel.
She's lucky to have you.

697
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,020
Wait a moment, sir.

698
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,563
You seem unwell, sir.

699
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,865
You should go home.

700
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,768
Yes.

701
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,706
Yes, I will.

702
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,513
Oak.

703
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,552
You know that things
have not gone well
with me, lately.

704
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:23,124
I was going to get
a little settled in life.
But, er...

705
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,163
It was not to be.

706
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,602
I daresay
I'm something of a...

707
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,472
A joke about the parish.

708
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,843
But I do wanna make
one thing clear.

709
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,546
There was no jilting
on her part.

710
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:51,085
We were never engaged.
No matter what people say.

711
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,589
She promised me nothing.

712
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,096
And yet,

713
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,165
Gabriel,

714
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:10,938
I feel the most terrible grief.

715
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,714
Not a word to her.

716
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,651
We understand each other, yes?

717
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:26,554
Yes, sir.

718
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,674
Damn and bother!

719
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,779
Sit.

720
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,248
Stay. Now, turn around.

721
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:34,789
Can you spare a coin, please?

722
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,023
No, no.

723
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,662
Hit him!

724
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,030
Come on!

725
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,100
Knock him out!

726
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,036
Hit him!

727
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,110
Pay up. Pay up, Mr. Troy.

728
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,613
Just take it.

729
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:05,620
Sir, excuse me.

730
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,121
Could you spare a coin, please?

731
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,069
No.

732
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,793
Fanny?

733
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:21,969
Hello, Frank.

734
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,640
Hello.

735
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,343
You're so pale.

736
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,712
Oh, Frank.

737
01:17:31,714 --> 01:17:33,748
Darling, your hands are shaking.

738
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,184
I thought you said All Souls,
not All Saints.

739
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,086
I went to the wrong church.

740
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:44,425
When I got there, you'd gone.
And I don't blame you,

741
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,761
but it's been very hard,
Frank. I...

742
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,095
Not now.

743
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,799
My wife mustn't see you.

744
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,801
Your wife?

745
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,714
Mrs. Troy is very beautiful.

746
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,284
No more than you.

747
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:17,692
Frank, I must tell you,
I'm carrying your child.

748
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:18,859
What?

749
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,208
What if I told you that
I'd made a terrible mistake,

750
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,978
but that
I will make amends?

751
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,848
I swear on my life

752
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,417
I will find a home
for you and our baby.

753
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,219
You've sworn before, Frank.

754
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,855
No, this time...
This time...

755
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,065
Go to Budmouth.
Stay at the Union.

756
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,034
The workhouse, Frank?

757
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:02,036
Tonight, just tonight.
One night.

758
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:04,772
And then meet me tomorrow
at 10:00 on the bridge.

759
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,374
I'll bring you
all the money I have

760
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,776
and I'll find a home for you.

761
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,078
You'll be safe, my darling.

762
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,782
And I promise you,
I promise you

763
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:16,517
I will make amends.

764
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,824
Get back in the carriage.

765
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,793
Do you know
who that woman is?

766
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,294
I do.

767
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:28,829
Who is she?

768
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:29,964
She's nothing.

769
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,200
Get back in the carriage.

770
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,536
Frank...

771
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,374
Could you let me have £20?

772
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,445
What for?

773
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,914
I need it.

774
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,986
If you continue to gamble,
we will lose the farm.

775
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:00,221
It's not for gambling.

776
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:01,555
What's it for?

777
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:02,623
Why should it matter
what it's for?

778
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,024
It's my money.

779
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,627
I work for it, don't I?

780
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,196
No. You don't.

781
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,132
Not proper farm work.

782
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,403
Don't do something
you'll regret.

783
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,309
The money is required
for farm expenses.

784
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,058
No mistake, Mr. Oak.

785
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,994
This was Miss Robbin's
last known abode.

786
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:15,029
Fanny was my uncle's servant

787
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:16,751
and we shall treat her
with respect.

788
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,967
Perhaps we should
take her to the church,

789
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:21,468
just for tonight.

790
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,704
No, bring her inside, please.

791
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,993
What did she die of, Liddy?

792
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:49,463
I don't know, miss.

793
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,334
There were rumors, but...

794
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,004
Fanny had a sweetheart,
didn't she?

795
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,106
Yes, miss.

796
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,142
A soldier.

797
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,983
Please,
come and sit
upstairs with me.

798
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,269
I seem to cry a great deal
these days.

799
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,374
I never used to cry at all.

800
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,385
Good night, Liddy.

801
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,088
'Night, miss.

802
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,279
What?

803
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,247
Who is it?

804
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,249
I can't say...

805
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,117
Stay, stay. Stay.

806
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,172
Don't kiss them, Frank.

807
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,875
I'm still your wife.

808
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,752
This woman, dead as she is,

809
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:31,458
is more to me
than you ever were,
or are, or can be.

810
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,163
You are nothing to me now.

811
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,233
Nothing.

812
01:27:47,962 --> 01:27:49,930
Mrs. Troy?

813
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,702
I'm afraid...

814
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,971
I'm afraid
your husband has drowned.

815
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:33,367
That's a great
responsibility, sir.

816
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:34,534
Nonsense.

817
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,836
No reason why a man
of your ability

818
01:29:35,838 --> 01:29:38,405
shouldn't be able
to superintend two farms.

819
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:39,673
And why shouldn't there be
stronger links

820
01:29:39,675 --> 01:29:41,541
between our establishments?

821
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:45,412
Think of it.
Two thousand acres
under your sole charge.

822
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:47,447
A share of my profits.

823
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:48,482
Miss Everdene needs me here.

824
01:29:48,484 --> 01:29:50,016
And her farm
will have priority.

825
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:51,551
I'd still need
Miss Everdene's permission.

826
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,652
But, of course.

827
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:53,820
Of course,
I wouldn't dare do anything

828
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,722
without her blessing. And,

829
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,158
if it'll help
sway your decision,

830
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,898
there's an old comrade
of yours here.

831
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,101
Georgie!

832
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:09,569
Had to go all the way
to Norcombe Hill

833
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,537
to find this old fella.

834
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:11,738
You pleased?

835
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,007
Yes, sir, very much.

836
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:16,676
And I'll have your
decision soon, yes?

837
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:18,645
You will, sir.

838
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,680
Hey, Georgie.

839
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:24,851
Come on. Come on.

840
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:36,530
Come on! Come on!

841
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,999
Gabriel,
you're getting on
in the world.

842
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,737
Of course you must
accept the offer.

843
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,872
Only with your approval.

844
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,041
If I lose the farm,
there may be no future

845
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:50,143
for any of us here.

846
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,712
You know where
my loyalty lies.

847
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:57,584
You're a man of great talent.

848
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:01,221
I've no desire
to hold you back.

849
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Thank you.

850
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:20,907
Come on, Georgie. Come on.

851
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:30,250
Forgive me.
I understand there are debts.

852
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,253
Your late husband.

853
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:37,524
Perhaps... Perhaps we should
change the subject.

854
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:38,925
Perhaps I can help.

855
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:46,666
Mr. Boldwood,
that's a very kind offer,

856
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,068
but I would never dream
of accepting any money.

857
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:55,642
I am a middle-aged man

858
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,280
willing to protect you
for the rest of your life.

859
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:06,653
You may run your farm,
if you wish. Without risk.

860
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:10,290
I'll pay your

861
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,627
departed husband's debts

862
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:15,695
and guarantee
its financial stability.

863
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,299
It can be your pastime.

864
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:24,204
Of course,
we'd need to wait,

865
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,740
for propriety's sake.

866
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,209
But when you're ready,

867
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:32,145
I'm offering you shelter.

868
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:37,150
Comfort. A safe harbor.

869
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:41,988
As my wife.

870
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,862
You must at least admire
my persistence.

871
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:53,567
I do.

872
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:55,609
And like me?
Yes.

873
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:59,239
And respect me?

874
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:01,241
Yes. Very much.

875
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:03,710
Which is it?
Like or respect?

876
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:10,617
It is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings

877
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:13,186
in a language
chiefly made by men
to express theirs.

878
01:33:13,188 --> 01:33:15,889
If you worry about a lack
of passion on your part,

879
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:17,724
a lack of, er,

880
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:21,628
desire,

881
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,265
if you worry about marrying me

882
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:28,201
merely out of guilt,

883
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:30,103
and, er,

884
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:35,275
pity and compromise, well...

885
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:38,144
I don't mind.

886
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:44,250
When must you give
your answer?

887
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:45,819
By Christmas.

888
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,708
It's a terrible responsibility.

889
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,761
I hold that man's future
in my hands.

890
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:57,697
His sanity, too, perhaps.

891
01:33:57,699 --> 01:33:58,965
Could you care for him?

892
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:01,167
You may suppose
love is wanting.

893
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:06,239
But love's a worn-out,
miserable thing for me now.

894
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,208
Why are you asking me?

895
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,649
I need someone who's objective.

896
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,916
Indifferent.

897
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,221
Then I'm afraid
you're asking the wrong man.

898
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:41,174
Good evening, Mr. Oak.

899
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:44,344
Good evening.

900
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:03,963
That's it.

901
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:05,031
Mind.

902
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:43,103
I appreciate
you coming along, Oak.

903
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:44,404
Ah!

904
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,773
Yes, very good.
Well done. Erm...

905
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,895
Just more... More things.
Yes, sir.

906
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:56,282
So what do you think?

907
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,853
I'm not in the habit
of organizing parties.

908
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,355
Perhaps we should make it
an annual event.

909
01:36:02,357 --> 01:36:03,490
Every Christmas Eve.

910
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,892
I've invited
the whole village.

911
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:08,895
Do you think
Miss Everdene will come?

912
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,430
I'm sure she will.

913
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:12,899
Yes.

914
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,468
And you'll come too, I hope.

915
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:19,272
I know Miss Everdene
would like you to be here.

916
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:21,274
Perhaps,
for an hour or so.

917
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:29,182
Look, I'm shaking.
I'm so nervous.

918
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,352
Gabriel, will you...

919
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:34,154
As well as you can, please.

920
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:35,922
I'll try.

921
01:36:35,924 --> 01:36:38,858
Is there a knot
that's particularly
fashionable?

922
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:42,896
You're asking the wrong man.

923
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:45,899
What about women?

924
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:48,802
Does a woman keep her promise?

925
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:51,871
She has promised?

926
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,407
An implied promise.

927
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,811
Once again, I'm...

928
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,212
Will she do what's right?

929
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:04,022
If it's not inconvenient to her.

930
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:07,153
Oak, you've become
quite cynical lately.

931
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:10,123
She never promised
that first time.

932
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:13,393
Therefore, she has
never broken her promise.

933
01:37:14,461 --> 01:37:16,821
She hasn't promised
this time, either.

934
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,533
But she will. Tonight.

935
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:22,502
I know she will.

936
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:25,939
And when she does...

937
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:35,548
I wanted to tell you
in advance, Gabriel,

938
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:40,086
because I... I believe
I know your secret.

939
01:37:43,324 --> 01:37:45,859
I've seen you together.

940
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,395
The way you speak to her.

941
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:52,098
And watch her.

942
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:55,869
And look after her.

943
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:58,438
And I know her, er,

944
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:03,409
profound affection for you.

945
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:06,246
You've behaved like a man,

946
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,882
and as the successful rival,

947
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:11,951
successful through
your kindness,

948
01:38:11,953 --> 01:38:12,953
I wish to tell you

949
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:17,957
I am profoundly grateful.

950
01:38:22,097 --> 01:38:24,564
The cook
would like a word, sir.

951
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,001
Kiss me. Joseph.

952
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:37,036
No, please don't.
Liddy, don't.

953
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:02,095
Would you excuse me?

954
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,036
I've come to say good night.

955
01:40:10,038 --> 01:40:12,271
Go back and talk
to the poor things.

956
01:40:12,273 --> 01:40:14,273
You've broken their hearts.

957
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:17,176
I don't suit
this kind of affair.

958
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:20,446
No. Nor do I.

959
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:23,583
I wish I could go, too.

960
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:34,627
I must go.

961
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:37,530
Not before you've danced.
Both of you.

962
01:40:37,532 --> 01:40:39,098
I insist.

963
01:40:42,102 --> 01:40:43,102
Mr. Oak?

964
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,107
Thank you.

965
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:18,638
Tell me what to do.

966
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,178
Gabriel?

967
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,087
Do what is right.

968
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:39,792
Sorry, excuse me.

969
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:26,639
Frank.

970
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:30,209
Black suits you.

971
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:34,147
Although a little premature.

972
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:41,320
You're alive.

973
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:45,658
And here I am.
Pulled from the sea.

974
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:49,287
Some fishermen found me
and brought me to shore.

975
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:53,344
Then I discovered
I was dead
and found I preferred it.

976
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:56,235
For a while, anyway.

977
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,204
Why have you come back?

978
01:42:58,206 --> 01:42:59,772
The strangest thing.

979
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,742
I missed you.

980
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,946
You don't seem
very happy to see me.

981
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:09,682
You said
I was nothing to you.

982
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:17,456
Well, then.
Honesty at all times.

983
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:21,327
I find myself
in need of money.

984
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:23,663
I gave up
my profession for you,

985
01:43:23,665 --> 01:43:25,531
and it seems a little harsh

986
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:26,866
that you have
a farm and a house

987
01:43:26,868 --> 01:43:29,235
while I'm living off nothing.

988
01:43:29,237 --> 01:43:30,303
There is no money.

989
01:43:30,305 --> 01:43:31,971
Then sell the farm.

990
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:45,351
Come home.

991
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,424
No.

992
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:56,796
I said, come home.

993
01:43:58,999 --> 01:44:01,467
I'm your husband
and you'll obey me!

994
01:44:18,285 --> 01:44:19,685
Oh, my God.

995
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:50,576
Let me see.

996
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:54,480
If it's any consolation,

997
01:45:54,482 --> 01:45:56,349
his life will be spared.

998
01:45:58,385 --> 01:45:59,785
Crime of passion.

999
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,514
Morning, Liddy.

1000
01:46:30,817 --> 01:46:32,518
It's a fine harvest, ma'am.

1001
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,520
Best we've had in years.

1002
01:46:34,522 --> 01:46:35,855
Will we have it all over
before the dew?

1003
01:46:35,857 --> 01:46:39,125
We will indeed, ma'am.
Luck's been on our side.

1004
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:48,167
Come, Liddy, give me a hand.

1005
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,828
I'm sorry I startled you.

1006
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:19,131
I wanted to
tidy up for them.

1007
01:47:19,133 --> 01:47:21,253
I haven't been here for so long.

1008
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:26,005
Are you going in?

1009
01:47:26,973 --> 01:47:29,642
Rehearsals.
I sing bass in the choir.

1010
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:31,811
Yes, I've heard you.

1011
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:34,847
Then I apologize.

1012
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:41,454
I've been hoping to get
a chance to talk to you.

1013
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:45,891
We've... We've not spoken
as much as I'd have liked.

1014
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,594
No.

1015
01:47:57,137 --> 01:47:59,572
I'm leaving England.

1016
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:04,810
Leaving?

1017
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:08,080
Going to America.

1018
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,584
There's a boat
leaving Bristol
in four days' time.

1019
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:13,185
I'll be on it.

1020
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:16,140
Now that the farm
is secure.

1021
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:19,258
I understand I should
give you notice.

1022
01:48:21,528 --> 01:48:24,597
No. You must go
when you want.

1023
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:31,604
I'll leave first thing tomorrow.

1024
01:48:31,606 --> 01:48:33,105
No fuss.

1025
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:36,275
I think that's best.

1026
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:24,750
Gabriel!

1027
01:50:30,056 --> 01:50:31,390
Gabriel.

1028
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:33,692
Wait.

1029
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:53,831
You'll think I'm strange, but...

1030
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:57,416
I've been worried.
Have I offended you somehow?

1031
01:50:57,418 --> 01:50:58,917
No, not at all.

1032
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:01,754
Is it money?

1033
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:04,723
I'll pay you
whatever you want.

1034
01:51:04,725 --> 01:51:06,258
I don't need money now.

1035
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:08,927
A formal partnership, then?

1036
01:51:08,929 --> 01:51:10,729
Nor a partnership.

1037
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:13,966
The farm
belongs to you alone.

1038
01:51:13,968 --> 01:51:16,268
It's the finest farm
for miles around.

1039
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:18,437
Then why else
are you leaving?

1040
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:20,272
I said
I'd leave you one day.

1041
01:51:24,344 --> 01:51:26,712
Well, you must not go.

1042
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:28,881
You forbid me?

1043
01:51:28,883 --> 01:51:30,349
Yes, if you like.

1044
01:51:31,117 --> 01:51:32,785
I forbid you.

1045
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:37,890
It's time for you
to fight your own battles.

1046
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:40,459
And win them, too.

1047
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,817
So we should
say good-bye, then?

1048
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,734
I suppose so.

1049
01:51:59,412 --> 01:52:00,746
Gabriel, wait.

1050
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:07,286
Thank you, Gabriel.

1051
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:11,395
You've believed in me
and fought for me

1052
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:13,792
and stood by my side when

1053
01:52:13,794 --> 01:52:16,061
all the rest of the world
is against me.

1054
01:52:18,164 --> 01:52:20,466
And we've been through
so much together.

1055
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:27,398
Wasn't I your
first sweetheart?

1056
01:52:29,943 --> 01:52:31,810
Weren't you mine?

1057
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:40,819
And now I'd have to
go on without you.

1058
01:52:45,058 --> 01:52:47,092
If I knew...

1059
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:53,932
If I knew that you would

1060
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:56,769
let me love you
and marry you...

1061
01:52:56,771 --> 01:52:58,270
But you will never know.

1062
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:01,907
Why not?

1063
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:05,277
Because you never ask!

1064
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:07,813
Would you say no again?

1065
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,116
I don't know.

1066
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:14,520
Probably.

1067
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,228
So why don't you?

1068
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,899
Ask me.

1069
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,404
Ask me.

1070
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,410
Ask me, Gabriel.

1071
