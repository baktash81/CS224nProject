Okay

16
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,929
A goldfish.

17
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,080
It's stuck.

18
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,899
That was weird.

19
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,500
OW!

20
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:24,070
Is it dead?

21
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,190
It licked me.  It's alive.

22
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:35,360
Sosuke, we're Leaving!

23
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,259
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

24
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,139
This wind feels strange.
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

25
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,419
Did you find her?

26
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,129
What, captured by a human?

27
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:18,830
This is bad. ...very bad.

28
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,789
Are you dead?

29
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,340
You're alive!

30
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,649
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

31
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,049
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

32
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,690
A goldfish?

33
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,200
Down by the rocks.

34
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,419
I'm sorry, but you can't
use weed killer here.

35
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,870
Heavens no! This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.

36
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:57,669
As Long as
it's not weed killer.

37
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,470
Good day!

38
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,539
This is very bad.

39
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,009
What a creepy guy.

40
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,350
But don't you say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

41
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,929
I won't.

42
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,580
Are you taking
that to school?

43
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,059
Won't the teacher complain?

44
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,100
Don't worry..
I'll take care of you.

45
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,769
She's cute!

46
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,450
They're using the dry dock.

47
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,570
Here, eat this
before we get there.

48
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,750
Maybe she's hungry.

49
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:47,919
Want some?

50
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,590
Hey, my cut is gone!

51
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,590
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

52
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,320
She's really special!
She can do magic.

53
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,659
She fixed my cut.

54
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,809
Want some ham?

55
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,750
- Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
- That makes two of us.

56
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:00,820
Oh no.

57
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,159
Disgusting!

58
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,220
Hurry, Lisa!

59
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,740
Such filth! Intolerable!

60
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,240
Good morning!

61
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,649
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.

62
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,139
- I'll drop you here.
- Okay.

63
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,309
Have fun.

64
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,000
See you.

65
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,850
Morning.
Sorry I'm Late.

66
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,850
Could you get
Noriko's wheelchair?

67
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:03,080
I

68
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,100
Good morning.. Sosuke.

69
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,009
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you Later.

70
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,370
My!

71
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,980
Hello, Sosuke.

72
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,480
Can't talk now, Toki

73
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,210
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

74
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,220
I know!

75
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,960
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.

76
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,570
What if a cat comes?

77
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,919
Stay here, I'll be right back.

78
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,620
See you later.

79
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,759
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.

80
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,559
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

81
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,600
Good morning.. teacher.

82
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,000
Hello Sosuke.

83
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:29,639
How are you?

84
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,980
- Sosuke
- Kumiko.

85
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,379
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.

86
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:41,620
Oh.

87
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,480
Let's play, Sosuke!

88
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,679
Not now. I'm busy.

89
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,350
How come?

90
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,990
- I told you, I'm busy.
- You're no fun.

91
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,220
Yeah!

92
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,220
Ponyo!

93
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,029
Sosuke!

94
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,259
Kumiko.

95
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,859
What's that?

96
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,059
You're not supposed to
bring stuff.

97
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:33,529
But these trees
aren't on school grounds.

98
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,940
Show me.

99
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,670
Oh, a goldfish.

100
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,109
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.

101
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,509
Ponyo? I want to see!

102
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,869
Promise not to tell?

103
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,240
I promise.

104
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,259
Isn't she cute?

105
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,460
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.

106
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,220
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

107
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,170
I'll give you
some more water.

108
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,250
Ponyo!

109
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,259
You scared me.

110
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,259
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.

111
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,309
But he's supposed
to be in school

112
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,640
I must be hearing things.

113
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:25,009
Here I am, Yoshie.

114
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:30,349
I knew I heard your voice.

115
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,759
Do I have a secret?

116
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,789
Yes

117
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,420
Bingo!

118
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,289
Okay, what colour is my secret?

119
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,799
- Red!
- Red!

120
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,269
Good guess.

121
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,599
How'd you know?

122
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,009
Show us.

123
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,569
All right.

124
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:55,549
Oh, how pretty!

125
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,210
Very cute!

126
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,609
Her name is Ponyo.

127
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,190
She loves ham
and she can do magic.

128
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,680
I cut my thumb,
but she fixed it.

129
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,559
I wonder if she'd
fix our Legs.

130
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,690
We could run around
just like you.

131
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,839
Well .. I'd have
to ask Ponyo first.

132
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,170
Can I take a look?

133
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,569
Sure, Toki

134
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,210
Heavens, it has a face

135
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:35,049
Put it back
before it brings a tsunami !

136
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,849
You're so superstitious, Toki

137
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,759
That's what
the old stories say.

138
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,859
Fish like that are bad luck.

139
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,769
The tsunami! It's here!

140
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,910
The tsunami is here!

141
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,609
What's wrong, Toki?

142
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,180
Just look at my clothes!

143
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,490
Sosuke!

144
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,519
Sosuke!

145
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,339
Sosuke!

146
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:29,200
Come back here and apologise!

147
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,279
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

148
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,519
Sosuke.

149
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,619
Sosuke.

150
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,960
Ponyo!

151
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,769
Ponyo. Sosuke.

152
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,380
Ponyo. .Loves.

153
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,569
..SOsuke!

154
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,589
I Love you too.

155
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,650
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

156
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,789
Ponyo!

157
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,900
Ponyo!

158
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,240
Ponyo!

159
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,170
Sosuke!

160
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,309
Ponyo!

161
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,029
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.

162
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,410
It just can't be helped.

163
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:25,309
Ponyo was born in the sea.

164
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,480
She went back home,.
that's all

165
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:31,849
Anyway, let's hope
that creepy guy is gone.

166
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:33,849
One lick?

167
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,390
Hurry, it's melting!

168
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,170
Not bad!

169
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,640
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.

170
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,809
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

171
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,369
No more ocean today, okay?

172
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:51,200
Sosuke?

173
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:53,569
Time to come inside.

174
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:58,569
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

175
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,069
There's only one way
to find out.

176
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,819
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi

177
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,390
Hello?

178
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,259
Yes.. it's me.

179
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,970
Yes, I'm fine.

180
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:32,410
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

181
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,910
Okay. Here's Lisa.

182
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,420
Koichi? Yes.
What?!

183
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,420
Can't you get out of it?

184
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,319
Fine. Leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

185
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,109
I give up!

186
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,990
Why bother ?

187
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,589
C'mon Sosuke,
Let's eat out!

188
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:58,430
I want to eat here.

189
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,220
There he is!

190
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:31,130
Turn Off the lights, Lisa.

191
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,059
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

192
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,029
Your wife must be upset.

193
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,170
He says he's sorry.

194
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,069

THANKS

226
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,490
LOVE AND KISSES

227
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:24,380
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.

228
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:29,680
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

229
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,799
I

230
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:36,819
I

231
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,720
Okay, let's cheer up!

232
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,269
'I'm happy as can be. .. '

233
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:49,500
OW!.

234
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,140
Don't worry.. Sosuke.

235
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,369
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

236
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,180
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

237
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:12,589
This is all my fault.

238
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,329
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

239
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,430
How often have I
warned you about humans?

240
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,940
Their very breath is polluted.

241
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,440
Come, you must eat.

242
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,079
Can't you hear me.. Brunhilde?

243
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,380
I want ham!

244
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,849
Ham? What on earth
have you been doing?

245
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,789
Answer me, Brunhilde!

246
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:43,319
My name's not Brunhilde.
It's Ponyo.

247
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,319
Ponyo?

248
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,900
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

249
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,130
I want to be human!

250
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,900
Human?

251
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:55,970
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

252
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,539
They rob the sea of life.

253
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,170
I was human myself. .once.

254
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,880
I finally escaped
that awful heritage.

255
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:08,680
I want hands!

256
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,319
I don't like this!

257
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,990
I want legs like Sosuke!

258
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,890
Of all the nonsense!

259
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,549
Look at me!
Hands and feet!

260
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:44,710
NO.. .don't tell me
you tasted human blood!

261
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,329
Wanna see Sosuke!

262
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,390
No! His blood has
deranged your DNA!

263
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,430
Revert. revert.

264
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,279
Go back. .go back!

265
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:08,180
It's not working.
I need more power.

266
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,720
Let me out!

267
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:29,099
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!

268
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,140
Just like her mother. .so strong.

269
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,789
She should remain
innocent and pure forever.

270
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,480
I can't hold her for long.

271
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,349
I need her mother's help.

272
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,289
No! My elixir  is
too strong for you!

273
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:31,700
Shoo! Go away!

274
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,990
My crab shields were weakening.

275
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:37,460
I nearly upset
nature's balance.

276
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:38,799
I must stay calm.

277
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,130
When I think
of meeting HER again. !

278
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,940
This batch should be ready.

279
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,079
No leaks down here.

280
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,490
This door is loose.

281
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,460
I'll fix it later.

282
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,039
If even one creature
got in here. !

283
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,300
Superb!

284
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,929
I feel the ocean's power
in my very DNA.

285
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,900
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

286
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,070
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Era!

287
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:01,340
This revolting era
of Man will be over.

288
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:08,030
Better fix this door.

289
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,210
Teeth!

290
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,719
I'm going back to Sosuke!

291
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,769
A waterspout?

292
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:18,139
Captain, look there!

293
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,750
- Tsunami!
- Turn her into the waves!

294
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,340
What's that?

295
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,920
Captain!
Radio's out.. the radar too!

296
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:43,070
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!

297
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,239
- Bye-bye.
- See you tomorrow.

298
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:59,789
- Thanks.
- Take care.

299
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:03,980
Do you want
to wait here for Lisa?

300
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,289
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

301
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,989
Goodbye.

302
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,050
Be careful out there.

303
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:49,329
I

304
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:56,900
Sorry.. Sosuke.
The power's out.

305
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,139
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?

306
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,869
Go home.. Lisa.
We'll be fine.

307
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,349
Are you sure?

308
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,119
Don't worry,
We'll be just fine.

309
00:41:08,489 --> 00:41:13,550
Were spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.

310
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,219
Wait for me, Sosuke.

311
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,130
Yoshie.

312
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,869
Why, Sosuke.
It's so dark, I didn't see you.

313
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:38,480
This is for you.

314
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,690
My, what is it?

315
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,449
One for you.. Noriko.

316
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,059
Thank you,

317
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,659
Can't see a thing.

318
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,659
This is such foolishness!

319
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,760
I don't want
to spend the night.

320
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:03,909
- Oh good, the power's on.
- It's a goldfish!

321
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:08,699
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

322
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,579
Extremely powerful 
micro-typhoon.

323
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,250
Ships should exercise
extreme caution.

324
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,409
This TV is useless.

325
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,559
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

326
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,690
You should go home, Sosuke.

327
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:30,329
Your goldfish will I bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.

328
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,679
Here's yours, Toki.

329
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:47,579
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

330
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,769
Like this.

331
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,320
I know!
It's a grasshopper.

332
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,619
No, the Koganie Maru.

333
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,300
That's your father's ship.

334
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:01,860
Still looks like
a grasshopper.

335
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,139
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

336
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,510
Goodbye, everybody.

337
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,840
Goodbye.

338
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,909
Don't let the wind
blow you away!

339
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:18,650
Climb over.

340
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,190
The phones are out too.

341
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:50,639
The sea is puffed up!

342
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,010
Will the ships sink?

343
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:02,090
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

344
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:17,260
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Seat belt!

345
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:30,340
You've got to turn back!

346
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:33,079
People are going
to the shelters.

347
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,789
But there are people
at the senior centre!

348
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,869
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

349
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:45,269
I've just got to get home.

350
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,969
You'd better go
around the mountain.

351
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,869
Here we go.. Sosuke.

352
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,710
No! Stop!

353
00:44:55,849 --> 00:44:57,809
Look out for that wave!

354
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,179
Here it comes!

355
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,789
Run for it, Lisa!

356
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:49,760
- The fish are following us.
- Seat belt.. Sosuke!

357
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,139
Hold on tight!

358
00:46:57,369 --> 00:46:59,090
That wave won't quit!

359
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,480
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

360
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:19,889
Where?

361
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:30,269
The sea keeps rising.

362
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:32,869
Where did you see her?

363
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,610
Running On top of a fish.

364
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:36,969
A fish!?

365
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:42,869
Come on, Sosuke.

366
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,269
Hang on, Sosuke!
Were almost home.

367
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,949
A little girl !

368
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,320
Here.. you'd better
come with us.

369
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,789
Stay there, Sosuke.

370
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,280
Sosuke, do you know her?

371
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:53,940
Ponyo?

372
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,110
Yes.. it's me!

373
00:49:57,449 --> 00:49:59,139
It's you!

374
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,489
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

375
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:17,769
I made it !

376
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,119
Now I listen, children.

377
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,800
No matter how strange
everything seems.

378
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,019
..we have to stay calm.

379
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,690
Now be good.

380
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,869
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

381
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:56,699
Here Ponyo.. you hold the light.

382
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,409
I'll bring you a towel

383
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:21,860
C'mon, Ponyo!

384
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,289
It smells just I like you!

385
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:29,940
Ouch!

386
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,039
Ponyo!

387
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:39,550
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.

388
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,849
Such pretty red hair!

389
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:50,320
But your clothes are dry.

390
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:54,820
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

391
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,329
I like this!

392
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:03,840
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?

393
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,340
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

394
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,880
Coming!

395
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,469
Think we'll have water?

396
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:11,550
Sure!

397
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,969
Sure!

398
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:16,579
Water!

399
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:18,449
Water!

400
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,750
We have a tank outside.

401
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,619
What about the gas?

402
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,059
Presto!

403
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,090
All right!

404
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,320
All right!

405
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:31,460
It's propane.

406
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,869
Okay, take your seats.

407
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,900
Okay

408
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,949
Over here, Ponyo.

409
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,309
Sit down, like this.

410
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:52,349
Put your stuff down.

411
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,219
You need your hands.

412
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,000
I have feet!

413
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,260
wow!

414
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:07,400
What are you two doing?

415
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,429
Her feet are like hands.

416
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:31,460
There you go.

417
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,340
This is the best!

418
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,719
That hit the spot.

419
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,460
What shall we do now?

420
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,420
I want ham!

421
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,860
She's crazy about ham.

422
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,389
Then let's eat.

423
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,570
But first let's start
the generator.

424
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,130
We need electricity
to talk to Koichi

425
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:53,739
Koichi is my father.

426
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,570
Is he a bad sorcerer?

427
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:59,150
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.

428
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,750
What about your father.. Ponyo?

429
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:05,110
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.

430
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,219
I ran away.

431
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:11,360
What about your mother?

432
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:14,789
I love my mother!

433
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,730
She's really scary.

434
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,269
Sounds like Lisa.

435
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,859
Can you help me, Ponyo?

436
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,610
Maybe the fuel's too old?

437
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,369
Is it clogged?

438
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:47,669
Clogged.

439
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:50,110
It's clogged there.

440
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,430
Success

441
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,570
All bright!

442
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:12,170
Wow.. Ponyo!

443
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,880
Antenna! Antenna!

444
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:35,020
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

445
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,660
I can't see a single light.

446
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,270
So loud!

447
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,520
What's wrong?

448
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:03,150
Even the radio
is out of whack.

449
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:08,520
This is JA4LL. .JA4LL.

450
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,660
Come in, Koichi

451
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,029
It's Lisa, Sosuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.

452
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,669
Were going to have dinner.

453
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,540
Ham!

454
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,180
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

455
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,029
It's not ready yet.

456
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,270
It takes three minutes.

457
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,749
Close your eyes!

458
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:11,409
Not yet!

459
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,700
No peeking, Ponyo.

460
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,420
Okay.. you can look now.

461
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,430
And. .presto!

462
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:31,800
Ham!

463
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,569
Good for you, Ponyo.

464
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:56,990
Ponyo went to sleep.

465
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,539
Is her home far away?

466
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,670
I think it must be.

467
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:27,159
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.

468
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,670
Because Ponyo's asleep?

469
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:31,640
Look over there!

470
00:59:39,419 --> 00:59:41,979
It's moving.
Someone's up there.

471
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,239
People from
the senior centre?

472
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,950
It's gone.

473
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:53,789
That's the peak road.

474
00:59:57,539 --> 00:59:59,529
Sosuke, stay there
with Ponyo.

475
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,870
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

476
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:20,279
I'm going to the senior centre.

477
01:00:20,419 --> 01:00:21,580
I'll go too.

478
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,849
Stay here with Ponyo.

479
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:28,429
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

480
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,599
I'm going with you!

481
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:36,630
Sosuke, our house
is a Lighthouse in the storm.

482
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,770
Everyone out there
is depending on us.

483
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:42,880
Someone has to stay here.

484
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:48,609
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

485
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:53,239
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior centre.

486
01:00:53,989 --> 01:00:57,940
Just knowing you're
here will help me.

487
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,120
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.

488
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:03,609
Promise?

489
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,429
I promise.

490
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,089
You promised!

491
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:10,630
I love you, Sosuke.

492
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,690
I see the lights of the town!

493
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:09,950
Finally.

494
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,130
Now we can navigate.

495
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:14,770
I've never seen
that town before.

496
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:23,330
Did the storm
blow us to America?

497
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:44,429
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbour.

498
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,089
Those are ships!

499
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:59,239
The sea is piled up
into a mountain!

500
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:04,120
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?

501
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:10,560
We lost power!

502
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:13,679
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!

503
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,989
Aye-aye!

504
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:30,070
Something is coming!

505
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,840
A sea goddess!?

506
01:04:10,419 --> 01:04:11,439
The engine!

507
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,709
We're saved!

508
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,880
The engine started again.
It was Her!

509
01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:19,590
Protect us from harm. .

510
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,610
Come on, come on.

511
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:06,970
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?

512
01:05:24,699 --> 01:05:27,459
Good heavens. .she's human!

513
01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:31,500
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?

514
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:42,230
Stop! This is unsafe!

515
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:46,679
Stop that at once!

516
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:57,789
I'm simply trying
to save your sister.

517
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,150
She's here.
She answered my call!

518
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:46,529
- Fujimoto.
- You came, my beloved.

519
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,279
Such a beautiful ocean.

520
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:58,069
So full of magic,
I like my ancient Devonian sea.

521
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,880
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood...

522
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,140
...and plundered all of my elixir.

523
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:08,760
Ponyo.. .what a lovely name.

524
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,159
It's all my fault.

525
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:21,270
She's totally beyond my control
It's complete chaos.

526
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:24,000
She doesn't understand
what she's done.

527
01:07:24,449 --> 01:07:29,779
Now she's human, and she's
up there with her boyfriend!

528
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:34,169
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

529
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,829
No! The satellites are failing.

530
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,529
Earth's gravitational field.

531
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,529
Be still

532
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,610
Sosuke. .that is his name, yes?

533
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:09,890
You love your sister,
don't you?

534
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,090
.
Listen, dear. ..what if Ponyo
really became human?

535
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,630
Use the old magic.

536
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:24,600
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

537
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,370
But if it's not..
she'll turn to sea foam!

538
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:33,610
That's where we all
came from,. dear.

539
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:36,579
But he's Only five!

540
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,579
Sleep well.. little children.

541
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,730
Sosuke!

542
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:02,429
Sosuke!

543
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,299
OW!.

544
01:09:07,919 --> 01:09:09,579
Good morning.. Ponyo.

545
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:12,309
Morning.. Sosuke.

546
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:21,120
We almost got flooded.

547
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:48,569
- Where's Lisa?
- She must be stuck someplace.

548
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,559
I wish we had a boat.

549
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:51,819
I

550
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:56,250
There's a boat!

551
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:59,659
We can't fit.

552
01:09:59,799 --> 01:10:01,419
Can so.

553
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:18,309
Awesome!

554
01:10:20,289 --> 01:10:23,279
The candle's bigger too.

555
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:24,720
We can fit.

556
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,079
This is cool

557
01:10:26,299 --> 01:10:27,590
Cool!

558
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,890
Grab that end.

559
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,890
Ready?

560
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,419
Ready!

561
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:50,209
She's seaworthy!

562
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,919
Awesome. No leaks!

563
01:10:55,059 --> 01:10:57,490
Now we fill the boiler.

564
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:00,659
The water goes in here.

565
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:03,750
It goes in the boiler.

566
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,789
It's I like a rocket!

567
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,429
Every thing's shipshape.

568
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,159
Shipshape.

569
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:44,919
Shipshape?

570
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:45,799
Shipshape!

571
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,740
Shipshape! Shipshape!

572
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,959
Is it not?

573
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,360
Hot!

574
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,829
It's hot.

575
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:26,429
- The candle's burning.
- It's burning!

576
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,120
Hot hot hot!

577
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:39,590
It's hot.

578
01:12:50,509 --> 01:12:51,800
Awesome!

579
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,469
Were shipshape, Sosuke!

580
01:12:56,749 --> 01:12:58,540
This is great.

581
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:08,009
This is so much fun.

582
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,880
It's burning, Sosuke.

583
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,479
It's really hot.

584
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:18,989
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

585
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,199
Okay.. I'm the lookout.

586
01:13:48,269 --> 01:13:49,790
There's a road.

587
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:51,919
That's the road Lisa took.

588
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:56,060
I don't see her.

589
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:59,870
You will.
She gave me her promise.

590
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,880
Ancient fish.
from the Devonian age!

591
01:14:08,019 --> 01:14:10,110
There's Bothriolepis.

592
01:14:15,259 --> 01:14:16,310
That one is.

593
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:17,550
Dipnorhynchus.

594
01:14:17,759 --> 01:14:19,219
Dipnorhynchus!

595
01:14:19,429 --> 01:14:21,689
That one's really huge.

596
01:14:21,969 --> 01:14:23,659
That's Devonynchus.

597
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:26,030
Devonynchus!

598
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,640
Ahoy!

599
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:38,909
A boat!

600
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,640
Ahoy!

601
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:44,640
They're calling us.

602
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,650
Ahoy!

603
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,790
OW!.

604
01:14:57,969 --> 01:14:59,300
Pretty good, huh?

605
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,659
Now.. Ponyo.

606
01:15:10,949 --> 01:15:12,999
Hello.

607
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:15,880
That's a wonderful
boat you have.

608
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,080
Why.. you're Lisa's little boy.

609
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,880
He's not little.. he's Sosuke.

610
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,610
This is Ponyo.

611
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,679
I was a fish before.

612
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,489
A fish?

613
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,199
Ponyo. .that's a nice name.

614
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,439
Have you seen Lisa?

615
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,969
Lisa?

616
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:39,630
She's not with you?

617
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:41,070
She's at the centre.

618
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:42,570
The senior centre...?

619
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,209
This is my baby.

620
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,729
Oh my, what happened?

621
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,340
Is that for us?

622
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,019
Give me the cup, dear.

623
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:46,100
Thank you,

624
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,300
Let's try it.

625
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:53,840
It's delicious!

626
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:56,380
Lisa made it.

627
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,110
It's for the baby.

628
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:03,850
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.

629
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:08,120
But this will help me
make milk for him.

630
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,630
Lisa gave me her milk too.

631
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:16,469
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

632
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,469
Sure.

633
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:20,330
Thank you,

634
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:41,140
People from the town.
It's like a festival

635
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,060
You there!
Do you need assistance?

636
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:51,300
Thanks, we're okay right now!

637
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,400
Then please follow us.

638
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:57,540
We're going to
the hotel on the peak.

639
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:00,709
Okay! Will do.

640
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,719
The whole town's here.

641
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:06,439
I hope everyone's all right.

642
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:10,110
- Let's go, Ponyo.
- Hold on a second.

643
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,790
Milk!

644
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,189
Oh my.

645
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:21,290
Milk!

646
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,929
She ate up all the ham.

647
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,969
This will help me
make good milk.

648
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:31,340
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

649
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:34,810
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.

650
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:36,840
Be careful !

651
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:38,610
Thank you both!

652
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,140
What is it, dear?

653
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:52,219
Don't cry.

654
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,909
Ponyo!

655
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:27,189
Sosuke!

656
01:19:29,169 --> 01:19:32,030
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?

657
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:35,499
I'm going to pick her up.

658
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,140
So she survived that wave?

659
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,239
Sosuke, take me with you!

660
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,340
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.

661
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,019
Everyone from the centre
evacuated to the park.

662
01:19:49,229 --> 01:19:51,419
- Keep safe!
- You can do it!

663
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,550
We'll send a boat
for them later.

664
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,030
Good luck, captain!

665
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,939
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

666
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,949
Were okay.
I have another one.

667
01:20:57,729 --> 01:21:00,689
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

668
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,459
Bye-bye.

669
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:12,630
Can you make this candle bigger?

670
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,300
all right.

671
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:22,709
Are you sleepy.. Ponyo?

672
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,110
Ponyo!

673
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,739
Ponyo! Ponyo!

674
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:49,130
Good. it's shallow enough to walk.

675
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,090
A road!

676
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,040
It's shrinking!

677
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,110
Ponyo!

678
01:23:55,939 --> 01:23:57,959
Ponyo, wake up!

679
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,400
Sosuke.

680
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,810
Don't scare me.

681
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:13,080
I thought you were
turning into a fish.

682
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:24,350
I

683
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,310
Lisa's car!

684
01:24:26,739 --> 01:24:28,900
Ponyo, that's her car!

685
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,600
Lisa!

686
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:38,909
Lisa!

687
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,640
Lisa!

688
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,540
Lisa!

689
01:24:56,999 --> 01:24:59,159
Lisa!

690
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,429
Lisa!

691
01:25:31,929 --> 01:25:34,219
Here's your boat.

692
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,330
Your eyes are wet.

693
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,009
Let's find Lisa.

694
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,159
- You forgot your wrap!
- Who needs it?

695
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,790
Look.. it's a whale!

696
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,290
- My knees don't hurt anymore!
- What were we so afraid of?

697
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:48,840
- Is this the Other Side?
- Who cares? It's wonderful

698
01:26:51,209 --> 01:26:54,269
Attention, please!
Gather round.

699
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,870
Coming!

700
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:57,679
Shall we?

701
01:26:59,919 --> 01:27:01,909
It's so nice to run.

702
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:04,090
Meet you there!

703
01:27:07,259 --> 01:27:09,189
The winner!

704
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:13,530
You're so fast, Kayo.

705
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,989
Quiet, everyone!

706
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:19,130
The moment
of truth is at hand.

707
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,840
Sosuke and Ponyo
are almost here.

708
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:23,409
It's so romantic.

709
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:27,739
- Will love triumph?
- I'm so excited!

710
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:30,409
quiet!

711
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:35,739
Very soon, you will bear witness
to a sacred trial of love.

712
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:41,530
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not
up to something, are you?

713
01:27:41,729 --> 01:27:44,689
Nonsense, he's her father.

714
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,159
They'll be fine..
if she doesn't wake up.

715
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,030
Now excuse me!

716
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:01,640
I'd like to believe him...

717
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,209
Where's Lisa gone to?

718
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:09,120
She's been talking with
Ponyo's mother for ages.

719
01:28:17,169 --> 01:28:19,729
I hope she's okay.

720
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,459
What are they talking about?

721
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,269
Let's find out. Lisa!

722
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:28,640
Lisa!

723
01:28:34,219 --> 01:28:41,179
Were all rooting
for Sosuke and Ponyo!

724
01:28:54,499 --> 01:28:55,689
Lisa!

725
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,330
- You must be worried.
- Sosuke will be just fine.

726
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:02,100
He's a strong little boy.

727
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,669
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.

728
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,350
Ponyo, it's a tunnel

729
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:28,360
'STOP'

730
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:35,139
I've been here before.

731
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:37,369
Ponyo?

732
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,709
I don't like this place.

733
01:29:43,889 --> 01:29:45,910
Don't let go of my hand.

734
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:25,220
Ponyo!

735
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,340
Ponyo!

736
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,680
Ponyo!

737
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,939
Please don't die!

738
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,070
Ponyo!

739
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,340
Wake up, Ponyo!

740
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:27,079
Let her sleep.

741
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,119
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

742
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:33,590
Lisa and the old ladies
are waiting too.

743
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:35,579
Lisa?!.

744
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:39,229
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.

745
01:31:41,999 --> 01:31:44,729
Let's not wake her.

746
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:47,030
Sosuke!

747
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:50,309
Don't listen to him!

748
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:54,169
He tricked everyone
into going with him.

749
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,110
Toki !

750
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:57,180
But he couldn't fool me!

751
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:03,510
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?

752
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:07,180
If the Moon comes
any closer, we're finished!

753
01:32:07,559 --> 01:32:10,579
Is that the best
you can do?

754
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,470
Sosuke, come here!

755
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:17,099
Listen to me.. Sosuke.
You're the planet's best hope.

756
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,169
Don't make me use force.

757
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:21,800
Ponyo!

758
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,999
Is this how you
treat your father?

759
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,119
Ponyo!

760
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,849
Run, Sosuke!

761
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,220
You don't understand!

762
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,959
You can make it!

763
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,459
Jump!

764
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,070
Now what?

765
01:34:24,999 --> 01:34:25,930
Lisa!

766
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:27,260
Sosuke!

767
01:34:27,499 --> 01:34:28,660
Ponyo!

768
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:37,229
- Look over there.
- Where are we?

769
01:34:47,619 --> 01:34:49,740
So, you are Sosuke.

770
01:34:49,959 --> 01:34:53,289
Hello. Are you
Ponyo's mother?

771
01:34:53,559 --> 01:34:54,490
Yes,

772
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:59,490
I want to thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

773
01:35:00,139 --> 01:35:05,599
Ponyo wanted to be like you,
but she unleashed a terrible power.

774
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,539
To become human, she must be loved.

775
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,610
.for who she really is.

776
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:18,180
DO you know that Ponyo was a fish?

777
01:35:18,419 --> 01:35:19,380
Yes

778
01:35:19,519 --> 01:35:23,470
Your blood made her human...almost.

779
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:24,590
That's right!

780
01:35:24,729 --> 01:35:28,180
Ponyo licked
my cut and made it better.

781
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:30,729
So that's why she changed!

782
01:35:31,829 --> 01:35:35,490
Can you accept her as she is?

783
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,889
I'll always love Ponyo.

784
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:40,590
..whether she's a fish.. a human.

785
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:43,139
.or in between.

786
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,849
Come, Ponyo.

787
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:17,939
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

788
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:24,439
But first, you must
give up your powers.

789
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:26,650
Can you do that?

790
01:36:36,869 --> 01:36:40,559
Kiss this bubble
when you return to land.

791
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:45,059
. .and Ponyo
will be a little girl

792
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,169
Way to go, Ponyo!

793
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,539
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

794
01:36:59,389 --> 01:37:02,979
Now the planet is safe again.

795
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,249
Splendid, Sosuke!

796
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:16,160
Sosuke!

797
01:37:40,099 --> 01:37:41,930
I'm grateful , Lisa.

798
01:37:42,329 --> 01:37:44,990
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

799
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:59,669
There you are!
Are you all right?

800
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:06,610
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

801
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,919
Don't bother, we'll walk.

802
01:38:09,059 --> 01:38:11,490
It's all so exciting.

803
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,479
I believe this is yours.

804
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,990
Thanks.

805
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:24,499
I hope you'll
forgive me. ..may I?

806
01:38:30,249 --> 01:38:32,300
Take good care of her.

807
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:36,519
It's Koichi!

808
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,769
Koichi!

809
01:38:46,289 --> 01:38:49,650
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!

810
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:55,119
Look.. Ponyo.
It's Koichi !
