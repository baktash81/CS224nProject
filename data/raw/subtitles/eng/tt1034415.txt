<i>♪ 'Cause I'll be leaving in the... ♪</i>

2
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,280
Oh.

3
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,602
Patricia.

4
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:51,455
<i>♪ That I'll be leaving in the fairest of the season ♪</i>

5
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,367
<i>♪ Should I stay or should I go ♪</i>

6
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,890
So, I have a patient that is coming in five minutes.

7
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,371
I can ask him to come back later.

8
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,291
Please.

9
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:09,149
<i>♪ 'Cause I'll be leaving in the fairest of the season ♪</i>

10
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,301
<i>♪ Leaving... In the... ♪</i>

11
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:27,892
This song, it's stuck in my head, and it's so loud.

12
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:36,281
Do you know what I mean?

13
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,531
Do you know what I mean?

14
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,293
They're going to try to keep her alive after all.

15
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,534
Markos?

16
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,727
Quick, get us seats over there before those boys take them!

17
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,990
The guitarist is so cute...

18
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,010
I was right.

19
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,848
They are witches..

20
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:38,815
I have to tell Sara to get out of there.

21
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,935
She's the only girl I actually give a damn about.

22
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,045
"Her delusions has deepened into panic.

23
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,963
She feels her constructed mythology is confirmed."

24
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,154
If I leave without her,

25
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,336
they may pick her next.

26
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:53,776
Or Olga.

27
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:55,496
I should warn Olga, too.

28
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,216
Olga's already figured out things.

29
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,817
She saw how they groomed me.

30
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:07,977
There's more in that building than what you can see.

31
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,617
They've been underground since the war.

32
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:28,417
And you think they can hear you now?

33
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,019
At the beginning, they gave me things.

34
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:52,699
Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

35
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,298
Talking with our minds.

36
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,539
But they took my hair.

37
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,339
They took my urine. They...

38
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,019
They took my eyes.

39
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,339
Now she can see me.

40
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,820
Mother Markos.

41
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,340
Oh, she wants to get inside of me.

42
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:36,940
I can feel her.

43
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh, I thought I wanted it.

44
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,981
I let it happen.

45
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:34,744
If they find out I was here, they won't hesitate.

46
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,310
They'll hollow me out and eat my cunt on plate.

47
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,785
Mr. Berger is waiting for you, Doctor.

48
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,948
Okay, that's good. That's good.

49
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,231
Did the rain get your clothes all wet?

50
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,271
No, don't you worry. The girls just hung that all up.

51
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:35,592
is what I just heard on the radio.

52
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,992
-That'll just about do it.
-Just about.

53
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:43,712
How is she today?

54
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:56,358
You're Miss Tanner?

55
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,078
Yes. Come in.

56
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,359
Nah?

57
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:12,159
I tried to call you at your hotel this morning

58
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:15,759
to ask you if you could reschedule.

59
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,559
-Why?
-Company business.

60
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,799
It's not a good time just today.

61
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,439
But here you are.

62
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:57,001
And one, and two,

63
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:00,521
and three, and four,

64
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,361
and five,

65
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:06,041
and six, and seven,

66
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,282
and eight.

67
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,641
Elbows up. And one...

68
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,202
Come in, Susie.

69
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:19,882
Miss Millius and Miss Mandel
are the company's repetiteurs.

70
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,882
And Veva Blanc?

71
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,962
I was told she would be here.

72
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,442
Oh, dear.

73
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:28,763
You have no formal training or references.

74
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:30,923
Your insistence to audition

75
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:35,402
happened to catch Madame Blanc on a good day.

76
00:13:35,563 --> 00:13:39,003
But you really shouldn't be here at all.

77
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:41,483
Do you understand?

78
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:43,243
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

79
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:44,043
Good.

80
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,123
Uh...

81
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,164
I prefer dancing without music.

82
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:01,884
Danke schoen.

83
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:04,124
You can keep time in your head, yes?

84
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,205
Mm-hmm, and Hypnose.

85
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,326
And here we have...

86
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,926
a line between the elbows.

87
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,206
Face forward.

88
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,327
Perfect, and... Morphus.

89
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:54,006
And here, not so close to the face.

90
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,206
More like you're holding a bird or something.

91
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,369
They did it when we were in morning rehearsal.

92
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,529
They just put her things in shipping boxes.

93
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,969
You don't think she had to go underground, do you?

94
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,689
I don't care what happened.

95
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,329
I just want her to call.

96
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:02,610
I'm really worried.

97
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,810
Fraulein Bannion.

98
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,090
Come (Kommen Sie in French)

99
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,610
I've just spoken with Madame Blanc.

100
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,130
Well done, Miss Bannion.

101
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,810
I imagine you will need to return home

102
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:26,251
to settle things and make arrangements

103
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,130
for moving to Berlin.

104
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,411
No. No, no.

105
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,931
I can start right now.

106
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,731
Good.

107
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:36,451
This is Miss Boutaher,

108
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,491
our technical director.

109
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:40,131
Guten Tag.

110
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,572
And this is Miss Vendegast.

111
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,531
-She acts as house mother...
-Hello.

112
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:47,092
...for our dancers who reside here.

113
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:50,651
Where'd you come from?

114
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,772
Ohio.

115
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,212
We operate as a sort of Ruth Bré collective.

116
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:04,053
As we cannot pay our dancers a lot of money,

117
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:07,212
we offer dormitory-style rooms, rent-free.

118
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,893
You don't... you don't charge anything at all?

119
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,253
Not a mark.

120
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,173
In this company, we fully understand

121
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:21,533
the importance of a woman's financial autonomy.

122
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,973
Normally, it would be full at this time of year,

123
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:28,573
but we have had a room open.

124
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,214
Yeah. Patricia's.

125
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,253
Do you know Patricia?

126
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:34,453
Mmm...

127
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,854
No, I heard some girls talking

128
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,374
about her in the hall.

129
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:42,134
Ah.

130
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,254
Now that you're one of us, I won't be coy.

131
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,215
Patricia has just left the company

132
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:50,814
under sad circumstances.

133
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:54,295
We think she won't be back,
so there's room if you want.

134
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:58,895
We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.

135
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:00,615
After lunch.

136
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:02,335
It's all right for you?

137
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,855
Yes.

138
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,015
It's-it... it's all...

139
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:06,735
Yes.

140
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,256
It's perfect.

141
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,337
Hello. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

142
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,937
-Hi.
-It's the rain.

143
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,737
Whenever it rains in Berlin, everyone jumps in a cab,

144
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,537
and like an idiot, I just let ours go.

145
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,097
Hi. I'm Sara.

146
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,897
We're gonna have to take our chances on the street.

147
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,657
Do you have an umbrella?

148
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,617
Oh, when you weren't here by 6:00,

149
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:50,858
I had to take the room for another night.

150
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:52,377
Oh. God, Susie, I'm sorry.

151
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,257
Everything was a mess at the company today.

152
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,578
Why are you smiling?

153
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,498
I'm sor... I-I...

154
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:01,258
Um, uh, when you said Berlin a second ago,

155
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:02,858
you said "everyone in Berlin,"

156
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:06,458
and I just thought that... that includes me now.

157
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,018
I live in Berlin.

158
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:10,258
Yes. Congrats.

159
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,618
I heard you were a sensation today.

160
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,418
Have you called your family yet, to tell them?

161
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,138
Miss Blanc came into my audition.

162
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,059
But she left right after.

163
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,418
She's incredible.

164
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,779
The way she transmits her work, her energy.

165
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:27,859
When it shines on you, it's...

166
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,699
"addictive" is the word for it.

167
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,139
She's tough.

168
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:33,419
She kept the company alive through the war.

169
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,419
When the Reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds

170
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,739
and keep their uteruses open,

171
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,700
there was Blanc.

172
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,860
Thank you.

173
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,219
"La vraie chose" - The real thing

174
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,059
What?

175
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,139
W-Was that French?

176
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,940
It's a bomb.

177
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:58,980
I can smell it.

178
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:00,300
There's a bank that way.

179
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,981
Don't you know what's happening here?

180
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,620
The hijackers are negotiating a release

181
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,941
of the Stammheim prisoners tonight.

182
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,741
The RAF.

183
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:13,101
Baader-Meinhof.

184
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,181
They kidnapped an executive.

185
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:19,101
During the war, he was a Nazi SS, an officer.

186
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,301
Now he runs the German Employers' Association.

187
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:24,861
You don't get how awful that is, do you?

188
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:33,382
Sorry.

189
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,102
I'm just worried about my friend.

190
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,819
Now for the voting

191
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,929
each of us says the name of her choice

192
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,385
Mandel, whom are you voting for?

193
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:08,998
Markos.

194
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:10,112
Miss Killen?

195
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,533
Blanc.

196
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,531
Judith?

197
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,106
Markos.

198
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,027
Boutaher?

199
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,141
Blanc.

200
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,485
Millius?

201
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,791
Markos.

202
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,751
Martincin?

203
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:20,864
Markos.

204
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:21,825
Huller?

205
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:22,938
Markos.

206
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,013
Mauceri?

207
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:24,743
Blanc.

208
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,162
Marks?

209
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:28,967
Marcos.

210
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:30,158
Pavla?

211
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,156
Blanc.

212
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,462
Vendegast?

213
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:33,691
Blanc.

214
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:34,958
Balfour?

215
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,764
Blanc.

216
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,032
Creusot?

217
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:37,876
Blanc.

218
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,297
Alberta?

219
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,718
Marcos.

220
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:42,715
Griffith?

221
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:46,594
Griffith?

222
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,514
We are at the end.

223
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:50,626
You must choose!

224
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,082
Mother Markos.

225
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,385
Blanc, whom are you voting for?

226
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,495
I abstain.

227
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,145
I vote for Markos.

228
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,641
Markos wins by three.

229
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,561
It is decided.

230
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:10,480
Mother Markos will remain in control.

231
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,168
Let no ones's vote be held against her.

232
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,817
And let the will of the majority proceed.

233
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:20,195
Long life to Markos.

234
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:37,207
<i>"..there is no information yet on whether the hijackers will pilot
the Lufthansa flight to a fourth destination or what is the condition
of the 91 hostages still presumed aboard.</i>

235
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:46,577
<i>Yesterday, one of the Palestinian hijackers issued official demands including
the release of all RAF members incarcerated at Stammshein prison.."</i>

236
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,709
Mother asked for you.

237
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:02,629
She has to know that we can move ahead

238
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:04,549
now that last night's business is behind us.

239
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,967
You all knew my concerns about Patricia.

240
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,268
What happened to Patricia was ghostly.

241
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,649
But now that we voted Mother wants to try again.

242
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:15,724
And so soon.

243
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,563
The question isn't just who to try next.

244
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,861
We have to make sure the ritual will work with whichever girl we choose.

245
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,202
Mother trusts you already have ideas on this subject.

246
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,197
Maybe Sara could be a good option.

247
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:38,919
Yes. It was right to send her to collect the American girl.

248
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,989
Sara is a good ambassador for the good company.

249
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,025
She's made a home here, hasn't she?

250
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,022
She feels good here.

251
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:48,250
Loved.

252
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,236
Uncle Josef!

253
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:58,965
Good morning my dear!

254
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:01,537
Are you going to your country house? - Yes!

255
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:05,032
I'm freezing my ass off.
I'll go to the university later on with Clara.

256
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:05,915
Who is speaking?

257
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,219
Lacan.
- Ah, Lacan!

258
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,361
Good morning, Doctor Klempere!

259
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,281
Are you going to the country house?

260
00:24:28,956 --> 00:24:30,416
"Next stop Friedrichstrasse.

261
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,836
This train terminates here.

262
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:35,753
Please have your identification ready to enter East Berlin."

263
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,638
Anke, look...

264
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,635
everything is full of leaves again!

265
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:23,854
I swept them away just last Tuesday.

266
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,680
Why don't you try speaking to me like you love me?

267
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,080
Huh?

268
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,800
For a change.

269
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,560
This is my room.

270
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,121
And here...

271
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,480
is yours.

272
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:19,761
We're neighbors.

273
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:22,281
You can knock on the wall if you ever need anything.

274
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,638
Miss Sesame?

275
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,945
Doctor, I got the semolina from Mrs. Meir.

276
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:24,398
They are demonstrating again for the release of the RAF terrorists.

277
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,318
Ensslin, Meinhof...

278
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,811
Before the war Germany had the strongest women...

279
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,844
Like your wife Anke.

280
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:35,765
Wasn't she strong, Doctor?

281
00:28:38,913 --> 00:28:41,410
"First rehearsal in the Iris Studio today.

282
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,907
in twenty minutes.

283
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,085
You're to lead your own stretches today."

284
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,204
Good morning.

285
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:49,085
-Good morning.
-Hello.

286
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:51,885
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

287
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,685
-Hi.
-Good morning. Good morning.

288
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:56,445
How's your knee? Okay?

289
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,325
It's wonderful you're here.

290
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,525
Thank you.

291
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:10,926
We have some happier company business today.

292
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:12,966
We have a new dancer.

293
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,566
This is Susie Bannion, who's joining us from America.

294
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:19,327
I was privileged to witness her audition yesterday.

295
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:21,686
We are very lucky to have her.

296
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,647
Would you like to say something, Susie?

297
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,247
Um...

298
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,686
I don't know.

299
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:30,406
Hello.

300
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:34,767
I feel like I'm not even here yet.

301
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,047
I don't know.

302
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,207
You join in whenever you feel ready,

303
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,967
but there's no rush.

304
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,167
Welcome to our little family.

305
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:43,367
I'm Susie.

306
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,527
Hi. Hi.

307
00:29:45,687 --> 00:29:47,888
All right, so for today's rehearsal,

308
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,768
I want to pick up exactly where we left off with Volk.

309
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:52,048
I've spoken to Olga,

310
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,848
and she's going to dance Patricia's part.

311
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:59,528
And, Sara, I'd like you to dance Olga's part.

312
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:00,888
Is everyone happy with that?

313
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,568
Okay.

314
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:04,888
Good.

315
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,449
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Music off, please.

316
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,329
One moment.

317
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,609
Okay, so...

318
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:24,730
And one, and two, and three.

319
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,290
You pull it from the ground.

320
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,049
All right? Gravity, remember.

321
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,130
And everybody from here, please.

322
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,530
And Tanner.

323
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,570
One and two and three.

324
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,689
And one, and two, and three.

325
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,930
And one and two and three

326
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,450
And one and two and three

327
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,450
And one and two and three

328
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,690
And one and two and three

329
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,610
And one and two and three

330
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,570
And one and two and three

331
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,891
And one and two and three

332
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,571
This is shit.

333
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:56,090
-Such shit.
-Okay.

334
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:59,171
Why don't we all break for ten minutes.

335
00:30:59,331 --> 00:31:02,291
You can't even be bothered to respect your own lies.

336
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:04,051
Miss Ivanova!

337
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,051
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

338
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:07,611
Let's face this.

339
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:11,371
Patricia is gone, Olga.

340
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:13,532
We don't know where.

341
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:15,411
If she's gone into hiding, she wouldn't have told us,

342
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:17,732
-would she?
-She would have told someone.

343
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,332
We know that she had dealings

344
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,732
with people who are interested in targets.

345
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:23,092
And we know there was another bomb

346
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:24,332
in Kreuzberg last night.

347
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:25,452
She wouldn't do that.

348
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,532
She wanted to live her beliefs.

349
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:30,812
Who doesn't admire that?

350
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:34,372
And there's so much to change in the world.

351
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:36,093
If she wants to live in a cellar

352
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:39,052
filling bottles with petrol, that's her choice.

353
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:42,133
And who won't be heartbroken if she's shot by police?

354
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:45,053
You manipulate everything.

355
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:50,174
She didn't trust you because you're hypocrites.

356
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,773
Will you take Olga to her room, please, Tanner?

357
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:55,814
No, Miss Tanner!

358
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:58,733
Call Olga a cab.

359
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:00,773
She's had enough.

360
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,374
And is going to pack her things

361
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:05,974
and get the fuck out from this box of rabies!

362
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,389
Witches!

363
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,615
I'm sorry about that.

364
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:28,015
It's a hot thing we do.

365
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:37,216
Okay, so... who will dance the protagonist?

366
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,975
Sonia?

367
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,656
I can't. Not yet.

368
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:43,216
Caroline?

369
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:49,216
Very well. We'll manage.

370
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:52,456
I suggest that we all take it from the top.

371
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:54,096
I'll dance.

372
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:04,697
I know it.

373
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,257
It's in the documentary.

374
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,297
I-I've seen it a hundred times at the library.

375
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,617
Sweetheart, we rehearsed this piece

376
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:16,417
for ten months before we performed it.

377
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:20,457
I've seen it in person, too.

378
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:23,058
First do it alone, then.

379
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:26,618
We don't want to put the others at risk.

380
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:28,418
The last thing we need

381
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:32,058
is someone to get kicked in the ribs.

382
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:37,538
All right?

383
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,621
Okay, stop. Stop, stop.

384
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,261
Stop.

385
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:36,821
All right.

386
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:38,541
Clear your head.

387
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,501
I want you to start over.

388
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,861
Have you stretched?

389
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,821
This is no joke.

390
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:16,063
Olga.

391
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:19,466
Olga.

392
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:25,786
Come.

393
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:55,147
Remember, you start on one with the music,

394
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:58,307
and if you feel ill at any time, just stop.

395
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,348
You start here.

396
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:01,588
And...

397
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,831
Lauter!

398
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,470
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

399
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:20,037
It'll pass.

400
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:22,837
You're not the first dancer who lost the room.

401
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:29,117
I'm not usually dizzy.

402
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:30,477
An occasional collapse

403
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,997
is a vocational hazard, I'm afraid.

404
00:40:33,158 --> 00:40:36,398
I-I didn't... I didn't collapse.

405
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:39,518
You're on the floor, and that's
not where the dance ends.

406
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:44,918
I was trying not to throw up in your studio.

407
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:46,398
Susie, it's fine.

408
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:48,638
It was wonderful.

409
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:51,838
Sara, can you take her to her room, please?

410
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:54,279
You can rest for the rest of the day.

411
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,599
- How enlightening.
- Okay, come on, girls.

412
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,239
Let's go.

413
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,679
And one, and two, and three.

414
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,119
And...

415
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,722
No, Susie.

416
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:07,362
We have to study America.

417
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:09,122
I said no.

418
00:42:11,842 --> 00:42:13,162
Susanna.

419
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:22,363
Everything fine?

420
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:16,855
Attention, please!

421
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,580
Don't hurt Olga.

422
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:09,196
Slowly...

423
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:00,732
Out!

424
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,997
<i>"Police station, good evening."</i>

425
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:32,221
Good evening, I'm reporting a young
woman who may be missing.

426
00:45:33,988 --> 00:45:35,869
She couldn't have known what she was doing.

427
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,865
She just carried more of our intention than we expected.

428
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:42,820
We also let ourselves get angry with Olga.

429
00:45:43,204 --> 00:45:44,894
I could feel it.

430
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:47,505
But the girl is natural.

431
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:49,963
Like Patricia. Only clean somehow.

432
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:52,305
She may be more what we're looking for.

433
00:45:52,804 --> 00:45:53,995
even than Sara.

434
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:56,837
Are we saying that?

435
00:45:57,566 --> 00:46:00,024
No. I'm not saying that yet.

436
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:08,333
You don't look better.

437
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:10,773
Or are you this pale all the time?

438
00:46:12,053 --> 00:46:13,653
I will leave you.

439
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:16,173
Good night.

440
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:26,894
The Amish split

441
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:29,294
from the Mennonites in the 17th century.

442
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,414
They were worried the Mennonites

443
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:32,094
were becoming too liberal.

444
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:35,374
"They"? Not "we"?

445
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:38,774
You've left religious thinking behind you, then?

446
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:41,174
And you're not comfortable talking about these things.

447
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:43,414
I don't know why we are.

448
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:45,135
It's difficult not to be curious about you.

449
00:46:45,295 --> 00:46:47,535
In two days, you've auditioned,

450
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:51,055
been accepted and danced a lead.

451
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:53,855
How did your journey towards us begin?

452
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:55,495
I went to New York.

453
00:46:55,655 --> 00:46:57,815
To the Martha Graham Center.

454
00:46:57,975 --> 00:47:00,536
I saw you there three times.

455
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:02,216
I went once by bus,

456
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,736
then I hitchhiked the other two.

457
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:07,376
That's risky.

458
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,496
Were you punished?

459
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:11,936
Yeah.

460
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,216
But I felt I had to see you.

461
00:47:23,697 --> 00:47:25,857
What did it feel today

462
00:47:26,016 --> 00:47:29,777
to dance Volkin front of the one who made it?

463
00:47:29,937 --> 00:47:31,737
No, no. That's a vain question.

464
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,897
Let me ask you another.

465
00:47:34,056 --> 00:47:37,977
When you were dancing, what did it feel like...

466
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:41,497
inside you, inside your body?

467
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:51,418
It felt like what I think it must feel like to fuck.

468
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,418
You mean to fuck a man?

469
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,537
No, I...

470
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:57,178
was thinking of an animal.

471
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:07,019
You looked...

472
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:21,099
I'm going to ask Caroline
to work on your jumps with you.

473
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:23,699
Yours are nowhere near good enough yet.

474
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,539
We'll have to build you up.

475
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,980
So that I can dance the protagonist

476
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,859
when you perform it?

477
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,380
I'll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again.

478
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:35,660
I can do it.

479
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,300
Olga made Volkseem like such heavy lifting.

480
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,100
She never understood the heart of Volk.

481
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,621
She lacked conviction.

482
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,580
I'm relieved she's gone.

483
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,221
Thank you for your help with that.

484
00:49:05,581 --> 00:49:07,781
Madame Blanc...

485
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:12,621
wants me to dance the protagonist in Volk.

486
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:18,461
I didn't think it was gonna be like this.

487
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,422
She's so kind.

488
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,141
That's wonderful.

489
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:28,382
Are you all right?

490
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:33,022
I'm fine. I was just...

491
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:38,862
I was just thinking about what Olga said in rehearsal.

492
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:40,542
About Patricia.

493
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:42,822
What do you mean?

494
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,423
She was active in some political groups.

495
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:50,703
No one knows where she is, really.

496
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,103
If she's all right.

497
00:49:53,263 --> 00:49:55,624
Was it true...

498
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:57,263
what Olga said?

499
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:01,464
Yes.

500
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,063
Patricia didn't trust the matrons.

501
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,664
And I never understood why.

502
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:14,464
If I asked you for a favor tomorrow, would you do it?

503
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:15,624
Yes.

504
00:50:22,664 --> 00:50:25,064
We might get caught.

505
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,065
Okay.

506
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,467
Mother. Mother.

507
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:15,347
Mother.

508
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,387
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

509
00:51:18,547 --> 00:51:20,108
Mother. Mother.

510
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:24,788
Susanna.

511
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:11,599
Come inside, hurry up!

512
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,438
What do you want?

513
00:52:17,283 --> 00:52:19,165
We need to talk to someone in charge.

514
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,586
Miss Markos!

515
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:24,810
About a girl named Patrizia...

516
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:30,416
Patricia Hingle.

517
00:52:36,138 --> 00:52:37,943
Someone named Blanc then?

518
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:41,438
I'm she.

519
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:45,931
Why don't you come in?

520
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:48,081
Please...

521
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,539
Follow me.

522
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:01,152
-Guten Morgen.
-Guten Morgen.

523
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,272
Morgen.

524
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,912
Guten Morgen.

525
00:53:13,952 --> 00:53:15,592
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

526
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:17,593
Okay, well, let's meet soon.

527
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,473
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm... I'm ready.

528
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:28,553
I'm almost out the door.

529
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:30,353
Okay. Yeah.

530
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:32,913
-I'll see you soon.
-Marketa.

531
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:37,433
-Marketa, come on.
-I'll see you soon.

532
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:40,754
Come on.

533
00:53:58,194 --> 00:53:59,634
Come, come, come.

534
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:12,915
Are you sure no one's coming?

535
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,956
Oh, I'm sure. Don't worry.

536
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:17,155
Nobody comes here during the weekend.

537
00:54:44,557 --> 00:54:45,877
Patricia's isn't here.

538
00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:48,277
Try looking for Olga's.

539
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:49,877
Olga...

540
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:52,037
She's not here.

541
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:55,997
I just need a number.

542
00:54:56,157 --> 00:54:58,278
For her parents or someone who can tell me for sure

543
00:54:58,437 --> 00:54:59,637
she is or isn't in Berlin.

544
00:55:20,038 --> 00:55:22,238
Hmm. How odd.

545
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,279
1961.

546
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,519
1955.

547
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,999
1949.

548
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,759
It's bizarre.

549
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,319
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

550
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,721
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

551
00:56:29,962 --> 00:56:31,081
There's nothing.

552
00:56:31,242 --> 00:56:32,602
Come on.

553
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:38,842
Sit down.

554
00:56:43,282 --> 00:56:45,042
This morning,

555
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:47,882
we turn our instincts inward.

556
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,362
Miss Millius, Miss Mandel,

557
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:51,282
can you close the mirrors, please?

558
00:56:51,443 --> 00:56:52,523
Miss Marks, no music.

559
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,763
I want to start work on a new piece.

560
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:07,884
A piece about rebirths.

561
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:10,884
The inevitable pull that they exert

562
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:14,684
and our efforts to escape them.

563
00:57:14,844 --> 00:57:17,403
We'll learn it now, but, Susie,

564
00:57:17,564 --> 00:57:20,283
you will improvise freely at its heart.

565
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:22,244
I'm interested in your instincts here.

566
00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:35,445
The piece will be called Weider OÖffnen.

567
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,324
Open Again.

568
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:38,845
Allez.

569
00:57:45,285 --> 00:57:48,725
One, two, three, four.

570
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:52,325
One, two, three, four.

571
00:57:52,485 --> 00:57:55,845
One, two, three, four.

572
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:59,606
One, two, three, four.

573
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:03,125
One, two, three, four.

574
00:58:03,286 --> 00:58:05,686
One, two, three, four.

575
00:58:06,846 --> 00:58:10,126
One, two, three, four.

576
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,566
One, two, three, four.

577
00:58:13,726 --> 00:58:17,127
One, two, three, four.

578
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,366
One...

579
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:20,526
...two, three, four.

580
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:24,287
One, two, three, four.

581
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:27,327
One, two, three, four.

582
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:31,127
One, two, three, four.

583
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:34,687
One, two, three, four.

584
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:38,327
One, two, three, four.

585
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:41,688
One, two, three, four.

586
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:45,048
One, two, three, four.

587
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:46,768
One...

588
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:07,337
You should have told me she was coming.

589
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:09,910
She wanted to fell Susie for herself.

590
00:59:10,832 --> 00:59:12,099
So you put her...

591
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,787
in a storage closet!

592
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:15,862
Under the floor?

593
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:17,629
Helena Markos?

594
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,240
Mother wanted it.

595
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,082
I though we agreed to stop using that title.

596
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:28,957
If Markos really were one of the Three Mothers
we wouldn't be in this situation.

597
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:33,681
You should have told Markos about Miss Bannion yourself.

598
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:35,409
Now Mother wants her.

599
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:40,286
Are we going to waste another girl so quickly?

600
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,905
Everyone voted.

601
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,046
You are not the light we chose to follow.

602
00:59:46,123 --> 00:59:50,769
If Markos wants this girl, you must prepare her.

603
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:52,344
- And does she?
- Yes!

604
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:55,800
Markos will live.

605
00:59:57,029 --> 01:00:00,101
We found the girl in time.

606
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:15,923
I won't rush again.

607
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:20,185
I will tell Markos when the girl is ready.

608
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:22,336
Miss Balfour!

609
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,025
Alright!

610
01:00:26,052 --> 01:00:27,852
Did something happen?

611
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:30,053
-Hmm?
-To you, during it?

612
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,253
N-No.

613
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,933
Did you... did you...

614
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:39,693
Did you feel something there?

615
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:43,733
Someone?

616
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:45,454
Or just something.

617
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:48,493
What made you say that?

618
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:49,853
I don't know.

619
01:00:52,654 --> 01:00:55,374
Am I confusing you?

620
01:00:56,334 --> 01:00:58,054
No, it's, um...

621
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:01,574
It's odd. It's the...

622
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,374
It's the sort of thing Patricia would say.

623
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,014
It's bizarre.

624
01:01:06,174 --> 01:01:07,655
Come on.

625
01:01:07,814 --> 01:01:09,695
Let's get changed, or Sonia will leave without us.

626
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:10,895
I've got a dress you can wear.

627
01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:12,254
Double caposhi.

628
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:28,855
Susie!

629
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,656
Oh, Susie!

630
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:56,535
I want to bring in a custom from the old ways.

631
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:57,956
What do you have in mind?

632
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:00,068
A witness.

633
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,641
One of our new friends from the police?

634
01:02:02,987 --> 01:02:06,059
Why not one of those young things at the window?

635
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,785
You're forgetting we already have a witness.

636
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,781
The old man who sent us the police in the first place.

637
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:13,893
He will be our winess.

638
01:02:14,354 --> 01:02:16,965
Yes. Not one of our girls.

639
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:18,885
It would make any of them insane.

640
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,575
I agree

641
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:23,493
And it's good for Susie to see us like this.

642
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,413
That we're still part of the world.

643
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:29,484
Maybe she even senses what we want of her.

644
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,903
She senses a lot.

645
01:02:31,903 --> 01:02:34,399
You can see her eyes shine with it.

646
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:37,817
I see it every night.

647
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:39,737
When I send her our dreams.

648
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:28,220
Is it true?

649
01:04:00,823 --> 01:04:02,302
Is it true?

650
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:09,703
I know who I am!

651
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,143
I know who I am!

652
01:04:18,023 --> 01:04:20,624
It's all right.

653
01:04:20,783 --> 01:04:21,783
It's okay.

654
01:04:21,944 --> 01:04:23,463
Is she all right?

655
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:25,023
It's just a nightmare.

656
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:26,744
The Markos Company special.

657
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:28,744
I'm surprised it took this long.

658
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:30,983
Hey, let me know if she needs a Valium.

659
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:41,104
She's right. I dreamt of hairballs in toilets

660
01:04:41,264 --> 01:04:44,064
for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.

661
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:46,905
Move over.

662
01:04:58,105 --> 01:05:01,425
I've only ever slept in bed with my sister.

663
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:03,185
We're sisters now.

664
01:05:55,894 --> 01:06:01,999
<i>"In a statement released to the press moments ago,
the hijacker's leader "Martyrer Mahmud"</i>

665
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:10,102
<i>demands Baader, Ensslin, Möller and the other RAF prisoners
be released from Stammheim prison and flown to Mogadishu."</i>

666
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:11,631
Good morning.

667
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:18,819
I'd like to talk to Detective Glockner or Detective Albrecht.

668
01:06:19,357 --> 01:06:22,084
- Your name?
- Klemperer, josef.

669
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:23,120
One moment.

670
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:33,335
<i>".. as proof of their intentions, the hijackers threw down onto the tarmac,
the body of the flights pilot Jurgen Schumann.</i>

671
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:35,793
He had been shot in the head.

672
01:06:37,598 --> 01:06:39,902
Agent Glockner's office is on the right.

673
01:06:39,902 --> 01:06:42,705
Have a seat there and they'll call for you.

674
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:57,797
"Terror suspect. Do you know this woman's name?"

675
01:06:57,951 --> 01:06:58,988
Mr. Klemperer?

676
01:06:58,988 --> 01:07:00,908
Please come inside.

677
01:07:02,828 --> 01:07:04,133
We were shown every room

678
01:07:05,017 --> 01:07:07,206
We didn't see anything worth remembering.

679
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:11,699
They are professional performers.

680
01:07:12,313 --> 01:07:14,886
Illusion is their craft.

681
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:17,613
It's not your place to speculate on that.

682
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:27,290
Did you speak to the woman called Markos?

683
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,210
Patricia referred to her as

684
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:31,130
"Mother Markos."

685
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:38,849
She had a delusion about this woman leading a coven there.

686
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:44,110
She had this delusion for months

687
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,950
Do you believe in witches, Doctor?

688
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:49,148
No.

689
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:52,827
But I believe that...

690
01:07:53,518 --> 01:07:59,662
people can organize themselves to
perpetrate crimes and call it magic.

691
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,735
That I can believe

692
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:08,380
Do you understand the kind of week we are having, Doctor?

693
01:08:14,908 --> 01:08:16,982
Detective Glockner!

694
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:22,934
This isn't the first time we've met.

695
01:08:24,585 --> 01:08:28,003
You were on the police force in Friedenau, weren't you?

696
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:33,648
You helped me to try to locate my wife.

697
01:08:33,955 --> 01:08:35,799
Your wife also went missing?

698
01:08:37,258 --> 01:08:40,023
Two years before the Russian charge.

699
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,321
Ankle Meire. 1943.

700
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:51,927
From the records, you helped me cross off Poland.

701
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:56,535
I'm still grateful.

702
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:07,917
And one, and two, and three.

703
01:09:08,076 --> 01:09:10,197
And one, and two, and three.

704
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:12,636
And one, and two, and three.

705
01:09:12,797 --> 01:09:15,396
And one, and two, and three.

706
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:17,437
One, and two, and three.

707
01:09:17,597 --> 01:09:19,997
And one, and two, and three.

708
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,357
And one, and two, and three.

709
01:09:22,517 --> 01:09:24,637
And one, and two, and three.

710
01:09:24,797 --> 01:09:26,477
That's-that's okay.

711
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:30,318
Do you want to do the jumps?

712
01:09:31,878 --> 01:09:33,637
Okay.

713
01:09:33,798 --> 01:09:35,437
And...

714
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:37,798
one, and two, and three.

715
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:40,438
And one, and two, and three.

716
01:09:40,598 --> 01:09:41,318
No.

717
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:43,118
Elbows higher.

718
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:44,438
All right, one moment.

719
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,398
Susie, part of the jump is muscle,

720
01:09:46,559 --> 01:09:48,758
and that will develop as you condition,

721
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,279
but you seem to have an aversion to them,

722
01:09:50,438 --> 01:09:51,919
and I don't quite see why.

723
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:53,719
Are you so happy to be stuck to the earth?

724
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,959
There's a yield before the push,

725
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,639
which I don't think you're quite understanding.

726
01:09:58,799 --> 01:10:01,959
Caroline. Could you come and do a series for us, please?

727
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:18,480
Thank you.

728
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:21,160
And now you.

729
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:49,001
What I really want is to be on...

730
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,161
on the floor right now, anyway.

731
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:52,721
Well, of course.

732
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,121
That's because you're mistaking physical weakness

733
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:57,202
with artistic preference.

734
01:10:57,362 --> 01:10:59,002
And because you're tired.

735
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:03,521
At this point,

736
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:05,922
the jumps are opposing the pull of the structure,

737
01:11:06,082 --> 01:11:08,282
but...

738
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:10,122
it's soon for that, don't you think?

739
01:11:12,162 --> 01:11:16,563
The floor work is... is keeping
the other dancers pushed down.

740
01:11:16,722 --> 01:11:19,203
So this...

741
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:21,963
this could echo that...

742
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:29,683
...on-on a slightly higher point of elevation.

743
01:11:32,283 --> 01:11:33,964
If I stay close to the ground now

744
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,723
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later,

745
01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:41,884
then that's more to the point.

746
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,244
The resistance is more...

747
01:11:44,404 --> 01:11:46,363
emphatic.

748
01:11:46,524 --> 01:11:47,724
Right?

749
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:55,764
I don't know how aware you are

750
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:59,165
of what times we lived through here 40 years ago.

751
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:03,605
Out of which this piece was made.

752
01:12:05,564 --> 01:12:07,685
We learned at great cost through those years

753
01:12:07,844 --> 01:12:10,925
the value of the balance of things.

754
01:12:11,085 --> 01:12:15,965
Every arrow that flies feels the pull of the earth,

755
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:19,725
but we must aim upwards.

756
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:21,486
We need to get you in the air.

757
01:12:39,487 --> 01:12:41,366
Leave her, leave her, leave her, leave her, leave...

758
01:12:59,081 --> 01:13:00,310
Oh, Caroline.

759
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:02,691
Don't be afraid.

760
01:13:03,526 --> 01:13:05,447
Eveything will be arlight.

761
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,088
Ja?

762
01:13:13,528 --> 01:13:15,488
She hit her head hard.

763
01:13:15,648 --> 01:13:17,048
I heard it. I hope...

764
01:13:17,437 --> 01:13:18,589
Miss..

765
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,199
One moment please!

766
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:30,528
I am... I'm looking for a dancer from your company.

767
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:32,969
Who are you looking for?

768
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:34,689
You are Sara.

769
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:38,929
Yes.

770
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:40,049
May I help you?

771
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:43,249
I am a friend from Patricia.

772
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:48,581
<i>"When the deadline arrived, the hijackers informed the police</i>

773
01:13:48,581 --> 01:13:53,112
<i>they had poured all the flight's duty-free alcohol over the hostages</i>

774
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:55,032
and were set to ignite them.

775
01:13:55,032 --> 01:13:57,989
<i>But when they were told the West German Government</i>

776
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:00,255
<i>was in the process of releasing the terrorists from Stammheim prison,</i>

777
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:04,287
<i>they agreed to extend the deadline to after midnight."</i>

778
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:06,491
I don't know what to make of any of this.

779
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,250
<i>I know the kind of thing she was involved with,</i>

780
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:09,690
<i>but I can't see how any of this</i>

781
01:14:09,851 --> 01:14:11,930
<i>could be happening inside the company.</i>

782
01:14:12,091 --> 01:14:15,451
Well, she describes...

783
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:18,451
something like a revolutionary organization

784
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:21,171
in a crisis of leadership.

785
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:24,251
With Markos very ill...

786
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:27,531
I live there.

787
01:14:27,691 --> 01:14:28,891
I have friends there.

788
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,051
I don't see any evidence of this at all.

789
01:14:31,212 --> 01:14:32,491
No one has ever approached me

790
01:14:32,652 --> 01:14:34,332
or any of the other girls, as far as I know.

791
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:37,251
Read this.

792
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:38,331
What is this?

793
01:14:38,492 --> 01:14:40,371
This is Patricia's diary.

794
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,052
Mother Markos.

795
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:47,252
Mother Meinhof.

796
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:48,692
The dance rehearsal.

797
01:14:48,853 --> 01:14:50,173
Political action.

798
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:52,132
These two areas in Patricia's life

799
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:55,372
were of equal importance.

800
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:58,132
This is how transference happens,

801
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,492
how delusion is made.

802
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:03,173
Delusion, Sara,

803
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,853
is a lie that tells a truth.

804
01:15:07,013 --> 01:15:09,093
-This says "witches."
-Mmm.

805
01:15:10,773 --> 01:15:15,173
Maybe Patricia's fantasies about witches,

806
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:20,734
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.

807
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:26,054
The company's a family.

808
01:15:26,214 --> 01:15:27,974
There's a lot of love there.

809
01:15:28,134 --> 01:15:29,614
Love and manipulation--

810
01:15:29,774 --> 01:15:33,894
they... they share houses very often.

811
01:15:34,054 --> 01:15:36,615
They are frequent bedfellows.

812
01:15:36,774 --> 01:15:38,535
Sorry, I don't see this.

813
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:44,055
Eat.

814
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,175
Eat.

815
01:15:55,855 --> 01:15:58,456
Only...

816
01:15:58,615 --> 01:16:01,375
maybe the police, they missed something.

817
01:16:02,616 --> 01:16:06,535
And Patricia, she did spoke of...

818
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:09,776
whole hidden areas of the building.

819
01:16:09,936 --> 01:16:12,896
Actual rooms that are secret.

820
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,616
I don't want to be disrespectful--

821
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:23,057
I don't-- but you're asking me,

822
01:16:23,216 --> 01:16:25,016
-and I'm telling you...
-Oh, please.

823
01:16:25,177 --> 01:16:26,336
It's a dance company.

824
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:28,376
We're not talking about anything else.

825
01:16:28,537 --> 01:16:30,057
Sara.

826
01:16:30,217 --> 01:16:33,457
Please, only look closer.

827
01:16:33,617 --> 01:16:34,737
Thank you for caring for Patricia,

828
01:16:34,897 --> 01:16:36,537
but I hope you don't come again.

829
01:16:58,658 --> 01:16:59,818
-Good night.
-Good night.

830
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:01,538
Sara, hurry up.

831
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:03,938
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

832
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:09,019
-Good night, Doll.
-Good night.

833
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:20,459
She hasn't come back yet?

834
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,540
Maybe she's seeing somebody.

835
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:34,820
Part of the issue always

836
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,300
is not being able to see your body in space.

837
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,901
One angle in one mirror or on film is not enough.

838
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,540
Movement is never mute.

839
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,141
It is a language.

840
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,780
It's a series of energetic shapes...

841
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:48,460
...written in the air

842
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:51,581
like words forming sentences.

843
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,141
Like poems.

844
01:17:54,381 --> 01:17:55,781
Like prayers.

845
01:17:58,781 --> 01:18:00,021
Spells?

846
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,981
When you jump, it's not the height

847
01:18:06,142 --> 01:18:08,501
but the space beneath you that matters.

848
01:18:08,662 --> 01:18:11,302
Every leap into the air must be a coup de foudre.

849
01:18:16,422 --> 01:18:18,062
I don't understand.

850
01:18:18,222 --> 01:18:20,862
A strike of lightning.

851
01:18:21,022 --> 01:18:23,102
A bolt of love, in fact.

852
01:18:26,183 --> 01:18:28,622
That's beautiful.

853
01:18:28,782 --> 01:18:31,982
There are two things that dance can never be again:

854
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:34,903
beautiful and cheerful.

855
01:18:35,063 --> 01:18:36,863
Today, we need to break the nose

856
01:18:37,022 --> 01:18:39,103
of every beautiful thing.

857
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:40,663
And if you're going to be a dancer,

858
01:18:40,823 --> 01:18:42,663
you must learn French.

859
01:18:43,737 --> 01:18:45,119
Try not to worry.

860
01:18:45,235 --> 01:18:47,385
Blanc is working on the new approach,

861
01:18:47,846 --> 01:18:50,649
How could we have known what would happen with Patricia?

862
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,952
What we are attempting hasn't been done in living memory.

863
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:57,485
How do we know it will work at all?

864
01:18:57,485 --> 01:18:59,827
If it killed that girl

865
01:18:59,827 --> 01:19:02,784
it may kill any girl we try.

866
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:03,821
She is not wrong.

867
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:05,664
Patricia was unwilling in the end.

868
01:19:05,664 --> 01:19:07,584
Blanc believes that was the reason.

869
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:09,889
We should not have forced it.

870
01:19:10,273 --> 01:19:11,732
She did not want to be a vessel.

871
01:19:11,732 --> 01:19:13,844
We wanted to bring her into our power

872
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:16,532
but she wanted to blow up departments stores intead.

873
01:19:16,724 --> 01:19:18,299
What a fool, that girl.

874
01:19:18,985 --> 01:19:20,824
When you dance the dance of another,

875
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:24,865
you make yourself in the image of its creator.

876
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:26,185
You empty yourself

877
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,785
so that her work can live within you.

878
01:19:27,945 --> 01:19:29,185
Do you understand?

879
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:32,465
Yeah.

880
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:33,746
You're in a company now.

881
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:35,186
You have to find your right place.

882
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:36,705
You have to decide--

883
01:19:36,866 --> 01:19:39,946
what is it you want to be for this company?

884
01:19:40,106 --> 01:19:41,866
Is it the head?

885
01:19:42,026 --> 01:19:43,666
The spine?

886
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,746
The sex?

887
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,066
The heart?

888
01:19:47,226 --> 01:19:48,386
The hands.

889
01:19:51,306 --> 01:19:53,187
I want to be this company's hands.

890
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,547
Higher.

891
01:19:59,706 --> 01:20:01,386
Higher. Higher.

892
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,146
Higher.

893
01:20:04,307 --> 01:20:06,347
Higher! Higher.

894
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:07,867
Higher.

895
01:20:09,427 --> 01:20:12,587
Higher, higher, higher.

896
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:13,828
Higher.

897
01:20:19,108 --> 01:20:19,987
Higher.

898
01:20:20,707 --> 01:20:22,948
Higher. Higher.

899
01:20:23,107 --> 01:20:26,707
Higher. Higher. Higher.

900
01:20:32,588 --> 01:20:35,309
Sometimes I only need to be told twice.

901
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,503
How do we know no one's planning to blow us up, too?

902
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:52,921
Patricia might have said anything to anyone about us.

903
01:20:53,074 --> 01:20:54,841
As she did with the old man.

904
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:56,914
You are right.

905
01:20:56,914 --> 01:20:58,834
We cannot despair.

906
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:00,025
We have time.

907
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:02,022
How much time?

908
01:21:02,675 --> 01:21:05,670
If Mother dies before Blanc can deliver us Susie

909
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,590
this company is finished.

910
01:21:07,782 --> 01:21:10,624
Markos will hold on, for us.

911
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:12,659
You've seen her.

912
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:15,808
Her body's a prison!

913
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,456
Disease is on top of disease

914
01:21:19,687 --> 01:21:21,223
How long she can possibly..

915
01:22:29,914 --> 01:22:34,354
33, 34, 35, 36,

916
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:37,674
37, 38, 39,

917
01:22:37,834 --> 01:22:39,354
40, 41.

918
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:46,475
57, 58, 59,

919
01:22:46,634 --> 01:22:49,274
60, 61, 62, 63.

920
01:22:58,795 --> 01:23:01,835
65, 64, 63, 62.

921
01:23:09,996 --> 01:23:12,595
23, 22, 21.

922
01:23:26,156 --> 01:23:27,596
Ten, nine, eight,

923
01:23:27,756 --> 01:23:29,317
seven, six.

924
01:23:29,476 --> 01:23:31,636
Two, one.

925
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,922
We couldn't stop her!

926
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:15,035
She was too fast with knife!

927
01:26:17,262 --> 01:26:18,644
She's cold.

928
01:26:21,364 --> 01:26:23,844
Come with me! Quickly!

929
01:26:41,205 --> 01:26:43,885
Patricia wrote about

930
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:47,326
"Three Mothers" lost in time,

931
01:26:47,485 --> 01:26:51,685
predating all Christian invention.

932
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:55,045
Pre-God. Pre-Devil.

933
01:26:55,206 --> 01:26:59,126
Mother Tenebrarum, Mother Lachrymarum

934
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:01,686
and Mother Suspiriorum.

935
01:27:03,086 --> 01:27:07,127
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

936
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,326
I saw images of that last night.

937
01:27:10,487 --> 01:27:12,847
In porcelain, these very fine things.

938
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:14,366
You can tell they have money.

939
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:21,367
Patricia said that, uh, Markos

940
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,807
claims to be one of the Three.

941
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:26,567
But there is dissent amongst them.

942
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:31,567
She wrote about "Markosites" and "Blancites."

943
01:27:31,728 --> 01:27:34,887
In-Internal division.

944
01:27:35,048 --> 01:27:37,047
Madame Blanc's involved in this?

945
01:27:43,368 --> 01:27:46,608
Do they believe they're witches?

946
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:52,009
You can give someone your delusion, Sara.

947
01:27:52,168 --> 01:27:53,408
That's religion.

948
01:27:56,128 --> 01:27:57,568
That was the Reich.

949
01:27:59,128 --> 01:28:00,808
The Reich had these things.

950
01:28:02,449 --> 01:28:04,369
Insignia.

951
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:07,369
Esoteric ritual.

952
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:10,569
These "Mothers," yeah, they could be

953
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:13,929
code names for founding members

954
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,370
with metaphoric histories.

955
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:18,730
I don't know.

956
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:23,369
But I do know you are living with dangerous people.

957
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:25,610
Patricia could still be in...

958
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:26,690
...in there.

959
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:32,691
They could be holding her.

960
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,410
In the building.

961
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:36,610
Well, I cannot promise that the authorities

962
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:39,611
will come back to, uh, inspect a cabinet

963
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:44,010
full of porcelain after all that has happened.

964
01:28:44,171 --> 01:28:46,331
But we can try.

965
01:28:46,491 --> 01:28:50,131
And in the meantime, you must,
uh, take care of yourself.

966
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:52,131
Perhaps you should leave.

967
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,731
You have somewhere you can go?

968
01:28:55,891 --> 01:28:58,252
I'll figure it out.

969
01:28:58,411 --> 01:29:01,092
And I think you should put this back.

970
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,091
Or better still, you leave it here.

971
01:29:05,092 --> 01:29:07,132
Not good for them to know that you have it.

972
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:38,576
Is anyone among you sick?

973
01:30:38,736 --> 01:30:41,256
Let him call for the elders of the church;

974
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:43,696
and let them pray over him,

975
01:30:43,857 --> 01:30:47,256
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

976
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:52,577
And the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick,

977
01:30:52,737 --> 01:30:55,617
and the Lord shall raise him up;

978
01:30:55,777 --> 01:30:59,737
and if he has committed sins...

979
01:30:59,897 --> 01:31:01,737
My daughter.

980
01:31:04,537 --> 01:31:06,497
...they shall be forgiven him.

981
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:12,217
My last one.

982
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:17,818
She's my sin.

983
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:20,938
She's what I smeared on the world.

984
01:31:27,971 --> 01:31:32,272
First of all it's very important, do you remember this?

985
01:31:33,577 --> 01:31:37,456
You must use your center.

986
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:39,683
and you must create a space.

987
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,139
Now I understand.

988
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,136
Wait, wait.

989
01:31:45,943 --> 01:31:47,287
Alright.

990
01:31:49,015 --> 01:31:52,087
Suspended, suspended in the air.

991
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:54,161
Remember to create space.

992
01:31:54,161 --> 01:31:56,081
Yes, I understand.

993
01:32:00,459 --> 01:32:03,860
You're making some kind of deal with them.

994
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

995
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,100
How can you know

996
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,660
what they're going to ask you in return?

997
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,780
Sara, whatever you have in your mind,

998
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:17,101
nothing is wrong.

999
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,021
You just haven't seen the bill yet.

1000
01:32:21,061 --> 01:32:22,621
Nothing's wrong.

1001
01:32:25,688 --> 01:32:37,363
<i>"Special forces of the German Federal Police stromed Lufthansa 181
in the night and killed three of the four hijackers ending five days
of terror for the passenger of the flight.</i>

1002
01:32:37,363 --> 01:32:53,069
<i>In the morning, in the high-security wing of the Stuutgart-Stammheim prison,
three of the five RAF prisoners were discovered dead in an apparent
suicide pact made upon hearing of the news from Mogadishu.</i>

1003
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,911
<i>Protesters are congregating around the Germany</i>

1004
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:59,943
<i>chanting that the prisoners were instead assassinated.</i>

1005
01:33:00,788 --> 01:33:07,930
<i>Federal Police President Horst Herold, went so far
as to declare 'The Baader-Meinoff era is done'."</i>

1006
01:33:19,063 --> 01:33:20,664
What's the matter with you?

1007
01:33:20,824 --> 01:33:22,464
Huh?

1008
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:31,064
You don't be so afraid about the white, Susie.

1009
01:33:31,224 --> 01:33:34,424
They need to see you from the very back row.

1010
01:33:42,425 --> 01:33:43,784
Where is Sara?

1011
01:33:45,305 --> 01:33:47,545
She came early in the morning,

1012
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,545
did her makeup and left.

1013
01:33:51,747 --> 01:33:53,475
Good evening, welcome.

1014
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:57,776
First time here, isn't it?

1015
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:00,963
Please, come.

1016
01:34:08,874 --> 01:34:11,869
Yes, thank you. Have fun.

1017
01:34:11,869 --> 01:34:13,789
Straight ahead.

1018
01:34:38,867 --> 01:34:39,787
Girls!

1019
01:34:39,947 --> 01:34:41,948
Vier minuten!

1020
01:34:42,107 --> 01:34:43,388
Four minutes!

1021
01:34:46,227 --> 01:34:49,067
Vier minuten!

1022
01:34:49,228 --> 01:34:50,867
Tak, tak.

1023
01:35:31,429 --> 01:35:32,509
Is it true?

1024
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,589
Sara.

1025
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:36,589
Sara.

1026
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:38,110
Patricia.

1027
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,230
Patricia. Patricia.

1028
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,790
-I knew it.
-They'll kill him.

1029
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,751
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1030
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:48,791
I'm so sorry.

1031
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:50,951
What did they do to you?

1032
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:53,471
I wake up here every day.

1033
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,351
It's all over now. I'll get you out.

1034
01:35:56,591 --> 01:35:57,991
The performance is starting upstairs.

1035
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:00,711
Everyone will be looking the other way.

1036
01:36:00,871 --> 01:36:03,191
Get up. Get up.

1037
01:36:03,351 --> 01:36:04,431
Patricia!

1038
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:07,711
-Patricia, get up.
-I'm trying.

1039
01:36:07,872 --> 01:36:08,991
Get up.

1040
01:36:19,832 --> 01:36:23,672
Get it off of me!

1041
01:36:23,832 --> 01:36:25,152
Sara!

1042
01:36:56,873 --> 01:37:00,274
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

1043
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:13,356
Good evening!

1044
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:18,310
We created this piece in 1948.

1045
01:37:20,955 --> 01:37:22,115
Marketa.

1046
01:37:22,275 --> 01:37:23,675
Where is Sara?

1047
01:37:23,835 --> 01:37:24,594
Sara?

1048
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:25,795
I don't know.

1049
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:27,675
-Is she upstairs?
-No. I looked.

1050
01:37:27,835 --> 01:37:29,835
Just dance as if she's with you.

1051
01:37:38,635 --> 01:37:40,195
Sara!

1052
01:37:45,844 --> 01:37:50,721
This is the last time we are performing it.

1053
01:37:51,873 --> 01:37:55,521
The Markos Dance Company presents

1054
01:37:55,944 --> 01:37:56,712
Volk!

1055
01:38:01,596 --> 01:38:02,197
Go!

1056
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,231
My darling..

1057
01:39:54,241 --> 01:39:56,602
-No.
-Sara, lie still.

1058
01:39:56,761 --> 01:39:58,602
- No!
- Sara.

1059
01:40:01,682 --> 01:40:05,162
Please. Please...

1060
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:12,482
No! No!

1061
01:41:10,718 --> 01:41:12,676
The girl is ready, Blanc.

1062
01:41:12,868 --> 01:41:14,135
It's time.

1063
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:10,822
Please, remain seated!

1064
01:44:10,937 --> 01:44:11,628
Stay calm and seated!

1065
01:44:11,653 --> 01:44:12,373
Sara!

1066
01:44:56,096 --> 01:44:57,296
Good.

1067
01:44:57,456 --> 01:44:59,136
Good. That's good.

1068
01:46:12,339 --> 01:46:14,179
I'm sorry I went off book.

1069
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:22,380
This can't happen again.

1070
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:26,620
You're only just starting to understand, Susie.

1071
01:46:26,779 --> 01:46:28,260
We brought Sara back upstairs

1072
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:30,620
to try to complete the performance in time,

1073
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:33,260
but then you derailed it.

1074
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,381
Did I hurt those people?

1075
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:36,860
Not this time.

1076
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,300
They saw a dance.

1077
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:39,420
That's all.

1078
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,501
It's all a mess, isn't it?

1079
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,700
The one out there.

1080
01:46:46,861 --> 01:46:48,341
The one in here.

1081
01:46:51,221 --> 01:46:52,581
The one that's coming.

1082
01:46:56,861 --> 01:46:59,181
Why is everyone

1083
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:01,902
so ready to think the worst is over?

1084
01:47:20,222 --> 01:47:22,222
I could explain everything to you.

1085
01:47:24,542 --> 01:47:26,823
I think it would be wrong, though.

1086
01:47:32,892 --> 01:47:35,196
You don't want to make me choose.

1087
01:47:35,542 --> 01:47:37,500
Because you love me.

1088
01:47:42,262 --> 01:47:43,836
Close your eyes.

1089
01:47:47,638 --> 01:47:49,712
No more dreams tonight.

1090
01:47:53,975 --> 01:47:55,626
I'll make sure of it.

1091
01:47:59,824 --> 01:48:02,865
One, two, three, four.

1092
01:48:03,024 --> 01:48:06,744
One, two, three, four.

1093
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:10,665
One, two, three, four.

1094
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,052
Tonight.

1095
01:48:19,397 --> 01:48:21,317
It must happen tonight.

1096
01:49:30,268 --> 01:49:31,508
Herr Doktor.

1097
01:49:31,822 --> 01:49:33,781
But Doctor, the soup is ready!

1098
01:50:01,008 --> 01:50:03,081
You can eat and drink

1099
01:50:03,081 --> 01:50:04,425
all that you want!

1100
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:54,216
Who's there?

1101
01:52:14,147 --> 01:52:15,222
Josef?

1102
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,404
Anke?

1103
01:52:34,231 --> 01:52:36,381
Karol told them about us.

1104
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:40,605
I had only a few minutes to get out.

1105
01:52:43,754 --> 01:52:47,326
I got the apartment, but my papers were'n't anywhere.

1106
01:52:49,246 --> 01:52:52,433
Then I traveled by foot to Teplitz.

1107
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:55,313
where I planned to ask Mireks family to take me in.

1108
01:52:55,697 --> 01:52:57,925
But I was caught at the border

1109
01:52:58,385 --> 01:53:00,728
and taken to Terezin Camp

1110
01:53:00,997 --> 01:53:04,338
No one believed me that I was born in Gartz.

1111
01:53:05,643 --> 01:53:09,215
After the liberation I made my way Zurich

1112
01:53:09,676 --> 01:53:11,135
and then to Bristol.

1113
01:53:12,287 --> 01:53:13,976
I've made

1114
01:53:14,975 --> 01:53:18,085
a new life there

1115
01:53:19,622 --> 01:53:21,350
A lovely life.

1116
01:53:23,807 --> 01:53:25,228
I was told

1117
01:53:25,612 --> 01:53:28,377
you'd died in the invasion.

1118
01:56:21,723 --> 01:56:24,104
Look how dirty he made it!

1119
01:56:24,449 --> 01:56:26,715
Have a pity!

1120
01:56:26,715 --> 01:56:29,365
What reason is there to pity you?

1121
01:56:29,365 --> 01:56:32,898
You had years to get your wife out of Berlin

1122
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:35,279
before the arrests began.

1123
01:56:36,047 --> 01:56:38,773
When women tell you the truth

1124
01:56:38,773 --> 01:56:40,693
You don't pity them

1125
01:56:40,962 --> 01:56:44,457
You tell them they have delusions!

1126
01:59:15,644 --> 01:59:18,525
I'm not guilty...

1127
01:59:20,253 --> 01:59:23,018
I am innocent!

1128
01:59:24,131 --> 01:59:27,741
I remember!

1129
01:59:28,701 --> 01:59:31,850
I am innocent!

1130
01:59:36,497 --> 01:59:38,916
Are there guilty men in Berlin?

1131
01:59:39,338 --> 01:59:40,644
Everywhere!

1132
01:59:42,103 --> 01:59:45,252
But I am not one of them!

1133
01:59:49,897 --> 01:59:51,377
I'm ready, Madame.

1134
02:00:16,818 --> 02:00:17,978
You look afraid.

1135
02:00:20,299 --> 02:00:22,138
She's afraid for you.

1136
02:00:37,699 --> 02:00:41,300
There will be nothing of you

1137
02:00:41,459 --> 02:00:45,140
left inside.

1138
02:00:45,299 --> 02:00:50,660
Only space for me.

1139
02:00:50,819 --> 02:00:53,180
I came here for this.

1140
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:57,100
You've all waited long enough.

1141
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:59,260
Ah!

1142
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:02,181
It is happening.

1143
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:05,421
It is happening!

1144
02:01:46,782 --> 02:01:50,262
Do you come here willingly?

1145
02:01:50,423 --> 02:01:52,103
Hmm?

1146
02:01:53,222 --> 02:01:54,103
Huh?

1147
02:01:54,263 --> 02:01:55,943
You must have no doubts, Susie.

1148
02:01:56,102 --> 02:01:58,343
If you do, I can take you back.

1149
02:01:58,502 --> 02:02:00,943
I can take all of this from your head.

1150
02:02:01,103 --> 02:02:03,143
You can forget everything.

1151
02:02:05,463 --> 02:02:08,503
I want this to be pure.

1152
02:02:08,664 --> 02:02:12,543
We all know what you want.

1153
02:02:16,664 --> 02:02:19,664
This isn't vanity.

1154
02:02:19,824 --> 02:02:22,464
This isn't...

1155
02:02:22,624 --> 02:02:24,464
art!

1156
02:02:26,544 --> 02:02:28,544
There is something wrong here.

1157
02:02:28,704 --> 02:02:29,785
Can you not feel it?

1158
02:02:29,944 --> 02:02:31,864
This is not right.

1159
02:02:32,024 --> 02:02:33,145
We have to stop this now.

1160
02:02:33,304 --> 02:02:35,865
We have been on

1161
02:02:36,025 --> 02:02:37,984
two sides of this

1162
02:02:38,145 --> 02:02:39,904
for too long now.

1163
02:02:40,065 --> 02:02:42,505
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1164
02:02:42,665 --> 02:02:46,185
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

1165
02:02:46,345 --> 02:02:48,625
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1166
02:02:48,785 --> 02:02:50,385
Markos! Markos!

1167
02:02:50,546 --> 02:02:52,665
Markos! Markos! Markos!

1168
02:02:52,826 --> 02:02:55,065
Markos! Markos!

1169
02:03:24,987 --> 02:03:28,387
If you accept me,

1170
02:03:28,547 --> 02:03:33,427
you must put down the woman who bore you.

1171
02:03:35,707 --> 02:03:38,788
Think of that false mother now.

1172
02:03:51,108 --> 02:03:54,268
Reject her.

1173
02:03:54,428 --> 02:03:56,268
Expel her.

1174
02:03:59,909 --> 02:04:05,708
You have the only mother you need here.

1175
02:04:05,869 --> 02:04:08,749
Death to any other mother.

1176
02:04:08,909 --> 02:04:09,349
Say it.

1177
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:14,109
Death to any other mother.

1178
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,391
Who are you?

1179
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:54,111
For whom were you anointed?

1180
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:56,871
Which of the Three Mothers?

1181
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:58,911
Mother...

1182
02:05:03,671 --> 02:05:06,591
Mother Suspiriorum.

1183
02:05:09,311 --> 02:05:11,792
I am she.

1184
02:05:48,754 --> 02:05:49,753
Markos.

1185
02:06:03,994 --> 02:06:04,874
Markos!

1186
02:06:39,675 --> 02:06:40,676
Markos!

1187
02:06:42,716 --> 02:06:43,716
Markos.

1188
02:06:50,557 --> 02:06:53,557
Death to any other mother.

1189
02:06:53,716 --> 02:06:54,836
Markos.

1190
02:07:01,677 --> 02:07:02,596
Markos!

1191
02:07:14,438 --> 02:07:15,117
Markos!

1192
02:07:22,598 --> 02:07:23,717
Markos!

1193
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:15,000
I am the Mother.

1194
02:08:35,601 --> 02:08:37,921
What do you ask?

1195
02:08:38,082 --> 02:08:39,361
To die.

1196
02:08:43,482 --> 02:08:45,441
Mother.

1197
02:08:45,602 --> 02:08:47,202
Mother, we're so tired.

1198
02:08:55,002 --> 02:08:56,842
What do you ask?

1199
02:08:57,002 --> 02:08:59,083
To die.

1200
02:08:59,242 --> 02:09:00,602
I want to die.

1201
02:09:09,963 --> 02:09:11,403
Sweet girl.

1202
02:09:13,603 --> 02:09:15,203
What do you ask?

1203
02:09:18,803 --> 02:09:19,723
Die.

1204
02:09:45,964 --> 02:09:48,484
Dance. Dance.

1205
02:09:48,645 --> 02:09:50,925
Keep dancing.

1206
02:09:51,084 --> 02:09:52,644
It's beautiful.

1207
02:09:53,805 --> 02:09:55,445
It's beautiful.

1208
02:09:56,725 --> 02:09:58,645
It's beautiful.

1209
02:11:10,417 --> 02:11:11,876
Watch your step,

1210
02:11:14,641 --> 02:11:16,369
It's been snowing.

1211
02:11:16,638 --> 02:11:18,289
Everything is pretty.

1212
02:11:18,558 --> 02:11:21,630
And again, slowly.

1213
02:11:22,168 --> 02:11:23,969
Yeah. Okay.

1214
02:11:24,129 --> 02:11:25,929
Good. Good.

1215
02:11:32,997 --> 02:11:37,259
Good evening, good night

1216
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:44,133
with roses covered

1217
02:11:44,825 --> 02:11:48,703
with cloves adorned

1218
02:11:49,586 --> 02:11:53,811
slip under the covers.

1219
02:11:54,271 --> 02:11:59,110
Tomorrow morning, if God wills

1220
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:03,718
you will wake once again.

1221
02:13:16,174 --> 02:13:18,654
My God, what a night.

1222
02:13:18,814 --> 02:13:21,295
I definitely drank too much wine.

1223
02:13:22,327 --> 02:13:24,746
And what about the song of Tanner and Balfour?

1224
02:13:24,861 --> 02:13:26,128
It was fantastic!

1225
02:13:26,128 --> 02:13:28,049
Yes, I adore it!

1226
02:13:35,295 --> 02:13:36,575
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

1227
02:13:40,375 --> 02:13:42,335
-Guten Morgen.
-Morning.

1228
02:13:42,495 --> 02:13:43,616
Good morning.

1229
02:13:44,331 --> 02:13:47,518
Girls, I need you to listen.

1230
02:13:47,518 --> 02:13:52,050
I have such a sad news and I want you to be brave when you hear it.

1231
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,891
Madame Blanc has left the company.

1232
02:14:20,237 --> 02:14:22,733
Be brave girls!

1233
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:40,244
"aryan papers"

1234
02:15:12,578 --> 02:15:14,729
This is not the way to do it, Doctor.

1235
02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:18,914
I nearly called the police myself.

1236
02:15:19,106 --> 02:15:22,409
You haven't been well, I know.

1237
02:15:24,636 --> 02:15:26,902
Who are you? How did you get in here?

1238
02:15:27,171 --> 02:15:28,515
Wait outside.

1239
02:15:54,422 --> 02:15:56,822
I regret what my daughters did to you.

1240
02:15:59,182 --> 02:16:01,181
I wasn't in a position to prevent it.

1241
02:16:06,302 --> 02:16:08,662
I believe you deserve to know the truth.

1242
02:16:17,542 --> 02:16:21,983
Your wife did try to make it south

1243
02:16:22,143 --> 02:16:23,583
to Teplice.

1244
02:16:25,583 --> 02:16:29,383
She was apprehended by border guards

1245
02:16:29,543 --> 02:16:32,543
in the woods just outside of Glashuütte.

1246
02:16:35,743 --> 02:16:40,543
She was then taken to Theresienstadt camp.

1247
02:16:43,144 --> 02:16:45,504
She lived there for 20 days.

1248
02:16:47,344 --> 02:16:52,184
On the 11th of November, 1943,

1249
02:16:52,344 --> 02:16:56,424
the commandant of the camp, a man named Burger...

1250
02:16:57,944 --> 02:17:00,665
...ordered all 40,000 detained there

1251
02:17:00,824 --> 02:17:05,305
stand outside in the cold for a census.

1252
02:17:11,225 --> 02:17:13,185
Hours and hours passed.

1253
02:17:16,905 --> 02:17:18,906
Some hundreds died of exposure.

1254
02:17:27,705 --> 02:17:30,146
Your wife had two women with her as she died.

1255
02:17:32,506 --> 02:17:35,946
Women she had befriended,

1256
02:17:36,106 --> 02:17:38,666
who made her feel that she was not alone.

1257
02:17:45,787 --> 02:17:49,347
Her final thoughts...

1258
02:17:49,507 --> 02:17:52,907
were of a birthday

1259
02:17:53,067 --> 02:17:56,867
when you took her to a concert as a surprise.

1260
02:17:57,027 --> 02:17:59,467
Chopin and Brahms.

1261
02:18:03,788 --> 02:18:05,907
It was the first time you held her hand.

1262
02:18:11,788 --> 02:18:14,428
She was cold when she died.

1263
02:18:17,788 --> 02:18:19,228
But she wasn't afraid.

1264
02:18:23,628 --> 02:18:25,749
She was thinking only of you.

1265
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:46,349
Of Anke Meier...

1266
02:18:48,709 --> 02:18:50,350
...of Patricia Hingle...

1267
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:53,629
...of Sara Simms...

1268
02:18:57,469 --> 02:19:00,750
...of Susanna Bannion,

1269
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:04,110
of all the women of your undoing...

1270
02:19:07,031 --> 02:19:09,630
...every memory will vanish.

1271
02:19:13,751 --> 02:19:17,150
They will melt away in the sun

1272
02:19:17,311 --> 02:19:18,470
and be gone.

1273
02:19:21,383 --> 02:19:24,686
We need guilt,

1274
02:19:25,569 --> 02:19:26,798
Doctor.

1275
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:30,484
And shame

1276
02:19:31,982 --> 02:19:33,825
But not yours.

1277
02:19:47,312 --> 02:19:49,072
Herr Doktor.

1278
02:19:49,232 --> 02:19:51,752
Herr Doktor.

1279
02:20:02,012 --> 02:20:03,280
Who are you?

1280
02:20:03,587 --> 02:20:04,892
Miss Sesame!

1281
02:20:06,633 --> 02:20:08,593
-Ja?
-Ja.

1282
02:20:38,123 --> 02:20:40,233
- ?
- Wait.

1283
02:20:41,015 --> 02:20:43,280
- Are you calling?
- Yes.

1284
02:20:43,358 --> 02:20:44,921
Go to mom.

1285
02:20:44,946 --> 02:20:46,249
?

1286
02:20:46,796 --> 02:20:48,827
- Come now! See you.
- Yes.
