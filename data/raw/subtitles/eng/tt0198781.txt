00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:30,907
BOY:

00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,027
MAN:
Sleep tight, kiddo.

10
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:32,987

13
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,309

14
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,685

24
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:44,774
Whoa!

Simulation terminated.

35
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,362
All right,
Mr. Bile, is it?

36
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,923
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

37
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:12,979
Uh-huh.

38
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,124
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

39
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:16,245
I fell down?

40
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:18,037
No, no, before that.

41
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,717
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

42
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:23,127
Anyone?

43
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,727
( coughs )

44
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:25,527
( groans )

45
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,031
Let's take a look
at the tape.

46
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,056
Here we go.

47
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,105
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

48
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,545
Ah! There, see?

49
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,433
The door.
You left it wide open.

50
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,234
( whimpers )

51
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,994
( all murmuring )

52
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:37,883
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

53
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,539
any employee can make
because...?

54
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,260
Um... it could let in a draft?

55
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,668
It could let in

56
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,685
a child!

57
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:47,901
Oh! Mr. Waternoose!

58
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:52,543
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

59
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:54,687
A single touch could kill you!

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Leave a door open

61
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,521
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

62
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:01,442
Right into the monster world!

63
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,786
I won't go
in a kid's room!

64
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:03,746
You can't make me!

65
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,691
You're going in there
because we need this.

66
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,899
( children screaming )

67
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,724
( whimpering )

68
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:11,844
( static and feedback )

69
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:12,805
( screaming stops )

70
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,917
Our city is counting on you

71
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,094
to collect those children's
screams.

72
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,814
Without scream,
we have no power.

73
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,831
Yes, it's dangerous work

74
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,712
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

75
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:27,657
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious

76
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:30,409
tough, intimidating.

77
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:35,723
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

78
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:38,668
( snoring )

79
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,428
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.

80
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,733
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 A.M.

81
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,109
in the big monster city.

82
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,806
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--

83
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,694
which is good news
for you reptiles--

84
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,031
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day

85
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,016
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

86
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:55,792
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

87
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,201
Get up, Sulley!

88
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,929
--( screaming )
--( honking )

89
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:02,770
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

90
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,755
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

91
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:06,228
--Feel the burn!
--( growling )

92
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,636
You call yourself
a monster?

93
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:08,596
( growling )

94
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,005
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

95
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,125
Oop! The kid's awake!

96
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,821
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

97
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,781
kid's asleep!

98
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,742
( roaring )

99
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:15,958
Twins! In a bunk bed!

100
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,263
( growling )

101
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,639
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

102
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,080
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,361
You ready? Follow it.

104
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:23,384
Oh! It's over here!

105
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,537
Oh, look over there!

106
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,946
Don't let the kid
touch you!

107
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,002
Don't let it touch you!

108
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,794
* I don't know,
but it's been said *

109
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,362
* I love scaring kids in bed! *

110
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,251
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

111
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,659
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

112
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,868
1 18... do you have 1 19?

113
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:37,405
Do I see 120?

114
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,653
Oh, I don't believe it!

115
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,061
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

116
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,021
Not you!

117
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:42,238
Look! The new
commercial's on!

118
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,358

We light your city.

126
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,906
Hey, look! Betty!

refined into clean,
dependable energy.

131
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:06,340
Every time you turn something on

132
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:08,581
Monsters, Incorporated,

133
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:10,470
I'm Monsters, Incorporated!

ANNOUNCER:
We know the challenge--

135
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,991
the window of innocence
is shrinking.

136
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:16,328
Human kids are harder to scare.

137
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,888
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

138
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,073
with the top scarers...

139

We scare because we care.

148
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,126
I can't believe it.

149
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,183
Oh, Mike...

150
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,648
I was on TV!

151
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,217
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!

152
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,177
( phone rings )

153
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,169
Hello.

154
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,129
I know!

155
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,089
Hey, wasn't I great?

156
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,306
Did the whole
family see it?

157
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,426
It's your mom.

158
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,570
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

159
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,870
( bicycle bell rings )

160
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,662
I'm telling you, big daddy

161
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,095
you're going to be seeing this
face on TV a lot more often.

162
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,952
Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis@s Most Wanted?

163
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,168
( mocking laughter )

164
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,608
You've been jealous
of my good looks

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,729
since the
fourth grade, pal.

166
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,137
Have a good day, sweetie.

167
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,282
You, too, hon.

168
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:22,203
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

169
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,259
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

170
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,219
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

171
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,467
Where you going?
What are you doing?

172
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,292
Mikey, there's a scream
shortage. We're walking.

173
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:28,348
--Walking?!
--Yep.

174
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,277
No, no, no, my baby.

175
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,237
Come on. Come on.

176
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,389
Look, she needs
to be driven.

177
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,854
Bye, baby.
I... I'II call you!

178
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,614
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

179
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:36,895
I bought the car? Huh?

180
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:37,855
Not really.

181
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:38,911
To drive it!

182
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,223
You know, like,
on the street?

183
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,536
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

184
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:42,496
and no walking involved.

185
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,456
( mock whining )

186
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:44,929
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

187
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,529
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

188
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,906
I could use
the exercise?!

189
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,922
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

190
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,130
GIRL MONSTERS:
How many tentacles
jump the rope?

191
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,699
BOY MONSTER:
Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

192
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:54,659
Hey! Morning, kids.

193
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:55,619
Hey, kids.

194
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,580
How you doing?

195
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,244
Bye, Mike!
Bye, Sulley!

196
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,973
BIG EYE:
Ow! Hey!

197
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,926
( humming )

198
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,471
( sneezing )

199
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,040
Ah, nuts.

200
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,992
( singing )

201
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,592
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

202
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,552
Hey, Tony!

203
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,889
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

204
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:15,849
--Tony!
--Hey, Tony!

205
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:16,778
Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow!

206
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:18,282
I hear somebody's
close to breaking

207
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:19,243
the all-time
scare record.

208
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:20,459
Ah, just trying
to make sure

209
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,867
there's enough scream
to go around.

210
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:22,892
( laughing )

211
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,140
Hey! On the house!

212
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,060
--Hey, thanks!
--Grazie!

213
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:27,789
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!

214
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:29,485
( startled gasp )

215
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,374
Oh, great.

216
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,399
Hey, Ted!

217
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,903
Good morning!

218
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,311
( clucking )

219
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,352
See that, Mikey?

220
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,760
Ted's walking to work.

221
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,977
Big deal.

222
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,705
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

223
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:50,003
( phones ringing )

224
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,667
FEMALE MONSTER:
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

225
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,844
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

226
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,804
Morning, Sulley.

227
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,764
Morning, Ricky.

228
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:56,757
Hey, it's
the Sullster!

229
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:57,878
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

230
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,030
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

231
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,598
Morning, Sulley!

232
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,911
Hey!

233
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,983
Hey, it's still
leaning to the left.

234
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,168
It is not!

235
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:07,129
Hey, fellas.

236
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,089
Hey, Jerry.

237
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,401
Hey, Mr. Sullivan!

238
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:12,153
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

239
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,114
( nervous giggling )

240
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:14,074
I don't think so.

241
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,994
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.

242
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,019
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

243
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,300
Come on, get lost,
you two.

244
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,708
You're making him
lose his focus.

245
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,636
Oh. Sorry.

246
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:21,596
See you later,
fellas.

247
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,421
Go get 'em,
Mr. Sullivan!

248
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:26,462
Quiet! You'II make
him lose his focus.

249
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,422
Oh, no. Sorry!

250
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:28,350
Shut up!

251
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,175
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

252
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,287
Monsters, Inc.
I'II connect you.

253
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:33,536
Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.

254
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,720
Would you like her voice mail?

255
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:37,441
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

256
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,201
-( snakes squealing )
-Googley Bear!

257
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,322
Happy birthday.

258
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,882
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

259
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,163
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

260
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:45,443
Oh, hey, Celia...

261
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:46,531
weelia.

262
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,196
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.

263
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,476
Thanks.

264
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:52,357
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

265
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,757
I just got us
into a little place

266
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,742
called, um...
Harryhausen's.

267
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:57,703
( gasps )

268
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:58,855
Harryhausen's?!

269
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:00,967
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,920
Not for Googley Bear.

271
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,552
I will see you
at quitting time

272
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:05,801
and not a minute later.

273
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,825
Okay, sweetheart.

274
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,201
Think romantical
thoughts.

275
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,282
* You and me *

276
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:11,626
* Me and you *

277
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,963
* Both of us together! *

278
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,268
You know, pal, she's the one.

279
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,612
That's it.
She is the one!

280
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:19,149
I'm happy for you.

281
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,749
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

282
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,126
with those reservations.

283
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:22,797
Oh, no problem.

284
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:24,174
They're under the
name Googley Bear.

285
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,167
Oh, good ide...

286
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,279
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

287
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,367
( gasps )

288
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:30,576
What the...?

289
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:31,537
Wazowski!

290
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,464
( screams )

291
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,649
( grunts )

292
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:34,609
( chuckling )

293
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:35,826
What do you know?

294
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:38,642
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

295
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:39,634
I wasn't scared.

296
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,875
I have... allergies.

297
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:42,931
( coughing )

298
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,500
Uh-huh. Sure.

299
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:46,389
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

300
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,924
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

301
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,813
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.

302
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:51,253
Putting up some big numbers.

303
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,310
Wow, Randall.

304
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:53,271
That's great.

305
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,935
That should make it
even more humiliating

306
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,183
when we break the record first.

307
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:56,663
Ha, ha!

308
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,264
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

309
00:10:58,264 --> 00:10:59,512
Do you hear that?

310
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,424
It's the winds of change.

311
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,394
( mocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''

312
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:07,611
Oh, what a creep.

313
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,787
One of these days,
I am really...

314
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:12,379
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

315
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:15,772
( deep croaking )

316
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:17,117
( liquid squishing )

317
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,150
Chalooby! Baby!

318
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,137
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz

319
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,057
my succulent
little garden snail.

320
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,561
And who would
we be scaring today?

321
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,850
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

322
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,355
Oh, that darn paperwork.

323
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,844
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

324
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:37,932
( chair squeaking )

325
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,300
Don't let it happen again.

326
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,805
Yes, well, I'II, uh...

327
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:44,141
I'II try to be less careless.

328
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:46,478
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

329
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:48,462
Always watching.

330
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:49,422
Whoo! She's nuts.

331
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,343
Always!

332
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,415
CELIA ( over PA ):
All scare floors are now active.

333
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,136
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

334
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,448
( metallic clunk )

335
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,658
( machine beeps, bell dings )

336
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,340
( bell dings )

337
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,025
( clanking and whirring )

338
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,434
( chime rings )

339
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:45,018
Okay, people, eastern seaboard
coming on-line.

340
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,906
We got scarers coming out!

341
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:53,244
( dramatic brass fanfare
playing )

342
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:03,102
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

343
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,683
( knuckles cracking )

344
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:25,475
( clanging and growling )

345
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:27,684
( snarls )

346
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,485
( blowing )

347
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:33,669
( growling )

348
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:50,312
Hey... may
the best monster win.

349
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:51,689
I plan to.

350
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:52,745
( bell ringing )

351
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:55,530
We are on in seven... six...

352
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,146
five... four... three...

353
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,131
two...

354
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:03,627
( horn blaring )

355
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:04,491
( growls )

356
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,052
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

357
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,140
You're the big,
hairy boss.

358
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,093
( child screaming )

359
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:16,782
( bell dings )

360
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:19,023
Oh, I'm feeling good today,
Mikey!

361
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:19,983
Yeah!

362
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,199
MIKE:
Whoa!

363
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:22,479
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

364
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,759
Another door coming right up.

365
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,352
( whirring and clanking )

366
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,600
( child screaming )

367
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:28,656
( bell dings )

368
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:31,377
( growling )

369
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,657
You're still behind,
Randall.

370
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,705
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve.

371
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,762
Just get me
another door!

372
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:36,754
A door! Yes, door!

373
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:39,187
( child screaming )

374
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,883
( bell dings )

375
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,099
( bells dinging )

376
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:46,004
( beeping )

377
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,804
( metallic clanking )

378
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,765
( click and hiss )

379
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:50,262
( children screaming )

380
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,501
( bells dinging )

381
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:54,838
( children screaming )

382
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,480
Well, Jerry, what's
the damage so far?

383
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,040
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

384
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,921
Hmm. First time
in a month.

385
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,001
( gurgling and burping )

386
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,474
Huh?!

387
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,754
( door buzzing )

388
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,675
( screaming and sobbing )

389
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,115
What happened?

390
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,235
The kid almost
touched me!

391
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:19,580
She got this close
to me!

392
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,828
She wasn't
scared of you?

393
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:21,948
She was only six!

394
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,292
I could've been dead!

395
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,213
I could've died!

396
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:27,325
Keep it together, man.

397
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,445
( whistling )

398
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,014
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!

399
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,454
--We're coming!
--Coming!

400
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,086
--Look out!
--Out of the way!

401
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:35,007
--Coming through!
--Excuse us.

402
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:37,472
( whimpering )

403
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:40,000
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

404
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,921
Oh, kids these days.

405
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,577
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

406
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,593
Let her rip!

407
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:49,314
( buzzing )

408
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,283
( metallic clank )

409
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,875
( eerie blubbering )

410
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:56,835
( child screaming )

411
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:57,795
( bell dings )

412
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:58,756
Uh, sir?

413
00:15:58,788 --> 00:15:59,716
What?!

414
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,252
Look.

415
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,397
CELIA ( over PA ):
Attention.

416
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,414
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

417
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:06,501
( snickering )

418
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:09,094
( assistants cheering )

419
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:12,007
( children screaming )

420
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:15,016
( knuckles cracking )

421
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:15,943
Slumber party.

422
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:16,904
( laughing )

423
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:17,960
Whoo!

424
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,465
( beeping )

425
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,969
CELIA ( over PA ):
Never mind.

426
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,729
Hey! Watch it!

427
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,033
( Sulley laughing )

428
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,850
Well, James, that was
an impressive display!

429
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:29,834
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr. Waternoose.

430
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,883
Of course, I did
learn from the best.

431
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,164
( both laughing )

432
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:36,236
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds

433
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,957
I will personally put you
through the shredder!

434
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,013
( screams )

435
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,670
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

436
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,110
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.

437
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,454
Are they?

438
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:46,863
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

439
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:48,367
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

440
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,519
He's doing great!

441
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,863
I love working
with that big guy.

442
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:51,823
( child screaming )

443
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,008
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

444
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,128
I'm on a roll today.

445
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,857
George and I
are like brothers.

446
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:56,848
( gasping )

447
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,409
2319! We have a 2319!

448
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,393
( gasping )

449
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:04,882
( alarm blaring )

450
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:07,027
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Red alert! Red alert!

451
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,467
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

452
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:09,971
FEMALE ( over PA ):
George Sanderson

453
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:11,700
please remain motionless.

454
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:12,884
Prepare for decontamination.

455
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,164
Get it off!

456
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:15,701
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

457
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:20,758
Oh, not the CDA.

458
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,751
( siren wailing )

459
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:29,464
CDA AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!

460
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,032
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

461
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,344
CDA AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.

462
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,305
( screams )

463
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:35,032
CDA AGENT:
This is a 2319 in progress.

464
00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:35,961
Keep the area clear.

465
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,145
Coming through.
Watch yourself.

466
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:38,297
( grunts )

467
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:39,641
( whimpering )

468
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:42,394
Stand back.

469
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,251
Careful.

470
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:45,467
( metallic clang )

471
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,748
( drills whirring )

472
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:51,868
( all gasping )

473
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,981
( muff
ed explosion )

474
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,469
( drills whirring )

475
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,718
All clear.

476
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,318
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

477
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:01,855
Ready for decon.

478
00:18:01,886 --> 00:18:02,975
Hey, thanks, guys.

479
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,159
That was a close one.

480
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,567
Okay.

481
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,487
( shears buzzing )

482
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,152
( screaming )

483
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,105
( whimpering )

484
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,992
( ripping )

485
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,202
( screaming )

486
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,537
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!

487
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,850
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

488
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:19,970
and reset the system.

489
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,531
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

490
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,483
What else can go wrong?

491
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:28,100
Oh... what a day.

492
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,892
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

493
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,005
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

494
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:33,894
Tell that to the
board of directors.

495
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:35,398
( slurping )

496
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,030
James, this company

497
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,751
has been in my family
for three generations.

498
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:42,791
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.

499
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,104
Oh, so would I, sir.

500
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,512
Well...

501
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:48,201
Say, I could use your help
with something.

502
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,705
Anything, sir.

503
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,721
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

504
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,642
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

505
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,210
Inexperienced?

506
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,714
Oh, they stink!

507
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,995
Uh-huh.

508
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:59,819
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

509
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:01,355
and give them a demonstration.

510
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:04,396
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

511
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:07,468
I'II start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

512
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,036
( growling loudly )

513
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,957
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

514
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:12,333
Now, that's my boy!

515
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,710
( both laughing )

516
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:17,551
( ringing )

517
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:20,496
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!

518
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,904
All doors must be returned!

519
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:23,536
No exceptions!

520
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,105
--Oh, yeah.
--Whoo!

521
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,994
I've never seen anything
like you today.

522
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:32,242
You were on
a roll, my man.

523
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,298
Another day like this

524
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,578
and that scare record's
in the bag.

525
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,507
That's right, baby!

526
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,467
Uh-huh.

527
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:41,972
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

528
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,020
I'm taking her to a monster
truck rally afterwards.

529
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:44,980
Nice.

530
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:46,293
What's on your agenda?

531
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,894
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

532
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,877
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

533
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:50,966
( sniff'
ng )

534
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,246
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

535
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,751
Yeah. I got, uh...

536
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,567
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

537
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,527
You got low tide?

538
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,488
No.

539
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,448
How about wet dog?

540
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,440
Yep. Stink it up.

541
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,097
( growling )

542
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,409
You know, I am so romantic

543
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:06,105
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

544
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,354
Give me a
break, Mike.

545
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:09,850
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

546
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:11,066
Tonight is about me

547
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,859
and Celia.

548
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,419
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

549
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:16,379
( imitating ship horn )

550
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,564
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

551
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:19,708
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

552
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,668
Yikes!

553
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,820
Hello, Wazowski.

554
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,573
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

555
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,494
Well, as a
matter of fact...

556
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,214
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

557
00:20:29,214 --> 00:20:30,847
correctly... for once.

558
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:35,519
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

559
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,440
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

560
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,393
and if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes

561
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:40,545
they're going to give
our table away!

562
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:41,505
What am I going to tell...

563
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:42,465
Schmoopsie-poo.

564
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:44,001
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

565
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,154
Do I ever!
It's just that...

566
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,273
What?

567
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:47,266
Uh, you know,
there's a small....

568
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:48,482
I don't understand.

569
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,211
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

570
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:51,363
I was supposed to file.

571
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:52,931
Mike was reminding me.

572
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:53,988
Thanks, buddy.

573
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,075
Whoo.

574
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,484
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

575
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,828
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.

576
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,789
We're going!

577
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,749
On my desk, Sulley.

578
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,997
The pink copies
go to Accounting

579
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,309
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

580
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:03,494
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

581
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:04,454
Huh!

582
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:05,574
Leave the puce.

583
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:11,175
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

584
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,288
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

585
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,112
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

586
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,768
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

587
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,762
Oh, that's puce.

588
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:26,250
Hmm?

589
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,003
Uh, hello?

590
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,211
Anyone?

591
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,484
There's a door here.

592
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:34,444
Hmm.

593
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:48,623
( door latch clicking )

594
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:50,063
( door creaking )

595
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:53,296
( whispering ):
Hello?

596
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:54,256
Hey.

597
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:55,216
Psst.

598
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:56,913
Anybody scaring in here?

599
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:58,834
Hello?

600
00:21:58,865 --> 00:21:59,825
Yo!

601
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:08,084
Hmm.

602
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:09,044
( thump )

603
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,052
( thump )

604
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:14,933
( thump )

605
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:16,982
( speaking baby talk )

606
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:17,686
( screams )

607
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,606
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

608
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,583
Oh!

609
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:24,791
( giggling ):
Here.

610
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:25,976
Gotcha!

611
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,800
( yells )

612
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:29,880
( squeals in delight )

613
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:30,872
Eh!

614
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:32,889
( giggling )

615
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,386
( yells )

616
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,249
( giggles )

617
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,817
( gasps, then whimpers )

618
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,642
( squeals in delight )

619
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,210
( giggling )

620
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,299
( laughs )

621
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,419
Oh!

622
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,276
( loud crashing, toy squeaking )

623
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:47,580
Yeow!

624
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,692
( gasps )

625
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,501
( toy ducks quacking )

626
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:07,008
( yelling )

627
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,929
( toy ducks quacking )

628
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,113
( quacking )

629
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:15,202
Eww.

630
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,635
( toy ducks quacking )

631
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:18,914
( sighs )

632
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:21,763
( yells )

633
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,067
( panting )

634
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:29,285
( toys quacking and squeaking )

635
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:31,461
( squeaking )

636
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,942
Whew.

637
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:45,064
( Sulley screams )

638
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,504
( little girl
speaking baby talk )

639
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:47,945
Kitty!

640
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,097
( speaking baby talk )

641
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:50,057
No, no-- stay back.

642
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,465
( speaking baby talk )

643
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,314
( stutters in fear )

644
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,306
( giggling )

645
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,379
( speaking baby talk )

646
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,156
( whine of disgust )

647
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:05,997
( little girl
speaking baby talk faintly )

648
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:07,822
( whimpers )

649
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,134
( door latch clicking )

650
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,350
Hmm.

651
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,649
( speaking baby talk )

652
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:26,737
( faint squeal
of delight )

653
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:31,090
( sneezes )

654
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:44,469
( murmur of conversation )

655
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:46,101
( knives being sharpened )

656
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:51,958
PHOTOGRAPHER:
And hold it.

657
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:52,983
( shutter clicks )

658
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,607
ALL:
Get a paper bag!

659
00:24:58,392 --> 00:24:59,321
Mmm.

660
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,785
( laughing )

661
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,249
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

662
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:05,882
well, not a
lot of birthdays

663
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:07,962
but this is the
best birthday ever.

664
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:08,923
Hmm.

665
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:11,002
What are you
looking at?

666
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,091
I was just thinking

667
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,011
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

668
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:15,099
how pretty you looked.

669
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,188
Stop it!

670
00:25:16,188 --> 00:25:17,436
Your hair was
shorter then.

671
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:18,908
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

672
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:19,869
( faint squeal of fear )

673
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,021
No, no, I like
it this length.

674
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:21,981
( sighs of relief )

675
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:23,485
I like everything
about you.

676
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:24,574
Just the other day

677
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:25,854
someone asked me who I thought

678
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:27,742
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

679
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:28,735
You know what I said?

680
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,111
What did you say?

681
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,071
I said...

682
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:33,503
--Sulley?
--Sulley?

683
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:34,528
No! No, no.

684
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:35,840
That's not
what I was going to say.

685
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,344
Mike, you're not making sense.

686
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,945
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

687
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,385
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

688
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,922
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

689
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:42,818
Michael...

690
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:43,778
Sulley!

691
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:44,963
I wonder what's good here.

692
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:46,434
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

693
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:47,554
I went back to get
your paperwork

694
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,515
and there was a door.

695
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,507
What?

696
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,420
( rattling )

697
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,380
A door?!

698
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:54,308
Randall was in it.

699
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:55,269
Wait a minute.
Randall?

700
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,261
That cheater!

701
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,052
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

702
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,333
There's something else.

703
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:00,293
What?!

704
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,510
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

705
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,470
What?!

706
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,430
Look in the bag.

707
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,159
What bag?

708
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,271
( sighs )

709
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:10,120
( gasps )

710
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,784
( giggling )

711
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh!

712
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,217
They don't have
anything I like here.

713
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:15,144
So take care, Celia!

714
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,169
Excuse me, sir.

715
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,129
What's going on?

716
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:18,537
Celia, please try
to understand.

717
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,353
I have to do something!

718
00:26:21,418 --> 00:26:22,314
Michael?

719
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,882
PHOTOGRAPHER:
On three.

720
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,067
One... two....

721
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:26,027
( squeals and giggles )

722
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,947
( screaming )

723
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:28,908
A kid!

724
00:26:28,908 --> 00:26:30,092
Boo!

725
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:31,757
( all screaming )

726
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:35,597
A kid!

727
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:39,342
There's a kid here--
a human kid!

728
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,007
( exclaiming in baby talk )

729
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:42,927
Oh!

730
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:44,271
CELIA:
Googley Bear!

731
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,599
( yelling )

732
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:50,704
( blows raspberry )

733
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:51,825
Come on!

734
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,953
( monsters screaming in terror )

735
00:26:55,953 --> 00:26:57,201
MIKE:
Let's get out of here!

736
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:59,442
CDA HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.

737
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:00,563
This is not a drill.

738
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:02,419
( siren wailing,
tires screeching )

739
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,371
CDA AGENT 1 :
We have an 835 in progress.

740
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:05,331
Please advise.

741
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,540
Michael? Michael?

742
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,660
Oh, Celia.

743
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,196
--Please come with me.
--Ow. Stop pushing.

744
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,085
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

745
00:27:12,117 --> 00:27:14,325
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

746
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,270
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

747
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:18,326
( explosion )

748
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,927
( electrical buzzing )

749
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,591
If witnesses are to be believed

750
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,768
there has been
a child security breach

751
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:30,009
for the first time
in monster history.

752
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,417
We can neither confirm nor deny

753
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,497
the presence of a human child
here tonight.

754
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:35,130
Well, a kid flew right over me

755
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,434
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

756
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,707
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

757
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:42,171
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

758
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,028
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

759
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,620
It is my
professional opinion

760
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:49,437
that now is the time
to... panic!

761
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,749
Oh-oh.

762
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,797
( both yelling )

763
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:54,014
Oh, it's coming!

764
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:55,294
It's coming!

765
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:57,119
( giggling ):
Boo!

766
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,303
( both screaming )

767
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,191
( distant sirens wailing )

768
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,848
( delighted cry )

769
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,608
( yelling )

770
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,017
No, no, no, no, no!

771
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,136
Come here, kid.

772
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,129
Whee.

773
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,714
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

774
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:12,674
Oh, now

775
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:13,730
those were alphabetized.

776
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:14,851
It's okay, it's all right.

777
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:16,194
As long as it doesn't
come near us

778
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,155
we're going to be okay.

779
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,115
( sneezes )

780
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,235
( screams )

781
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,220
( yelling in pain )

782
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:22,532
( whimpering in fear )

783
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:23,716
Wanna ride on it!

784
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:25,988
Da, da-da.

785
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:26,949
Da-da-da.

786
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:27,973
Oh, y-you like this?

787
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:28,933
Fetch!

788
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,893
( giggles )

789
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:31,462
( gasps )

790
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:32,838
Hey, hey, that's it!

791
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,759
No one touches
little Mikey!

792
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,551
( whining )

793
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,471
Mike, give her the bear.

794
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,096
Oh, no.

795
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,857
( piercing scream )

796
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,265
( electrical buzzing )

797
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,874
( screaming and crying
continue )

798
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,851
( buzzing continues )

799
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,891
( exclaiming in fear )

800
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:56,171
Make it stop, Sulley!

801
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,387
Make it stop!

802
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,635
Look!
See the bear?

803
00:28:58,668 --> 00:28:59,692
Ooh, nice bear.

804
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:00,653
( screams )

805
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:01,772
Sulley!

806
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:02,861
See?

807
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:04,045
Ooh, bear, ooh.

808
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:05,741
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

809
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:07,341
* He's not crying,
neither should you *

810
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:08,750
* Or we'II be
in trouble *

811
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:09,838
* 'Cause they're gonna find us *

812
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:11,919
* So please stop crying *

813
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:12,975
* Right now. *

814
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,096
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

815
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,344
You're doing great.

816
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,656
* Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no... *

817
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:17,839
( screaming )

818
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:19,152
She touched me!

819
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,176
Sulley, the bear!

820
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,105
The bear!

821
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:22,161
Give her the...

822
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,633
Whoa!

823
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,442
( giggles )

824
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:28,851
( screaming with laughter )

825
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,674
( electrical buzzing
grows louder )

826
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:31,731
( light bulb shatters )

827
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:32,723
( giggles )

828
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,356
What was that?

829
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:35,348
( thumping )

830
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:36,308
I have no idea

831
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,101
but it would be
really great

832
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:39,669
if it didn't
do it again.

833
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:40,821
( giggles )

834
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,229
Shh, shh, shh.

835
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:43,381
Shh...

836
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,406
shh.

837
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:46,166
Shh...

838
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,024
Ah!

839
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:00,569
How could I do this?

840
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,009
How could I be so stupid?

841
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,577
This could destroy
the company.

842
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:04,538
The company?

843
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:05,978
Who cares
about the company?!

844
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:06,939
What about us?

845
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,411
That thing is
a killing machine!

846
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,492
* La-la-la-la-la-la *

847
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:12,444
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

848
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,564
and then wham!

849
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,324
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

850
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,213
We're sitting targets.

851
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:18,141
Okay, look, I think

852
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,485
I have a plan here.

853
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,654
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

854
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,574
and release it into the wild.

855
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,655
Spoons.

856
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,063
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

857
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:29,535
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

858
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:31,200
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

859
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:32,160
Too conspicuous.

860
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:33,248
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

861
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:36,480
( speaking baby talk )

862
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,498
No plan. No plan.

863
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:40,802
Can't think.
Can't think.

864
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,794
Flatlining.

865
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:42,754
Uh, Mike?

866
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,963
I think she's getting tired.

867
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:46,819
Well, then
why don't you

868
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:49,283
find someplace
for it to sleep?

869
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,883
While I think of a plan!

870
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:54,020
Are you sleepy?

871
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,005
You want to sleep?

872
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:57,125
ls that what you want?

873
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,469
Huh?

874
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:10,152
( crunching )

875
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,464
Okay, all right.

876
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:13,001
I'm making a nice little area
for you to...

877
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:14,153
( giggling )

878
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,753
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!

879
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:17,225
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

880
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,266
( sighing ):
Fine.

881
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,635
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

882
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:24,011
( yells )

883
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:24,971
What?

884
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:26,156
( speaking fearfully )

885
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:28,780
it's just a closet.

886
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:29,868
Will you go to sleep?

887
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,277
Hey, that looks like Randall.

888
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,710
Randall's your monster.

889
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:40,622
You think he's going
to come through the closet

890
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:41,583
and scare you.

891
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:43,567
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

892
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:44,592
Uh, it's empty.

893
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:46,000
--See?
--Ah!

894
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:47,696
No monster in here.

895
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:52,593
Well, now there is

896
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:55,154
but I'm not going to scare you.

897
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,274
I'm off-duty.

898
00:32:00,115 --> 00:32:01,427
Okay.

899
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:05,716
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

900
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:08,853
Go ahead.

901
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,293
Go to sleep.

902
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:11,253
Now.

903
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:14,134
Now... go.

904
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,414
Uh, you...

905
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:16,631
go...

906
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,783
to...

907
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:18,807
sleep.

908
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,375
( imitating snoring )

909
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:21,784
( giggles )

910
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,745
( sighs in relief )

911
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:45,341
( door creaks softly )

912
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,479
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

913
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,399
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

914
00:32:54,462 --> 00:32:56,575
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

915
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,623
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

916
00:32:58,655 --> 00:32:59,936
Now, look.

917
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,664
What if we just put
her back in her door?

918
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:03,137
What?

919
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:04,129
Mike, think about it.

920
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:05,697
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

921
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:06,721
Everything goes back to normal.

922
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:07,682
Is that a joke?

923
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:08,769
Tell me you're joking.

924
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,675
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

925
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:14,403
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

926
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:15,683
but that is a horrible idea!

927
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:16,932
What are we going to do?

928
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,788
March right out into
public with that thing?

929
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,316
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

930
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:24,421
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

931
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,461
Sulley, a mop, a couple of
lights and some chair fabric

932
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:29,094
are not going
to fool anyone!

933
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:31,335
Just think about
a few names, will you?

934
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:33,575
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

935
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:36,071
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

936
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:37,448
We could be next!

937
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,664
Don't panic--
we can do this.

938
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:39,752
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

939
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:40,808
Hey, guys.

940
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:41,864
Everything's going

941
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,145
to be okay.

942
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:44,137
( gasping )

943
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:46,057
( equipment buzzing loudly )

944
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:49,483
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

945
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:50,762
Careful with that.

946
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:52,171
I got a good view from here.

947
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,836
A little lower.

948
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,363
This was recovered
at the scene.

949
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,324
Don't panic.
Don't panic!

950
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,381
Don't tell me
not to panic.

951
00:33:58,381 --> 00:33:59,308
Just keep it together.

952
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:00,301
Everything is not okay!

953
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:01,325
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.

954
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,797
...could be contaminated.

955
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,949
Gentlemen, safety

956
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,165
is our number one concern.

957
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:06,446
If there's anything that...

958
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,502
not now, not now.

959
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:09,039
Oh, hello, little one.

960
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:10,766
Where did you come from?

961
00:34:10,766 --> 00:34:11,791
Mr. Waternoose!

962
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:13,488
Ah, James!
ls this one yours?

963
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,104
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

964
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,897
Yeah, it's, uh...

965
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:21,617
''Bring an Obscure
Relative to Work Day.''

966
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:23,122
Hmm, must have missed the memo.

967
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:24,306
Well, listen, James

968
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,738
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

969
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,466
and give us
that scare demonstration

970
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,651
we talked about, huh?

971
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,155
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

972
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,499
Excuse me,
Mr. Waternoose?

973
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,748
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

974
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:36,052
All right then, I'II see
you this afternoon, James.

975
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,229
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

976
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,317
Oh, boy.

977
00:34:39,317 --> 00:34:40,278
Oh, a scare demo.

978
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:41,334
Well, that is great.

979
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:42,422
Why am I
the last to know?

980
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:44,598
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

981
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:45,654
She'II be a big hit!

982
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:46,743
( equipment buzzing loudly )

983
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:47,862
Halt!

984
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:48,855
( yelling )

985
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,911
Stop him!

986
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:51,607
Hold him down.

987
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:56,281
Come on,
the coast is clear.

988
00:34:56,312 --> 00:34:58,841
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

989
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,922
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

990
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:02,170
But she can't stay here.

991
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,386
This is the men's room.

992
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:06,043
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

993
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,355
It's fine. It's okay.

994
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:08,539
Look, it loves it here!

995
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,628
It's dancing with joy!

996
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:10,908
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

997
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:12,956
I'II be right back
with its door key.

998
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:14,204
( laughs )

999
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,733
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

1000
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,366
It almost looks
like you've got to...

1001
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:19,998
( whining )

1002
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,919
Oh.

1003
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,831
( singing in baby talk )

1004
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,265
( singing stops )

1005
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,945
Uh, are you
done in there?

1006
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:36,226
( squeals )

1007
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:38,657
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

1008
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:41,315
( singing )

1009
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:49,956
( toilet flushes )

1010
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:52,100
Okay, you
finished now, right?

1011
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,381
Hello?

1012
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:55,686
( yells )

1013
00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,078
Boo.

1014
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,423
( giggles )

1015
00:36:00,454 --> 00:36:02,663
( sighs )

1016
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,231
( giggling )

1017
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,136
( chuckles )

1018
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,889
Where did she go?

1019
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,193
Oh, did she disappear?

1020
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:15,657
Did she turn invisible?

1021
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,354
( giggling softly )

1022
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:18,858
I just have no idea.

1023
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:21,675
Gotcha!

1024
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:24,332
Boo.

1025
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:25,612
( giggles )

1026
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:27,373
Hey, you're good.

1027
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,189
( sighs )

1028
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,271
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

1029
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:37,806
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom

1030
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:39,343
you're looking
fabulous today.

1031
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:40,560
Is that a new haircut?

1032
00:36:40,623 --> 00:36:41,647
Come on, tell me.

1033
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,928
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?

1034
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:43,984
That's got to be
a new haircut.

1035
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:44,976
New makeup?
You've had a lift.

1036
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,352
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

1037
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:48,209
Something has been
inserted in your skin

1038
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:49,425
that makes you look like...

1039
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,089
( sighs )

1040
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:52,338
Listen, I need a favor.

1041
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:54,290
Randall was working
late last night

1042
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,602
out on the scare floor.

1043
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:58,291
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

1044
00:36:58,323 --> 00:36:59,924
Well, isn't that nice?

1045
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:02,196
But guess what?

1046
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:05,492
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

1047
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,381
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?

1048
00:37:07,413 --> 00:37:09,366
This office is now closed.

1049
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:11,958
( Mike screams in pain )

1050
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,359
Ready or not, here I come!

1051
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,215
I'm getting warmer.

1052
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:17,399
Any second now.

1053
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:20,504
Fee fi fo...

1054
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:21,624
What are you doing?!

1055
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,384
I-I'm looking
for the kid.

1056
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:24,505
You lost it?!

1057
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,785
No, no, she was just....

1058
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,514
( squeals )

1059
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:28,730
Here she is.

1060
00:37:28,762 --> 00:37:29,722
( whining )

1061
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,066
Hey, what's the matter?

1062
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,786
RANDALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

1063
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,227
CDA AGENT:
All right, carry on.

1064
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,189
( splashing )

1065
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,237
Randall!
Thank goodness!

1066
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:48,606
What are we going to do
about the child?

1067
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:49,758
Shh!

1068
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:52,863
Shh, shh, shh.

1069
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,553
( door slams open )

1070
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,385
( door slams open )

1071
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,107
The front page!
It's on the front page.

1072
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,931
The child--
the one you were after.

1073
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,019
Will you be quiet?!

1074
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:16,132
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

1075
00:38:16,132 --> 00:38:17,892
I was up all night
trying to find it.

1076
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:19,365
I did a simple
calculation

1077
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,797
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

1078
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:23,302
The child
may have escaped!

1079
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:24,902
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

1080
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,078
we're going to act like nothing
happened, understand?

1081
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,807
You just get the machine
up and running.

1082
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,959
I'II take care of the kid.

1083
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,135
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

1084
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,512
Oh!

1085
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:36,296
Why are you still here?

1086
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:37,448
Come on, go!

1087
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,632
Move! Now!

1088
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:40,041
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

1089
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:42,121
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.

1090
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,658
( squeaking and splashing )

1091
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,418
LITTLE GIRL:
Eww.

1092
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:46,603
MIKE:
This is bad.

1093
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:48,075
This is so very bad.

1094
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,643
What were they talking
about a machine?

1095
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:50,667
Who cares? Oh!

1096
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:52,204
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

1097
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:53,868
is call her door down
and send her home.

1098
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:55,212
You're right,
you're right.

1099
00:38:55,244 --> 00:38:57,421
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

1100
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,733
We will blend right in.

1101
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,141
Top of the mornin', fellas!

1102
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:01,581
Hey, what's
shakin', bacon?

1103
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:02,670
Did you lose weight?

1104
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:03,726
Or a limb?

1105
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:04,974
You have
her card key, right?

1106
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,255
Of course
I have her card key.

1107
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:07,663
I told you
I'd get her card key.

1108
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:08,815
I went and got
her card key

1109
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,831
and now I have her card key.

1110
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:14,001
Okay, here we go.

1111
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,120
Take care of yourself.

1112
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,201
Try not to run
through any more closets.

1113
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:18,417
( giggles )

1114
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,914
Mike, that's
not her door.

1115
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,482
What are you
talking about?

1116
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,082
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

1117
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,131
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

1118
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,923
No. It must have been
dark last night

1119
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:29,171
because this is its door.

1120
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,324
( polka music playing )

1121
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:31,348
Hey, you hear that?

1122
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,301
Sounds like
fun in there!

1123
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,709
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

1124
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,181
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

1125
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:38,421
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back lane.

1126
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,022
Mowki Kowski.

1127
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:41,718
Very good.
Now bon voyage!

1128
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,159
Bye-bye!
Come on.

1129
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,790
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

1130
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,007
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.

1131
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,960
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.

1132
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:49,272
Boo? What's Boo?

1133
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:51,672
That's what I decided
to call her.

1134
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,113
Is there a problem?

1135
00:39:53,176 --> 00:39:54,873
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

1136
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:57,177
Once you name it, you start
getting attached to it!

1137
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,202
Now put that thing

1138
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:01,082
back where it came from,
or so help me...

1139
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,659
Oh, hey!

1140
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:08,284
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

1141
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:10,588
called Put That Thing
Back Where lt Came From

1142
00:40:10,653 --> 00:40:11,901
Or So Help Me%

1143
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:12,925
( Mike laughing )

1144
00:40:12,925 --> 00:40:13,981
It's a musical!

1145
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:15,998
* Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me *

1146
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:17,150
* Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom... *

1147
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,142
* So help me,
so help me. *

1148
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,455
And cut!

1149
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:20,543
We're still
working on it.

1150
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:21,534
It's a work
in progress

1151
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,135
but, hey,
we need ushers.

1152
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,223
Sulley, I've had enough.

1153
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,983
Now say good-bye to...
where'd it go?

1154
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:26,976
What'd you do with it?

1155
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:27,968
( gasps ):
Where is she?

1156
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:29,024
I don't believe it.

1157
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:30,336
She got away
from you again?!

1158
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,425
Well, that is just...

1159
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:32,513
Wait a minute.

1160
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:34,017
The sun is coming up.

1161
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,266
This is perfect!

1162
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:37,122
She's gone!

1163
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:38,466
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1164
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:39,426
Where are you going?

1165
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,707
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

1166
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,627
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

1167
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:43,940
Somebody else
will find the kid.

1168
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,283
It'II be their problem,
not ours!

1169
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:46,180
She's out of our hair!

1170
00:40:47,204 --> 00:40:48,613
What are you
two doing?

1171
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,693
They're rehearsing a play.

1172
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:52,294
* She's out of our hair! *

1173
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:53,381
Can it, Wazowski!

1174
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,326
So, what do you think of that
kid getting out, Sullivan?

1175
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:57,511
Pretty crazy, huh?

1176
00:40:57,607 --> 00:40:59,367
Oh, yeah, crazy.

1177
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,487
Word on the street is the kid's

1178
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:01,607
been traced back
to this factory.

1179
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:02,856
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

1180
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:04,360
Uh, well, uh...

1181
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:05,512
No, no way!

1182
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,784
But if it was
an inside job

1183
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:09,642
I'd put my money
on Waxford.

1184
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:10,794
Waxford?

1185
00:41:10,825 --> 00:41:12,073
Yeah, the one
at station six.

1186
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:13,610
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.

1187
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:14,795
Hey, Waxford!

1188
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,010
Sulley!

1189
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,547
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!

1190
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,363
( whimpers )

1191
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,540
last night was one
of the worst nights

1192
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,108
of my entire life,
bar none!

1193
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:25,580
( hissing )

1194
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:27,693
I thought
you cared about me.

1195
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:28,717
Honey, please.

1196
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:31,021
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

1197
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,526
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!

1198
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:35,087
You think this is
about sushi?!

1199
00:41:40,496 --> 00:41:41,648
Wazowski!

1200
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:43,249
Michael! Mike...

1201
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:44,593
Men.

1202
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:45,680
( panting )

1203
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,057
Breathe. Keep breathing.

1204
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,884
Whew.

1205
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,004
Yikes!

1206
00:41:58,004 --> 00:41:59,796
Where's the kid?

1207
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,460
Kid? What kid?

1208
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:02,933
lt's here in
the factory, isn't it?

1209
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:04,180
You're not
pinning this on me.

1210
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:05,429
It never would
have gotten out

1211
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,125
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

1212
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,150
Cheating?

1213
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:11,095
Cheating. Right.

1214
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:14,903
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

1215
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:18,840
What happens when the whistle
blows in five minutes?

1216
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,337
Uh... I get a time-out?

1217
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:24,025
Everyone goes to lunch!

1218
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:27,258
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

1219
00:42:28,474 --> 00:42:29,626
Painted?

1220
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,571
Empty! It'II be
empty, you idiot!

1221
00:42:32,603 --> 00:42:34,299
You see that clock?

1222
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,508
When the big hand
is pointing up

1223
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,685
and the little hand
is pointing up

1224
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:41,085
the kid's door
will be in my station.

1225
00:42:41,085 --> 00:42:43,357
But when the big hand
points down

1226
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:45,886
the door will be gone.

1227
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,926
You have until then
to put the kid back.

1228
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:51,583
Get the picture?

1229
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:54,080
( roaring playfully )

1230
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:02,145
Boo!

1231
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:03,682
( giggles )

1232
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:04,642
No.

1233
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:05,762
Hey, you! Halt!

1234
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,362
He's the one.

1235
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,739
The one from
the commercial!

1236
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:09,859
Affirmative.
That's him.

1237
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,139
Can we get
an autograph?

1238
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:12,675
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.

1239
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:15,812
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

1240
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:17,029
Yes. Let's see...

1241
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:18,853
''From your scary friend

1242
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:20,486
best wishes...''

1243
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:22,438
So I said,
''If you talk to me

1244
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,679
like that again,
we're through!''

1245
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,702
What'd she say?

1246
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:26,887
You know my mom.

1247
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,583
She sent me to my room.

1248
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,344
See you guys later,
take it easy.

1249
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,463
Bottoms up!

1250
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:35,304
( gasps in horror )

1251
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:48,843
No!

1252
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:52,364
( singing )

1253
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,325
Whoa!

1254
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:54,541
Hey.

1255
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,621
( growling )

1256
00:43:56,685 --> 00:43:58,221
Oh, well, hello, there.

1257
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,374
What's your name?

1258
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:01,198
Mike Wazowski!

1259
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:05,007
( machinery pounding loudly )

1260
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,865
( grinding and chopping )

1261
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:24,915
( panting )

1262
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:37,046
( moans )

1263
00:44:38,454 --> 00:44:40,087
Sulley!

1264
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,783
Oh, Sulley.

1265
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:45,143
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

1266
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:47,160
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

1267
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,344
Nope. Sorry.

1268
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,560
Oh, Sulley!

1269
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,057
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

1270
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,497
( squeaking and quacking )

1271
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:54,809
2319!

1272
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:56,442
We have a 2319!

1273
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:57,594
Oh, dear.

1274
00:44:57,658 --> 00:44:58,810
Get him!

1275
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:02,203
Sulley? Sulley!

1276
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,988
( moaning )

1277
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:06,044
Sulley!

1278
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:07,164
Oh, great news, pal.

1279
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:08,541
I got us a way out of this mess

1280
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:09,693
but we got to hurry.

1281
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:10,781
Where is it?

1282
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:12,926
( whimpering )

1283
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:14,782
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.

1284
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,126
( squeaks )

1285
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,279
Uh-oh.

1286
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:20,159
I-I can still hear
her little voice.

1287
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,695
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!

1288
00:45:21,695 --> 00:45:23,007
Hey, I can hear her, too.

1289
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,576
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!

1290
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:26,240
How many kids
you got in there?

1291
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,097
Mike Wazowski!

1292
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,313
Kitty!

1293
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:30,945
Boo!

1294
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,313
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

1295
00:45:33,378 --> 00:45:35,298
I was so worried!

1296
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:39,620
Don't you ever run away from me
again, young lady!

1297
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,307
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

1298
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,412
My, what an affectionate father.

1299
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,397
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

1300
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:48,357
Okay, Sulley.

1301
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:49,381
That's enough.
Let's go.

1302
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:50,341
Mike Wazowski!

1303
00:45:50,405 --> 00:45:51,366
Yeah, yeah.

1304
00:45:51,366 --> 00:45:52,774
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

1305
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:53,671
( screams in pain )

1306
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:54,535
( screams with laughter )

1307
00:45:54,535 --> 00:45:55,302
( electrical buzzing )

1308
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,327
( light bulbs shattering )

1309
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,511
( gasping )

1310
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:59,847
( baby monsters screaming
and crying )

1311
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,344
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

1312
00:46:02,408 --> 00:46:04,008
I didn't, so come on!

1313
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:06,473
( screaming and crying
continue )

1314
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:07,561
I still don't understand.

1315
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:08,522
You've got Boo's door?

1316
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:09,482
I'II explain later.

1317
00:46:09,514 --> 00:46:10,442
Run.

1318
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:11,819
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

1319
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,875
Come on.

1320
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,763
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

1321
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:16,331
There it is!

1322
00:46:16,427 --> 00:46:17,291
Just like Randall said!

1323
00:46:17,387 --> 00:46:18,347
Randall?
What a minute.

1324
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:19,307
( cries out in fear )

1325
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:20,268
Oh, hey.

1326
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:21,165
One, two, three, four!

1327
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:22,125
Get the kid back
through the door!

1328
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,085
Hey, hey.

1329
00:46:23,085 --> 00:46:24,269
We're going to get
our lives back.

1330
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:25,229
The nightmare is over.

1331
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:26,189
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

1332
00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:27,022
What's the matter?

1333
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:28,270
Come on, it's time to move!

1334
00:46:28,301 --> 00:46:29,262
Mike, what are you thinking?

1335
00:46:29,294 --> 00:46:30,222
We can't trust Randall.

1336
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:31,182
He's after Boo.

1337
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:32,142
Who cares?
Let's go.

1338
00:46:32,175 --> 00:46:33,198
This is a limited time offer.

1339
00:46:33,263 --> 00:46:34,158
No, no.

1340
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:35,119
I don't like this.

1341
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,551
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

1342
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,512
Now, let's move.

1343
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:40,144
No, Mike.

1344
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,289
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

1345
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:43,889
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

1346
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:44,689
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!

1347
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,322
He's a paranoid delusional
furball.

1348
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:49,715
Mike!

1349
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,603
( whimpers in fear )

1350
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:01,204
( whining )

1351
00:47:01,204 --> 00:47:02,837
Shh, shh, shh.

1352
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,873
( small cry of surprise )

1353
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,101
( lunch bell rings )

1354
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:49,695
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

1355
00:47:49,727 --> 00:47:51,199
Sulley? Sulley?

1356
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:05,955
Huh?

1357
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:07,395
( whispering ):
Mike?

1358
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,356
Mike?

1359
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:11,108
Where are you?

1360
00:48:11,108 --> 00:48:12,868
You in there?

1361
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,757
Where are you, buddy?

1362
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:15,781
Mike?

1363
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:17,158
Hey.

1364
00:48:23,271 --> 00:48:24,711
( door thunks )

1365
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:27,527
( excited baby talk )

1366
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:29,064
Boo, way to go.

1367
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:30,056
( giggles )

1368
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:37,930
It's okay.

1369
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:43,819
( door clunks shut )

1370
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:57,422
( pipes whistling and venting )

1371
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,759
( distant voices )

1372
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,784
RANDALL:
Yes! I got the kid!

1373
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,225
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!

1374
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:11,185
That's great news.

1375
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:13,009
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

1376
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:14,610
Just get over
here and help me!

1377
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,474
Come on, come
on, come on.

1378
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,498
While we're young
here, Fungus!

1379
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:21,011
( both straining )

1380
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,771
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

1381
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:27,605
( yelps )

1382
00:49:27,605 --> 00:49:28,565
Wazowski?!

1383
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:29,940
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

1384
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:31,157
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

1385
00:49:31,157 --> 00:49:32,117
If you're going
to threaten me

1386
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,173
do it properly.

1387
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:35,254
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

1388
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,046
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

1389
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:38,423
( chuckling evilly )

1390
00:49:38,486 --> 00:49:42,648
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

1391
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:45,912
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

1392
00:49:45,912 --> 00:49:49,145
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

1393
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:52,441
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry

1394
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:55,803
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

1395
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:57,338
is going to be
working for me.

1396
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:58,427
MIKE:
Well

1397
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:00,700
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

1398
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,332
First, I need to know
where the kid is

1399
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:03,612
and you're going
to tell me.

1400
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:04,828
Yeah, I don't
know anything.

1401
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:05,788
Uh-huh, sure.

1402
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:06,749
MIKE:
I don't.

1403
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:07,901
I mean, I don't.

1404
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:09,277
Oh-oh.

1405
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,654
( mechanical clanging
and grinding )

1406
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:11,678
What's that?

1407
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,990
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

1408
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,334
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.

1409
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:15,295
No, no, no, no, no.

1410
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,447
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.

1411
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,175
This thing is moving.

1412
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,191
I don't like big...

1413
00:50:20,223 --> 00:50:22,400
moving things that are
moving towards me.

1414
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,840
No! Come on!

1415
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:25,280
Hey, Randall!

1416
00:50:25,377 --> 00:50:28,481
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

1417
00:50:28,481 --> 00:50:30,402
Hello.

1418
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,650
Come on,
where you going?

1419
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:32,610
We'II talk.

1420
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:33,795
Come on,
we'II have a latte!

1421
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:34,786
Come on.

1422
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:36,515
We can talk
about this.

1423
00:50:36,515 --> 00:50:39,300
( electrical whirring starts,
then grows louder )

1424
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,020
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

1425
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,205
Wait, wait, wait!

1426
00:50:43,236 --> 00:50:44,325
Stop, stop!

1427
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:45,669
No, no!

1428
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:46,661
Come on, hey!

1429
00:50:46,694 --> 00:50:48,102
( deep, resonating whirring )

1430
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:49,830
Help! Help! Help!

1431
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:50,790
Help!

1432
00:50:50,854 --> 00:50:52,743
( yelling )

1433
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,031
( noise dies away )

1434
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,087
Oh, for...

1435
00:50:58,152 --> 00:50:59,464
What did you
do wrong this time?

1436
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:00,520
I don't know.

1437
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,705
I calibrated the drive...

1438
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:03,145
Go check the machine!

1439
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:05,194
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

1440
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:07,785
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

1441
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,770
Huh?

1442
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:14,475
Hmm.

1443
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,454
Psst!

1444
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:27,022
Fungus.
Fungus.

1445
00:51:27,022 --> 00:51:29,134
You like cars, huh?

1446
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,574
'Cause I got a really nice car.

1447
00:51:30,703 --> 00:51:32,944
If you let me go,
I'II give you...

1448
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:34,223
a ride in the car.

1449
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:35,631
Please, Fungus?

1450
00:51:35,664 --> 00:51:37,393
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

1451
00:51:37,456 --> 00:51:40,113
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

1452
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:41,105
( gasps )

1453
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:42,546
( clanging )

1454
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:43,858
Hmm...

1455
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:45,746
( zapping )

1456
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:47,859
( electrical whirring )

1457
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:50,963
( clanking, rattling, whirring )

1458
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:51,923
( gasps )

1459
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:52,883
( muff
ed screams )

1460
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:53,620
What happened?

1461
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,348
Where's Wazowski?

1462
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,012
( muff
ed screams )

1463
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,837
( shuts off machine )

1464
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:00,149
Where is he?!

1465
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:01,813
( whimpering )

1466
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:02,902
( growls )

1467
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:04,118
( whimpering )

1468
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,302
( squeals )

1469
00:52:05,366 --> 00:52:06,551
Come on!

1470
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:08,087
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

1471
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:10,231
CDA AGENT 1 :
Careful.
That could be contaminated.

1472
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:11,736
We got to get out of here now!

1473
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:14,232
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

1474
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,512
Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!

1475
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:17,337
Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!

1476
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,745
No, Mike, wait!

1477
00:52:18,777 --> 00:52:20,121
Hey, what are you doing?

1478
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:21,625
Follow me. I have an idea.

1479
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:24,282
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

1480
00:52:24,347 --> 00:52:26,395
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Simulation terminated.

1481
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:27,643
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

1482
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:28,731
What was that?

1483
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:31,484
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

1484
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,397
I was going for a
snake
ninja approach

1485
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:35,676
with a little hissing.

1486
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:36,637
( hisses )

1487
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:39,069
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1488
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:40,702
It's all about presence!

1489
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:42,687
About how you enter the room!

1490
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:44,095
Mr. Waternoose!

1491
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,015
James! Perfect timing.

1492
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,519
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.

1493
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,440
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

1494
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:50,400
What? No, no,
I can't...

1495
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:51,424
Sir...
sir, you have

1496
00:52:51,424 --> 00:52:52,352
to listen to me.

1497
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:53,376
Pay attention, everyone.

1498
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:54,337
You're about to see

1499
00:52:54,401 --> 00:52:55,777
the best in
the business.

1500
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:56,738
Reset the simulator.

1501
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:57,698
But-but, sir!

1502
00:52:57,729 --> 00:52:59,042
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.

1503
00:52:59,073 --> 00:53:00,386
ANIMATRONIC BOY:
Night, Mom.

1504
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:01,346
Kitty!

1505
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,435
No, Boo, no, no!

1506
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:04,099
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

1507
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:05,892
Mr. Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

1508
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:07,588
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

1509
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:08,484
But-but-but, sir!

1510
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,316
Roar!

1511
00:53:09,348 --> 00:53:10,628
( groans )

1512
00:53:10,628 --> 00:53:11,908
( roaring ferociously )

1513
00:53:11,908 --> 00:53:13,413
( shrieking in terror )

1514
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:14,949
( gasps )

1515
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:16,069
( roaring ferociously )

1516
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:17,190
( squeals )

1517
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,431
( Boo crying )

1518
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:20,454
( students applauding )

1519
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:21,447
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.

1520
00:53:21,478 --> 00:53:23,175
Well done, James.

1521
00:53:23,175 --> 00:53:24,615
Boo?

1522
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,240
--All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
--Right this way, everyone.

1523
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,840
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

1524
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,281
( fearful whimper )

1525
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:31,561
( whines softly )

1526
00:53:31,593 --> 00:53:32,937
Boo.

1527
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,473
( nervous grunt )

1528
00:53:34,538 --> 00:53:36,330
( whining )

1529
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:38,539
Boo?

1530
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:41,707
( panicked grunts )

1531
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:42,891
( door slams )

1532
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:45,644
Boo, it's me.

1533
00:53:45,644 --> 00:53:46,764
( squealing )

1534
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,229
( gasps ):
The child!

1535
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,253
Sir, she isn't toxic.

1536
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:52,109
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

1537
00:53:52,173 --> 00:53:53,069
Boo?

1538
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:54,158
No, no, no, no.

1539
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:55,118
It's okay.

1540
00:53:55,182 --> 00:53:56,206
I was just...

1541
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,422
( whimpering in fear )

1542
00:53:57,422 --> 00:53:59,343
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

1543
00:53:59,343 --> 00:54:01,071
That wasn't real.

1544
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,192
It's just a...

1545
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,344
I was just...

1546
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:04,592
( crying ):
No...

1547
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,816
( Boo continues crying )

1548
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:15,186
( Boo sobbing )

1549
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,498
Boo.

1550
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:18,003
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out

1551
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:19,955
on that sweet,
little girl.

1552
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:21,715
--Boo.
--Now that we have her...

1553
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:22,932
...he is trying
to kill us.

1554
00:54:22,932 --> 00:54:24,724
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

1555
00:54:24,724 --> 00:54:25,941
Randall?

1556
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,405
Yes. And we can take you to his
secret lab, which is right here

1557
00:54:28,405 --> 00:54:29,365
in this factory.

1558
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:30,613
How could this happen?

1559
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:32,534
Oh, how could this happen?

1560
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:34,646
Does anyone else
know about this?

1561
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,606
No, sir.

1562
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,143
Good.

1563
00:54:37,175 --> 00:54:39,992
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

1564
00:54:40,024 --> 00:54:44,120
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

1565
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,329
take care of the child.

1566
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,954
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

1567
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:55,867
not in my factory.

1568
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,067
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

1569
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,508
Especially you, James.

1570
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,236
But now we can set

1571
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:05,693
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

1572
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,813
( whirring )

1573
00:55:06,813 --> 00:55:08,222
( thunk )

1574
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,342
MIKE:
Uh...

1575
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,550
sir, that's not her door.

1576
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:13,151
I know, I know.

1577
00:55:15,872 --> 00:55:16,928
It's yours.

1578
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:18,080
( startled gasps )

1579
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:19,200
( grunts )

1580
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,344
( yelling )

1581
00:55:21,344 --> 00:55:22,145
No!

1582
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:24,577
( gasps )

1583
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:28,610
( voice echoing ):
Boo!

1584
00:55:31,554 --> 00:55:32,579
( gasps )

1585
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,571
No! No!

1586
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:35,588
No! No! No! No!

1587
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,611
No!

1588
00:55:36,644 --> 00:55:37,892
( desperate grunts )

1589
00:55:37,956 --> 00:55:38,916
lt's too late!

1590
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,516
We're banished, genius.

1591
00:55:40,516 --> 00:55:42,341
We're in the human world!

1592
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:45,670
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

1593
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,814
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

1594
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:51,399
All you had to do was listen
to me-- just once!

1595
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:53,576
But you didn't, did you?

1596
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:56,008
You're still not listening!

1597
00:55:56,008 --> 00:55:58,760
( yelling )

1598
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:02,857
( Sulley grunting and groaning )

1599
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:03,945
Take that!

1600
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,610
( growling )

1601
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:07,275
( gasps in horror )

1602
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:12,139
Welcome to the Himalayas!

1603
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,476
( wind gusting )

1604
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,108
''Abominable''!

1605
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,069
( chuckles )

1606
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,317
Can you believe that?

1607
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:20,077
Do I look abominable to you?

1608
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,957
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

1609
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:25,678
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

1610
00:56:25,742 --> 00:56:26,958
I'm a nice guy.

1611
00:56:26,991 --> 00:56:28,271
Snow cone?

1612
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:29,231
Yuck.

1613
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,191
No, no, no.

1614
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:31,759
Don't worry--
it's lemon.

1615
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,904
Uh, how about
you, big fella?

1616
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:36,017
Snow cone?

1617
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:40,593
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

1618
00:56:40,657 --> 00:56:42,066
( sighs )

1619
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,890
Ah, poor guy.

1620
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:44,979
I understand.

1621
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,610
lt ain't easy
being banished.

1622
00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:47,987
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

1623
00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:49,172
When he was banished

1624
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:52,116
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

1625
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,004
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

1626
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,573
Called himself King Itchy.

1627
00:56:55,573 --> 00:56:58,293
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

1628
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,766
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

1629
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:01,270
Banished with your
best friend.

1630
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:02,710
He is not my friend.

1631
00:57:02,742 --> 00:57:04,631
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

1632
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,167
when I saw you out
there in the snow

1633
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:07,127
hugging and all that.

1634
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:08,216
Look at that big jerk.

1635
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:09,655
Ruined my life, and for what?

1636
00:57:09,688 --> 00:57:10,776
A stupid kid!

1637
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,696
Because of you,
I am now stuck

1638
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,233
in this frozen
wasteland!

1639
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:15,225
Wasteland?

1640
00:57:15,256 --> 00:57:17,593
I think you mean wonderland!

1641
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:20,026
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

1642
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:22,554
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

1643
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:24,123
Cutest thing in the world.

1644
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,364
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

1645
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:27,964
What... what did you say?

1646
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:28,924
Yak's milk.

1647
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:30,652
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

1648
00:57:30,684 --> 00:57:32,381
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

1649
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:33,373
it's very nutritious.

1650
00:57:33,469 --> 00:57:34,781
No, no. Something
about a village.

1651
00:57:34,877 --> 00:57:36,062
Where?
Are there kids in it?

1652
00:57:36,062 --> 00:57:37,182
Kids? Sure.

1653
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:39,294
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

1654
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,254
Where is it?!

1655
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:41,663
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

1656
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:42,815
Around a three-day hike.

1657
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:44,127
Oh, three days?!

1658
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,503
We need to get there now!

1659
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:46,495
( thump )

1660
00:57:49,376 --> 00:57:50,336
( ding )

1661
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:57,859
You want to go to the village?

1662
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,194
Okay, rule number one
out here.

1663
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:01,283
Always...

1664
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,371
No.

1665
00:58:02,435 --> 00:58:04,612
Never go out in a blizzard.

1666
00:58:04,643 --> 00:58:06,244
We need to get to Boo.

1667
00:58:06,308 --> 00:58:07,652
( grunts, then gasps )

1668
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,477
Boo?!

1669
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:10,852
What about us?

1670
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:11,813
( grunts )

1671
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:13,478
Ever since that kid
came in

1672
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,918
you've ignored
everything I've said

1673
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:16,070
and now look where we are!

1674
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,623
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

1675
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:21,063
We would have had it made!

1676
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:22,312
None of that matters now.

1677
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:24,808
None of it matter...

1678
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,024
Wa-wait a second.

1679
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:28,200
None of it matters?

1680
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:29,737
( sighs )

1681
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:31,210
MIKE:
Okay.

1682
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,193
That's.... no. Good. Great.

1683
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:35,818
So, now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

1684
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:38,987
Oh, would you
look at that?

1685
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:40,779
We're out of
snow cones, uh...

1686
00:58:40,843 --> 00:58:42,443
Let me... just go outside

1687
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:43,724
and make some more.

1688
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:47,981
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

1689
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:51,182
Does that matter?
Huh?

1690
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,102
And what about Celia?

1691
00:58:53,134 --> 00:58:56,846
I am never... never
going to see her again.

1692
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:58,351
Doesn't that matter?

1693
00:59:01,584 --> 00:59:02,544
( sighs )

1694
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:05,105
What about me?

1695
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:06,705
I'm your pal.

1696
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:08,754
I'm... I'm your best friend.

1697
00:59:08,818 --> 00:59:10,834
Don't I matter?

1698
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:14,098
( sighs )

1699
00:59:14,098 --> 00:59:15,219
I'm sorry, Mike.

1700
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:18,099
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

1701
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:20,212
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

1702
00:59:20,243 --> 00:59:21,876
But Boo's in trouble.

1703
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,732
I think there might
be a way to save her

1704
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:25,301
if we can just
get down to that...

1705
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,261
''We''?

1706
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:28,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?

1707
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:29,366
No.

1708
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:31,414
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.

1709
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:33,623
I-if-if you want
to go out there

1710
00:59:33,623 --> 00:59:34,935
and freeze to death

1711
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:37,304
you be my guest...

1712
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:40,153
because you're on your own.

1713
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:57,724
* *

1714
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:05,822
( wind whistles )

1715
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:18,049
Hey, I got more snow cones!

1716
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:24,098
Ohh!

1717
01:00:28,803 --> 01:00:29,731
Ahh!

1718
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:36,964
Ahh!

1719
01:00:36,964 --> 01:00:37,924
( yells )

1720
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:40,965
( grunting and groaning )

1721
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,303
( wind howling )

1722
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:52,904
( distant child screaming )

1723
01:00:56,905 --> 01:00:59,817
( children screaming )

1724
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:04,555
Oh, come on, now, George.

1725
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:06,090
I know you can do this.

1726
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:09,291
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

1727
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,308
Nice, quiet Nepal.

1728
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:13,004
You know, you're right.

1729
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,188
Here, take this.

1730
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,853
Go get 'em, Georgie!

1731
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:17,581
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

1732
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:18,861
Sorry, George.

1733
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,206
Hey, you can't just...

1734
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:21,166
( gasps )

1735
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,126
23...

1736
01:01:22,126 --> 01:01:23,759
( gagging )

1737
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:27,919
( whistling )

1738
01:01:27,983 --> 01:01:29,135
Out of the way!

1739
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:30,096
--Hey!
--Whoa!

1740
01:01:30,128 --> 01:01:31,600
Don't!

1741
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,201
( gasps )

1742
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:34,353
( whimpers )

1743
01:01:34,353 --> 01:01:35,569
Finally!

1744
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:37,713
I never should have
trusted you with this.

1745
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,178
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

1746
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:42,482
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

1747
01:01:42,514 --> 01:01:44,691
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

1748
01:01:44,723 --> 01:01:47,667
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

1749
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:48,627
( low growl )

1750
01:01:48,692 --> 01:01:49,812
( panting )

1751
01:01:49,812 --> 01:01:50,772
( clanging )

1752
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:52,020
( grunting )

1753
01:01:52,053 --> 01:01:53,365
( yells with effort )

1754
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:58,326
( mechanical whirring )

1755
01:01:58,358 --> 01:01:59,895
( gasps )

1756
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:02,199
Kitty!

1757
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,255
( whirring and hissing )

1758
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,952
( yelling )

1759
01:02:04,983 --> 01:02:06,264
( shrieking )

1760
01:02:06,296 --> 01:02:07,383
( roaring )

1761
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:09,976
Kitty!

1762
01:02:10,008 --> 01:02:10,680
Sullivan?

1763
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:11,928
( grunting )

1764
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:16,633
Wh-whoa!

1765
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:17,882
Kitty!

1766
01:02:17,882 --> 01:02:18,970
Sorry, Boo.

1767
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,378
Stop him!

1768
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:21,530
( growls )

1769
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:23,963
Let's get you home.

1770
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:24,571
( panting )

1771
01:02:24,604 --> 01:02:25,531
( blow lands )

1772
01:02:25,564 --> 01:02:26,524
Ooh!

1773
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:27,868
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!

1774
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,860
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

1775
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:30,780
( clanging )

1776
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:33,021
( thunk )

1777
01:02:34,525 --> 01:02:36,030
You don't know how long

1778
01:02:36,062 --> 01:02:38,878
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

1779
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:39,839
( grunts )

1780
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,831
( chuckles )

1781
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:43,456
( punches landing )

1782
01:02:43,488 --> 01:02:44,416
Hah!

1783
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:45,312
Ooh!

1784
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:46,624
( shrieks )

1785
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:49,376
( panting )

1786
01:02:49,376 --> 01:02:50,337
Ooh!

1787
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:51,490
Mike?!

1788
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,281
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

1789
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:54,530
Mike, you don't
understand.

1790
01:02:54,594 --> 01:02:56,291
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.

1791
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,666
I needed some time to think.

1792
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,651
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

1793
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:00,644
( thump )

1794
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,019
I'm being attacked!

1795
01:03:02,052 --> 01:03:03,331
No, I'm not attacking you.

1796
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:04,516
I'm trying to be honest.

1797
01:03:04,516 --> 01:03:05,476
Just hear me out.

1798
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:06,661
You and I are a team.

1799
01:03:06,693 --> 01:03:09,317
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

1800
01:03:09,317 --> 01:03:10,277
I-I-I know, kid.

1801
01:03:10,277 --> 01:03:11,365
He's too sensitive.

1802
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:13,029
( gagging )

1803
01:03:13,029 --> 01:03:13,798
( whining cry )

1804
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,110
Come on, pal.

1805
01:03:15,143 --> 01:03:16,743
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

1806
01:03:16,774 --> 01:03:18,215
and I'II never get through this.

1807
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:20,744
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

1808
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:21,704
but I am now.

1809
01:03:21,704 --> 01:03:22,504
Ow!

1810
01:03:22,504 --> 01:03:23,912
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.

1811
01:03:23,976 --> 01:03:25,961
The least you could do
is pay attention!

1812
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:28,553
( yells in pain )

1813
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:30,538
( sighs in relief )

1814
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:32,714
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

1815
01:03:32,714 --> 01:03:33,674
Oh.

1816
01:03:33,674 --> 01:03:34,891
Come on!

1817
01:03:34,987 --> 01:03:36,203
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!

1818
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:38,092
There can't be
any witnesses.

1819
01:03:38,123 --> 01:03:39,340
There won't be.

1820
01:03:39,723 --> 01:03:40,812
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

1821
01:03:40,844 --> 01:03:43,308
Somebody's got take care
of you, you big hairball.

1822
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:44,333
( Celia screaming )

1823
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,933
( screaming )

1824
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:46,893
Ow!

1825
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,877
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.

1826
01:03:48,877 --> 01:03:49,902
Come on!

1827
01:03:49,934 --> 01:03:51,439
Michael, if you
don't tell me

1828
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,551
what's going on right
now, we are through!

1829
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,735
You hear me? Through!

1830
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:55,855
Here's the truth.

1831
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,615
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

1832
01:03:57,648 --> 01:03:58,608
We tried to
send her back

1833
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,952
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

1834
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:02,289
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

1835
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,490
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

1836
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,865
Mike Wazowski!

1837
01:04:06,865 --> 01:04:08,082
( startled yell )

1838
01:04:08,114 --> 01:04:09,458
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!

1839
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:11,218
RANDALL:
Move it! Look out, you...

1840
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:11,987
Oh!

1841
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:12,947
...idiot!

1842
01:04:13,043 --> 01:04:14,067
( huff'
ng )

1843
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,019
Look out. Coming through,
here, coming through!

1844
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:17,300
Make way. Move it!

1845
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:18,548
Hurry up, hurry up.

1846
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:20,437
There they are!

1847
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:23,253
Celia: ( over PA )
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs

1848
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:26,069
has just broken
the all-time scare record.

1849
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:27,030
Huh?

1850
01:04:27,094 --> 01:04:27,990
No, I didn't.

1851
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:29,110
Get out of my way!

1852
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,070
( clamoring )

1853
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,607
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!

1854
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:32,727
( Boo shrieks )

1855
01:04:32,727 --> 01:04:33,847
There it is!

1856
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,384
RANDALL:
Get off my tail!

1857
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:36,504
Let me through!

1858
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:41,369
Sulley,
what are you doing?

1859
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:42,330
Grab on, Mike!

1860
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:43,417
Are you out of your...?

1861
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,698
( screaming )

1862
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,051
( whirring )

1863
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:50,555
( Mike whimpering )

1864
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,948
MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?

1865
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:57,116
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

1866
01:04:57,148 --> 01:05:00,765
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

1867
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:02,846
( growls )

1868
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:04,190
Whoa.

1869
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,304
--( gasps )
--Oh, boy.

1870
01:05:14,304 --> 01:05:16,129
Hold on!

1871
01:05:16,129 --> 01:05:18,145
( Mike screaming )

1872
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:22,369
( screaming )

1873
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:23,970
( clinking )

1874
01:05:24,034 --> 01:05:24,866
Wow!

1875
01:05:24,898 --> 01:05:25,827
Don't look down!

1876
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:28,611
( teeth chattering )

1877
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:30,532
( rattling )

1878
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:31,492
( startled gasp )

1879
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:36,901
( screaming )

1880
01:05:36,901 --> 01:05:40,357
( shrieking )

1881
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,079
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!

1882
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:44,999
Whoa!

1883

( chugging and clanking )

1886
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:53,577
No!

1887
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:54,793
Aah...

1888
01:05:54,793 --> 01:05:55,529
Boo's door?

1889
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:56,361
There it is!

1890
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:59,658
MIKE:
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

1891
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:04,203
Oh, it's a dead
end, Sulley!

1892
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:05,259
( gasps )

1893
01:06:05,355 --> 01:06:06,507
MIKE:
There he is.

1894
01:06:06,572 --> 01:06:07,532
Make her laugh.

1895
01:06:07,532 --> 01:06:08,267
What, Sulley?!

1896
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:08,876
Just do it!

1897
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,668
Oh... ow!

1898
01:06:10,732 --> 01:06:11,692

( engines starting )

1901
01:06:16,813 --> 01:06:18,990
SULLIVAN:
Get it open.

1902
01:06:19,054 --> 01:06:20,623
Here he comes.

1903
01:06:20,654 --> 01:06:22,703
Give me that kid!

( Boo giggling )

1906
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,496
Why couldn't we
get banished here?

1907
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,673
Come on. We got to
find another door.

1908
01:06:31,664 --> 01:06:32,625
( gasps )

1909
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,714
Look, Boo's door!

Hurry up, hurry up!

Come on, it slides,

Hurry up! Keep moving!

1923

Get inside!

Mike?

1927
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:15,642
Oh, sorry, buddy.

1928
01:07:15,642 --> 01:07:16,858

Oh!

1932
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:25,917
I hope that hurt, lizard boy!

1933
01:07:25,948 --> 01:07:27,548
( laughing )

1934
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:32,446
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.

1935
01:07:32,478 --> 01:07:33,406
( squeals )

1936
01:07:33,438 --> 01:07:34,367
Boo!

1937

Nice working with you!

( yells )

1954
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:11,686
Looks like we caught
the express, pal.

1955
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:12,775
Do you see them?

1956
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,311
Straight ahead!

1957
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:17,447
No...

Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now!

1965
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:50,767
You stupid, pathetic waste!

1966

( thump )

1967
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,720
You've been number one
for too long, Sullivan.

1968
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,800
Now your time is up!

1969
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,657
And don't worry.

1970
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:03,729
I'II take good care of the kid.

1971
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:04,658
No!

1972
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:06,290

01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:23,414
( gagging )

1976
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:25,206
( roaring angrily )

1977
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:27,350
She's not scared
of you anymore.

1978
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:28,887
( roars angrily )

1979
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:31,031
Looks like you're out of a job.

1980
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:32,247
( gulps )

1981
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,336
All right, come on,
over the plate.

1982
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:34,456
Let's see
the ol' stuff here, pal.

1983
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:36,121
Come on, now, chuck him,
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.

1984
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:37,177
Hum, baby,
here's the pitch.

1985
01:09:37,209 --> 01:09:38,489
Wait, please, don't,
don't, don't!

1986
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:39,289
No!

1987
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:40,249
And he is...
out of here!

1988
01:09:40,345 --> 01:09:41,562
( crickets chirping )

1989
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:44,058
BOY:
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

1990
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,018
Another gator?!

1991
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,907
Give me that shovel!
Come here!

1992
01:09:46,938 --> 01:09:48,347
( clanging, yelling )

1993
01:09:48,379 --> 01:09:50,235
Get him, mama!
Get that gator!

1994
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,636
Care to do the honors,
Mikey?

1995
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:55,388
With pleasure.

1996
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:01,662
( thud )

1997
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:03,038
( baby talk )

1998
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,351
That's right, Boo.

1999
01:10:04,382 --> 01:10:05,471
You did it.

2000
01:10:05,503 --> 01:10:06,623
You beat him.

2001
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:07,583
( raspberry )

2002
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:08,991
Come on.

2003
01:10:11,104 --> 01:10:13,184
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.

2004
01:10:13,184 --> 01:10:15,392
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

2005
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:16,513
( gasps )

2006
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:17,666
Oh, no!

2007
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:18,593
The power's out!

2008
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:20,002
Make her laugh again.

2009
01:10:20,034 --> 01:10:21,314
All right, I got a move here.

2010
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:22,626
It'II bring down the house.

2011
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:23,715
Up...

2012
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:24,835
( metallic clang )

2013
01:10:24,931 --> 01:10:25,987
( groans softly )

2014
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:28,228
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

2015
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,828
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

2016
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,109
if her stupid hood was up

2017
01:10:31,205 --> 01:10:32,292
ya big dope?!

2018
01:10:32,324 --> 01:10:34,501
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

2019
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:36,037
You know we still need her
to laugh.

2020
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:36,997
Right.

2021
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:37,958
( laughs )

2022
01:10:37,989 --> 01:10:39,622
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

2023
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:40,582
( gibberish )

2024
01:10:40,582 --> 01:10:42,119
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

2025
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:43,175
These are the jokes, kid.

2026
01:10:43,271 --> 01:10:44,327
Whoa!

2027
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:46,152
What's happening?

2028
01:10:46,152 --> 01:10:48,200
SULLIVAN:
Hold on!

2029
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,401
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

2030
01:10:51,401 --> 01:10:54,345
You'II have the child
and the criminals responsible

2031
01:10:54,377 --> 01:10:56,714
for this whole mess.

2032
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,603
Great.
A welcoming committee!

2033
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,394
What are we going to do?!

2034
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:03,979
( electrical humming )

2035
01:11:06,284 --> 01:11:07,724
( clang )

2036
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:12,653
This is the CDA.

2037
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,773
Come out slowly

2038
01:11:13,806 --> 01:11:15,374
with the child
in plain sight.

2039
01:11:15,406 --> 01:11:17,614
Okay, okay.

2040
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:18,607
You got us.

2041
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,695
Here we are.

2042
01:11:19,695 --> 01:11:20,655
Here's the kid.

2043
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,159
I'm cooperating.

2044
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:24,048
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

2045
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,008
( gags )

2046
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,384
Catch!

2047
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,336
( all shouting ):
2319!

2048
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:29,969
We have a toxic
projectile!

2049
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:31,569
Halt! After the suspect!

2050
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:32,977
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

2051
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,514
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!

2052
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:37,042
( Boo squeaks )

2053
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,226
Come on.

2054
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,435
Don't let them get away.

2055
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,396
What...?!

2056
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:42,548
No, wait, wait!

2057
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,148
Come back!
He has the child!

2058
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:45,428
( frustrated growl )

2059
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:49,205
( Boo squeaks )

2060
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:51,670
Sullivan? Sullivan!

2061
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,270
Give me the child!

2062
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,422
Me not go!

2063
01:11:54,486 --> 01:11:55,351
Give her to me!

2064
01:11:56,503 --> 01:11:58,679
( panting )

2065
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:00,119
( grunts )

2066
01:12:01,912 --> 01:12:03,672
( metallic creaking )

2067
01:12:03,768 --> 01:12:08,057
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!

2068
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,721
( growling and pounding )

2069
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:11,546
Hey!

2070
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,050
Sullivan!

2071
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:13,914
( yells )

2072
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:15,643
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.

2073
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:16,411
( beep )

2074
01:12:16,507 --> 01:12:17,211
Come on.

2075
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:20,187
Don't go in that room!

2076
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,756
( yelling )

2077
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,061
I think we stopped him, Boo.

2078
01:12:24,093 --> 01:12:25,180
You're safe now.

2079
01:12:25,213 --> 01:12:28,381
You be a good girl, okay?

2080
01:12:28,446 --> 01:12:30,878
This has gone
far enough, James.

2081
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:32,222
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

2082
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:33,374
I can't do that!

2083
01:12:33,374 --> 01:12:34,463
She's seen too much.

2084
01:12:34,495 --> 01:12:36,095
You both have.

2085
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:37,471
It doesn't have to be this way.

2086
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:39,072
I have no choice!

2087
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,128
Times have changed.

2088
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:41,760
Scaring isn't enough anymore.

2089
01:12:41,793 --> 01:12:43,169
But kidnapping children?!

2090
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:44,737
I'II kidnap
a thousand children

2091
01:12:44,769 --> 01:12:46,209
before I let
this company die

2092
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:47,970
and I'II silence anyone

2093
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,794
who gets in my way!

2094
01:12:49,826 --> 01:12:51,106
No!

2095
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:53,411
( child@s voice ):
Good night, Mom.

2096
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,107
( woman@s voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.

2097
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:56,004
Good night, Mom.

2098
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,276
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

2099
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:00,549
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

2100
01:13:00,549 --> 01:13:02,532
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

2101
01:13:02,532 --> 01:13:04,453
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

2102
01:13:04,453 --> 01:13:05,894
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

2103
01:13:05,894 --> 01:13:07,046
MIKE:
You know what?

2104
01:13:07,046 --> 01:13:09,799
Let's watch my favorite part
again... shall we?

2105
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:12,839
( repeating ):
I'II kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

2106
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:14,696
What...? Wha...?

2107
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:16,648
I'II kidnap
a thousand children before...

2108
01:13:16,712 --> 01:13:18,056
( baby talk )

2109
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,497
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

2110
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,032
Shh!

2111
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:21,993
I'II get him.

2112
01:13:21,993 --> 01:13:23,113
All right,
come with us, sir.

2113
01:13:23,113 --> 01:13:24,169
Wh-what are
you doing?

2114
01:13:24,265 --> 01:13:25,225
Take your
hands off me!

2115
01:13:25,225 --> 01:13:26,281
You can't
arrest me!

2116
01:13:26,346 --> 01:13:27,530
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!

2117
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:29,707
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

2118
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,267
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

2119
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:34,540
The energy crisis
will only get worse

2120
01:13:34,604 --> 01:13:36,108
because of you!

2121
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,420
( loud clang )

2122
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:41,293
Stay where you are.

2123
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:42,253
Huh?

2124
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,629
Number One
wants to talk to you.

2125
01:13:43,662 --> 01:13:45,710
Attention!

2126
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:53,456
Hello, boys.

2127
01:13:53,456 --> 01:13:54,448
BOTH:
Roz?!

2128
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,289
Two and a half years
of undercover work

2129
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,209
were almost wasted

2130
01:14:00,209 --> 01:14:03,698
when you intercepted
that child, Mr. Sullivan.

2131
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:07,155
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

2132
01:14:07,187 --> 01:14:09,971
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

2133
01:14:10,003 --> 01:14:11,732
( baby talk )

2134
01:14:11,764 --> 01:14:13,300
( gasps )

2135
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,516
ROZ:
Now...

2136
01:14:14,612 --> 01:14:16,149
about the girl...

2137
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:19,253
I just want to
send her home.

2138
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:20,438
Very good.

2139
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:21,558
( chiming tones )

2140
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,287
Bring me a door shredder.

2141
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:26,391
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

2142
01:14:26,391 --> 01:14:29,656
That's the way it has to be.

2143
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:32,664
I'II give you
five minutes.

2144
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:38,809
( whirring hum )

2145
01:14:42,843 --> 01:14:44,379
Well, so long, kid.

2146
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,363
Mike Wazowski!

2147
01:14:46,363 --> 01:14:47,803
Yeah.

2148
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:52,860
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.

2149
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,205
Go ahead.

2150
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,605
Go grow up.

2151
01:15:02,366 --> 01:15:04,319
( door creaking )

2152
01:15:06,848 --> 01:15:09,120
( squealing in delight )

2153
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,272
( laughing )

2154
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,490
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

2155
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:16,450
( speaking baby talk )

2156
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:17,569
Um... Boo?

2157
01:15:17,602 --> 01:15:19,010
( speaking baby talk )

2158
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:20,162
Oh, look at that.

2159
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,370
Yeah, you know...

2160
01:15:22,403 --> 01:15:24,099
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

2161
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:25,155
( baby talk )

2162
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:26,308
Uh, Boo, um...

2163
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,268
( squeaking toy )

2164
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,740
Well, that's very nice.

2165
01:15:28,772 --> 01:15:30,501
( giggling )

2166
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:31,877
Come here, you!

2167
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:33,093
( squeals )

2168
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:35,142
( both laughing )

2169
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:42,376
* Oh, he's a happy bear... *

2170
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:43,976
( giggling )

2171
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,024
( baby talk )

2172
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:49,609
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

2173
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:51,113
to scare you
anymore, right?

2174
01:15:51,145 --> 01:15:52,201
Mm...

2175
01:15:52,265 --> 01:15:54,602
Yeah.

2176
01:15:54,665 --> 01:15:56,970
Good-bye, Boo.

2177
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:59,627
Kitty.

2178
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:01,676
Kitty has to go.

2179
01:16:17,966 --> 01:16:20,111
* *

2180
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,484
Boo!

2181
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:44,693
( gasps )

2182
01:16:44,693 --> 01:16:47,701
Kitty?

2183
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,974
( motor buzzing loudly )

2184
01:16:53,462 --> 01:16:54,647
( clicks off )

2185
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:56,023
None of this

2186
01:16:56,023 --> 01:16:58,903
ever happened, gentlemen.

2187
01:16:58,903 --> 01:17:03,416
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

2188
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:07,801
( door closes )

2189
01:17:24,093 --> 01:17:26,334
Take him away.

2190
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:28,254
( all murmuring )

2191
01:17:28,286 --> 01:17:30,206
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

2192
01:17:30,206 --> 01:17:31,358
You idiot!

2193
01:17:31,358 --> 01:17:33,407
They're going to shut down
the factory!

2194
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:35,136
( all gasp )

2195
01:17:35,136 --> 01:17:37,152
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

2196
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:39,585
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

2197
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:41,729
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

2198
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,945
Hey, you all right?

2199
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:45,026
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

2200
01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:46,082
We got Boo home.

2201
01:17:46,146 --> 01:17:48,323
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

2202
01:17:48,386 --> 01:17:50,723
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

2203
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:53,028
Not to mention the angry mob
that'II come after us

2204
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:54,851
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

2205
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:57,796
at least we had
some laughs, right?

2206
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:02,630
Laughs...

2207
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:03,909
( crickets chirping )

2208
01:18:03,974 --> 01:18:05,670
( wind blowing softly )

2209
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:08,391
( door quietly creaks open )

2210
01:18:17,513 --> 01:18:18,697
( boy gasps )

2211
01:18:21,097 --> 01:18:22,634
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?

2212
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:24,234
Hello?
Testing, testing.

2213
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:25,642
Hey, good evening.
How are you?

2214
01:18:25,642 --> 01:18:26,987
How are you?
Nice to see you.

2215
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:29,003
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

2216
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:30,155
Where you from?

2217
01:18:30,187 --> 01:18:31,403
Never mind.

2218
01:18:31,436 --> 01:18:33,356
You're in
kindergarten, right?

2219
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,476
Oh, I love kindergarten.

2220
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:36,204
Best three years of my life.

2221
01:18:37,197 --> 01:18:38,541
Of my life.

2222
01:18:38,573 --> 01:18:39,501
But I love sports.

2223
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:40,782
Dodgeball
was the best.

2224
01:18:40,814 --> 01:18:41,742
Oh, yeah.

2225
01:18:41,774 --> 01:18:43,150
I was the fastest one out there.

2226
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:44,846
Course I was the ball.

2227
01:18:44,879 --> 01:18:46,575
But I...

2228
01:18:46,606 --> 01:18:48,112
was the ball, see?

2229
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:49,712
All right.

2230
01:18:53,713 --> 01:18:55,281
( rumbling )

2231
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:56,849
( rumbling gets louder )

2232
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:58,001
( gurgling )

2233
01:18:58,001 --> 01:18:59,922
Ah...

2234
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:01,170
( huge burp )

2235
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,290
Ah?

2236
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,859
( laughing )

2237
01:19:03,923 --> 01:19:04,979
Hey, thanks a lot.

2238
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:06,163
I'II be here all week.

2239
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:07,860
Remember to tip your waitresses.

2240
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,620
( guffawing )

2241
01:19:09,651 --> 01:19:10,932
( rippling gurgle )

2242
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:12,277
( bell dings )

2243
01:19:12,277 --> 01:19:13,429
Great job, Mikey.

2244
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:15,573
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

2245
01:19:15,637 --> 01:19:16,725
Not bad, huh?

2246
01:19:16,758 --> 01:19:18,901
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

2247
01:19:18,934 --> 01:19:20,726
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

2248
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:22,198
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

2249
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:23,671
ten times more
powerful than scream

2250
01:19:23,702 --> 01:19:24,760
had nothing to do with it.

2251
01:19:24,823 --> 01:19:25,943
( clears throat )

2252
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:27,191
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.

2253
01:19:27,191 --> 01:19:29,464
Come here, you.

2254
01:19:29,496 --> 01:19:30,424
Schmoopsie-poo!

2255
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:31,417
Googley.

2256
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:32,537
Whoa!

2257
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:33,657
( snakes chittering )

2258
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:34,745
( Mike giggling )

2259
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:35,801
Girls!
Girls, put...

2260
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:38,010
Stop, stop, stop!

2261
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,315
Michael,
you're such a charmer.

2262
01:19:40,346 --> 01:19:41,659
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?

2263
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:42,971
They just delivered
a whole box.

2264
01:19:42,971 --> 01:19:43,931
Let me see it!

2265
01:19:43,931 --> 01:19:44,987
( laughing )

2266
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,524
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?

2267
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:49,788
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.

2268
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,421
( sympathetically ):
Googley Bear...

2269
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:54,622
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!

2270
01:19:54,718 --> 01:19:56,062
Ow!

2271
01:19:56,062 --> 01:19:57,438
( chattering )

2272
01:19:58,846 --> 01:20:00,479
( jittering blubbers )

2273
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:02,495
Oh, this is great!

2274
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:04,928
( humming happily )

2275
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,657
( child laughing uproariously )

2276
01:20:06,752 --> 01:20:07,809
( bell dings )

2277
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,465
Oh.

2278
01:20:13,089 --> 01:20:15,426
( distant laughter )

2279
01:20:15,426 --> 01:20:16,834
( kazoo whirs )

2280
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,659
( toy horn toots )

2281
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:28,869
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!

2282
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:30,277
( yells )

2283
01:20:30,341 --> 01:20:31,397
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

2284
01:20:31,429 --> 01:20:32,518
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

2285
01:20:32,549 --> 01:20:33,926
there's something
I want to show you.

2286
01:20:33,926 --> 01:20:34,886
But-but-but...

2287
01:20:34,886 --> 01:20:35,846
Okay, close
your eyes.

2288
01:20:35,846 --> 01:20:36,903
Follow me.
Come on.

2289
01:20:36,967 --> 01:20:37,863
I-I-I...

2290
01:20:37,927 --> 01:20:39,015
No peeking.

2291
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,552
Keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming.

2292
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:41,639
Come on,
keep coming.

2293
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:42,792
Keep coming,
keep coming.

2294
01:20:42,824 --> 01:20:43,912
Mike...

2295
01:20:43,944 --> 01:20:45,448
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

2296
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,440
Okay, stop.

2297
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,401
Open them.

2298
01:20:48,554 --> 01:20:50,281
Ta-da!

2299
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:51,945
Mike...

2300
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:53,194
Is that...?

2301
01:20:53,194 --> 01:20:54,442
Sorry it took

2302
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:55,563
so long, pal.

2303
01:20:55,627 --> 01:20:57,995
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

2304
01:20:58,027 --> 01:20:59,564
You know,
it only works

2305
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:01,516
if you have
every piece.

2306
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:16,015
( whirring hum )

2307
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:27,218
( creaking )

2308
01:21:27,218 --> 01:21:29,330
Boo?

2309
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,026
BOO:
Kitty!

2310
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:42,836
( bouncy blues melody plays )

2311
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:46,454
Sulley:
* If I were a rich man *

2312
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:50,390
* With a million or two *

2313
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:53,207
Mike:
* I'd live in
a penthouse *

2314
01:21:53,303 --> 01:21:57,688
* In a room
with a view *

2315
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,513
* And if I were handsome *

2316
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:00,473
No way.

2317
01:22:00,473 --> 01:22:01,625
It could happen.

2318
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:05,754
* Those dreams
do come true *

2319
01:22:05,818 --> 01:22:09,626
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2320
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,404
* Wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2321
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:16,988
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2322
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,261
* Wouldn't have nothing *

2323
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:20,829
Can I tell
you something?

2324
01:22:20,861 --> 01:22:23,037
* For years
I have envied *

2325
01:22:23,102 --> 01:22:24,126
You were green with it.

2326
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:27,870
* Your grace
and your charm *

2327
01:22:27,934 --> 01:22:32,575
* Everyone loves
you, you know *

2328
01:22:32,575 --> 01:22:35,745
* Yes, I know,
I know, I know *

2329
01:22:35,776 --> 01:22:38,977
* But I must admit it *

2330
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:43,266
* Big guy, you
always come through *

2331
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:48,323
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2332
01:22:50,531 --> 01:22:54,084
BOTH:
* You and me together *

2333
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:57,797
* That's how it
always should be *

2334
01:22:57,797 --> 01:23:03,654
* One without the other
don't mean nothing to me *

2335
01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:08,167
* Nothing to me *

2336
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:09,767
* Yeah, I wouldn't
be nothing *

2337
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:11,368
* No *

2338
01:23:11,368 --> 01:23:14,824
* If I didn't
have you to serve *

2339
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:18,633
* I'm just a punky
little eyeball *

2340
01:23:18,698 --> 01:23:22,250
* And a funky
optic nerve *

2341
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:25,963
* Hey, I never
told you this *

2342
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:28,556
* Sometimes I get
a little blue *

2343
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:30,124
Looks good on you.

2344
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:32,332
* But I wouldn't
have nothing *

2345
01:23:32,397 --> 01:23:35,309
* If I didn't
have you... *

2346
01:23:35,309 --> 01:23:38,670
Let's dance.

2347
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:40,814
Look, Ma,
I'm dancing!

2348
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,135
Would you let me lead?

2349
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:46,735
Look at that.
It's true.

2350
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,880
Big guys are light
on their feet.

2351
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:50,032
Don't you dare dip me.

2352
01:23:50,064 --> 01:23:52,337
Don't you dare dip me,
don't you dare dip me.

2353
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:54,290
Ow. I should
have stretched.

2354
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:57,618
* Yes, I wouldn't
be nothing *

2355
01:23:57,681 --> 01:24:00,051
* If I didn't have you *

2356
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:01,426
I know what you
mean, Sulley.

2357
01:24:01,491 --> 01:24:02,387
* Because... *

2358
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:03,859
* I wouldn't know
where to go *

2359
01:24:03,859 --> 01:24:05,140
* Me, too,
because I... *

2360
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,252
* Wouldn't know
what to do *

2361
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:08,916
Why do you keep
singing my part?

2362
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,669
BOTH:
* I don't have to say it *

2363
01:24:11,701 --> 01:24:12,821
Ah, say it anyway.

2364
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:13,781
* 'Cause we... *

2365
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:16,406
* Both know it's true *

2366
01:24:16,406 --> 01:24:20,919
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2367
01:24:21,047 --> 01:24:24,567
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2368
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:28,793
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2369
01:24:28,793 --> 01:24:34,873
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you. *

2370
01:24:34,873 --> 01:24:35,834
( music ends )

2371
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:37,818
One more time.

2372
01:24:37,883 --> 01:24:39,578
( music begins again )

2373
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:40,475
lt worked!

2374
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:42,300
* I don't have
to say it *

2375
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,612
Where'd everybody
come from?

2376
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:45,692
* 'Cause we both
know it's true *

2377
01:24:45,756 --> 01:24:47,612
Let's take it
home, big guy.

2378
01:24:47,676 --> 01:24:51,550
BOTH:
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

2379
01:24:51,613 --> 01:24:55,135
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

2380
01:24:55,135 --> 01:25:00,223
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

2381
01:25:00,223 --> 01:25:02,240
* You, you *

2382
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,288
* A, E, I, O... *

2383
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,049
* That means you, yeah. *

2384
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:06,976
( music ends )

2385
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:09,953
( percussive jazz melody
begins )

2386
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,373
* *

2387
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:40,808
* *

2388
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,331
* *

2389
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:09,006
( music ends )

2390
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:11,310
( soft intro plays )

2391
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:30,675
( music segues
to fast swing melody )

2392
01:26:41,205 --> 01:26:44,086
* *

2393
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,425
* *

2394
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,828
* *

2395
01:27:24,383 --> 01:27:27,231
( music segues
to slow, soft melody )

2396
01:27:40,674 --> 01:27:43,554
( music segues
to jazzy bass beat )

2397
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,037
* *

2398
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:05,223
* *

2399
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:16,553
( music ends )
