1
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:46,969
There was a demon that lived in the air.

2
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:51,286
They said whoever challenged him
would die.

3
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:54,643
Their controls would freeze up.

4
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:57,206
Their planes would buffet wildly...

5
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:00,083
...and they would disintegrate.

6
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,290
The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter...

7
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,001
...750 miles an hour...

8
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,369
...where the air could no longer
move out of the way.

9
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:19,526
He lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass.

10
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:24,568
They called it the sound barrier.

11
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:28,928
Then they built a small plane...

12
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:32,488
...the X-1, to try and break
the sound barrier.

13
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:37,690
And men came to the high desert
of California to ride it.

14
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,761
They were called test pilots...

15
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,681
...and no one knew their names.

16
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,690
Okay, Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.

17
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:08,531
Roger, Ground Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...

18
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,967
...lowering and launching... now.

19
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,723
Mach.92.

20
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:30,003
.93.

21
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,486
.94.

22
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,523
Hit a mild buffet there.

23
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:41,204
Mach.95.

24
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:56,566
.98!

25
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,326
.99!

26
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:05,491
WK 28, do you want
to declare an emergency?

27
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,201
Negative. WK 28 is not...

28
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,244
Go away.

29
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,930
"Lord, guard and guide

30
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,692
"The men who fly

31
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:55,610
"Through the great spaces

32
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,807
"In the sky.

33
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:03,091
"Be with them always

34
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,521
"In the air

35
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:11,967
"In darkening storms or sunlight fair.

36
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:21,081
"Hear us when we lift our prayer

37
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:28,403
"For all in peril

38
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:32,282
"In the air."

39
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,487
I was looking at the pictures on your wall.

40
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,130
How come a fancy pilot...

41
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:24,409
...like Slick there,
doesn't have his picture up there?

42
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,731
What do you have to do
to get your picture up there?

43
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,609
You have to die.

44
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,612
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.

45
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:41,002
Don't just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder.

46
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,248
Get your ass over here and have a drink.

47
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,890
I got you something.

48
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:56,770
You could be the first.

49
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:59,770
The man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top.

50
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,810
You'd be the one they remembered.

51
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:04,565
You're the best civilian pilot around.

52
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,491
You get that helmet?

53
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,766
It might work.

54
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,809
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost in it.

55
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:16,929
Some people say the sound barrier
can't be broke.

56
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:20,126
An engineer will tell you it's an absolute...

57
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,282
...like the firmness of the earth.

58
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,844
The sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky.

59
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,209
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.

60
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,931
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.

61
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,412
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.

62
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:38,806
Then again...

63
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,525
...maybe it can.

64
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:47,291
Maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum.

65
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,161
How much?

66
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,801
$150,000.

67
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:57,640
Come on, Slick, give us a break.

68
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,852
Non-negotiable, as usual.

69
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,691
What do we do now?

70
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:10,723
That guy in the corner...

71
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,691
Yeager is his name.

72
00:09:12,772 --> 00:09:16,003
He's some kind of a war hero.
Shot down five Germans in one day.

73
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,481
He's a natural-born stick-and-rudder man.

74
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,690
As press-liaison man for the Air Force,
I think...

75
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,084
Any problems with him?

76
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:25,891
- Only one.
- What's that?

77
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:27,925
Holding him back.

78
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:40,087
We were just talking to Slick
about the sound barrier.

79
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,885
We feel that the X-1
is ready to have a go at it.

80
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:47,442
We think the X-1's got the answer
to go beyond Mach 1.

81
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:49,530
If there is any beyond.

82
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:53,964
So, what do you think?

83
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:58,527
I'll tell you. Half these engineers
have never been off the ground.

84
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:01,968
They might tell you that
the sound barrier's a brick wall.

85
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:04,964
It'll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it.

86
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,369
If you ask me,
I don't believe the damn thing even exists.

87
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,602
Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager.

88
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,205
No thanks, I got one.

89
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:15,566
So, do you think
you want to have a go at it?

90
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,007
I might.

91
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:21,963
But since, as you say,
this sound barrier doesn't really exist...

92
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,040
...how much...

93
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,565
How much you got?

94
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:29,603
Just joking.
The Air Force is already paying me. Right?

95
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,131
So when do we go?

96
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,884
How about tomorrow morning?

97
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,040
I'll be there.

98
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,411
See you there.

99
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:45,243
How much are you paying him?

100
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:48,041
I think it's $283.

101
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:49,441
A week?

102
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:50,925
A month.

103
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,925
Well, that's not bad.

104
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,691
First fellow to break the sound barrier...

105
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:03,565
...gets a free steak with all the trimmings.

106
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,527
I'll have mine medium rare, please.

107
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,930
Honey, you ever been caught
on the desert alone?

108
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,765
I never have.

109
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,003
I don't think I ever will.

110
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,290
Never met the man
who could catch me out there.

111
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,045
I'm half jackrabbit.

112
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,850
Forget it, flyboy.

113
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,041
You'd never catch me.

114
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,285
I believe I will.

115
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:49,324
Can't be done.

116
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,803
Could I ask you something?

117
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,804
Forget it, sweetie.

118
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,045
She's his wife.

119
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,403
Glennis! I'm gonna get you!

120
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,091
Come back here!

121
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,522
What have you two been up to?

122
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,405
Where's Ridley?

123
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,484
Over there waiting on you.

124
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,405
Can I talk to you?

125
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,682
I got a little problem.

126
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:27,081
A horse threw me last night
and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.

127
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:28,321
How bad?

128
00:14:28,412 --> 00:14:31,290
I feel like I broke a couple
of the sons of bitches.

129
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,447
I won't be able to lean over
to shut the door. Got any ideas?

130
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,045
Your left side okay?

131
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:42,880
I don't want these guys to know.
They'll find somebody else to fly this thing.

132
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:44,803
I'll try to fix you a handle.

133
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:55,207
Can you help me out?
I got a small emergency.

134
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:59,365
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.

135
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,605
I think that'll work.

136
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,844
Punch a hole in the sky.

137
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:28,565
I'll be right back.

138
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,206
How are you feeling?

139
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:36,805
Oh, just about right.

140
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:39,447
There she is, partner.
All bridled, saddled and ready to go.

141
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,324
You got any Beemans?

142
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,085
Yeah, I got a stick.

143
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,208
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

144
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,441
Fair enough.

145
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:05,167
Stick this in the handle.
Take your good arm and just whang it.

146
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,485
Okay, thanks, buddy.

147
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,609
Pre-drop checklist complete.

148
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,684
Ten... nine...

149
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:39,681
Drop!

150
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:44,770
There you go, buddy.

151
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,242
Put your spurs to her, Chuck.

152
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:18,130
Mach.91.

153
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,127
.92.

154
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,285
.93.

155
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,324
Hit a mild buffet there.

156
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,324
Just the usual instability.

157
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:55,412
Ridley, make a note here,
would you, if you got...

158
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:58,609
...nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.

159
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,884
.95.

160
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:12,970
.96.

161
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,886
More buffeting.

162
00:20:20,972 --> 00:20:22,200
More commotion.

163
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,885
Getting wobbly here.

164
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:28,961
.98.

165
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,604
She's getting real active.

166
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:41,607
.99!

167
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:53,605
What's that sound?

168
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:01,684
He bought the farm.

169
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,487
That's it. We're back to square one.

170
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:10,126
Wait a minute.

171
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:20,001
Ridley, make another note, would you?

172
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,281
Must be something wrong
with the Machmeter.

173
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:25,124
Jumped plumb off the scale.

174
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,364
Gone screwy on me.

175
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:29,762
You bust it, we'll fix it.

176
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,361
Personally, I think you're seeing things.

177
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:38,407
Could be. I'm still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell.

178
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,326
We did it!

179
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:47,281
We finally broke the sound barrier.

180
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,126
We did it!

181
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:28,210
I want to place a long-distance call
to Los Angeles.

182
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:29,645
Who are you calling?

183
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:30,767
The press!

184
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:34,208
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.

185
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,964
No, sir. No press.

186
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,852
No word of this goes beyond the flight line.

187
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:42,687
What's going on? This is big news.
We need coverage of this.

188
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:44,603
No, sir. Sorry, no press.

189
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:47,081
Those are orders. National security.

190
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:48,605
But the war's over!

191
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,969
Look, pal, maybe they don't want
someone to know.

192
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,441
Who?

193
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,085
The Russians, maybe.

194
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:57,322
But they're our allies!

195
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:02,442
Well, anyway, someone figured it out
that way, and that's the way it is.

196
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:05,085
Chuck, you're our man!

197
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:07,610
You're the fastest man alive!

198
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:09,523
We want you to fly more planes for us.

199
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:12,046
We want you to fly all our planes!

200
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,081
What you been doing, hedgehopping?

201
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,450
Word will get out, Major.

202
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:58,126
Maybe not to the press
or the general public.

203
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:02,525
But soon, every fighter jock, rocket ace,
and rat-racer in the country...

204
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:07,083
...will be headed this way, wanting
to push the outside of the envelope...

205
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,450
...and get to the top of the pyramid.

206
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,882
Edwards Air Force Base.

207
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:39,849
This is the place to be, hon.

208
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:43,282
They're going faster, farther
and higher here than anywhere else.

209
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,762
I'll tell you something else, too.

210
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:55,369
We'll climb right up that ladder,
just like we did at Langley.

211
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,167
We?

212
00:24:58,292 --> 00:24:59,566
You mean you.

213
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:02,124
Hon, we're a team!

214
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,408
I move up, you move up.

215
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,122
Right to the top of the old pyramid.

216
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,046
Slow down, Gordo.

217
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,407
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.

218
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,569
You're scaring the girls. You are!

219
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,081
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

220
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:27,082
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

221
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,243
You're looking at him, baby.

222
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,844
Come on, cheer up.

223
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:44,166
Hey, have I ever let you down?

224
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:37,290
Deke, that's 62 men...

225
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,609
...in the last 36 weeks.

226
00:28:41,212 --> 00:28:43,043
You know what that averages?

227
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:48,886
Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field?

228
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:53,050
What is an ace like you
doing in a place like this?

229
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,202
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.

230
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,286
Gordo...

231
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,804
...Cooper, right?
- Yeah.

232
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,406
Gordo thinks he's one of those
hot-dog pilots you hear so much about.

233
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:06,484
You got a short memory.

234
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:10,930
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.

235
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:15,251
I guess you're too shy to tell this guy
how I used to wax your tail.

236
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,086
Wax my tail?

237
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:23,082
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.

238
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,803
That's where you'll always be.

239
00:29:26,052 --> 00:29:28,361
What are you two rookies going to have?

240
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,447
Rookies?

241
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:34,603
Now hold on, sis.

242
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:38,529
You are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now.

243
00:29:39,932 --> 00:29:42,730
In a few years I bet you're even
going to immortalize us...

244
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:45,565
...by putting our pictures up there
on your wall.

245
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,322
Did I say something wrong?

246
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:57,162
I'll tell you. We got two categories
of pilots around here.

247
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:00,849
We got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes.

248
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:04,851
And we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes.

249
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:08,964
Now what are you two pudknockers
going to have?

250
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,246
Scotch.

251
00:30:17,172 --> 00:30:19,891
You know what happened!
The machine broke.

252
00:30:19,972 --> 00:30:21,166
Not the machine, it's the man.

253
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,528
He was dead before he went up.
Don't talk about it here.

254
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,762
Good one. Now fire it in here.

255
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,731
Look at old Yeager.

256
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:53,649
On top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years.

257
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:57,329
Every time somebody goes faster,
he just goes up again.

258
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:00,682
He stays the fastest man alive.

259
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,206
You know...

260
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,040
...sometimes...

261
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:13,009
...all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting.

262
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,607
I think:

263
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,010
"That's the crash truck."

264
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:25,521
Anyway...

265
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,362
...I'm really glad we could talk.

266
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,004
I thought I was the only one
who had these nightmares.

267
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:34,681
Yeah, me too.

268
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:38,763
Nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here.

269
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:41,003
Everybody's always trying to...

270
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:45,011
..."maintain an even strain."

271
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:50,890
Well, you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military.

272
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:53,964
I'll tell you one thing.

273
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:57,012
The military owes me for all this.

274
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:59,886
One day I expect the military
to make good.

275
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:07,729
Well, it sure ain't your average dull life.

276
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:10,969
I went East for a reunion...

277
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:14,283
...and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands' work.

278
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:18,604
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was
on Madison Avenue...

279
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,011
...places like that.

280
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,644
Cutthroat?

281
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,972
I wondered how they would have felt...

282
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,969
...if each time their husband
went in to make a deal...

283
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:38,080
...there was a one in four chance
he wouldn't come out of the meeting.

284
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:45,611
I'm going home to my folks in San Diego.

285
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:50,165
What did Gordo say?

286
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,681
He "maintained an even strain."

287
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:00,441
Look at them.

288
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:04,480
You'd think they were talking about sports.

289
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,247
Men...

290
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:16,564
Sometimes they're just such... assholes.

291
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:31,885
Sometimes they sure are
handy assholes, though.

292
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:33,971
Yeah, sometimes...

293
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:37,525
Sometimes.

294
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,565
You want a hot dog?

295
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:51,603
I'm leaving, Gordo.

296
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:59,126
Look at that!

297
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:02,172
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase 2.

298
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:04,005
Scott Crossfield.

299
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:06,652
It sure as hell is. Jesus!

300
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:11,843
He scorched that one, didn't he?

301
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,442
He's pushing the outside of the envelope.

302
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,443
He must be going for a record.

303
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,602
He's shooting for Mach 2, I heard.

304
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:28,445
On the 50th anniversary
of the Wright Brothers' historic flight...

305
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:32,208
...another historic flight takes place,
as Scott Crossfield...

306
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:36,280
...streaks across the skies
over the high desert in California.

307
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:37,687
Mach 2.

308
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:40,605
Almost 1,500 miles per hour...

309
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,962
...and a new world record!

310
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,362
It's a field day for the press.

311
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:48,081
Congratulations come
from a previous record holder...

312
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:52,643
...as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.

313
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:55,924
And there's a comradeship of speed.

314
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:59,050
To Scott Crossfield, the fastest man alive.

315
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,762
Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.

316
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,563
The real test wasn't Mach 2.

317
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:28,931
I guess that demon lives out
at about 2.3 on your Machmeter.

318
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,407
Yeah, but Mach 2 was the magic number.

319
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:37,170
Like 60 homers, like batting.400,
like the four-minute mile.

320
00:35:37,812 --> 00:35:39,928
The press likes a nice round number.

321
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:43,209
After that, they don't care,
until the next magic number.

322
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,807
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.

323
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:48,246
Coverage?

324
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:52,087
You mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras?

325
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,322
Those root weevils write history.

326
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:58,281
Let them write the history,
and let the pilots fly the planes.

327
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:01,047
Pilots.

328
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,126
You know what really makes
your rocket ships go up?

329
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:30,648
The aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that...

330
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:31,801
Funding.

331
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:33,883
That's what makes your ships go up.

332
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,564
I'll tell you something.

333
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,645
And you guys, too.

334
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:40,680
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

335
00:36:41,372 --> 00:36:43,886
Whoever gets the funding
gets the technology.

336
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,805
Whoever gets the technology stays on top.

337
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:48,530
Flyboy, let's dance.

338
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,805
I'll drink to that.

339
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:24,685
He'll be going after Crossfield soon,
won't he?

340
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:26,286
No, he won't.

341
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,649
He'll be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air.

342
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:09,965
You got any Beemans?

343
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,762
Even before you hit Mach 2,
she'll be unforgiving on you.

344
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,691
So take it easy.
Wring her out a little bit this time.

345
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:17,807
You got any gum?

346
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:19,041
Yeah, I got me a stick.

347
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:21,441
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

348
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:23,484
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

349
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,965
Okay, drop her.

350
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:42,282
All right, here we go again.

351
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:47,248
Drop!

352
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:59,050
Number 3 coming on.

353
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:09,492
Got seven seconds on 150 right now.

354
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:30,249
I've got you in sight, Chuck.

355
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:32,405
Going out of sight...

356
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:33,967
...now!

357
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:41,766
Mach 1.

358
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:52,887
Number 4.

359
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,205
Here goes Mach 2.

360
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:00,807
2. 1.

361
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,326
Sorry, Scotty.

362
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:05,285
You got her now, buddy.

363
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:06,885
You can ease it back.

364
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,126
Bring it on in.

365
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,930
I'm pushing the envelope.

366
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,970
See where that demon lives.

367
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,443
Come in, Chuck.

368
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:38,811
Say again. Over.

369
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:40,689
Do you read? Over.

370
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,612
Damn! He's uncorked it!

371
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:47,691
Mayday! Mayday!

372
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:49,604
Alert all ground crews.

373
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:55,684
Talk to me!

374
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,207
Come in!

375
00:41:05,852 --> 00:41:07,763
Do you read me? Over.

376
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:20,650
I'm fighting bad here.

377
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:25,449
I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.

378
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,770
I don't know if I can make it
back to base or not.

379
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:34,246
What happened?

380
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,966
Think I bust the canopy with my head.

381
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:38,805
I'm getting okay now.

382
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:44,330
We sure chased that old demon this time.

383
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,248
That's as fast as a man can go.

384
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,724
What's next, Ridley?

385
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:30,206
It's called Sputnik.

386
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,169
We know. Sit down.

387
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:39,683
And as I was saying...

388
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:43,927
...whoever controls
the high ground of space...

389
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:46,130
...will control the world.

390
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:50,811
The Roman Empire controlled
the world because it could build roads.

391
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:54,801
Later, the British Empire was dominant
because it had ships.

392
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:59,881
In the air stage, we were powerful
because we had the airplane.

393
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:04,688
Now the Communists have established
a foothold in outer space.

394
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:08,602
Soon they'll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us...

395
00:43:08,692 --> 00:43:10,922
...like rocks from a highway overpass.

396
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:14,290
How the hell did they get ahead of us?

397
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:16,368
Gentlemen, I think we're ready.

398
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,200
Is there a loose plug over there anywhere?

399
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:28,490
Here it is. I'll get it.

400
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:31,252
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.

401
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:34,370
The decisive battle between
the forces of good and evil.

402
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:37,171
We're engaged in a struggle for survival.

403
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,687
This footage was assembled from...

404
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:44,844
...sources operating under deep cover
at great risk.

405
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:49,208
We're fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men.

406
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,409
This is secret footage
of the Russian Korabl rocket...

407
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:56,201
...and these are the German scientists
that they captured after the war.

408
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:59,329
Was it their German scientists
who got them up there first?

409
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:02,770
No, it was not, Senator.

410
00:44:02,852 --> 00:44:05,525
Our Germans are better
than their Germans.

411
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:09,044
That's Titov on the right
and on the left is Gagarin.

412
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:11,891
No, Titov's on the left.
Gagarin's on the right.

413
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:16,001
They bear a great resemblance
to each other.

414
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:20,529
If the Soviets ever do put a man up there,
it will be one of these two.

415
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:22,603
Most likely, the one on the left.

416
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:23,966
- Gagarin.
- Titov.

417
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:27,005
Isn't that their chief designer?

418
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:28,605
We know very little about him.

419
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:31,160
- Let us see him again.
- Here's some more of him.

420
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:34,210
They've developed a program
of stupendous dimensions...

421
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:36,760
...and he is clearly the genius behind it.

422
00:44:38,692 --> 00:44:41,160
I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep...

423
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:43,722
...by the light of a Communist moon.

424
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:49,402
Get that moron off of there!

425
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:56,051
We could have orbited
a satellite a year ago...

426
00:44:56,132 --> 00:44:58,168
...if we had been given a green light.

427
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:01,847
Now we must get something up there
quick and dirty, any way at all.

428
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:03,087
Well, what?

429
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,166
By combining our available rockets,
the Redstone, the Atlas...

430
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:09,761
...I agree that we could launch a pod.

431
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:11,761
A pot?

432
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:12,847
A pod.

433
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,606
A capsule.

434
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:17,252
Now, we will be in full control of this pod.

435
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:19,607
It will go up like a cannonball...

436
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:22,126
...and come down like a cannonball...

437
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,841
...splashing down in the ocean...

438
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:28,408
...with a parachute to spare the life
of the specimen inside.

439
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:30,606
Spaceman?

440
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:32,081
Specimen.

441
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:36,368
Well, what kind of "specimen"?

442
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:38,921
A tough one.

443
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:41,690
Responsive to orders.

444
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:44,690
I had in mind a jimp.

445
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:46,207
"Jimp"?

446
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,329
Well, what the hell is a "jimp"?

447
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,968
A jimp. A jimpanzee, Senator. An ape.

448
00:45:52,612 --> 00:45:56,287
The first American into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee.

449
00:45:57,772 --> 00:46:00,525
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?

450
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:04,440
We have film of some people
we think are strong candidates.

451
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:07,569
We'd like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking.

452
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:12,687
These are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown.

453
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:14,689
We like the one on the right.

454
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,048
- No, on the left.
- On the right. Don't embarrass me!

455
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:22,489
These people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets.

456
00:46:22,772 --> 00:46:24,000
Is that a factor?

457
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:25,491
As you'll see...

458
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:28,804
...they're quite comfortable
in conditions of flame.

459
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:33,924
Now this is personnel who have
very well-developed equilibrium.

460
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:38,000
Good middle ear. Also very nice people.

461
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:39,320
Very easy to work with.

462
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:42,324
With some work,
they could be very responsive to orders.

463
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:45,165
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.

464
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:49,763
Since he works without eyesight,
his other senses are sharpened.

465
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,163
In space there'll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate.

466
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:55,846
The cannonball effect you mentioned...

467
00:46:56,132 --> 00:46:58,805
We were basically thinking about...

468
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,848
...putting a couple into orbit.

469
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:03,208
Possibly adds emotional stability.

470
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:07,128
This individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned.

471
00:47:07,212 --> 00:47:11,125
Ease with flames, comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase.

472
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:13,487
Also, he is available as of the 15th.

473
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,569
I want test pilots!

474
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:20,328
Test pilots? No, you can't deal with them.

475
00:47:20,412 --> 00:47:23,449
I'm sure we can do better
with another type of man...

476
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:25,324
...any other type of man.

477
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:27,210
A more manageable type.

478
00:47:27,332 --> 00:47:29,243
It will only complicate things.

479
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:31,766
With a man we must guarantee
a safe return.

480
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:34,730
Mr. President, I think
you'd be wise to reconsider.

481
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:37,641
Test pilots?

482
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,444
We'll be heading for some air bases.

483
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:41,124
Not just some air bases.

484
00:47:41,332 --> 00:47:44,642
The one with the great test pilots.
There's only one place to go.

485
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:49,282
I was there once before
and I hoped I'd never have to go back.

486
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:54,084
It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in California.

487
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,928
A prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called Edwards.

488
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:00,812
They've got a weird, mad-monk squadron.

489
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,772
They live in rat shacks, terrible conditions.

490
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:07,049
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.

491
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:09,683
This is the joint they hang out in.

492
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,842
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.

493
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,402
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?

494
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:16,643
How'd it get a name like that?

495
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:18,411
Ask Pancho.

496
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:24,762
We're meeting the Liaison Officer.
They are expecting us.

497
00:48:24,852 --> 00:48:26,410
They? Who's "they"?

498
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,761
The best...

499
00:48:30,412 --> 00:48:32,482
The best test pilots in the world.

500
00:48:33,532 --> 00:48:35,602
They got some kind of brotherhood.

501
00:48:36,732 --> 00:48:38,802
They think they got the right stuff.

502
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:40,962
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?

503
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,123
There any snakes around here?

504
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,725
Yeah. In the bushes.

505
00:48:45,012 --> 00:48:48,800
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But seems to be more to it.

506
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:50,805
What do they say it means?

507
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:53,770
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.

508
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:56,002
They don't talk about it to outsiders?

509
00:48:56,212 --> 00:48:57,531
To each other.

510
00:48:57,612 --> 00:48:59,603
To outsiders they say even less.

511
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,450
Anyway, they're all here.

512
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:05,048
Including the ace of aces himself.

513
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:06,247
Who's that?

514
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,201
Yeager.

515
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:10,091
Never heard of him.

516
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:26,285
These must be our gentlemen
from Washington...

517
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:28,324
...scouting for astronauts.

518
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:33,441
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.

519
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:35,844
I didn't quite hear you.

520
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,850
I said, "Lab rabbits."

521
00:49:41,052 --> 00:49:42,167
What's that mean?

522
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:44,971
It means you don't need
honest-to-God pilots.

523
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:49,286
What you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule...

524
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:51,563
...with its heart beating...

525
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:53,450
...and a wire up the kazoo.

526
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,086
I don't hold with it.

527
00:49:57,172 --> 00:49:58,446
I don't either.

528
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:01,366
You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile.

529
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:03,085
And then splashdown.

530
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:05,443
Possibly get lost at sea.

531
00:50:05,572 --> 00:50:07,802
There's some things you can't change.

532
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:10,761
Some peckerwood's
got to take the beast up.

533
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:14,049
And some peckerwood's got to land it.

534
00:50:14,532 --> 00:50:17,888
And that peckerwood is called a pilot.

535
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:20,011
You're mighty right.

536
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,680
The boys smell panic in your program.

537
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:25,047
That's one thing they don't respond to.

538
00:50:25,132 --> 00:50:29,330
Now maybe if we talk privately
to Yeager and some of the other boys...

539
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:30,606
That's Yeager?

540
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:33,889
Anybody goes up in the damn thing's
gonna be Spam in a can.

541
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,368
Yeager doesn't fit the profile.

542
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,722
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.

543
00:50:46,372 --> 00:50:50,843
Forget about Walker and Crossfield
and the other civilian pilots, too.

544
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:56,408
The security clearance just takes
too long with those people.

545
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,491
Besides, they seem
a little too independent.

546
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:03,287
You mean for this space race...

547
00:51:03,932 --> 00:51:05,968
...you don't want our best pilots?

548
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:07,805
I didn't say that.

549
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:11,489
We want the best pilots that we can get.

550
00:51:14,252 --> 00:51:15,844
Y'all want some whiskey?

551
00:51:16,332 --> 00:51:18,687
No, thanks, Fred. Just a little coffee.

552
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:20,764
I'd like a Coca-Cola.

553
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,965
In a clean glass.

554
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:26,643
There's an old saying:
"Never refuse a combat assignment."

555
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:33,882
Well, there sure is a long line
of shit-hot rocket aces around here.

556
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:36,521
Hey, Hot Dog.

557
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:40,121
What the hell's "astronaut" mean anyway?

558
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:44,606
Star voyager.

559
00:51:49,092 --> 00:51:51,003
Star voyager Gus Grissom.

560
00:51:53,412 --> 00:51:55,164
I like the sound of that.

561
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,721
Now your name is?

562
00:51:58,052 --> 00:51:59,804
My name, José Jiménez.

563
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,091
Who are we gonna get
to take on the Russians?

564
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:09,087
Have you seen this José Jiménez?
He's a crack-up.

565
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:14,846
I am the chief astronaut
of the United States Interplanetary...

566
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:23,483
My name, José Jiménez.

567
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:27,563
Now I see you have some of
your space equipment with you.

568
00:52:27,852 --> 00:52:30,207
What is that called? The crash helmet?

569
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:32,124
Oh, I hope not.

570
00:52:32,492 --> 00:52:33,811
Get that guy off.

571
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:36,482
The country's already laughing at us.

572
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:41,164
This is the show I wanted you to see.

573
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:42,526
Who, that kid?

574
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:47,887
Winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...

575
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:52,443
...and holder of the coast-to-coast,
nonstop, supersonic flight record...

576
00:52:52,772 --> 00:52:54,763
...from the U.S. Marine Corps...

577
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,491
...Major John Glenn!

578
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:57,561
That guy.

579
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:04,007
Can you tell us what's that song?

580
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,123
Straighten Up and Fly Right.

581
00:53:16,772 --> 00:53:18,888
It's Straighten Up and Fly Right.

582
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:20,846
He's not dumb.

583
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:31,765
Major, Eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend.

584
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:35,289
Did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten?

585
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:37,205
Yes, I did, Bob.

586
00:53:37,972 --> 00:53:40,042
I liked a girl in my class, but...

587
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:43,290
...the other guys liked her too
and she didn't pay attention.

588
00:53:43,372 --> 00:53:45,522
But I kept after her, Eddie.

589
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:48,807
Did you finally get her to notice you?

590
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,007
Yes, I did.

591
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:52,641
In fact, I finally got her to marry me.

592
00:53:57,412 --> 00:53:58,765
They love the guy.

593
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:17,687
Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...

594
00:54:17,772 --> 00:54:19,330
...at 180 degrees.

595
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:22,605
José Jiménez on approach.

596
00:54:25,052 --> 00:54:27,441
My name, José Jiménez.

597
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:32,163
Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.

598
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:36,007
Some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut.

599
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:39,608
They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.

600
00:54:51,132 --> 00:54:54,568
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?

601
00:54:55,852 --> 00:54:59,765
They call them aviators in the Navy.
They say they're better than pilots.

602
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:13,692
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Alan Shepard.

603
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:17,522
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

604
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:19,523
Just the man we came to see.

605
00:55:26,212 --> 00:55:28,168
You've heard about our project.

606
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:31,449
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest...

607
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:32,887
Priority.

608
00:55:33,212 --> 00:55:34,645
It's a hazardous...

609
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:38,010
...undertaking. In fact,
it's extremely hazardous.

610
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:43,803
It's so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer...

611
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:46,572
...it will not be held against you
in any way.

612
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:48,610
- Sounds dangerous.
- It is.

613
00:55:49,692 --> 00:55:51,125
Count me in.

614
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,205
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.

615
00:56:04,892 --> 00:56:07,167
Why are you doing this to me?

616
00:56:07,772 --> 00:56:10,969
I'm afraid there's no simple way
to explain that to you.

617
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,922
Thank you, Number 21.

618
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:50,761
Number 22, please.

619
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:53,884
You're gonna love it.

620
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,363
Excuse me, are you John Glenn?

621
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:07,685
Scott Carpenter.

622
00:57:08,372 --> 00:57:11,091
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.

623
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:13,083
I had a good time doing them.

624
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:16,050
I guess we're both here
for the same reason.

625
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:20,082
You know what they've got planned?

626
00:57:20,572 --> 00:57:22,244
No. Let me check it out.

627
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,483
What have you got scheduled?

628
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:27,604
We're not really free
to reveal all the testing.

629
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,080
I don't get this.

630
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:36,084
Sending us down here
disguised as civilians.

631
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:38,892
Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell...?

632
00:57:38,972 --> 00:57:42,169
Hot Dog, this entire operation's
supposed to be hush-hush.

633
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:47,243
We got top-secret orders to blend in
with the patients. So shut up.

634
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,162
There might be Russian agents here.

635
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,961
They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.

636
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:01,131
All we got here is your local gentry, and...

637
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:05,567
...then you got Navy
and Marine pilots over here.

638
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:08,491
None of these guys is up
to Air Force standards.

639
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:13,126
I hear they got some 50-some guys
trying out for seven spots.

640
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:16,889
After they pick us three,
there's only gonna be four spots.

641
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:19,812
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?

642
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:21,530
You go in that door.

643
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:26,811
Who are you?

644
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:36,010
My name, José Jiménez.

645
00:58:39,372 --> 00:58:41,010
You talking to us, buddy?

646
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:45,647
All Air Force pilots go in that door.

647
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:48,285
When they all go in...

648
00:58:49,452 --> 00:58:51,170
...they all look the same.

649
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,728
But when they all come out...

650
00:58:54,772 --> 00:58:56,490
...they all look different.

651
00:58:57,172 --> 00:58:58,241
How's that?

652
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:01,890
Fellow, I said how's that?

653
00:59:03,372 --> 00:59:05,169
When they all come out...

654
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:08,403
...they all look scared.

655
00:59:18,332 --> 00:59:19,731
Buenos dias, Gonzalez.

656
00:59:21,252 --> 00:59:22,765
Buenos dias yourself.

657
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:25,724
Would you come this way.

658
00:59:30,572 --> 00:59:32,608
That guy didn't fool me a bit.

659
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:34,365
That Mexican guy?

660
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:37,849
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.

661
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:40,920
I'll open the box a little so you can see.

662
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,645
Don't put your fingers in there.

663
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:45,292
This thing will bite them off. It's vicious.

664
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:51,048
Real swabbo sense of humor.

665
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:56,284
Let's see what there is
to be scared about back here.

666
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:04,291
The ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines.

667
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:06,970
You may begin... now.

668
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:09,203
The record is 91 seconds.

669
01:01:37,892 --> 01:01:40,770
Ninety-three seconds. Read it and weep.

670
01:02:06,732 --> 01:02:08,450
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!

671
01:02:08,532 --> 01:02:10,966
You were probably just getting warmed up.

672
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:13,283
Next time I doubt I'd win.

673
01:02:14,452 --> 01:02:15,851
I don't know about that.

674
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,321
We're competing with Archie and Jughead.

675
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:14,441
Let me out of here! Let me out!

676
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,850
Gus, I got this whole thing figured out.

677
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:42,005
The drill here...

678
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:49,210
The drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of Nurse Murch.

679
01:04:52,052 --> 01:04:53,246
You're nuts.

680
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:56,731
She thinks we're all just
miserable pudknockers.

681
01:04:57,452 --> 01:05:01,206
This is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker.

682
01:05:01,532 --> 01:05:05,207
She's a woman,
susceptible to charms like all of the rest.

683
01:05:11,372 --> 01:05:12,964
You want what in there?

684
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:14,287
Sperm.

685
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,327
What for?

686
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:19,928
Sperm motility factors.

687
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:23,687
Yeah, but, Nurse...

688
01:05:24,332 --> 01:05:26,163
...how am I supposed to...

689
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:32,246
The best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization...

690
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:35,927
...accompanied by masturbation,
followed by ejaculation.

691
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:41,770
That sounds easy enough.

692
01:05:43,492 --> 01:05:44,891
I'll tell you what.

693
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:49,285
If I get stuck, you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit?

694
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,602
Please return it to the lab.

695
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,522
Hey, cut out the humming in there.

696
01:06:47,612 --> 01:06:49,682
Okay, knock it off in there.

697
01:06:58,412 --> 01:07:01,210
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.

698
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:05,202
Just knock it off,
because I'm trying to concentrate in here.

699
01:07:41,852 --> 01:07:43,046
That was quick.

700
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:45,767
There's plenty more where that came from.

701
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:47,524
You want to see me again?

702
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:49,804
I'd like to meet your wife.

703
01:07:53,972 --> 01:07:55,724
You're married, aren't you?

704
01:07:57,132 --> 01:07:59,168
Yeah, sure, I'm married all right.

705
01:08:00,052 --> 01:08:01,087
Happily?

706
01:08:01,492 --> 01:08:04,529
Yeah. A real stable relationship, too.

707
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:06,890
I'd like to meet your wife.

708
01:08:11,492 --> 01:08:12,527
Tomorrow.

709
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,091
Tomorrow's no good.

710
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:19,407
Tomorrow.

711
01:08:31,172 --> 01:08:32,844
I need you, Trudy.

712
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:41,290
I'm talking about a whole new ball game.

713
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:43,451
Fresh start.

714
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:47,521
This astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder.

715
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,566
If we play our cards right,
we go all the way to the top.

716
01:08:53,652 --> 01:08:55,085
We? You mean you.

717
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,806
I mean we.

718
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:00,491
We're a team.

719
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:06,370
Have I ever let you down?

720
01:09:06,732 --> 01:09:07,608
Yeah.

721
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,288
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

722
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:26,124
You're looking at him.

723
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:56,843
You're all set. I told her you were stable,
well-adjusted, attentive, persevering.

724
01:09:57,572 --> 01:09:59,290
- I lied.
- That a girl.

725
01:10:00,212 --> 01:10:01,406
What'd she say?

726
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:02,686
She laughed.

727
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:05,003
She knows you too well, Gordo.

728
01:10:05,332 --> 01:10:08,688
Let's face it. Some women
just have a problem with men.

729
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:11,890
Yeah, I know.

730
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:20,082
At secret locations throughout America...

731
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:22,891
...56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment...

732
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:26,567
...vying to be one of the first men
to go into space.

733
01:10:27,212 --> 01:10:29,772
These are the most up-to-date
tests imaginable.

734
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:33,527
This is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings.

735
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:40,683
They're being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent.

736
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:48,366
These men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life.

737
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:53,324
They will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment.

738
01:10:53,572 --> 01:10:56,609
They will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee.

739
01:10:57,212 --> 01:11:00,045
Many are called, but few will be chosen.

740
01:11:01,492 --> 01:11:05,007
These are men who will have to face
any danger for their country.

741
01:11:07,492 --> 01:11:11,849
No individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event.

742
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:16,968
Each man knows
that whoever survives this competition...

743
01:11:17,292 --> 01:11:20,489
...is destined to become
a legend in his own time.

744
01:11:33,732 --> 01:11:35,006
Here, hold this.

745
01:11:35,812 --> 01:11:37,404
And hold this like this.

746
01:11:37,812 --> 01:11:40,804
When the clamp is released,
the balloon inside you deflates.

747
01:11:40,892 --> 01:11:42,484
Deflates? Where's the john?

748
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:46,406
Two floors up. Gonzalez will take
you there, but wait here with him.

749
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:54,210
How's it going, Gonzalez?

750
01:12:26,412 --> 01:12:27,640
Faster!

751
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:42,571
Good day, Commander.

752
01:12:42,652 --> 01:12:44,608
You prick!

753
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:50,446
Push the button.

754
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:30,203
Me and my friends think your
José Jiménez imitation is A-okay.

755
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:34,048
But what you're doing with it is b-a-d.

756
01:13:34,132 --> 01:13:36,441
You're right, you're absolutely right.

757
01:13:47,332 --> 01:13:50,085
You ever have any explosions doing this?

758
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,603
All the time. It's a mess.

759
01:13:55,092 --> 01:13:57,652
Tell me something else, Mr. Gonzalez.

760
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:00,691
How am I doing?

761
01:14:01,012 --> 01:14:04,641
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.

762
01:14:28,052 --> 01:14:29,485
After a long...

763
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:33,172
...and unprecedented
series of evaluations...

764
01:14:34,772 --> 01:14:37,411
...which told our medical scientists...

765
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:42,728
...of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight...

766
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:47,052
...it is my pleasure to introduce to you...

767
01:14:48,172 --> 01:14:49,764
...seven Americans...

768
01:14:50,812 --> 01:14:52,245
...gentlemen all.

769
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:56,652
Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom!

770
01:15:00,172 --> 01:15:02,242
Leroy G. Cooper!

771
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:06,247
Donald K. Slayton!

772
01:15:07,692 --> 01:15:10,160
John H. Glenn, Junior!

773
01:15:11,532 --> 01:15:13,602
Malcolm S. Carpenter!

774
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:17,131
Alan B. Shepard, Junior!

775
01:15:17,772 --> 01:15:20,809
Walter M. Schirra, Junior!

776
01:15:22,412 --> 01:15:25,563
America's Mercury astronauts!

777
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:40,805
Holy shit!

778
01:15:41,612 --> 01:15:43,842
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.

779
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:48,330
Yeager ought to see this.

780
01:15:48,572 --> 01:15:51,689
Seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers...

781
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:55,521
...and they haven't done a thing
but show up for a press conference.

782
01:16:03,212 --> 01:16:07,524
Following the distribution of the kits,
those of you who have p.m. Deadlines...

783
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:09,763
...better dash to your phones.

784
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,290
Now we'll have some questions
from the press, please.

785
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:19,165
I'd like to know
whether your wives and children...

786
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:21,322
...had anything to say about this.

787
01:16:28,412 --> 01:16:29,925
Mine think it's fine.

788
01:16:41,252 --> 01:16:42,731
They're all for it.

789
01:16:53,772 --> 01:16:57,242
I don't think any of us could go on
with something like this...

790
01:16:57,332 --> 01:17:00,165
...if we didn't have
pretty good backing at home.

791
01:17:05,612 --> 01:17:08,445
My wife's attitude towards this
has been the same...

792
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:11,046
...as it's been all along through my flying.

793
01:17:11,412 --> 01:17:14,484
If it's what I want to do, she's behind it.

794
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:17,644
And, by golly, my kids are, too.
100 percent.

795
01:17:25,652 --> 01:17:27,404
I don't believe this.

796
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:30,770
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.

797
01:17:34,092 --> 01:17:37,004
I was brought up believing
that you are placed on earth...

798
01:17:37,092 --> 01:17:40,129
...more or less with a 50-50 proposition.

799
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:43,083
This is what I still believe.

800
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:47,362
We're placed here with certain talents
and capabilities...

801
01:17:47,452 --> 01:17:51,525
...and it's up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can.

802
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:57,161
And if we use our talents properly...

803
01:17:57,892 --> 01:18:01,680
...I think there is a power
greater than us that will place...

804
01:18:01,812 --> 01:18:03,928
...the opportunities in our way.

805
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:13,245
When I think of Orville and Wilbur Wright...

806
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:15,886
...standing on a hill
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina...

807
01:18:15,972 --> 01:18:19,965
...tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight...

808
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:23,960
...and then I think of us here today...

809
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:30,888
...I thank God I live in a country...

810
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:34,123
...where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out.

811
01:18:46,812 --> 01:18:50,521
I'd like to second some of the things
Mr. Glenn has said here.

812
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:55,685
I think that we are all very,
very fortunate...

813
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,610
...that we have been,
should we say, "blessed"...

814
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:02,492
...with the talents for something like this.

815
01:19:02,892 --> 01:19:06,726
And I think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed...

816
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:10,801
...if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is...

817
01:19:11,132 --> 01:19:12,565
...for our country...

818
01:19:12,812 --> 01:19:15,246
...and to the world in general right now.

819
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:21,490
One of our Air Force boys.

820
01:19:23,052 --> 01:19:24,644
Don't you agree, Deke?

821
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,923
I absolutely agree with Gordo.

822
01:19:28,492 --> 01:19:30,642
But we're not saying anything new.

823
01:19:31,092 --> 01:19:33,526
We're just saying the same things...

824
01:19:33,612 --> 01:19:37,730
...that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction.

825
01:19:45,892 --> 01:19:48,850
Can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly?

826
01:19:50,172 --> 01:19:52,128
As far as church goes...

827
01:19:53,012 --> 01:19:54,525
...I attend regularly.

828
01:19:58,652 --> 01:20:01,212
Which one of you will be
the first into space?

829
01:20:18,172 --> 01:20:20,242
The best will be first.

830
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:39,125
Share it, brother.

831
01:20:41,092 --> 01:20:42,650
Fucking A, bubba.

832
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:48,092
This is for America's Life magazine.

833
01:20:55,092 --> 01:20:58,448
These are the greatest pilots in America.

834
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:01,650
How much do they make?

835
01:21:02,132 --> 01:21:04,123
$7,000-$8,000 a year?

836
01:21:04,212 --> 01:21:06,407
- Tops.
- At the most.

837
01:21:06,812 --> 01:21:10,361
With this one deal
I'm giving them $500,000...

838
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,881
...split seven ways over three years.

839
01:21:14,052 --> 01:21:15,405
How does that sound?

840
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:21,250
Now I want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories.

841
01:21:21,572 --> 01:21:25,087
These stories will appear in Life
under their own by-lines.

842
01:21:25,772 --> 01:21:26,921
For example...

843
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,572
"...by Betty Grissom..."

844
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:31,406
...or, "by...

845
01:21:31,852 --> 01:21:33,763
"...Virgil I. Grissom."

846
01:21:38,972 --> 01:21:39,961
What was that?

847
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:41,041
Gus.

848
01:21:41,132 --> 01:21:43,885
Nobody calls me by that other name.

849
01:21:44,892 --> 01:21:45,961
Gus?

850
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:48,967
An astronaut named Gus?

851
01:21:52,372 --> 01:21:53,725
What's your middle name?

852
01:21:53,812 --> 01:21:54,801
Ivan.

853
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:01,007
Maybe...

854
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:04,605
..."Gus" isn't so bad.

855
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:06,530
Might be something there.

856
01:22:08,732 --> 01:22:10,962
All right, you can be Gus.

857
01:22:14,812 --> 01:22:18,009
I bet for all that money
they could call you Virgil.

858
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:19,924
They sure could me.

859
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:27,924
Well, what's with her?

860
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:30,651
She seems snobby.

861
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,685
I don't get it.

862
01:22:34,092 --> 01:22:36,970
I get it. She's "Mrs. Clean Marine."

863
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:51,603
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.

864
01:22:54,652 --> 01:22:57,212
I wish to heck it wasn't off-limits to wives.

865
01:22:59,052 --> 01:23:02,010
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests...

866
01:23:03,012 --> 01:23:04,161
...training...

867
01:23:04,252 --> 01:23:05,367
...studying.

868
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:14,962
What about after?

869
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:19,250
After hours I'll run a lot.

870
01:23:19,692 --> 01:23:22,081
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.

871
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,892
There's a beautiful, long beach there.

872
01:23:25,452 --> 01:23:27,124
It's called Cocoa Beach.

873
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:29,845
You can run forever.

874
01:23:31,932 --> 01:23:33,968
Scott Carpenter will run with me.

875
01:23:34,492 --> 01:23:35,891
He's a good guy.

876
01:23:36,732 --> 01:23:38,324
He's real philosophical.

877
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:43,286
What about...?

878
01:23:45,852 --> 01:23:50,323
The others want to get the job done and
keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.

879
01:23:53,172 --> 01:23:54,651
They're good men.

880
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:57,521
Good men.

881
01:23:58,652 --> 01:24:01,212
They'll give 100 percent
when the time comes.

882
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:09,042
Guess they think I'm kind of a...

883
01:24:10,852 --> 01:24:12,410
...gung-ho type.

884
01:24:14,212 --> 01:24:15,611
"Eddie Attaboy."

885
01:24:17,492 --> 01:24:18,925
"Harry Hairshirt."

886
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:23,886
What, you agree?

887
01:24:26,892 --> 01:24:28,007
You agree?

888
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:29,400
My own wife.

889
01:24:31,172 --> 01:24:33,242
Do you think I'm a "Dudley Doright"?

890
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:38,771
That's me, I guess.

891
01:24:39,772 --> 01:24:41,728
A lonely beacon of restraint...

892
01:24:41,812 --> 01:24:44,531
...and self-sacrifice
in a squall of car-crazies.

893
01:24:58,132 --> 01:25:01,647
It's important to America
to get a man up there first.

894
01:25:05,452 --> 01:25:08,046
I plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket.

895
01:27:53,332 --> 01:27:56,369
What is the most important thing
in rocket travel?

896
01:27:56,492 --> 01:27:59,086
To me the most important thing...

897
01:28:00,052 --> 01:28:01,485
...is the blast-off.

898
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:04,647
I always take a blast before I take off.

899
01:28:06,772 --> 01:28:08,763
Otherwise I wouldn't go near it.

900
01:28:16,012 --> 01:28:17,570
He loves Ed Sullivan.

901
01:28:47,332 --> 01:28:49,892
Four down, three to go.

902
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:30,803
I don't want anything to put this program
in a bad light.

903
01:29:31,812 --> 01:29:35,964
We have the opportunity of a lifetime
and I'm sorry, but I won't stand by...

904
01:29:36,052 --> 01:29:39,010
...and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing!

905
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:42,687
You know and I know this could lead
to something very unfortunate.

906
01:29:43,012 --> 01:29:45,970
I'm talking about the playing around
that's going on.

907
01:29:46,372 --> 01:29:48,602
I'm talking about the young girls.

908
01:29:48,852 --> 01:29:50,490
I'm talking about the cookies.

909
01:29:50,572 --> 01:29:53,644
I'm talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry.

910
01:29:53,732 --> 01:29:56,166
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.

911
01:29:56,812 --> 01:30:01,363
I advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group.

912
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:03,847
Each man here has volunteered to do a job.

913
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:06,765
Each man is devoting long hours
of training...

914
01:30:06,852 --> 01:30:09,969
...and doing many things above
and beyond the call of duty...

915
01:30:10,052 --> 01:30:12,043
...such as morale tours of factories...

916
01:30:12,132 --> 01:30:14,123
Such as bringing girls up to your room?

917
01:30:14,212 --> 01:30:16,646
And forgoing any orderly family life.

918
01:30:16,732 --> 01:30:19,565
Mr. Glenn, as long
as a man uses good sense...

919
01:30:19,652 --> 01:30:22,450
...what he does with his wick
is his own business!

920
01:30:23,772 --> 01:30:26,411
I'm from Life magazine.
I'm not with these people.

921
01:30:26,492 --> 01:30:29,564
You can't go in.
They're discussing scientific problems.

922
01:30:33,772 --> 01:30:36,844
John's right. Whether we like it or not
we're public figures.

923
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,526
Whether we deserve it or not,
people look up to us.

924
01:30:39,612 --> 01:30:41,842
We have a tremendous responsibility.

925
01:30:41,932 --> 01:30:44,969
You can't tell a pilot what to do
when he's not flying.

926
01:30:49,852 --> 01:30:51,843
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.

927
01:30:51,932 --> 01:30:53,684
The issue here ain't pussy.

928
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:55,770
The issue here is monkey.

929
01:30:56,052 --> 01:30:59,044
Us. We are the monkey.

930
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:04,856
What Gus is saying is
that we're missing the point.

931
01:31:04,937 --> 01:31:08,976
Gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first.

932
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:12,493
None of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a man's work.

933
01:31:12,577 --> 01:31:14,249
What Gus is saying is that...

934
01:31:14,337 --> 01:31:18,216
...what they're trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkey's work.

935
01:31:18,297 --> 01:31:21,050
Us. A bunch of
college-trained chimpanzees.

936
01:31:21,377 --> 01:31:24,847
What Gus is saying is that
we've got to change things around here.

937
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:26,893
He's saying that we are pilots.

938
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:30,654
We know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else.

939
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:33,377
So what we have to do
is alter the experiment.

940
01:31:33,857 --> 01:31:37,532
It comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on.

941
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,292
What Gus is saying here is
that we've got to stick together on this.

942
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:48,607
These tests were designed...

943
01:32:48,937 --> 01:32:51,497
...to decondition, to desensitize...

944
01:32:51,977 --> 01:32:53,888
...to adapt out fears.

945
01:32:55,097 --> 01:32:58,806
Since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle...

946
01:32:59,497 --> 01:33:01,727
...all we seek from the occupants...

947
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:03,648
...of the capsule is data.

948
01:33:04,297 --> 01:33:06,811
The so-called astronaut...

949
01:33:06,937 --> 01:33:10,054
...would merely be a redundant component.

950
01:33:13,017 --> 01:33:14,245
And here you can see...

951
01:33:14,337 --> 01:33:17,773
...these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men.

952
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:20,293
And they are much more cooperative.

953
01:33:24,297 --> 01:33:27,846
They are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training.

954
01:33:28,057 --> 01:33:31,572
As far as we are concerned,
the question still remains:

955
01:33:31,817 --> 01:33:33,648
Which one will be first?

956
01:33:33,977 --> 01:33:35,330
The man or...

957
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:36,771
...the monkey?

958
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:38,886
We shall see.

959
01:34:09,097 --> 01:34:10,735
Take it easy with that.

960
01:34:18,817 --> 01:34:21,456
- Where are you putting the window?
- Window?

961
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:22,972
There is no window.

962
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,172
No window?

963
01:34:25,497 --> 01:34:27,010
What about the hatch?

964
01:34:28,377 --> 01:34:31,449
We need a hatch with explosive bolts,
that we can open ourselves.

965
01:34:31,537 --> 01:34:33,926
There's something you don't understand.

966
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:36,326
This is the final form of the capsule.

967
01:34:36,497 --> 01:34:37,612
No hatch.

968
01:34:37,777 --> 01:34:40,689
What would happen
if the automatic controls went out?

969
01:34:40,777 --> 01:34:43,814
With backups, checks,
this would not happen.

970
01:34:44,057 --> 01:34:46,412
I said, what would happen if it did?

971
01:34:46,537 --> 01:34:48,175
The pilot would have to fly it back.

972
01:34:48,257 --> 01:34:50,009
This is the way it is.

973
01:34:51,177 --> 01:34:54,294
I wonder how the press will feel about this.

974
01:34:54,377 --> 01:34:57,574
The press? What does the press
have to say about this?

975
01:34:58,857 --> 01:35:02,213
Do you boys know
what makes this bird go up?

976
01:35:02,937 --> 01:35:05,212
Funding makes this bird go up.

977
01:35:05,377 --> 01:35:07,333
That's right. No bucks...

978
01:35:08,297 --> 01:35:09,650
...no Buck Rogers.

979
01:35:09,897 --> 01:35:12,331
And the press over there...

980
01:35:19,697 --> 01:35:21,653
They all want to see Buck Rogers.

981
01:35:21,737 --> 01:35:22,965
And that's us.

982
01:35:23,777 --> 01:35:24,926
Buck Rogers.

983
01:35:25,297 --> 01:35:28,369
You see, those fellows over there
have been making us out...

984
01:35:28,457 --> 01:35:31,574
...as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all America.

985
01:35:32,577 --> 01:35:35,091
If the story would come out in the press...

986
01:35:36,217 --> 01:35:38,572
...that we are not allowed to fly as pilots...

987
01:35:38,657 --> 01:35:40,090
We want a window.

988
01:35:43,297 --> 01:35:45,208
There could maybe be...

989
01:35:45,417 --> 01:35:48,409
...in future capsules a window...

990
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:51,165
...here.

991
01:35:51,337 --> 01:35:54,090
No, that's where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes.

992
01:35:54,177 --> 01:35:56,133
The hatch with the explosive...

993
01:35:59,497 --> 01:36:02,773
There could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule.

994
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:04,848
That is a spacecraft, sir.

995
01:36:05,737 --> 01:36:07,967
We do not refer to it as a "capsule."

996
01:36:10,217 --> 01:36:11,491
Spacecraft.

997
01:36:14,217 --> 01:36:16,526
A hatch with explosive bolts on the...

998
01:36:17,097 --> 01:36:18,371
...spacecraft.

999
01:36:21,217 --> 01:36:24,766
And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant...

1000
01:36:24,857 --> 01:36:25,892
The pilot.

1001
01:36:27,897 --> 01:36:29,296
Astronaut-pilot?

1002
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,811
The astronaut...

1003
01:36:34,857 --> 01:36:35,972
...pilot...

1004
01:36:37,697 --> 01:36:39,050
...to have some...

1005
01:36:39,697 --> 01:36:40,891
...to have...

1006
01:36:44,097 --> 01:36:45,246
...control...

1007
01:36:47,537 --> 01:36:49,448
...of the re-entry procedures.

1008
01:36:54,217 --> 01:36:55,570
We appreciate it.

1009
01:36:55,777 --> 01:36:59,850
You wouldn't mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us, would you?

1010
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:36,090
Which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space?

1011
01:38:11,377 --> 01:38:12,856
Here he is.

1012
01:38:13,457 --> 01:38:15,254
Captain Ham.

1013
01:38:17,177 --> 01:38:19,737
Grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato.

1014
01:38:22,297 --> 01:38:25,926
Does he look like the kind of guy
who'd put doo-doo in the capsule?

1015
01:38:27,097 --> 01:38:28,166
Ham in a can.

1016
01:38:30,497 --> 01:38:32,886
America's first astronaut. Look at him!

1017
01:38:33,897 --> 01:38:38,573
You take a monkey like this,
you can make him into a great astronaut.

1018
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:42,851
I think he's better looking than Crossfield.

1019
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:48,767
How would you like to go up
with this guy as your copilot?

1020
01:39:55,777 --> 01:39:57,574
They've got a man up there. It's Gagarin.

1021
01:39:57,657 --> 01:39:59,056
We know. Sit down.

1022
01:40:33,177 --> 01:40:35,054
All right, give them a break.

1023
01:40:39,937 --> 01:40:42,849
Is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was cancelled?

1024
01:40:42,937 --> 01:40:45,087
Is it true we could've beaten the Russians?

1025
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:48,214
Why didn't we send a man up
instead of a monkey?

1026
01:40:49,817 --> 01:40:51,455
I think we ought to be...

1027
01:40:51,737 --> 01:40:54,774
...forthright, gracious,
and magnanimous and say...

1028
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:57,486
...the Russians beat the pants off us.

1029
01:40:57,737 --> 01:40:59,568
No sense in kidding ourselves about it.

1030
01:40:59,657 --> 01:41:02,694
But the space age has begun,
and there's plenty of work.

1031
01:41:02,777 --> 01:41:04,927
Who will be the second man in space?

1032
01:41:05,817 --> 01:41:09,014
You mean who will be
the first free man into space?

1033
01:41:10,017 --> 01:41:12,292
We know it'll be Glenn. Just tell us when.

1034
01:41:12,577 --> 01:41:13,646
That's a secret.

1035
01:41:14,937 --> 01:41:18,134
I'm tired of being "forthright,
gracious, and magnanimous."

1036
01:41:18,537 --> 01:41:21,176
I'm tired of stupid questions
from the press.

1037
01:41:21,577 --> 01:41:24,455
I'm tired of smocks,
of engineers telling us what we can't do.

1038
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,005
I'm tired of everybody saying
we are not pilots.

1039
01:41:27,097 --> 01:41:28,689
I'm tired of monkeys.

1040
01:41:29,177 --> 01:41:32,374
Most of all, I'm sick and tired
of being second to those...

1041
01:41:33,017 --> 01:41:35,577
...those darned Russians. It's time we...

1042
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:37,176
Got someone up there!

1043
01:41:39,457 --> 01:41:40,412
Fucking A, bubba.

1044
01:41:40,697 --> 01:41:42,016
- Exactly.
- Let's talk to them.

1045
01:41:42,097 --> 01:41:43,849
Let's get this thing on the road.

1046
01:41:43,937 --> 01:41:45,768
I'm tired of messing around.

1047
01:41:46,737 --> 01:41:49,615
We'll just tell 'em we're ready.
We're ready to go.

1048
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:29,049
In these three weeks since the Russian
Gagarin's flight surprised everybody...

1049
01:42:29,217 --> 01:42:31,651
...one wretched event
has followed another.

1050
01:42:31,777 --> 01:42:34,530
People have begun to say
our rockets always blow up...

1051
01:42:34,617 --> 01:42:36,687
...our boys always botch it.

1052
01:42:36,777 --> 01:42:41,851
Some say this is not the time to try
desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.

1053
01:42:42,057 --> 01:42:43,285
The question really is:

1054
01:42:43,377 --> 01:42:46,494
Are we actually ready
to launch a man into space?

1055
01:42:46,697 --> 01:42:50,372
And yet out here at this very moment
sits a rocket, waiting in the night.

1056
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:53,654
Soon, one American astronaut
will climb atop that rocket...

1057
01:42:53,737 --> 01:42:57,332
...in what may be the greatest
death-defying stunt ever broadcast.

1058
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:03,854
The identity of America's first astronaut
has been kept a secret...

1059
01:43:03,937 --> 01:43:05,893
...until almost the final moment.

1060
01:43:05,977 --> 01:43:09,413
The question everyone has asked is:
Which one will be first?

1061
01:44:38,537 --> 01:44:40,050
Not very funny, John.

1062
01:44:42,377 --> 01:44:44,447
But I do appreciate it, John.

1063
01:44:44,937 --> 01:44:46,529
I surely do.

1064
01:44:48,737 --> 01:44:50,807
Vaya con Dios, José.

1065
01:45:00,257 --> 01:45:03,135
Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.

1066
01:45:03,457 --> 01:45:06,051
I didn't quite copy that. Say again, please.

1067
01:45:08,417 --> 01:45:10,373
I said, everything's A-okay.

1068
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:12,892
Well, that's what I thought you said.

1069
01:45:14,217 --> 01:45:16,811
He said everything is A-okay.

1070
01:45:17,777 --> 01:45:21,406
He says everything is A-okay.
And there you have it.

1071
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:33,894
Roger. Auto retro-jettison switch.

1072
01:45:36,057 --> 01:45:38,013
Retro-heater switch... off.

1073
01:45:39,817 --> 01:45:41,728
Retro-heater switch... off.

1074
01:45:42,297 --> 01:45:44,606
Landing-bag switch... auto.

1075
01:45:45,777 --> 01:45:49,167
Roger. Landing-bag switch... auto.

1076
01:45:50,297 --> 01:45:53,016
This is it, ladies. This is for Life magazine.

1077
01:45:56,577 --> 01:45:59,489
My God! They're going
after the diaper-service man.

1078
01:46:06,537 --> 01:46:08,732
We don't have a diaper-service man.

1079
01:46:12,657 --> 01:46:14,170
Oh, Louise, your lawn!

1080
01:46:20,097 --> 01:46:21,450
Why are they here?

1081
01:46:21,577 --> 01:46:22,976
What do they want?

1082
01:46:23,057 --> 01:46:25,776
We are here live at the house
of Louise Shepard...

1083
01:46:25,857 --> 01:46:29,293
...wife of Astronaut Al Shepard,
who is about to go into space.

1084
01:46:34,817 --> 01:46:37,092
Wanted to keep you informed,
Mrs. Shepard.

1085
01:46:37,177 --> 01:46:39,611
Everything's A-okay.
Nothing to worry about.

1086
01:46:39,897 --> 01:46:41,012
Just some delays.

1087
01:46:41,377 --> 01:46:43,129
What kind of delays?

1088
01:46:43,577 --> 01:46:46,296
There's another hold from NASA,
another delay.

1089
01:46:46,617 --> 01:46:49,495
And Alan Shepard sits there
patiently waiting.

1090
01:46:49,817 --> 01:46:52,854
What can be going through
a man's mind at this moment?

1091
01:47:01,497 --> 01:47:02,896
I have to urinate.

1092
01:47:02,977 --> 01:47:04,092
Urinate?

1093
01:47:06,137 --> 01:47:08,571
Urinate? No. We did not think of that.

1094
01:47:08,697 --> 01:47:10,927
This is only a 15-minute flight.

1095
01:47:11,097 --> 01:47:13,167
The man's been up there for hours.

1096
01:47:13,337 --> 01:47:14,895
Could he do it in his suit?

1097
01:47:14,977 --> 01:47:17,537
It might be dangerous.
To introduce liquid...

1098
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:21,485
...into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit...

1099
01:47:21,737 --> 01:47:24,695
...might cause a short circuit.
It could start a fire.

1100
01:47:24,857 --> 01:47:26,449
No. Tell him he cannot.

1101
01:47:30,617 --> 01:47:34,610
Listen, old buddy, they promise
we'll stop at the next gas station.

1102
01:47:35,097 --> 01:47:38,612
Request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then.

1103
01:47:49,497 --> 01:47:52,409
- You sure you just want a little smidgen?
- About a half a cup.

1104
01:47:52,497 --> 01:47:54,488
- And nothing in it?
- That's fine.

1105
01:47:54,617 --> 01:47:55,652
All right.

1106
01:47:57,737 --> 01:48:01,332
Alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work this morning.

1107
01:48:08,217 --> 01:48:10,606
All this waiting is driving me crazy.

1108
01:48:13,977 --> 01:48:15,569
I had a little accident.

1109
01:48:33,337 --> 01:48:35,726
Request permission to relieve bladder.

1110
01:48:45,577 --> 01:48:47,886
Look, the man has got to go.

1111
01:48:49,817 --> 01:48:53,173
It's either that or we get the lug wrench
and pry him out.

1112
01:48:54,457 --> 01:48:55,890
Do it in the suit.

1113
01:49:00,857 --> 01:49:02,893
José, permission granted...

1114
01:49:02,977 --> 01:49:05,172
...to wet your diapers anytime, son.

1115
01:49:17,017 --> 01:49:20,214
Suit thermometer says
Freon flow jumping from 30 to 45.

1116
01:49:20,577 --> 01:49:22,454
Left lower-chest sensor.

1117
01:49:26,777 --> 01:49:28,847
No shortout. Moving up back.

1118
01:49:32,857 --> 01:49:33,892
Well...

1119
01:49:34,377 --> 01:49:35,890
I'm a wetback now.

1120
01:49:38,297 --> 01:49:40,288
It is questionable if we can proceed.

1121
01:49:40,377 --> 01:49:44,689
I'm cooler than you are. Why don't you
fix your problems and light this candle!

1122
01:49:45,017 --> 01:49:47,406
He's right! Let's light this candle!

1123
01:49:47,577 --> 01:49:49,647
He surely is! Light the candle!

1124
01:49:50,977 --> 01:49:52,490
Resume the countdown.

1125
01:50:00,537 --> 01:50:01,890
T minus ten seconds...

1126
01:50:01,977 --> 01:50:04,650
...nine, eight, seven...

1127
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:13,172
Ignition.

1128
01:50:21,337 --> 01:50:23,055
You're on your way, José.

1129
01:50:23,657 --> 01:50:26,251
We have liftoff, and the clock is operating.

1130
01:50:34,897 --> 01:50:38,094
I think we'll be able to talk
to one of the astronaut wives...

1131
01:50:38,177 --> 01:50:40,327
...if not to Louise Shepard herself.

1132
01:51:04,817 --> 01:51:09,254
He has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere
and the g-forces should be building up.

1133
01:51:09,337 --> 01:51:11,532
Louise, he's coming down!

1134
01:51:13,377 --> 01:51:15,527
We almost missed this.

1135
01:51:20,017 --> 01:51:21,132
Eight.

1136
01:51:22,657 --> 01:51:24,090
That's nine.

1137
01:51:25,057 --> 01:51:26,331
I'm okay!

1138
01:52:15,217 --> 01:52:18,129
The Vice President,
who is Chairman of our Space Council...

1139
01:52:18,217 --> 01:52:20,811
...and who bears great responsibilities
in this field...

1140
01:52:20,897 --> 01:52:23,127
...the members of the House and Senate...

1141
01:52:23,217 --> 01:52:26,209
...Space Committee,
who are here today to award you...

1142
01:52:27,697 --> 01:52:30,655
...this decoration,
which has gone from the ground up.

1143
01:52:54,537 --> 01:52:56,129
What was Jackie like?

1144
01:52:57,177 --> 01:52:58,451
She's very nice.

1145
01:52:58,537 --> 01:53:00,687
We talked about all kinds of things.

1146
01:53:00,777 --> 01:53:02,369
My Gus goes up next.

1147
01:53:02,697 --> 01:53:04,767
I can't wait to talk to Jackie after that.

1148
01:53:04,857 --> 01:53:08,054
You'll love her. She's so nice.
We talked about the kids.

1149
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:27,935
Mr. Shepard, sign here.

1150
01:53:32,817 --> 01:53:34,728
I never realized...

1151
01:53:35,377 --> 01:53:39,848
...a gruff, mean son of a bitch like you
could be so popular.

1152
01:53:41,457 --> 01:53:43,687
How'd you get to go up before me?

1153
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:46,087
Even before "Mr. Clean, the Marine."

1154
01:53:46,897 --> 01:53:49,047
Charm, Hot Dog. Pure charm.

1155
01:53:49,937 --> 01:53:51,211
Watch this.

1156
01:53:53,137 --> 01:53:54,968
Hey, sis, how are you doing?

1157
01:53:55,057 --> 01:53:56,729
So-so. How are you doing?

1158
01:53:57,137 --> 01:53:58,650
I ain't doing anymore.

1159
01:53:58,737 --> 01:54:01,774
Damn thing's dragging in the mud,
and I can't get it up.

1160
01:54:02,577 --> 01:54:04,533
Charm, Gus, that's pure charm.

1161
01:54:07,537 --> 01:54:09,368
How'd you like one of these?

1162
01:54:09,937 --> 01:54:12,326
I can get one of those from a dime store.

1163
01:54:12,537 --> 01:54:14,892
Not one that's been in outer space.

1164
01:54:15,537 --> 01:54:17,767
I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.

1165
01:54:18,577 --> 01:54:21,774
Would you like a souvenir
after I get written in history?

1166
01:54:22,057 --> 01:54:24,969
Well, I might, if it's been in outer space.

1167
01:54:25,777 --> 01:54:27,688
See you after outer space.

1168
01:54:38,417 --> 01:54:40,647
You got to think ahead to the future.

1169
01:54:41,297 --> 01:54:44,175
Folks have a taste for things
that have been there.

1170
01:54:46,737 --> 01:54:51,049
I'll give you one of these dimes
I'm taking up so you can play with it...

1171
01:54:52,497 --> 01:54:54,727
...and dream about outer space.

1172
01:54:57,137 --> 01:55:00,493
Why don't you just make sure
you don't screw the pooch?

1173
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:06,408
Oh, God, look at this.

1174
01:55:14,697 --> 01:55:16,050
Go get 'em, Deke!

1175
01:55:26,817 --> 01:55:30,048
Grissom has just reached the apex
of his flight into outer space...

1176
01:55:30,137 --> 01:55:32,526
...and will be coming down
with the valuable data...

1177
01:55:32,617 --> 01:55:35,893
...needed for the future flights
that will actually orbit the Earth.

1178
01:55:35,977 --> 01:55:38,696
He will be re-entering the atmosphere now.

1179
01:56:18,377 --> 01:56:23,007
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hunt Club 1. Over.

1180
01:56:23,657 --> 01:56:26,376
We're in orbit at this time
around the capsule.

1181
01:56:29,577 --> 01:56:31,807
Are you ready to come in and hook on?

1182
01:56:32,937 --> 01:56:35,167
Roger. This is Hunt Club 1...

1183
01:56:35,417 --> 01:56:38,136
...waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on.

1184
01:56:43,417 --> 01:56:47,615
Roger. I've unplugged my suit,
so I'm kind of warm now.

1185
01:56:49,417 --> 01:56:51,169
Hunt Club 1. Roger.

1186
01:56:51,497 --> 01:56:52,771
One, roger.

1187
01:56:53,097 --> 01:56:55,975
Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.

1188
01:56:56,977 --> 01:56:59,969
All right, get ready.
Another 15 feet to the right.

1189
01:57:03,657 --> 01:57:06,125
If you're ready for me to blow the hatch...

1190
01:57:06,857 --> 01:57:08,768
...I'll take my helmet off.

1191
01:57:10,377 --> 01:57:11,935
Say again, Liberty Bell.

1192
01:57:12,017 --> 01:57:14,326
Waiting for your okay to hook on.

1193
01:57:18,217 --> 01:57:19,809
Who designed this?

1194
01:57:21,097 --> 01:57:23,657
Say again, Liberty Bell. We can't hear you.

1195
01:57:23,817 --> 01:57:25,250
I can't get it off.

1196
01:57:27,897 --> 01:57:30,172
Liberty Bell, say again.

1197
01:57:30,337 --> 01:57:32,805
This is Hunt Club 1, waiting for your okay.

1198
01:57:39,937 --> 01:57:41,131
What happened?

1199
01:57:43,817 --> 01:57:46,854
It's all right. He's okay.
Go for the capsule.

1200
01:57:47,177 --> 01:57:48,769
Help, I'm sinking!

1201
01:57:50,137 --> 01:57:52,697
Get the capsule. He can float in that suit.

1202
01:57:56,617 --> 01:57:58,608
We need the data in the capsule.

1203
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,449
Throw down a line!

1204
01:58:10,257 --> 01:58:12,771
Help! Throw down the line!

1205
01:58:15,577 --> 01:58:17,169
Hey, I'm sinking!

1206
01:58:17,497 --> 01:58:19,249
Forget the fucking capsule!

1207
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:25,647
We can't pull it. It's full of water.

1208
01:58:26,457 --> 01:58:29,017
Hey! Help me over here!

1209
01:58:35,017 --> 01:58:36,166
We've lost it!

1210
01:58:36,257 --> 01:58:37,656
Blow the cable!

1211
01:58:41,857 --> 01:58:43,495
Come back here, damn it!

1212
01:58:53,857 --> 01:58:55,609
Throw a line down.

1213
01:59:50,737 --> 01:59:52,250
I didn't do anything.

1214
01:59:53,377 --> 01:59:55,015
I was just lying there.

1215
01:59:55,777 --> 01:59:57,051
It just blew.

1216
02:00:00,777 --> 02:00:02,415
The hatch just blew.

1217
02:00:14,497 --> 02:00:17,216
It must have been a technical malfunction.

1218
02:00:18,657 --> 02:00:20,887
The capsule was rocking around a bit.

1219
02:00:21,217 --> 02:00:25,369
There were no loose items. I don't see
how I could have hit that button.

1220
02:00:26,897 --> 02:00:29,365
I was just lying there, flat on my back...

1221
02:00:29,537 --> 02:00:30,970
...and it just blew.

1222
02:00:43,377 --> 02:00:45,607
Well, what do you think?

1223
02:00:48,977 --> 02:00:52,492
Explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for ten years.

1224
02:00:52,977 --> 02:00:55,366
The things have been wrung inside out...

1225
02:00:55,617 --> 02:00:59,610
...subjected to trial by heat,
by water, by shaking, pounding.

1226
02:01:00,137 --> 02:01:04,892
We even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete...

1227
02:01:05,857 --> 02:01:09,372
...and not one of them
has ever "just blown."

1228
02:02:18,777 --> 02:02:21,007
Are we going to the White House?

1229
02:02:23,457 --> 02:02:25,368
Isn't the President coming?

1230
02:02:30,977 --> 02:02:33,207
No ticker-tape parade in New York?

1231
02:02:35,617 --> 02:02:38,006
Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?

1232
02:02:43,577 --> 02:02:44,851
No Jackie?

1233
02:02:53,777 --> 02:02:56,689
By order of the President
of the United States...

1234
02:02:57,657 --> 02:03:00,046
...the Distinguished Service Medal...

1235
02:03:00,657 --> 02:03:04,332
...is awarded to Captain Virgil I. Grissom...

1236
02:03:06,257 --> 02:03:10,728
...who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty.

1237
02:03:12,057 --> 02:03:13,456
These actions...

1238
02:03:14,177 --> 02:03:16,452
...reflect great credit upon himself...

1239
02:03:17,177 --> 02:03:18,769
...the Air Force...

1240
02:03:19,817 --> 02:03:22,536
...and the United States of America.

1241
02:03:34,937 --> 02:03:36,211
You proud, boys?

1242
02:03:46,537 --> 02:03:49,609
Hey, look. They filled up the refrigerator.

1243
02:03:52,457 --> 02:03:53,810
Pretty good, huh?

1244
02:03:54,897 --> 02:03:56,012
Pretty good.

1245
02:03:56,617 --> 02:03:58,209
A full refrigerator!

1246
02:03:59,697 --> 02:04:02,336
I can see this afternoon
is shaping up just great!

1247
02:04:02,737 --> 02:04:05,205
And the rest of the day. Tomorrow, too!

1248
02:04:05,937 --> 02:04:08,326
What do they want me to do in here?

1249
02:04:08,857 --> 02:04:09,926
Cook?

1250
02:04:11,137 --> 02:04:13,526
Then risk my life and my kids'...

1251
02:04:13,617 --> 02:04:17,405
...by dragging them across that highway
to the worst beach in Florida!

1252
02:04:18,257 --> 02:04:21,010
Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat
in the White House.

1253
02:04:22,137 --> 02:04:24,367
I wanted to talk to Jackie about...

1254
02:04:25,897 --> 02:04:27,046
...things.

1255
02:04:28,737 --> 02:04:32,093
Well, look, I've got to go
to the Holiday Inn for some...

1256
02:04:33,017 --> 02:04:34,735
...beer call with the guys.

1257
02:04:39,137 --> 02:04:41,446
All those years of test flying...

1258
02:04:42,497 --> 02:04:46,410
...and all those times I waited
and all those times you weren't there!

1259
02:04:48,097 --> 02:04:49,928
The military promised...

1260
02:04:50,497 --> 02:04:54,376
...and now they are welshing
on that damn compact.

1261
02:04:55,377 --> 02:04:57,937
Look, I am finally
"Mrs. Honorable Astronaut."

1262
02:04:58,377 --> 02:05:00,493
But they are treating me like I'm...

1263
02:05:02,257 --> 02:05:04,646
...Honorable
"Mrs. Squirming Hatch Blower!"

1264
02:05:04,817 --> 02:05:06,569
I didn't do anything wrong!

1265
02:05:06,897 --> 02:05:11,368
The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!
It was a technical malfunction!

1266
02:05:11,697 --> 02:05:13,927
Why in hell won't anyone believe me?

1267
02:05:20,497 --> 02:05:22,089
I know that.

1268
02:05:27,377 --> 02:05:30,175
Gus, I mean are these the goodies?

1269
02:05:31,697 --> 02:05:34,006
Is this how the military pays off?

1270
02:05:39,057 --> 02:05:41,776
Oh, Gus, they owe you.

1271
02:05:44,697 --> 02:05:46,255
But they owe me, too.

1272
02:05:47,657 --> 02:05:48,976
They owe me.

1273
02:05:49,857 --> 02:05:52,325
They owe me, they owe me so much!

1274
02:06:32,657 --> 02:06:33,931
I love you.

1275
02:06:37,457 --> 02:06:41,575
We are here with Virgil I. Grissom
and his lovely wife, Betty.

1276
02:06:42,857 --> 02:06:45,417
Gus has just come back
from the second trip in space.

1277
02:06:45,497 --> 02:06:47,772
Betty, how do you feel about this trip?

1278
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:49,609
I'm so proud of him.

1279
02:06:49,937 --> 02:06:51,575
I think he was wonderful.

1280
02:06:51,697 --> 02:06:53,767
We're all proud of Gus Grissom.

1281
02:06:53,937 --> 02:06:56,974
Gus, how do you feel about the trip?
Was it a success?

1282
02:06:57,297 --> 02:06:58,889
It was A-okay.

1283
02:07:01,417 --> 02:07:04,534
My God. He lost his capsule
but he's keeping his story.

1284
02:07:04,657 --> 02:07:06,773
To recap yesterday's dramatic events...

1285
02:07:07,057 --> 02:07:09,855
...here we see America's
newest hero, Gus Grissom.

1286
02:07:09,937 --> 02:07:12,371
He is shouting to save the capsule first.

1287
02:07:13,617 --> 02:07:16,609
Pull that in flight test, it's all over for him.

1288
02:07:17,977 --> 02:07:20,935
He screwed the pooch, partner.
Plain and simple.

1289
02:07:21,497 --> 02:07:24,409
Sometimes you get a pooch
that can't be screwed.

1290
02:07:26,497 --> 02:07:29,295
The President's got his own problems
with the Bay of Pigs.

1291
02:07:29,377 --> 02:07:31,572
He doesn't want
the astronauts' image tarnished.

1292
02:07:31,657 --> 02:07:34,490
Nothing these guys do
is going to be called a failure.

1293
02:07:34,577 --> 02:07:36,374
These astronauts are our Davids.

1294
02:07:36,457 --> 02:07:40,450
You think the public would know they're
just doing what monkeys have done.

1295
02:07:44,097 --> 02:07:47,806
You think a monkey knows he's sitting
on a rocket that might explode?

1296
02:07:48,897 --> 02:07:51,013
These astronauts know that.

1297
02:07:53,017 --> 02:07:54,609
I'll tell you something.

1298
02:07:55,177 --> 02:07:58,055
It takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission.

1299
02:07:58,137 --> 02:07:59,855
Especially when it's on TV.

1300
02:08:03,977 --> 02:08:05,888
Old Gus, he did all right.

1301
02:08:06,297 --> 02:08:08,367
Though the capsule was lost,
our new hero...

1302
02:08:08,457 --> 02:08:10,607
...Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.

1303
02:08:11,337 --> 02:08:15,330
Now President Kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program.

1304
02:08:15,657 --> 02:08:17,568
Those who came before us...

1305
02:08:18,097 --> 02:08:19,849
...made certain this country...

1306
02:08:19,937 --> 02:08:23,293
...rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution...

1307
02:08:24,297 --> 02:08:26,811
...the first waves of modern invention...

1308
02:08:26,897 --> 02:08:29,206
...and the first wave of nuclear power.

1309
02:08:29,297 --> 02:08:32,175
And this generation does not intend...

1310
02:08:32,697 --> 02:08:34,688
...to founder in the backwash...

1311
02:08:34,977 --> 02:08:38,333
...of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it.

1312
02:08:38,697 --> 02:08:40,130
We mean to lead it.

1313
02:10:32,977 --> 02:10:35,207
You know, I always hated flying.

1314
02:10:37,977 --> 02:10:42,050
When I met you, you were already a pilot,
so I never had a complaint coming.

1315
02:10:43,377 --> 02:10:46,335
When you went up in those planes,
me and the kids...

1316
02:10:51,497 --> 02:10:54,807
We never had any insurance
except a couple months' pay.

1317
02:10:57,057 --> 02:10:59,651
I always hated all that talk
about insurance.

1318
02:11:01,417 --> 02:11:04,727
The government spends
all kinds of time and money...

1319
02:11:04,817 --> 02:11:07,377
...teaching pilots how to be fearless.

1320
02:11:10,017 --> 02:11:13,089
But they don't spend a penny
teaching you how to be...

1321
02:11:13,897 --> 02:11:16,127
...the fearless wife of a test pilot.

1322
02:11:20,937 --> 02:11:22,689
But I guess I liked it.

1323
02:11:28,937 --> 02:11:31,451
I guess I liked the kind of man who could...

1324
02:11:32,457 --> 02:11:34,607
...push the outside of the envelope.

1325
02:11:37,257 --> 02:11:38,372
Flyboy.

1326
02:11:41,417 --> 02:11:45,888
But I never could stand a man
who was one of those "remember-whens."

1327
02:11:46,537 --> 02:11:50,576
Those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times.

1328
02:11:57,257 --> 02:11:59,088
If I ever see that happen...

1329
02:12:02,857 --> 02:12:05,087
...I'm going right out the front door.

1330
02:12:09,297 --> 02:12:11,015
And you'll never catch me.

1331
02:12:12,617 --> 02:12:15,495
I'm a fearless man,
but I'm scared to death of you.

1332
02:12:15,817 --> 02:12:17,409
No, you're not.

1333
02:12:18,777 --> 02:12:20,256
But you ought to be.

1334
02:12:41,497 --> 02:12:42,771
What is it?

1335
02:12:44,297 --> 02:12:46,253
The Russians have sent Titov up.

1336
02:12:46,377 --> 02:12:47,492
Titov's up.

1337
02:12:48,097 --> 02:12:49,007
How long?

1338
02:12:49,097 --> 02:12:50,052
A day.

1339
02:12:50,377 --> 02:12:52,607
A day? A whole day?

1340
02:12:52,777 --> 02:12:55,166
He's orbiting over our country right now.

1341
02:12:56,017 --> 02:12:58,372
We need a man in orbit or it's all over.

1342
02:12:58,697 --> 02:13:01,655
We're scrapping the Redstone
and going with the Atlas.

1343
02:13:01,737 --> 02:13:03,409
You know what that means.

1344
02:13:03,777 --> 02:13:06,337
We haven't had too much luck
with that rocket.

1345
02:13:06,657 --> 02:13:09,217
We can't take all the precautions we'd like.

1346
02:13:09,617 --> 02:13:11,335
- It'll be dangerous.
- We're ready.

1347
02:13:11,417 --> 02:13:13,089
I said it'll be dangerous.

1348
02:13:13,177 --> 02:13:15,566
I said we're ready. 100 percent.

1349
02:13:29,097 --> 02:13:32,931
Inside this trim,
modest suburban home is Annie Glenn...

1350
02:13:33,257 --> 02:13:35,293
...wife of Astronaut John Glenn...

1351
02:13:35,577 --> 02:13:39,775
...sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment...

1352
02:13:40,177 --> 02:13:43,965
...but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand.

1353
02:13:50,537 --> 02:13:53,734
The Vice President would like
to see Mrs. Glenn.

1354
02:13:54,217 --> 02:13:55,935
He's asking for you again.

1355
02:13:56,937 --> 02:13:58,529
Tell them no.

1356
02:13:59,177 --> 02:14:01,088
I'm sorry, she says no.

1357
02:14:01,217 --> 02:14:03,208
You don't understand. It is very important.

1358
02:14:03,297 --> 02:14:05,253
The Vice President must see her.

1359
02:14:07,817 --> 02:14:10,206
We are told after the mission's success...

1360
02:14:10,297 --> 02:14:13,733
...the Vice President will come here
and speak with Annie Glenn.

1361
02:14:14,217 --> 02:14:17,368
Meanwhile, John Glenn waits
for the weather to clear...

1362
02:14:17,457 --> 02:14:20,017
...so he can undertake this historic mission.

1363
02:14:20,537 --> 02:14:22,528
You know what the Russians want?

1364
02:14:25,017 --> 02:14:27,656
They want our peckers in their pockets.

1365
02:14:31,137 --> 02:14:32,536
She still says no.

1366
02:14:34,177 --> 02:14:37,692
Didn't you tell her I'll bring in ABC-TV...

1367
02:14:38,177 --> 02:14:40,816
...NBC-TV, CBS-TV?

1368
02:14:41,817 --> 02:14:45,014
Her words, and mine,
will be heard by millions.

1369
02:14:54,537 --> 02:14:56,050
Where are they going?

1370
02:14:58,097 --> 02:15:00,053
I think the flight's been cancelled.

1371
02:15:00,137 --> 02:15:01,331
Cancelled?

1372
02:15:04,097 --> 02:15:05,576
That's perfect.

1373
02:15:05,897 --> 02:15:09,572
I will go in and console her
on nationwide TV.

1374
02:15:10,697 --> 02:15:12,608
I'll pay her a sympathy call.

1375
02:15:40,137 --> 02:15:44,096
The Vice President would like to make
a sympathy call if he could.

1376
02:15:47,497 --> 02:15:49,931
- No? What do you mean, "No"?
- I mean, "No."

1377
02:15:50,377 --> 02:15:52,447
What do you mean, "No"?

1378
02:15:52,777 --> 02:15:54,813
Somebody get NASA on the line.

1379
02:15:54,977 --> 02:15:59,016
I'm going to lean on NASA.
I'm going right to the top!

1380
02:16:00,217 --> 02:16:01,809
- To the top.
- Damn right!

1381
02:16:02,217 --> 02:16:04,731
They better tell her to play ball!

1382
02:16:13,257 --> 02:16:15,088
There's a problem with your wife.

1383
02:16:15,177 --> 02:16:16,929
- Is it serious?
- We think it is.

1384
02:16:17,017 --> 02:16:19,531
There's a phone hook-up,
we've got her on it.

1385
02:16:27,937 --> 02:16:30,053
It's me. Are you all right?

1386
02:16:30,137 --> 02:16:31,411
What's wrong?

1387
02:16:31,817 --> 02:16:33,409
Johnson...

1388
02:16:35,497 --> 02:16:37,089
...wants... me...

1389
02:16:40,777 --> 02:16:42,927
...on T... V.

1390
02:16:43,297 --> 02:16:44,525
The Vice President?

1391
02:16:44,617 --> 02:16:46,892
Tell her to let him in with the networks.

1392
02:16:46,977 --> 02:16:48,296
It's coverage.

1393
02:16:52,617 --> 02:16:54,175
It's important, John.

1394
02:16:54,737 --> 02:16:55,965
It means a lot.

1395
02:17:01,777 --> 02:17:02,926
Listen to me.

1396
02:17:05,177 --> 02:17:07,486
If you don't want the Vice President...

1397
02:17:07,857 --> 02:17:11,088
...or the networks,
or anyone else in our house, that's it!

1398
02:17:11,537 --> 02:17:14,256
As far as I'm concerned,
they are not coming in!

1399
02:17:14,337 --> 02:17:17,568
And I will back you up 100 percent,
and you tell them that!

1400
02:17:19,417 --> 02:17:23,330
I don't want Johnson or the others
to even put a toe in our house.

1401
02:17:29,817 --> 02:17:34,049
You tell them that Astronaut John Glenn
told you to say that.

1402
02:17:42,297 --> 02:17:44,049
I'll talk to you soon.

1403
02:17:49,497 --> 02:17:50,850
You can't do that!

1404
02:17:50,937 --> 02:17:52,768
The Vice President's head of the program!

1405
02:17:52,897 --> 02:17:54,615
You must think of the program!

1406
02:17:54,697 --> 02:17:55,971
You are out of line!

1407
02:17:56,097 --> 02:17:58,088
- I'm out of line?
- Yes, sir!

1408
02:17:59,257 --> 02:18:00,485
I run the show here.

1409
02:18:00,577 --> 02:18:02,215
We'll see about that!

1410
02:18:02,617 --> 02:18:05,973
And I'm thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments!

1411
02:18:06,777 --> 02:18:08,130
Who will you get?

1412
02:18:08,377 --> 02:18:10,288
You heard what he said.

1413
02:18:15,697 --> 02:18:17,289
Take it easy, fellows.

1414
02:18:17,657 --> 02:18:19,090
Step aside, pal.

1415
02:18:30,617 --> 02:18:31,891
Pilots!

1416
02:18:35,177 --> 02:18:37,088
Pansies! Cows!

1417
02:18:39,737 --> 02:18:41,170
Gladiolas!

1418
02:18:41,497 --> 02:18:45,206
Isn't there anybody
who can deal with a housewife?

1419
02:19:10,297 --> 02:19:12,936
Waltzing Matilda,
I thought Hank Williams wrote it.

1420
02:19:13,017 --> 02:19:14,848
We don't know who wrote it.

1421
02:19:14,937 --> 02:19:16,575
It's Australian, right?

1422
02:19:25,017 --> 02:19:26,609
Who are you guys?

1423
02:19:29,937 --> 02:19:31,290
We're aborigines.

1424
02:19:36,697 --> 02:19:37,732
Who are you?

1425
02:19:37,817 --> 02:19:38,806
Me?

1426
02:19:41,257 --> 02:19:42,610
I'm an astronaut.

1427
02:19:46,457 --> 02:19:49,017
Well, what do you do here, Astronaut?

1428
02:19:49,617 --> 02:19:53,610
I'm here because a buddy of mine
is getting ready to...

1429
02:19:54,297 --> 02:19:56,857
...fly overhead. Up in outer space.

1430
02:19:57,337 --> 02:19:59,897
And I'll be talking to him on that dish.

1431
02:20:00,937 --> 02:20:02,052
Fly over?

1432
02:20:02,857 --> 02:20:04,449
You blokes do that, too?

1433
02:20:05,297 --> 02:20:06,935
You do that yourself?

1434
02:20:07,377 --> 02:20:09,333
Not me, mate.

1435
02:20:10,057 --> 02:20:11,695
See that old bloke there?

1436
02:20:13,257 --> 02:20:14,212
He know.

1437
02:20:14,457 --> 02:20:15,890
He know the moon.

1438
02:20:16,697 --> 02:20:18,130
He know the star.

1439
02:20:19,137 --> 02:20:21,014
And he know the Milky Way.

1440
02:20:21,497 --> 02:20:23,294
He'll give you a hand.

1441
02:20:24,377 --> 02:20:25,492
He know.

1442
02:20:29,497 --> 02:20:32,216
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

1443
02:21:01,017 --> 02:21:03,577
Stand by for final ten-second count.

1444
02:22:02,617 --> 02:22:04,369
The clock is operating.

1445
02:22:05,297 --> 02:22:07,049
We're underway!

1446
02:22:12,057 --> 02:22:15,732
Good Lord, ride all the way.
Godspeed, John Glenn.

1447
02:23:27,417 --> 02:23:29,806
Zero-g, and I feel fine.

1448
02:23:31,577 --> 02:23:33,807
The capsule is turning around.

1449
02:23:37,177 --> 02:23:39,088
The view is tremendous!

1450
02:23:39,297 --> 02:23:43,529
I can see clear back,
a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.

1451
02:23:43,617 --> 02:23:45,414
It's a beautiful sight!

1452
02:23:45,817 --> 02:23:50,095
Roger, Friendship 7.
You have a go, at least seven orbits.

1453
02:23:54,457 --> 02:23:57,415
Roger, Al. Understand,
go at least seven orbits.

1454
02:23:57,497 --> 02:23:59,089
This is Friendship 7.

1455
02:24:24,257 --> 02:24:27,613
Speed is 17,500 miles per hour...

1456
02:24:35,417 --> 02:24:37,647
...and we're moving into night.

1457
02:24:57,737 --> 02:24:59,489
Full moon rising.

1458
02:25:03,417 --> 02:25:05,169
I can almost touch it.

1459
02:25:20,057 --> 02:25:22,776
Friendship 7, come in. Do you read?

1460
02:25:26,257 --> 02:25:28,134
Friendship 7, come in, please.

1461
02:25:28,537 --> 02:25:30,255
This sure was a short day.

1462
02:25:30,417 --> 02:25:32,055
Say again, please. Over.

1463
02:25:32,537 --> 02:25:35,097
That was the shortest day I've run into.

1464
02:25:35,577 --> 02:25:37,488
Kind of passes rapidly, huh?

1465
02:25:41,577 --> 02:25:44,614
I can see some lights down there
in Australia, Gordo.

1466
02:25:45,297 --> 02:25:46,776
Where are they from?

1467
02:25:47,097 --> 02:25:51,170
All of Perth and Rockingham
have turned their lights on for you.

1468
02:25:52,497 --> 02:25:55,614
And we have a few other lights turned on,
here and there.

1469
02:26:00,857 --> 02:26:02,575
They show up very well.

1470
02:26:03,137 --> 02:26:05,856
Thank everybody for turning them on,
will you?

1471
02:26:06,297 --> 02:26:09,016
We sure will, John. We sure will.

1472
02:26:25,337 --> 02:26:27,089
Heading towards daybreak.

1473
02:27:04,737 --> 02:27:06,932
Lot of cloud coverage today.

1474
02:27:14,377 --> 02:27:16,049
Man, it's beautiful.

1475
02:27:30,617 --> 02:27:32,528
Possibly it's the heat shield.

1476
02:27:32,857 --> 02:27:33,972
It's loose.

1477
02:27:36,617 --> 02:27:37,891
If it comes off...

1478
02:27:37,977 --> 02:27:40,537
If the heat shield comes off, he'll burn up.

1479
02:27:41,497 --> 02:27:43,567
He'll fry when he tries to re-enter.

1480
02:27:57,977 --> 02:27:59,569
Muchea, this is Cape.

1481
02:28:00,537 --> 02:28:02,289
We're showing some trouble.

1482
02:28:02,497 --> 02:28:05,569
We've got a warning light.
Possibly a loose heat shield.

1483
02:28:05,697 --> 02:28:07,927
Check your status lights immediately.

1484
02:28:26,177 --> 02:28:27,576
He's coming.

1485
02:28:29,417 --> 02:28:30,930
John, can you hear me?

1486
02:28:33,337 --> 02:28:35,248
Friendship 7, come in, please.

1487
02:28:35,537 --> 02:28:37,175
Try something. Anything.

1488
02:28:37,257 --> 02:28:38,531
Friendship 7, come in.

1489
02:29:11,977 --> 02:29:15,492
This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?

1490
02:29:17,137 --> 02:29:18,570
Wait a second.

1491
02:29:20,137 --> 02:29:22,367
I see something strange out here.

1492
02:29:22,537 --> 02:29:25,734
Oh! My goodness, what the heck is that?

1493
02:29:26,697 --> 02:29:29,734
Sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky!

1494
02:29:30,057 --> 02:29:33,094
Hey, let me tell you what I'm in up here.

1495
02:29:33,417 --> 02:29:35,806
I'm in a mass of very small particles...

1496
02:29:36,017 --> 02:29:39,168
...that are brilliantly lit up.
Like they're luminescent.

1497
02:29:39,337 --> 02:29:41,248
I never saw anything like it.

1498
02:29:41,737 --> 02:29:43,693
A shower of them coming by me now.

1499
02:29:43,777 --> 02:29:46,769
They're bright yellow.
They swirl around the capsule...

1500
02:29:46,857 --> 02:29:49,576
...and they're brilliantly lighted.

1501
02:29:50,537 --> 02:29:53,256
Do you think they could be alive?

1502
02:29:55,457 --> 02:29:59,006
It sounds ridiculous,
but they look like fireflies or something.

1503
02:30:02,137 --> 02:30:05,095
Maybe some Air Force experiment
went amuck.

1504
02:30:05,417 --> 02:30:07,647
Could our astronomers have been wrong?

1505
02:30:07,977 --> 02:30:10,855
Hello, Capcom, do you read me?
This is miraculous!

1506
02:30:11,697 --> 02:30:14,848
Could it be those fireflies,
or whatever they are?

1507
02:30:15,337 --> 02:30:17,248
Of course not. Fireflies?

1508
02:30:19,777 --> 02:30:21,415
Roger, Friendship 7.

1509
02:30:23,017 --> 02:30:26,214
Will you correlate the actions
of the surrounding particles...

1510
02:30:26,297 --> 02:30:28,367
...with that of your control jets?

1511
02:30:29,937 --> 02:30:31,336
Negative.

1512
02:30:31,977 --> 02:30:35,333
I do not think they were coming
from my control jets.

1513
02:30:36,457 --> 02:30:38,368
I'll tell you what I'll try to do.

1514
02:30:38,457 --> 02:30:41,176
I'll try to get some pictures
of these little guys.

1515
02:30:41,257 --> 02:30:42,849
Sounds like a good idea.

1516
02:30:43,297 --> 02:30:45,606
You guys probably think I'm nuts.

1517
02:30:46,737 --> 02:30:48,455
They're very beautiful.

1518
02:30:48,937 --> 02:30:50,893
Look like fireflies on a summer night.

1519
02:30:50,977 --> 02:30:52,695
They just dance around.

1520
02:31:28,857 --> 02:31:30,210
Get out of here!

1521
02:31:32,857 --> 02:31:34,848
Get out of here, you gadgets!

1522
02:31:37,377 --> 02:31:39,766
Heading into daybreak now. Another day.

1523
02:31:39,977 --> 02:31:41,888
Leaving the fireflies behind.

1524
02:31:42,137 --> 02:31:44,128
I have no idea what they were.

1525
02:31:45,257 --> 02:31:46,849
This is Friendship 7.

1526
02:31:47,897 --> 02:31:50,457
That was some night.
That was really exciting.

1527
02:31:50,617 --> 02:31:52,096
He's going into his third orbit.

1528
02:31:52,177 --> 02:31:55,169
How much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark?

1529
02:31:55,617 --> 02:31:56,845
What do we tell him?

1530
02:31:56,937 --> 02:31:59,895
He's a pilot.
Tell him the condition of his craft.

1531
02:32:05,457 --> 02:32:07,015
Glenn is in his third orbit...

1532
02:32:07,097 --> 02:32:09,736
...and the flight is going
pretty much as planned.

1533
02:32:10,057 --> 02:32:11,376
No human individual...

1534
02:32:11,457 --> 02:32:13,891
...has ever been so well prepared.

1535
02:32:14,337 --> 02:32:17,852
So far the key word
on this textbook flight is "operational."

1536
02:32:17,977 --> 02:32:19,649
Everything is A-okay.

1537
02:32:21,617 --> 02:32:24,450
We haven't been too lucky
with the Atlas rocket.

1538
02:32:24,617 --> 02:32:28,087
Some say we haven't taken all
the safety precautions we'd like to.

1539
02:32:28,177 --> 02:32:29,326
Is this true?

1540
02:32:29,417 --> 02:32:31,135
No, it's absolutely not true.

1541
02:32:31,657 --> 02:32:34,217
The only critical point is the re-entry.

1542
02:32:34,657 --> 02:32:37,376
If the capsule is not at the correct angle...

1543
02:32:37,457 --> 02:32:41,086
...with the blunt end and heat shield down,
it will burn up.

1544
02:32:41,417 --> 02:32:43,169
There is only one hope.

1545
02:32:43,537 --> 02:32:46,210
It might be possible to leave
the retro-rocket package...

1546
02:32:46,297 --> 02:32:48,208
...which covers the heat shield, on.

1547
02:32:48,697 --> 02:32:53,293
The straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place.

1548
02:32:53,977 --> 02:32:55,729
But if this fails...

1549
02:32:57,337 --> 02:33:00,374
John, you're going to
fly-by-wire for re-entry.

1550
02:33:01,257 --> 02:33:04,772
We recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle. Over.

1551
02:33:05,537 --> 02:33:07,448
Re-entry only three orbits?

1552
02:33:07,777 --> 02:33:09,256
That is correct.

1553
02:33:09,337 --> 02:33:11,487
Do you have a reason for this?

1554
02:33:11,777 --> 02:33:15,087
Not at this time.
This is the judgement of Cape Flight.

1555
02:33:19,017 --> 02:33:22,214
Do you have a time for going
to jettison retro? Over.

1556
02:33:24,617 --> 02:33:27,495
We are not sure your landing bag
is deployed.

1557
02:33:28,137 --> 02:33:31,607
We feel it is possible to re-enter
with the retropackage on.

1558
02:33:31,897 --> 02:33:35,287
We see no difficulty at this time
with that type of re-entry.

1559
02:33:35,377 --> 02:33:36,776
Do you read?

1560
02:33:37,617 --> 02:33:38,845
Roger.

1561
02:33:40,137 --> 02:33:41,570
Understand.

1562
02:33:42,857 --> 02:33:46,532
I'll start lining up as carefully as I can
in a minute.

1563
02:33:46,937 --> 02:33:51,567
See whether scanners will pick up
and correct it for good retro-fire attitude.

1564
02:33:52,417 --> 02:33:53,532
If not...

1565
02:33:54,217 --> 02:33:56,128
...I'll correct it myself.

1566
02:34:08,097 --> 02:34:09,576
We're lined up.

1567
02:34:10,497 --> 02:34:11,816
Here we go.

1568
02:34:48,937 --> 02:34:50,529
What's that sound?

1569
02:34:50,817 --> 02:34:52,296
Humming. It's him.

1570
02:34:52,377 --> 02:34:54,288
It's all right. He does that.

1571
02:36:00,417 --> 02:36:01,770
He can't hear you.

1572
02:36:02,017 --> 02:36:04,133
He's hit the ionization blackout.

1573
02:36:05,057 --> 02:36:08,015
No communications are possible
for a few minutes.

1574
02:36:10,617 --> 02:36:12,096
Then we'll know.

1575
02:36:21,057 --> 02:36:23,617
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

1576
02:36:30,497 --> 02:36:32,567
This is Cape. Do you read?

1577
02:36:37,057 --> 02:36:40,413
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

1578
02:36:40,817 --> 02:36:44,526
Automatic systems are not functioning.
He's in fly-by-wire...

1579
02:37:45,137 --> 02:37:46,650
Finally showed up.

1580
02:37:47,097 --> 02:37:49,292
The one with the big engine.

1581
02:37:50,937 --> 02:37:53,849
Boy, if we'd only had
one of those a few years back.

1582
02:37:55,017 --> 02:37:59,169
The bad news is the entire program's
probably going to be scrapped.

1583
02:38:00,217 --> 02:38:03,926
From now on, the astronaut boys
in Houston have got the only ticket.

1584
02:38:04,737 --> 02:38:08,252
Barring, of course, some unforeseen event.

1585
02:38:29,097 --> 02:38:32,169
The Russians set a new record
of 114,000 feet...

1586
02:38:32,257 --> 02:38:34,213
...going straight off the ground.

1587
02:38:34,297 --> 02:38:36,891
Nobody cares about
that kind of record anymore.

1588
02:38:37,577 --> 02:38:40,569
All they want now
is capsules up in outer space.

1589
02:38:43,617 --> 02:38:47,610
I get a feeling this plane might be able
to beat that Russian record.

1590
02:38:50,417 --> 02:38:51,930
You might be right.

1591
02:39:37,777 --> 02:39:39,608
And here they come!

1592
02:39:48,977 --> 02:39:51,889
Looky here what I brought you!

1593
02:40:33,697 --> 02:40:34,971
Smile, hon.

1594
02:40:35,937 --> 02:40:37,689
My fellow citizens...

1595
02:40:40,257 --> 02:40:44,330
...America's Mercury astronauts!

1596
02:40:55,577 --> 02:40:58,455
Welcome to Houston, your new home.

1597
02:40:58,777 --> 02:41:03,328
Your neighbors here and I,
we'd like to give you this little barbecue...

1598
02:41:05,777 --> 02:41:07,256
...Texas style!

1599
02:41:48,897 --> 02:41:53,129
Since you're relocating here,
to show appreciation for all you've done...

1600
02:41:53,497 --> 02:41:56,216
...Mr. Sharp is contributing the land...

1601
02:41:56,297 --> 02:41:58,288
...the contractors the homes...

1602
02:41:58,417 --> 02:42:01,250
...and department stores, the furnishings.

1603
02:42:03,577 --> 02:42:04,930
Which one are you?

1604
02:42:07,937 --> 02:42:10,451
Which one's Glenn? I want to meet him.

1605
02:42:12,057 --> 02:42:13,536
He's over there.

1606
02:42:22,497 --> 02:42:25,614
I'm going to the moon,
I swear to God, I'm on my way.

1607
02:42:29,097 --> 02:42:31,930
Hi, little gal.
Damned glad to meet you, too.

1608
02:42:32,097 --> 02:42:35,612
I heard an awful lot of good things
about you, gal.

1609
02:42:44,817 --> 02:42:45,886
We got it.

1610
02:42:46,297 --> 02:42:49,050
Steak. All the trimmings.

1611
02:42:50,857 --> 02:42:52,734
Just like Pancho's.

1612
02:42:55,457 --> 02:42:57,368
Steak tastes about the same...

1613
02:42:58,137 --> 02:43:00,890
...only there's a lot
more trimmings now, Gus.

1614
02:43:03,417 --> 02:43:04,930
You know, it's funny.

1615
02:43:05,897 --> 02:43:10,095
Here I am, I got $25,000 a year
for a magazine contract.

1616
02:43:11,017 --> 02:43:13,531
I got a free house with all the furnishings.

1617
02:43:13,617 --> 02:43:15,289
Got me a Corvette.

1618
02:43:16,257 --> 02:43:19,613
I got a free lunch from one end of America
to the other...

1619
02:43:20,617 --> 02:43:22,847
...and I ain't even been up there yet.

1620
02:43:24,977 --> 02:43:26,012
I noticed that.

1621
02:43:26,097 --> 02:43:29,453
Oh, you noticed that?
You noticed I hadn't been up there yet?

1622
02:43:32,137 --> 02:43:34,492
They're saving the best for last.

1623
02:43:36,537 --> 02:43:39,097
Yeah, I guess so, Hot Dog. I guess so.

1624
02:43:41,457 --> 02:43:43,687
Just watch you don't screw the pooch.

1625
02:44:02,617 --> 02:44:07,008
We're talking to Gordon Cooper.
He will be the next to orbit the Earth.

1626
02:44:08,857 --> 02:44:13,487
Since you're the last of the original seven
and the least well known...

1627
02:44:13,777 --> 02:44:18,293
...could you begin by telling us
who was the best pilot you ever saw?

1628
02:44:19,097 --> 02:44:21,406
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1629
02:44:28,577 --> 02:44:31,091
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1630
02:44:35,377 --> 02:44:36,890
I'll tell you.

1631
02:44:37,137 --> 02:44:41,688
I've seen a lot of them,
and most of them were pictures on a wall...

1632
02:44:42,937 --> 02:44:46,976
I said, "pictures on a wall,"
back at some place that...

1633
02:44:49,137 --> 02:44:51,173
...doesn't even exist anymore.

1634
02:44:54,217 --> 02:44:55,650
Some of them are...

1635
02:44:55,777 --> 02:44:57,688
...right here in this room.

1636
02:44:59,297 --> 02:45:01,049
And some of them are...

1637
02:45:01,737 --> 02:45:05,730
...they're still out there somewhere,
doing what they always do.

1638
02:45:05,857 --> 02:45:09,088
Going up each day
in a hurtling piece of machinery...

1639
02:45:09,217 --> 02:45:11,936
...putting their hides out on the line...

1640
02:45:12,337 --> 02:45:14,646
...hanging it out over the edge...

1641
02:45:14,857 --> 02:45:18,486
...pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back.

1642
02:45:20,497 --> 02:45:22,010
But there was...

1643
02:45:22,577 --> 02:45:26,968
...one pilot I once saw who I think
truly did have the right...

1644
02:45:27,057 --> 02:45:30,015
How close did you ever come
to not hauling it back?

1645
02:45:35,137 --> 02:45:37,367
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

1646
02:45:37,697 --> 02:45:39,767
Well, you're looking at him.

1647
02:45:57,257 --> 02:45:59,009
You got any Beemans?

1648
02:46:00,497 --> 02:46:02,169
I might have me a stick.

1649
02:46:02,257 --> 02:46:04,896
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

1650
02:46:06,577 --> 02:46:07,896
Fair enough.

1651
02:46:09,217 --> 02:46:12,254
Think I see a plane over here
with my name on it.

1652
02:46:14,457 --> 02:46:16,095
Now you're talking.

1653
02:46:30,177 --> 02:46:31,610
Hey, what's that?

1654
02:46:31,857 --> 02:46:33,688
Anyone got clearance?

1655
02:46:37,297 --> 02:46:39,447
What kind of a plane is that?

1656
02:46:45,137 --> 02:46:48,015
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

1657
02:46:48,977 --> 02:46:51,935
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

1658
02:46:52,577 --> 02:46:56,092
I'm taking her up to wring her out a bit.
Any objections?

1659
02:46:56,217 --> 02:46:57,536
It's Yeager.

1660
02:46:59,857 --> 02:47:01,290
No objections.

1661
02:47:01,617 --> 02:47:03,448
You are clear to taxi.

1662
02:47:04,977 --> 02:47:07,047
He must have clearance. Right?

1663
02:47:07,217 --> 02:47:09,208
Yeah. Sure, he must.

1664
02:47:09,777 --> 02:47:11,290
It's here someplace.

1665
02:49:11,337 --> 02:49:13,487
Now, in honor of...

1666
02:49:13,737 --> 02:49:17,366
...these, the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind...

1667
02:49:17,857 --> 02:49:21,691
...it gives me great pleasure, great pride,
to present to you...

1668
02:49:22,297 --> 02:49:24,049
...Miss Sally Rand!

1669
02:52:09,657 --> 02:52:11,568
Stretch it! Stretch it!

1670
02:52:12,577 --> 02:52:13,976
You can do it!

1671
02:52:15,417 --> 02:52:18,773
Just a little bit more.
104,000, here you go.

1672
02:52:24,137 --> 02:52:25,695
Christ Almighty!

1673
02:55:36,977 --> 02:55:38,649
Sir, over there.

1674
02:55:41,057 --> 02:55:42,456
Is that a man?

1675
02:55:45,297 --> 02:55:47,367
Yeah, you're damn right it is!

1676
02:56:51,497 --> 02:56:53,772
We hate to disturb you, buddy, but...

1677
02:56:54,657 --> 02:56:56,170
...we've got a launch.

1678
02:56:59,337 --> 02:57:02,773
There's millions of people watching,
and we thought maybe...

1679
02:57:03,217 --> 02:57:06,129
Yep. Well, no sweat. Let's go.

1680
02:57:06,857 --> 02:57:09,929
I'm ready when you are, John, 100 percent.

1681
02:57:15,537 --> 02:57:17,448
Ten... nine...

1682
02:57:58,057 --> 02:57:59,809
Go.

1683
02:58:07,017 --> 02:58:09,247
Go, Hot Dog, go!

1684
02:58:13,897 --> 02:58:16,457
"Up we go into the wild blue yonder."

1685
02:58:16,857 --> 02:58:20,406
Thirty seconds and fuel is go,
oxygen is go...

1686
02:58:20,497 --> 02:58:23,648
...cabin pressure on the top peg.
Altimeter is working.

1687
02:58:25,417 --> 02:58:27,328
Have a good ride, buddy. Go!

1688
02:58:31,857 --> 02:58:34,246
The sun is coming through the window.

1689
02:58:35,977 --> 02:58:38,855
Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.

1690
02:58:50,977 --> 02:58:53,411
The Mercury program was over.

1691
02:58:54,057 --> 02:58:57,254
Four years later,
Astronaut Gus Grissom was killed...

1692
02:58:57,337 --> 02:58:59,976
...along with Astronauts White
and Chaffee...

1693
02:59:00,097 --> 02:59:03,055
...when fire swept through
their Apollo capsule.

1694
02:59:04,057 --> 02:59:07,811
But on that glorious day in May, 1963...

1695
02:59:08,137 --> 02:59:11,527
...Gordo Cooper went higher, farther...

1696
02:59:11,817 --> 02:59:14,206
...and faster than any other American.

1697
02:59:14,697 --> 02:59:17,450
Twenty-two complete orbits
around the world.

1698
02:59:17,737 --> 02:59:20,968
He was the last American
ever to go into space alone.

1699
02:59:21,417 --> 02:59:23,248
And for a brief moment...

1700
02:59:23,577 --> 02:59:28,446
...Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot
anyone had ever seen.
