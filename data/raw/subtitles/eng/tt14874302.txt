1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,040
[gasp]

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,380
No!

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,710
Dr. Thunder.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,780
Oh! Oh!

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,580
Your power!

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,850
It's gone.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,020
[groan]

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,990
- How do you feel?
- I'm scared.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,460
Don't you burn out on me.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,630
Light a flame!

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm trying!

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,500
No!

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,880
Wow! What a clap, guys!

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,550
We are here with the stars
of "Super Society".

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,820
Adam Clark and his
girlfriend, Firephina.

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,720
Adam, a Golden Globe,
not to mention an Oscar nom.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,930
First I just want to say, I love
this guy. Is he not the best?

18
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,430
- He really is. You are the best.
- You're the best.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,760
- No, you're the best.
- You're the best.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,800
Yes. Yes.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,930
Um... I love the Academy,

22
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,770
almost as much as I love you.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,140
I wanna say something
about this relationship.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,170
I've known you over the years.
You've...

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,780
you've dated a lot of women.

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,810
- Right.
- And I see you with her

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,680
and I can tell: "This time,
I think it's gonna last".

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,650
Love is the great reducer
of ego, Jimmy.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,190
I love you.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,490
[audience sighing] Oh!

31
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,520
[whispering] I love you.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,660
I love her.

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,830
[audience sighing] Oh!

34
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,460
- Oh! Sorry!
- Auch!

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,430
See? We do our own stunts.

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,700
[laughter and clapping]

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,170
She's my best friend.

38
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,810
Now, tell me. You are heading
down to Mexico now

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,940
to wrap up the trilogy.
Is that bittersweet for you?

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,250
Yes, it is.

41
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
We actually have two more scenes

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,690
we're filming here in LA.
Unlike these other busy gigs...

43
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,060
[assistant] Another one.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,160
Mr. Clark, set's ready for you!

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,260
[knocking the door]

46
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,260
Mr. Clark!

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,890
- He came out?
- No.

48
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
- I keep knocking but...
- We have to practice our catch.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,740
He's probably doing his
sangha meditation. Cute!

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,440
[classical music]

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,180
Hey!

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,550
Um...

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm in character so...

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,650
This doesn't count,

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,490
right?

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,420
I found Adam.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,980
[emotional music]

58
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,930
[assistant] Soph... Sophie...

59
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Are you okay?

60
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,610
Yeah, I'm great!

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,480
[puking]

62
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,010
[phone ringing]

63
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,710
[voice machine]
(United Talent Agency.)

64
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,280
(Front desk.)
(Hold for Margo Cohen.)

65
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,880
So, Soph, like...

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
How does she look?
I mean, how is she doing?

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,320
[bells ringing]

68
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,390
Aesthetically, flawless.
Mentally, deranged.

69
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,830
I have to figure out how to tell
the studio about this mess.

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,730
[bells ringing]

71
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,800
It's done! She's gonna do the
movie, we're not gonna discuss

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,700
the breakup until after
the movie is wrapped.

73
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,070
I've done this a million times.

74
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,070
It's the perfect formula.
Works every single time.

75
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,610
I know there's a lot going on
here, but I need to figure out

76
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,280
what I'm gonna tell the studio.

77
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,550
Really, now? Read the room.

78
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,820
[bells ringing]

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,090
- I have three buts.
- You have three buts.

80
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,820
That's a lot of buts to have.
That's a lot of pressure.

81
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,490
[phone vibrating]

82
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,720
Oh, no, no, no.
I need help. Hurry.

83
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,560
No! Get the phone! The phone!

84
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,330
Jesus Christ! Thank you.

85
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,960
Okay, I got it.
Don't try to touch my boob. Hi!

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,330
I feel like an idiot.
Of course I did this to myself,

87
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,000
but now my career
is gonna be over.

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,270
I'll be on "The Masked Singer"
dressed like up like an octopus.

89
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,910
I mean, cheating?
It's actually very hip.

90
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,080
It's very French, you know?
Why do you think we all go

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,940
to the Cannes every year?
For the movies?

92
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,450
Yeah, okay, okay.

93
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,580
The best thing
you can do for her

94
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,590
is forgive yourself and make
sure that this does not get out

95
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,990
before the Oscars.

96
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,360
Oh, my god! The Oscars!

97
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
Lie down.

98
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,290
- Okay.
- I threw up.

99
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,930
Okay. We saw that. You did
such a good job getting it out.

100
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,530
We're finishing the movie
because it's everything

101
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,870
we've ever worked for. But
I don't understand

102
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,670
keeping up appearances
with this hen...

103
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,840
Whether you like or not,
they are more famous together

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,410
than they are apart.
I mean, they're a pair!

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,810
We'll circle back to that, okay?
I have to deal

106
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,810
with whatever is happening here.

107
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,950
[music]

108
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,080
[crying]

109
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm free!

110
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,290
[shout]

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,660
[music]

112
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,170
[lively music]

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Good morning.

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
Good morning.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,630
Coffee?

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes, please.

117
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,740
Thank you, that's very kind.

118
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
You're welcome.

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,080
What are you cooking over there?

120
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,820
The only clinically proven
cure for hangover. Chilaquiles.

121
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,990
Oh! You're appealing
to my wholesome side.

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,090
[chuckles]

123
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,900
- For my food blog.
- I'm honored.

124
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,130
- I didn't know you had one.
- You didn't know I have one

125
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,770
because we don't really know
anything about each other.

126
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,900
- We don't, do we?
- Actually, I take that back.

127
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,840
I know you went to Cornell.

128
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,940
I know you can cook.

129
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,210
And that you have no
idea what my name is.

130
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,050
All very useful observations.
Very.

131
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,720
Do you know mine?

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,960
No.

133
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,930
[chuckles]

134
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,460
Well...

135
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,130
This international love
affair is skipping romantic.

136
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,830
Not us.

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,030
So, um.

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,000
I have to go to work. I manage
a hotel a couple of miles away.

139
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,770
Do you want me to order you
an Uber or...

140
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,940
I already got one.
Thank you for breakfast.

141
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,580
By the way...

142
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,780
I like that we don't
know each other's names.

143
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,190
Bye.

144
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,990
You.

145
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,030
[chuckles]

146
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,640
- Really? Again?
- What?

147
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,810
Dude, I don't get you.

148
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,550
The girl stays over,
you make her breakfast.

149
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,810
And at the end you just say,
"Goodbye forever"?

150
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,210
She only stayed for the weekend.

151
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,680
I was making sure her stay
in Playa Mujeres

152
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
was really pleasurable.

153
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,310
It's always the tourists.

154
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,160
It's easier that way.

155
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,560
What about a partner?

156
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Someone who improves you
as a person.

157
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,200
That lasts more than hours.

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,730
When did you last have
a real relationship?

159
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,040
I've created
the perfect relationship.

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,910
Mutually beneficial,
no expectations, symbiotic.

161
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,570
Tourists come and go.

162
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,610
There's a shared understanding
that things can't go further.

163
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,150
It's beautiful!
And with no distractions.

164
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,880
He's such a dick!
Look at that asshole sleeping.

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,350
[Adam snoring]

166
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,790
That's why I don't date actors.
They're unstable narcissists

167
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,260
with no perception of reality.
Not you, of course.

168
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,890
Chris, why are we
sharing the car with all this?

169
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,760
You'd have to ask my now
former assistant, Larissa.

170
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,130
[Rachel] She assured me of it
on the phone.

171
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,270
Never trust an adult
with braces.

172
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,940
I've had this recurring
nightmare, all in black and white

173
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,340
where I'm standing
in animal print pajamas,

174
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,330
holding a knife and
about to stab him.

175
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,310
But the guilt stops me. I turn
around suddenly, he gets up,

176
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,320
takes the knife, stabs me
in the back. I bleed out.

177
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,750
And my blood is red.

178
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,920
It's the only part of
the dream that is in color.

179
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,220
We get it.
You've seen "Schindler's List".

180
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,660
- We need a drink.
- Yes, please.

181
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,760
- What are we celebrating?
- The last of the trilogy.

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
- I'm gonna get bangs!
- No!

183
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,730
- No!
- No bangs.

184
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,170
Remember what happened
to Meredith Cooper?

185
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,530
- Who's Meredith Cooper?
- My point exactly.

186
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,040
It's due to bangs.

189
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,640
Boss, the suites are ready,
the menus are set.

190
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,110
- The staff is all prepared.
- Come.

191

[laughter on TV]

192
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,320
I need you to tell me
the status of the artists.

193
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,050
- I'll check.
- Have they arrived?

194
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,620
Antonio, do you copy?

195
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,890
Don't bother, I fired him.

196
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,360
Why?

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,600
Rule number one,
don't sleep with guests.

198
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Poor guy.

199
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,370
[Aurelia]
No, he had a great time.

200
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,070
Too bad it cost him his job.

201
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,140
I need you to handle the artists

202
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,310
while I get a replacement.

203
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,080
As if.

204
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,080
[Aurelia]
Do I sound like I'm joking?

205
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,550
No way, Aurelia.
I already went through that.

206
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,490
What do you mean by that?

207
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,190
You're asking me
to take a big step back.

208
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,100
What part of your job
don't you get?

209
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,030
We handle everything
in this hotel.

210
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,870
It doesn't matter
how big or small it is.

211
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,070
Or hospitality is something
they didn't teach

212
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,770
in your fancy school?

213
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,380
Do you want me to promote
you to manager

214
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,550
of the New York branch?

215
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,850
I've worked so hard for that.

216
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,420
That damn meritocracy
has damaged you.

217
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,520
No, my love.
You need my recommendation.

218
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,520
And start getting used to it

219
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,530
because in this industry,
you're gonna deal

220
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,360
with Hollywood artists
for the rest of your life.

221
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,300
So you want me to play nanny
for these crazy artists?

222
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes.

223
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,040
It's just six weeks.

224

- Yes?

- Phoebe Ranger's up.
- Okay. You are the best.

231
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,430
- I'm taking a shower.
- You have twenty, twenty-five.

232
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,330
You'd better move on.

233

Okay!

Oh, my goodness, Alejandro!

240
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,550
Hi, Miss Almas.

241
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,420
You wouldn't mind if I grab
some of these towels, would you?

242
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,090
No, not at all.

243
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,860
Oh. By the way, thank you so much
for sending me the champagne,

244

They saved my marriage!

- I know but I heard an audio book

that said you have to lean
into that,

262
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,900
like let yourself be sad.
You know, just feel the sadness.

263

Speaking of... drinks. We need
drinks. I'm getting us drinks.

- No.
- Alcohol fixes everything.

was okay with your room,

there were no towels.

You're a terrible manager!

he's 5'97" tall,

noticed, Tachi,

- Right? He loves me.

Okay, come on.
He was just tipping you.

I was doing my job.

And she entered... naked.

No! Oh, my god. He walked on you
completely naked.

you are alarmingly civil.

so much love in my heart

for this moment for years.

I'm gonna draft it.

350

I'm gonna draft the notes
of the breakup post.

not an attempt to go viral.

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,150
Sophie! I have incredible news!

353
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
He cheated on you.
Please, the world needs to know.

354
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
This guy's a monster.

355
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,620
He once told me he didn't think
girls should go to school.

356
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,330
You wanna tell everybody
he cheated on me?

357
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,630
No! Absolutely not.

358
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,430
Hey, you. I got this.
I got this one.

359
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,800
Okay. What would Meryl do?

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,370
Meryl would put a pin
in all of this

361
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,640
and she would raise a glass of

362
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,910
[Chris] "Sophie's choice":
Moet et Chandon.

363
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,970
- Don't mind if I do.
- Am I right?

364
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,650
And she would celebrate

365
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,180
the script that
I just got for you.

366
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,980
What is it?

367
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,720
I got you "New York or Nowhere".

368
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Shut up!

369
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,990
She got the offer?

370
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, we got an offer
for a meeting

371
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,230
and a tape.

372
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,630
[Chris] Which is similar.

373
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,670
- Sophie Wilder does not tape.
- I can tape.

374
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,540
Sophie Wilder is fine with the
tape, so is "Emily from Paris"

375
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,780
and Sarah Sherona and...

376
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,710
You do the accent
when you say her name.

377
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,010
[Chris] And she's Irish.

378
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,850
[Chris]
They're all submitting a tape.

379
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,280
I don't book tapes

380
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,520
that I don't do with Adam.

381
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,520
Oh, the way this man
has brainwashed you, babe!

382
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,060
[Chris] -What year is this?
[Rachel] -You haven't stopped

383
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,590
talking about him
for a single second, please!

384
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,260
It was a five-year relationship!

385
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh! No, no, no!
Margo Cohen, I cannot take it.

386
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,860
If I wanna be topped, I'm doing
Grindr, thank you. It's all you.

387
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,900
Okay, wow. Thanks.

388
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,900
- Go, girl!
- She's not that scary.

389
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,770
Girl-boss!

390
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,440
- It's my girl-boss.
- Hi!

391
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,070
- Hi, Margo!
- Too nice.

392
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,310
She sounds like a little baby
when she answers the phone.

393
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,940
[girlish voice] I need a diaper.

394
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,750
[girlish voice]
I'm a little school girl.

395
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,480
I order the same way
in a restaurant.

396
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,420
[girlish voice]
Could I have a souffl?

397
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,820
[Margo] (Tell Rachel)
(to not post anything, okay?)

398
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,720
- How did you...?
[Margo] (-We're just thinking)

399
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,060
the best thing you can do for you
right now

400
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,060
is to say absolutely nothing
about the break up

401
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,630
(until this movie and possibly)
(the spin-off sequel)

402
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,800
are in the can.

403
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,570
- [Margo] (-Okay? We good?)
- Okay, uh...

404
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,540
Does that really align with our
values as women in this industry?

405
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,170
I mean...

406
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,210
I feel trapped.

407
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,980
You feel trapped. Okay, well...

408
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,080
You know? This industry just...
quick reminder, was built

409
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,120
on the back of a five year-old
child named Shirley Temple,

410
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,360
who they made wear miniskirts
and dance on a grown man's lap.

411
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,990
Not a mother in sight, so...

412
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,790
(Look, time's up.)

413
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,500
(But every time a guy)
(like Adam Clark breaks up)

414
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,060
(with a girl like Sophie Wilder)

415
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,700
you are the one

416
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,930
to get the short end
of the stick. It's you.

417
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm not talking about his stick.

418
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,440
I don't know if it's
short or not.

419
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,840
I didn't look at the nudes.
I just made them go away.

420
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,940
Well, we can change
the narrative.

421
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,810
[Margo on the phone]
(Go on a journey with me, honey.)

422
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,810
(Remember, uh, Tom and Katy?)

423
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,380
(Yeah, exactly. Where did she go?)

424
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,780
(And then there was Ben and Jen.)

425
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,850
Brad and Jen, but Ben and Jen...

426
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,460
Aniston, not Lopez.

427
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,120
(The point is, all that)
(incredible work you've done...)

428
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,130
(Do you really want it to be)
(eclipsed by some guy?)

429
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,270
(Sophie, do you really)
(wanna be treated like)

430
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,000
just another Jen?

431
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,270
[emotional music]

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,810
- I don't.
[Margo] (-Smart. Brilliant.)

433
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,780
(I underestimated you.)

434
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
You have a business brain.

435
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,150
[Margo on the phone]
(Okay, we'll talk soon!)

436
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,960
[emotional music]

437
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,830
[Dr. Thunder] Don't worry,
I brushed my teeth after lunch.

438
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,650
I didn't.

439
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,030
Okay.

440
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,840
[man] Okay, rolling.

441
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,170
Silence!

442
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,740
[director] Action!

443
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,310
[loud kissing]

444
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,860
Okay, let's cut! Come with me!

445
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,120
Right! Cut!

446
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,890
[lively music]

447
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,200
Soph, dear, I think your kiss
ain't working for me.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,800
- Yeah.
- You know what I think?

449
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,870
I think you wake up first,
you realize where you are.

450
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,440
First punch, then kiss.

451
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,470
Set.

452
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,040
Full, full.

453
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,080
There's a bottle of water there.
Okay, let's go folks!

454
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,430
Action!

455
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,430
That's for almost dying.

456
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,140
And that's for saving the world.
Now, where the hell are we?

457
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,250
And cut! That was beautiful!
Thank you, Soph.

458
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,450
The studio says
hers is too freezy.

459
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,020
No, she's perfect.

460
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,950
All right, I think we have it.

461
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,150
Hey, Margo,
I wanted to close the...

462
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,190
Excuse me!

463
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,190
No, thank you!

464
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,260
Anyway, circling back,
no, no circle in black.

465
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,630
Margo, I just bought some SPF 50
which made me think of you, uh...

466
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,970
No. Hey! Margo, they are all
checked in separate rooms

467
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,210
on opposite ends of the hotel.
They' re now on the same set.

468
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,910
Say a prayer.

469
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,710
- Hey!
- Hi.

470
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,110
There's some lavender in there,
you know, for the stress.

471
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,120
How could you tell
I was stressed?

472
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,350
Is it because
I yelled at the child?

473
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,090
You know, you're on vacation!

474
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,490
You should relax a little.

475
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,200
I am here doing damage control

476
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,160
and then I have to
head back to LA

477
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,200
in six hours to meet
with Avril Lavigne's team

478
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,300
about the skater board bio pic.

479
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,120
I love her.

480
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,410
I do too. She's actually
a client of mine.

481
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,210
Is she nice?

482
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,010
Uh?

483
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,920
Kind of complicated, isn't it?

484
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
[laughter]

485
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,520
So you're Taki.

486
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,120
Um...

487
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,690
Tachi.

488
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,460
Tachi.

489
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,560
The pleasure is mine, Tachi.

490
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,970
I love your cock... tails.

491
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,900
Oh, thank you.

492
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,170
Every time I feel like
they might know me it's either:

493
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,180
Oh my god! It's Firephina!

494
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,010
Or worst,
it's Adam Clark's girlfriend!

495
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,220
[man on the phone] (Sophie,
plenty) (of people know you are)

496
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,950
(separate from your relationship)
(with Adam Clark, okay?)

497
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,840
(Okay, dear, it's been a long day.)
(You sound hungry. Get a snack.)

498
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,560
(I'll send you that tape)
(from "New York or Nowhere")

499
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,260
(unless you wanna act in spandex)
(for the rest of your life.)

500
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,130
Oh, right the strike of midnight,
Pancho.

501
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,870
Yes, otherwise I will be
turning into a pumpkin.

502
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,810
Here's the derby food
and that's the bar.

503
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,080
Good night, guys. I'll...

504
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,950
see you tomorrow.

505
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,950
Miss Wilder, late night?

506
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,220
Double of the time, but we got
the shots we needed.

507
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,890
Didn't know you played
basketball.

508
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,360
I don't.

509
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,930
Oh, I see the confusion.
Is there a late night menu?

510
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah, I'll go grab one.

511
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,430
Hey, Soph, um...

512
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,840
I thought you did wonderfully
today, but

513
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,140
never feel like you have to rush
through your text. I mean,

514
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,910
we're the stars.

515
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,780
We run the set. Right?

516
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,850
Okay, if you're talking about
scene 36,

517
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,350
[chuckles]

518
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,350
I thought we got it
and I was giving the director

519
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,290
the time she needed
for the stunts.

520
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,020
We'll see. Tape never lies.

521
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,330
Oh, my God! Captain Thunder?!

522
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,630
You're the actress! Fire...
Uh... Fire...

523
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,800
I can't handle fans at this
hour. Good night. I can't.

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
I love all the sequels
to "Secret Society".

525
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,270
- Guys, could we...?
- "Super Society".

526
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,440
No, please, I'm so sorry.
I'm so tired.

527
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,180
Excuse me, bitch?

528
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,710
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sir, you can't do that.

529
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm a guest!

530
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,680
No, you're drunk and you're
getting back to your room.

531
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
- Martin, take him to his room.
- Let's go.

532
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,050
She's famous, you know?

533
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,990
I'm telling drunken gringos
to get back to their room.

534
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,360
Curse of the job.
Here, Miss Wilder.

535
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

536
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,130
Oh, is this all you have?

537
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,530
Uh, our kitchens are closed.
So sorry.

538
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,430
How disappointing!

539
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,470
I guess I'll just starve
'till the sun rises.

540
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,970
Good evening, Miss Wilder.

541
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,910
What a night!

542
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,590
[music]

543
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,170
[Alejandro] Miss Wilder?

544
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,410
What are doing?

545
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,210
Oh! Thank God! I hate cooking.

546
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,350
Can you help a gal in need?

547
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,720
That looks like trouble.

548
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,620
It's a sandwich.

549
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,520
So, you and Mr. Clarke
are shooting a movie.

550
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,430
Yeah, the third of
the "Super Society" trilogy.

551
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,300
You've never seen
"Super Society", have you?

552
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,140
Sorry.

553
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,040
Don't be. They're silly.

554
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,950
And according to Scorsese,
not cinema.

555
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,650
Well, what does he know?

556
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,450
Happy?

557
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,090
Thank you.

558
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,290
You're welcome.

559
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,770
But...

560
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,320
You're very hospitable.

561
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,110
Thank you.

562
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,510
Ever since my dad left, I felt
responsible for taking care

563
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,410
of my mom and sister, so
hospitality was a natural fit.

564
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,150
I once invited my Postmates
driver in for Thanksgiving dinner

565
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,070
that he had just delivered.

566
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,560
Wow!
So you do really hate cooking.

567
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,890
Yeah.

568
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,430
How it takes longer
than it does to eat it.

569
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,500
Did you, um...
did you always work here?

570
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,130
Yeah, I was actually born
and raised in this hotel.

571
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,270
Like Eloise.

572
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,640
I work here now

573
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,510
and I'm headed to New York.
I'm part of the rotation program

574
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,510
for the hotel where, hopefully,
I'll be able to manage there.

575
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,280
He says with disdain.

576
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,020
Because I wanna open
my own place,

577
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,290
but a boutique hotel. A place
that's cozier and smaller

578
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,360
where people from all over the
world can come and feel at home.

579
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,190
Please, tell me more.

580
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,830
How do I put it? Like...

581
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,600
When you're making coffee and
you choose your favorite mug,

582
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,370
right?

583
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,640
But you leave it out,
forget about it.

584
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,470
It's cold, it's very sad.
In my hotel,

585
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,470
we'd make sure that coffee mug
is always warm.

586
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,380
[romantic music]

587
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,750
- You've thought about that a lot.
- Yes, I have.

588
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,580
And in the meantime,

589
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,250
I get to take care of wonderful
hotel guests like yourself,

590
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,590
Miss Wilder.

591
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,490
Call me, Sophie.
You have seen me naked.

592
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,230
I wasn't looking.

593
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,160
Well now I'm offended.

594
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,870
[romantic music]

595
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,580
- Uf!
- Oh, no! No! No! No! No!

596
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,950
I... I shouldn't even had that.

597
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,920
You're not missing out on
my grandmother's secret recipe.

598
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,550
It's not happening.

599
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,420
Spoon me.

600
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,900
- I know.
- It's so unfair!

601
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,540
If I ever meet your grandmother,
I'm giving her a huge hug.

602
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,790
Do you know how to get back to
your room from here, Miss Wilder?

603
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,160
No.

604
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,630
Good night.

605
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,240
Hi, mom!

606
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,020
I miss you too.

607
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,420
But I'll see you at
Dani's birthday next week.

608
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,560
Yes, mom.

609
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,590
Love you. Kisses.

610
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,330

What is it, boss?

624
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,350
What are you doing here?

625
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,390
I was passing by.

626
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,420
And I remembered our
conversation yesterday.

627
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,220
- So I came to help.
- Good timing.

628
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,760
Miss Sophie has just called
asking for you.

629
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,530
Since when are you so excited
by your guest relations role?

630
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,670
Not at all.

631
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,370
What did she want?

632
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,770
[Rachel] Hello!

633
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,510
Hi, uh... I was told Miss Wilder
needs some towels.

634
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,780
Towels, that's hilarious.
You know, you can just ask

635
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,850
for her number. I' m joking.
Come down, come inside.

636

- Oh God.
[Sophie] -Is that Adam?

639
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,690
No. It's the cute guy
who saw you naked.

640
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,630
By the...
I did not see her naked.

641
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,760
Yeah, now I've heard everything.

I thought it was your day off.

644
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,030
Uh, yeah, it was. I was called
in for a last minute meeting

645
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,450
for a committee
that I oversee and, uh,

646
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,570
I'm an overachiever.

647
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,340
Well it's good to see you.

648
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,810
It's good to see you. Too.

we got a fan here!

Good evening, Miss Wilder.

659
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,140
Are you in need
of more of these?

660
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,440
Because this morning I did
your room and I thought

661
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,810
I had changed them all,
but... [chuckles]

662
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,320
If I made a mistake,
I apologize. I'm sorry.

663
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,850
No. No, you didn't.
You didn't make a mistake. I

664
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,420
ordered a lot of towels.

665
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,460
You've inspired me.
From one apology to another.

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,140
I'm so sorry.
Yesterday on the set,

667
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,940
I was transfixed by the words

668
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,380
and I failed to be
your equal scene partner.

Are the centerpieces

671
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,620
and tablecloths ready
for the event?

It's so beautiful here. I was
wondering, can I take a tour?

00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,540
Yeah, of course. I'd be happy
to assist you with that.

679
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,110
- It would have to be private.
- Of course.

680
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,310
Where would you like to go?
You can go

681
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,110
scuba diving or

682
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,880
go visit cenotes,
which are actually my favorite.

683
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,650
They're amazing.

684
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:59,520
- Or Mayan ruins perhaps?
- Actually I'd like to go dancing.

00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,190
- Good afternoon.
- Hi, how are you?

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,130
When would you like to go?

688
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,260
Tomorrow?

689
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,770
Okay, is there a particular style
you and Mr. Clark would like?

690
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,470
Oh, it's just me.

691

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,350
[Sophie VO] (Great, Sophie.)
(You've forgotten how to flirt.)

701
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,290
Well, welcome to Isla Mujeres.

702
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,960
[Alejandro VO] (What are you?)
(A tour guide?)

703
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,330
(That's exactly what you are)
(doing! Do your job, Alejandro.)

704
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,800
[Sophie VO]
(Ask him a question.)

705
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
Is this where you want
to open up your hotel?

706
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,370
[Alejandro VO] (My God!)
(She remembered!)

707
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,570
No. Uh, I mean,
it's beautiful here but...

708
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,670
I was looking at places
in San Miguel de Allende.

709
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,940
[Sophia VO] (That was)
(a horrible question.)

710
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,510
(What am I even doing here?)

711
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,740
Oh! That's...

712
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,680
That's where my grandmother
was born.

713
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,580
- No way!
- Yeah. Yeah.

714
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,980
I heard it's beautiful.

715
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,580
- You've never been?
- No.

716
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,150
[Sophia VO] (Oh, perfect, )
(an audience.)

717
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,920
(Watch how you get blamed)
(for cheating on Adam now.)

718
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,660
(But, you know what, Sophie?)
(Allow yourself to have fun.)

719
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,790
Two Pacificos, please!

720
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,790
[Alejandro VO] (Be a gentleman.)

721
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,830
[Alejandro VO]
(Oh, my god, she's beautiful.)

722
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,170
Thank you.

723
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,700
[Sophia VO] (He's more)
(of a romantic than I imagined.)

724
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,570
Cheers.

725
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,770
Cheers.

726
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,610
[Sophia VO] (God, he's cute. I)
(wonder if he's as nervous as me.)

727
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,210
[Alejandro VO] (This isn't a
date.) (It's just a private tour.)

728
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,150
(At midnight.)

729
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,050
[Sophia VO] (Ask me)
(to dance, you fool.)

730
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,690
[Alejandro VO] (Just ask her
to...)

731
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,090
Shall we dance?

732
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,490
I should warn you.
I'm a fantastic dancer.

733
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,330
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

734
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,730
Okay.

735
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,930
[music]

736
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,040
Oh. I thought you'd be

737
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,510
a little better at dancing.

738
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,280
- That was all you.
- Oh, really?

739
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,160
[drums]

740
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,370
[modern tango music]

741
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,840
Thank you. I haven't had
that much fun in a while.

742
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,840
I mean, that was...

743
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,440
Hot?

744
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,120
Aren't you and Adam...
I mean I'm...

745
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,350
[romantic music]

746
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,730
Good night, Alejandro.

747
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,300
Good night.

748
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,780
I kissed Sophie Wilder.

749
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,450
Technically,
I made the first move.

750
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,850
No! You're going to break
the sweet little boy's heart.

751
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,220
That's big news!

752
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,290
What's he gonna do?

753
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,060
What about the Adam deal?

754
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,940
I asked if they were together.

755
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,460
What did she say?

756
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,300
- Well, I kissed him.
- You can do whatever you want!

757
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,170
If Aurelia finds out, she'll
kill me. I can't risk my job.

758
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,700
Relax. You're nervous.
She won't find out.

759
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,570
If Adam finds out,
he is going to lose it.

760
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,740
- I don't care.
- Don't care?

761
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,180
Be honest.

762
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,110
Did you feel butterflies
in your stomach?

763
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,250
[Tachi] Come on, you did!
You did!

764
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,420
Cheers!

765
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,050
[laughter]

766
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,560
[Alejandro] I still feel them.

767
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,060
I can feel them.

768
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,030
[Adam] Hey, Sophie!

769
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,100
[Sophie] Adam.

770
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,170
[Adam] Look, um,

771
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,840
I know we never discussed

772
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,170
it, but

773
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,880
I feel like it'd be best
if we were together.

774
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,910
And I know I need to apologize

775
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,950
to us.

776
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,220
I've been going through
an identify defusion.

777
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,290
I'm sorry, a what?

778
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,560
No, I... I know.
The language... it seems broad.

779
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,060
Um...

780
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,200
I just want to discuss
our romantic terms.

781
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,500
And...

782
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,100
the idea of us getting back
together,

783
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,140
after such
a traumatic experience.

784
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,780
It's got legs. Doesn't it?

785
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,050
[birds chirping]

786
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,850
Wow! I, um...

787
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,490
I just need some space.

788
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,120
Sure. Yeah. Well,
it was good to...

789
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,820
- Right, space.
- Space.

790
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,130
Sorry. All right.

791
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,900
You want space?

792
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,310
How's this for space?!

793
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,050
[sound of sea]

794
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,600
Rest well, Santi.

795
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,870
- See you tomorrow, Marquitos.
- See you later, sir.

796
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,940
- [Sophie] (-Hello?)
- Hey!

797
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,040
Hello, you.

(So... my shift ends at midnight.)

00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,580
(Fancy a night swim?)

800
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,420
Sounds fine.

801
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,120
By that I'm mean
that I'll be there soon.

803
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,890
Miss Wilder!

804
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,530
Good evening. So sorry,
I was just walking.

805
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,230
It's okay!

806

How are you, Chuy?

810
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,920
Can you sign this, boss?

811
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,650
Let's see.

812
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,390
As legend has it, the only way
to get my power back

813
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,430
is with a sacrifice.
Thousands of years ago...

814
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,290
Ready?

815
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,360
And

816
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,400
action!

I'm your lawyer!

(You're telling me I'll never see)
(you again and I'm telling you)

820
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,410
(I won't let that happen.)
(I can't let that happen.)

821
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,080
The jury is gonna lock you away
for a crime you didn't commit.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, no.

- You're making it.
- No, stop. Stop. Okay.

Fifth Avenue bucks can buy.

say about falling in love?!

What's so funny? What?

832
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,610
- You're taking it very seriously.
- I'm in character!

Come on!

I'm not gonna book
"New York or Nowhere" anyway.

838
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,580
It's gonna go to a Lily. For some
reason it always goes to a Lily.

839
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,250
Yeah. It's okay because I said
I wouldn't do a remake anyway.

840
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,990
- This is...
- I love this film.

841
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,090
I know. This is literally
the best acting

842

I've ever seen in my life.

843
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,130
No, really. You are crushing it!

844
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,830
- Yeah.
- You are killing it!

845
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,630
You haven't seen enough acting.

846
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,270
Thank you. Thank you.

847
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,600
You're a much better scene
partner than Adam. He...

848
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,140
I... Sorry. Never mind.

849
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,310

Are you dating Adam?

00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,230
It's all over the internet.
It's all everyone talks about.

[knock on the door]

856
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,500
Did you order something?

857
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,470
No, I have no idea.

Uh...

860
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,170
I'll go through the door
on the back.

861
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,080
- I'm gonna go on the back.
- Okay.

- Come on in.
- This was sent for you.

865
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,560
Did you have seen
the view to Isla Mujeres?

866
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,260
Yeah, yeah. It's beautiful.
And the room it's... so great.

867
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,830
Did you have the opportunity
to watch it?

868
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
- To Isla?
- Yeah!

869
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,940
We can arrange a special tour
for you and mister Clark.

870
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,410
That would... be great.

incredible. Uh...

how great it was.

875
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,680
So I think I'm gonna

876
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,190
go to sleep soon.

877
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,220
[Aurelia] Yes. Yes. Yes.
We are leaving.

878
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,360
[Sophie] So sorry.

879
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,890
- It's a pleasure.
- Good night.

880
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,700
Man! That was close!

881
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,500
Damn!

882
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,710
TO DR. THUNDER AND FIREPHINA,
THE MOST POWERFUL COUPLE

883
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,580
IN THE WORLD.
HAVE A GREAT SHOOT.

884
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,020
You wanted to know
about Adam and me.

885
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,420
He cheated on me.
So much like the characters

886
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,860
in the films
that we're starring.

887
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,890
It's all pretend.

888
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,460
So you fake being in love? Why?

889
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,040
I don't wanna be
treated like another Jen.

890
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,620
I have no idea what that means.

891
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,380
It's embarrassing.
Can we not talk about it?

892
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,750
I have a surprise for you.

893
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,780
Some place
we won't be interrupted.

894
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,590
And...

895
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,460
Midnight with you
is my favorite hour.

896
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,460
Midnight isn't a time.

897
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,500
It's a place
for us to be together.

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,310
(it detects a lie.)

(I need you. Run.)

908
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,480
Copy, I'm on my way.

909
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,750
I gotta go.

910
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,050
I wish we could go somewhere
we didn't have to hide.

911
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,660
I know.

912
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:02,260
[music]

913
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,580
Hello.

914
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,780
- You sure about this?
- Yes!

915
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,920
We both have the day off

916
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,790
and nobody will be looking
for you until tomorrow.

917
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,660
All right.

918
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,060
[Sophie] Where are you
taking me?

919
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,170
[Alejandro] Oh, it's a surprise.
I can't tell you.

920
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,830
[laughter]

921
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,970
This is so fun!

922
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,740
Wow!

923
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,910
Oh, there's no...
there's no reception.

924
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,120
It's part of the magic here.
No cell service.

925
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,350
I cannot remember the last time
I could ignore my phone.

926
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,820
She said with envy.

928
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,100
- Just here?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

929
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,540
Okay.

[sound of wind and waves]

932
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,160
You just have to

933
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,130
curate the vibe.

934
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,600
Okay, so it is guest relations.

935
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,030
Of course!

945
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,960
Yes, I love that.
That's perfect. Um...

946
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,700
Let me just check, double check
with her schedule

947
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,430
and I will get back to you.

You are hilarious. I'm laughing.

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,970
Okay. Thank you,
pleasure's mine. Bye bye.

Are you ready to experience
the magic of a national

954
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,020
gastronomical treasure?

955
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,990
Chips and sauce?

956
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,640
How dare you? No!

957
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,900
- Prepared chips.
- "Prepared chips".

958
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,630
Good. Can you hand me
a Pacifico, please?

959
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,770
Yes. Of course.

00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,170

- With our eyes.

964
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,520
If not it's very bad luck.

965
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,590
So, first,

966
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,060
a little bit of Maggi.

967
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,630
A little love in there,
pum, pum.

968
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,690
Then,

969
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:22,250
English sauce.

970
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:25,000
No one leaves voice mails
but I'm leaving this voice mail

971
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,370
so you know I tried to connect.
Okay.

972
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:33,240
Lime. Here in Mexico we put
lime on everything.

973
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,810
Okay.

974
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,580
It's a lot of lime.

975
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,780
[Alejandro] Oh yeah.

976
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,050
Ready?

977
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:56,030
[romantic music]

978
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,000
So when are you opening up
your hotel?

979
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,110
I don't know. I keep telling
myself 'next year',

980
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,280
the year after that, but

981
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,310
then I have to go to New York
in a couple of months and...

982
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,720
I love New York. It's

983
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,180
crowded and dirty and full

984
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,020
of trash and rats,

985
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,830
but it's so magical.

986
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,930
So what's stopping you

987
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,240
from opening up your place?

988
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,310
Honestly?

989
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,930
It scares the shit out of me.

990
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:45,610
Why?

991
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,780
What if I fail?

992
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,150
What if I open it
and no one shows up?

993
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:53,890
Or even worse, what if
I open it and no one likes it?

994
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,790
Have you ever read some of
the comments on Trip Advisor?

995
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,820
They're ruthless!

996
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:02,630
Alejandro, what if
you never try?

997
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,870
"Puta madre"!

998
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,640
What does that mean?

999
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,800
"Puta madre"?

1000
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,840
It means...

1001
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,670
Motherfucker!

1002
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,680
Hi, don't be mad.
She's in the hotel.

1003
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,580
- It's just a very big hotel.
- Rachel, listen to me.

1004
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,780
- Rachel, listen to me.
- She hadn't mentioned going to...

1005
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,920
Rachel, please listen to me!
Listen to me what I'm asking you!

1006
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,990
No, Rachel, seriously,
stop talking.

1007
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:32,640
Where is she? Okay?
What the hell is going on?

1008
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,590
- She's definitely in the hotel.
- Is she?

1009
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,700
- Are we sure?
- I wouldn't lie.

1010
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,700
Any ideas as to where
in the hotel she may be?

1011
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,830
She had wanted to do
this acroyoga class.

1012
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,030
For 10 hours?

1013
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,500
And she needed lift face
resveratrol.

1014
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,600
Okay. She's getting a zombie
facial for 10 hours?

1015
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,040
Yes, and she's doing...
She's fine.

1016
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,440
We have to talk
to a professional. Excuse me.

1017
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,250
Did anyone say anything at any
point about her going anywhere

1018
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,180
- with anyone?
- No, I'm sorry.

1019
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,850
- Thank you, Aurelia.
- Yes.

1020
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,890
I guess we're gonna have full
dateline and call the police.

1021
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,260
- No!
- No, no, no!

1022
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,460
Look who's here!
I didn't know you were coming.

1023
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,190
- Sophie's gone missing...
- Relax.

1024
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,030
- What?
- And we don't know where she is.

1025
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,600
Missing is a very extreme word.

1026
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,330
Hey! Quiet! Quiet everybody!

1027
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,300
I got this.

1028
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,200
We need the schematics
of the building.

1029
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,470
I need to get in your main frame.
You understand me?

1030
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,810
Comprende?

1031
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,040
Also, we need a couple
of blood hounds.

1032
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,580
Whatever kind of dogs
you can get.

1033
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,640
An article of her clothing,
preferably underwear.

1034
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,930
The dogs love it, okay?

1035
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,950
Oh, my god! Why would I ask
an actor to do anything?

1036
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,060
[sound of waves]

1037
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,970
So,

1038
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,170
how's Sophie Wilder doing?

1039
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,010
Miserable at best.

1040
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,170
[chuckles]

1041
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,340
No, seriously. I mean,
you have a lot of stuff going on.

1042
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,350
Uh...

1043
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,960
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty
caught up in work.

1044
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,030
Firephina above all.

1045
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,860
She's great.

1046
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,960
Who wouldn't want
to be a superhero?

1047
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,630
But sometimes
there is a lot of pressure

1048
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:23,870
because people love her so much.

1049
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,270
The costume, you know,
and the catchphrases

1050
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,150
and the intensity.
People get really into it.

1051
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,580
And so do I.
It's a huge part of my life.

1052
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,090
But sometimes I wonder...

1053
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,460
who am I?

1054
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,160
Well I'm a fan.

1055
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,130
Oh, no, you watched.

1056
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,070
Not of Firephina.

1057
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,070
Of you, Sophie.

1058
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,810
[romantic music]

1059
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:12,790
[romantic music]

1060
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,130
[Alejandro] Good morning.

1061
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,800
Want some coffee?

1062
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,030
[Sophie] I fell sleep.

1063
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,340
Oh my god!

1064
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,270
I wasn't supposed
to stay overnight.

1065
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,350
Everybody's probably looking
for me. What time is it?

1066
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,820
Shit!

1067
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,790
We need to go.

1068
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,920
We...

1069
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,090
We need to go.

1070
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,190
- You okay?
- No, we have to go!

1071
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,430
Like... like right now.

1072
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,170
- We have to go!
- Man! Okay!

1073
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,840
[Rachel]
(It's me again. This is...)

1074
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,380
[chuckles]
(It's not cute anymore.)

1075
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,180
(Please let me know)
(where you are.)

1076
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,350
[Chris] (Sophie, I don't know)
(what else to do)

1077
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,480
(so I'm flying to Mexico.)

1078
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,920
(Weird airline and coach.)

1079
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,220
Don't worry, we're almost there.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1080
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,110
No. This is not fine.

1081
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,460
Calm down, Sophie.

1082
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,030
I shouldn't even be here!
We shouldn't have done this!

1083
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:37,070
I'm not on vacation!
I'm here for work!

1084
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:39,100
This was a huge mistake!

1085
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,610
My job is at stake too,
you know?

1086
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,840
It's a little different,
Alejandro.

1087
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,320
What the hell were you thinking
going off God knows where?

1088
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,650
Do you know how worried
we were for you?

1089
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,120
Not to mention I had to leave LA

1090
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,160
in the middle of a very
exclusive healing circle

1091
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,990
with Ashton Kutcher and
Mila Kunis as shamans

1092
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,200
so that I could come
looking for you!

1093
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,660
Okay?

1094
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,230
Do I look like
a babysitter to you?

1095
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,870
Huh?

1096
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,800
Do you see me with a little Baby
Bjorn and some mushed carrots

1097
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,370
ready to attend your every need?
I have other clients, Soph. Okay?

1098
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:19,180
I was supposed to be at Florence
Pugh's cookbook release party

1099
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,380
at the Barnes & Noble
at The Grove,

1100
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,720
eating her signature one pan
chicken cacciatore but, uh uh.

1101
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,020
I'm out here playing
grab ass looking for you!

1102
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,690
I said I was sorry.

1103
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,030
I needed to get out of here.
My phone died.

1104
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,160
- I stayed at a hotel nearby.
- We had to call the police,

1105
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,630
Sophie! The freaking "polic a"!
Okay?

1106
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:46,100
And I had to do some very bad
things with a low level intern

1107
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,110
at TMZ so that this
didn't become

1108
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,710
a freaking
international media frenzy!

1109
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,480
Okay, I think she gets it.

1110
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:59,280
Deborah Jackson Katz from the
studio was here to talk to you

1111
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,220
about your standalone feature
and guess who wasn't here?

1112
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,660
Any guesses?

1113
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,330
The answer is you.

1114
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,730
You weren't here.

1115
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,670
In the hotel by the sea.

1116
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,140
And that's a big problem,
sister friend.

1117
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,570
Now, not even...

1118
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:25,180
as one of the Hollywood
reporters

1119
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,250
35 under 35 entertainment
professionals,

1120
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:34,620
but as your friend,
you could've called or texted

1121
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,290
so I knew you were okay.

1122
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:41,990
Okay? Now, you have
two weeks left on this film.

1123
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,630
I want you...

1124
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,000
to get Demi Moore's
reiki specialist on Zoom

1125
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,370
if that's what it takes for you
to pull yourself together

1126
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:57,240
to finish this fantastic movie.
"Capisce"?

1127
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,180
I've had enough.

1128
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,380
I'm gonna go eat a taquito

1129
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,420
and think about this
and I want you to repent.

1130
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,030
Thank you so much
for not saying anything.

1131
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:16,360
Duh! Oh my god!

1132
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,160
Alejandro would be
in more trouble than me.

1133
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,370
Please, I care about you and
your heart way more

1134
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:25,910
than this Hollywood stuff.
Plus, you looked happy as shit.

1135
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,210
Everyone was looking for her
like idiots

1136
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,540
for her to say her phone died

1137
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,450
and that she couldn't
let anyone know.

1138
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,480
Can you believe it?
She's so selfish!

1139
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,120
That's crazy.

1140
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,230
You scared us.

1141
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,170
I... I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

1142
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,230
[Adam] To err is human.

1143
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:56,840
To forgive is divine.

1144
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,870
I wanna get back together,
Sophie. I really do.

1145
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,570
Cheating is romantic,
if you think about it.

1146
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,580
Look, I know I made
a huge mistake.

1147
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,420
Do you really want
to be treated like

1148
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,750
just another Jen?

1149
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,820
Sophie Wilder and Firephina.

1150
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,860
How much do you two
have in common?

1151
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,530
Are you the same person
at this point?

1152
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,430
Well, I booked the part when
I was in my early twenties,

1153
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,160
so, you know, when you play
a character for that long,

1154
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,600
they inevitably become
a part of who you are.

1155
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um...

1156
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,140
Going in depth.
Sorry, to you or the camera?

1157
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:35,440
To him.

1158
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,810
- [assistant] -To, uh, to...
- I'm asking him.

1159
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,780
- To me please.
- Okay.

1160
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:45,280
The love story between us
is about the unforeseen.

1161
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,190
And Doctor Thunder
has been alive for centuries.

1162
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,520
Meanwhile, Firephina
is the newer young soul

1163
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,790
that's fiery. Right. It's quite

1164
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,660
unexpected that he
would have her as a wingman.

1165
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,670
- Why is that?
- But...

1166
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,940
Because, uh,

1167
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,440
Doctor Thunder is this bitter
intellectual god type and she's,

1168
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,940
she's just corky. [chuckles]

1169
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,910
[Sophie] -Corky?
[Adam] -Yeah.

1170
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,350
She's the keeper of the
sacred flame of Kukulcan.

1171
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:17,650
- [reporter] -Okay...
- Well...

1172
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:19,080
As part of the vibe
I never caught,

1173
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,350
I think we're getting
to oily territory

1174
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,060
which I think we wanna try
to avoid.

1175
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,260
But that's what I love
about Sophie Wilder.

1176
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,590
Her enthusiasm for learning
and growing it.

1177
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,930
I think she's coming along fine.

1178
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,570
You know what my favorite
thing about Adam Clark is?

1179
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,130
What's that?

1180
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,200
He is such
a skilled snake charmer.

1181
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:40,610
All right,
I think we've had enough.

1182
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,940
- Thanks.
- Great!

1183
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,110
[Adam] Very unprofessional.

1184
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:46,180
Hey! Is this about
that lobby boy, right?

1185
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,410
Look, if you wanna get back at me
or teach me some sort of lesson,

1186
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,420
I get it. But...

1187
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,850
- him? Really?
- Wow!

1188
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,220
Okay...

1189
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,220
Whatever is going on
between me and Alejandro,

1190
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,630
who is incredible, by the way,

1191
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,200
has nothing to do with you.

1192
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,130
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah? Is that right?

1193
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:07,700
You know what?
I'm not your pet project.

1194
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,270
You're not better than me!

1195
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,370
Okay?

1196
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,470
And I don't need you,

1197
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,480
to be me.

1198
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,550
- And you're a terrible poet!
- Wow!

1199
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,280
Except for that Pablo Neruda
you played.

1200
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,420
- I did not...
- This feels incredible!

1201
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:33,230
He paid people in college
to write his papers for him!

1202
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,530
- She's making it up!
- We are firing Margo Cohen.

1203
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,670
"Hey it's Sophie.
We need to talk.

1204
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,970
Can you meet on the beach?"

1205
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,670
- Dude, that's awesome!
- Of course not!

1206
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:45,970
"We need to talk"?

1207
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,740
It's terrible news.
That's a bad text.

1208
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,410
It can't be. Look at that.

1209
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,240
- It has no punctuation. Nothing.
- That's actually good.

1210
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,280
That means
it's open to interpretation.

1211
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,620
- It means she was mad!
- It's okay! Listen.

1212
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,490
I think she wants to see you,
apologize

1213
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,750
and tell you she loves you.

1214
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,020
- Really?
- Sure! Why would she text you?

1215
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,760
What film do you live in?
Of course not!

1216
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,790
- No, no, no.
- I know life is not a movie.

1217
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,260
Ok, maybe this is good news.
You know?

1218
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,630
We almost got caught.
It's complicated.

1219
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,770
I need to end this now!

1220
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,370
Listen. Love is complicated.

1221
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,700
Do you love her? Go get her.

1222
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:23,640
[Sophie]
I was just so overwhelmed

1223
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,510
and I treated you unfairly.

1224
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:26,910
I...

1225
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,050
There's no need to apologize.

1226
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:32,220
But I like who I am
when I'm with you.

1227
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,150
And I like who I am
when I'm with you but...

1228
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,990
Wait, wait. I'm not finished.

1229
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,790
I pretended to be with Adam.
You know what?

1230
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,290
It doesn't...
It doesn't even matter.

1231
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,800
It's over. I ended that.

1232
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And now you and I don't have
to pretend, to hide anymore.

1233
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,370
Okay, but...
My future is still on the line.

1234
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:55,740
You know? And...

1235
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,240
Yeah, you're right.
That's a fantastic point.

1236
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,380
Didn't you say you want
to open up a place?

1237
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,680
Yeah, but that's...
that's later.

1238
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,950
Later?

1239
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,860
I have the weekend off.
You wanna run away?

1240
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:19,400
I would love to, really.
But I have to go to Mexico City.

1241
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,870
It's my sister's birthday and
I told my family I'd be there.

1242
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,870
Normally I'd be excited,

1243
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,410
but my dad is gonna be there
with his new lover.

1244
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,410
Dad and his new lover.

1245
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,610
Ugh, yeah.

1246
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,550
I'll go with you.

1247
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:36,120
- To Mexico City?
- Yeah.

1248
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:41,690
Oh, come on! I've never been!
And this really great guy told me

1249
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:44,990
(that it's a great city with)
(all this incredible food)

1250
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,630
(and dancing, and that's where)
(I could really learn my Spanish.)

1251
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,760
(We've both been working)
(so hard. We deserve it.)

1252
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,400
(Maybe I can get us a jet.)

1253
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,740
[Alejandro] (But...)

1254
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,600
(what about paparazzi?)
(What if they see us?)

1255
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,110
[Sophie] (So what? I'd love
that!)

1256
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,870
[Alejandro] (Aurelia would not.)
(I'd get fired, Sophie.)

1257
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,740
[Sophie] (Alejandro, no one)
(is gonna take our photo.)

1258
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,460
(It's gonna be fun. Relax.)

1259
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,780
It is impossible
to say no to you.

1260
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,150
And you know that.

1261
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:15,620
[Sophie] (No, you're doing)
(this 'cuz you want to.)

1262
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,620
[chuckles]

1263
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:23,700
[romantic music]

1264
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:35,540
[romantic music]

1265
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,560
[romantic music]

1266
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,840
What?

1267
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,050
[scream of fright]

1268
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,480
I'm sorry!

1269
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,780
[chuckles]

1270
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,990
[fans screaming]

1271
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,560
[indistinct dialogue]

1272
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,080
[fan] Who is he, Sophie?
Is he your new beau?

1273
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,290
- Are you ready?
- This is it?

1274
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,090
Wait until you see the inside.

1275
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,860
Don't be nervous.
They'll love you.

1276
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,800
I'm not nervous.

1277
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,870
I get along very well
with parents.

1278
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,600
Barbara and I
are still very close.

1279
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,240
Who's Barbara?

1280
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,870
Don't worry about it.

1281
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,580
Oh, shit. I forgot something
in the car. I'll be right back.

1282
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,080
- You... but...
- The bottle. I'll be right back.

1283
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,880
Should I...?

1284
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,020
No.

1285
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:30,760
I didn't ring the doorbell.

1286
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,760
Hi there!

1287
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,000
[scream]

1288
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,300
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

1289
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,270
I'm here with Alejandro.

1290
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,400
- Hi.
- Hi!

1291
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,270
Happy birthday.

1292
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:47,810
- Thank you!
- What's wrong, Sebas?

1293
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,010
Sophie,
this is my sister Daniela.

1294
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,040
- Hi.
- What's up, Akilita?

1295
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,480
Nice to meet you.
Happy birthday!

1296
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,210
They're lovely! Thank you!

1297
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,580
This is Sebastian.
Akila. Come in.

1298
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,050
Akila!

1299
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,790
How are you, Sebas?

1300
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,250
So good to see you!

1301
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,560
Guess who's here.

1302
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:05,860
My love!

1303
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,390
Hi, mom!

1304
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,630
- You got here so fast, my love.
- Yes.

1305
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:11,860
- Any traffic?
- No.

1306
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,700
Thank you.

1307
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,370
This is my grandmother, Annie.
Sophie.

1308
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,100
Annie, nice to meet you.

1309
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,790
- Nice to meet you.
- My grandma.

1310
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:21,740
And my mom, Monica. Sophie.

1311
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,910
Nice to meet you! Welcome!

1312
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,840
She doesn't speak
a lot of Spanish so... English.

1313
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,350
We can say anything.
She won't understand.

1314
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,050
- No!
- A little.

1315
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,980
It's so nice to meet you, guys.

1316
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,420
- You're welcome, Sophie.
- It's great having you.

1317
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,770
Let me take your coat off.

1318
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,020
Yes, yes. Thank you.

1319
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,530
Come, I'll show you something.

1320
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,930
Here we have
the very Mexican table.

1321
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:47,600
This looks incredible.

1322
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,000
Sopes.

1323
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,700
Guacamole.

1324
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:51,970
Cheese.

1325
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,370
Thank you.

1326
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,370
Thank you, Sebas.

1327
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,340
Nopales.

1328
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,710
Those are very spicy.

1329
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:59,640
He made me "prepared chips"
the other day.

1330
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,510
He made you?

1331
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:02,950
And a cake.

1332
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,350
He cooked for you?

1333
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,720
Yeah!

1334
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,390
You don't even make
popcorn for my birthday.

1335
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:09,990
Of course I do. Of course I do.

1336
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,620
Alejandro, come help me
in the kitchen.

1337
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,090
Now?

1338
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:15,960
I'll help you too, mom.
Stay with grandma, hon.

1339
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,500
Grandma, keep an eye on her!

1340
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,160
We'll be fine. We'll use signs.

1341
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,000
- Right, sweetie? Sit here.
- Yes.

1342
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,990
I want to know everything!

1343
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,870
You didn't tell me
you'd bring someone!

1344
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,340
- Is she your girlfriend?
- It was last minute.

1345
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,310
- Do you want a beer?
- I want to know who she is.

1346
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,080
Son!

1347
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,310
She's a friend.
I met her at the hotel.

1348
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,750
- From LA?
- No one believes you. Come on.

1349
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,650
Listen. We met at the hotel.
She is working.

1350
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,690
We met, we became friends,
that's all!

1351
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:45,890
What work?

1352
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:49,460
"We are getting to
know each other."

1353
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,430
How are you "getting to know"
each other?

1354
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,470
- Tell me!
- Have you slept together?

1355
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,770
- Come on!
- They did!

1356
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,370
They love gossip.

1357
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,010
But you don't have
to keep me company.

1358
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,340
Join them in the kitchen!

1359
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,180
To the kitchen? No, no, no.

1360
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,150
I don't cook.
I can't make a cake from a box.

1361
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,350
Cake!

1362
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,690
Grandma!

1363
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,030
Alejandro

1364
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,460
gave me some of your famous
recipe, your chocolate cake!

1365
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:25,430
Ah, yeah!

1366
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,170
I owe you a hug!

1367
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,470
Thank you very much!

1368
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,940
Let's toast for the pleasure
of being together!

1369
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,270
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1370
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:36,910
Happy birthday!

1371
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,340
Sh!

1372
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,110
It's Akilita.

1373
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,820
What's up, Akilita?
You scared me.

1374
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,450
What is it? Come here! Akila!

1375
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,220
That's a very special pink.
It's called Mexican pink.

1376
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,060
- It's the same as on the taxis.
- Yeah.

1377
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,130
Then the jacaranda tree,
so everything was built...

1378
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,700
Oh, I gave your grandma a hug
for the chocolate cake recipe.

1379
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,500
No!

1380
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,880
Yeah. I said I would.

1381
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,200
What?

1382
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,800
Why are you laughing?

1383
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,770
She hates chocolate cake.

1384
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:10,240
Hates it! I just didn't want
the night to end.

1385
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,080
You lied to me?

1386
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,250
You're a jester.

1387
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,880
[Alejandro senior]
This is Veronica, my fianc e.

1388
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,420
Happy birthday!

1389
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:22,490
Welcome!

1390
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,290
She's... she's young.

1391
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,970
Yeah.

1392
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,360
- Hi! Happy birthday!
- Alejandrito!

1393
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,230
Hi.

1394
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,270
- How are you?
- Fine.

1395
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,940
- This is Sophie, this is my...
- Alejandro, nice to meet you.

1396
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,240
Nice to meet you.

1397
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,940
She's my fianc, Veronica.

1398
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,040
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1399
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,840
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1400
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,960
I've heard a lot about you
from your dad.

1401
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,280
Same here.

1402
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,380
I think I saw you
in one of those TV shows?

1403
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,550
You're an actress.

1404
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,020
- Yeah, yeah, I am.
- Great!

1405
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,060
I imagine you stay quite busy.
What's your next project?

1406
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,360
Um...

1407
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,060
I'm not actually sure. I'm just
circling some things right now.

1408
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,600
Oh, great for you!

1409
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,740
You can have Alejandro
picking up all those red M&Ms

1410
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,840
and carrying luggage, no?

1411
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,310
[chuckles]

1412
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,140
I'm going to the bathroom.

1413
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,510
Okay.

1414
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,980
She's so lovely.

1415
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,390
Lovely.

1416
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,690
And how long
are you staying here?

1417
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,820
Just tonight.
Came here for the birthday.

1418
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,260
Great,
it means a lot to your sister.

1419
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,890
Yeah, I know.

1420
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,930
How's your lobby life?

1421
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,130
I'm the junior manager now.

1422
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:42,070
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1423
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,500
- A promotion?
- A while ago.

1424
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:48,170
Great. [chuckles]

1425
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:52,210
Let me help you.
I can invest in your business.

1426
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,010
I don't need you to.

1427
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:55,610
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

1428
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,520
Thanks.

1429
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:58,620
Okay.

1430
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,550
Do me a favor?

1431
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,620
Be nice to my fianc e.

1432
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:07,430
Can you speak English?
She doesn't speak Spanish.

1433
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,960
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1434
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,530
She's so cute! [chuckles]

1435
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,220
You survived!

1436
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,140
Yeah, thanks to you.

1437
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:22,540
- He's intense.
- He's an asshole.

1438
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:28,250
This house! This house,
you were saying, it's...

1439
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,150
it's this architect.

1440
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,820
Luis Barrag n.

1441
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,050
It was gonna be built
a bit differently

1442
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,590
and she doesn't like
me to say it,

1443
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,220
but she had like a flirtatious
relationship with him.

1444
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:42,230
- Oh!
- And one of the rooms...

1445
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:46,060
- The thing you told us.
- Shut up! That's a secret.

1446
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,170
[laughter]

1447
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,090
Having fun?

1448
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,200
Our little wonderful
dysfunctional family.

1449
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:57,310
So much fun. It's amazing you
guys managed to stay friends.

1450
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,340
We're friends because
we were never in love,

1451
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,180
but we love our kids.

1452
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:05,320
She doesn't need to hear
the whole family story, that's...

1453
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,090
I would love to hear
the whole family story.

1454
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,420
- Where is the bathroom?
- Spanish?

1455
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:16,030
- Down the hall, to the right.
- Thank you.

1456
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,730
She's beautiful.

1457
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,930
I'm in love with this man.

1458
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,270
(Wait, his odd)
(douchebag father?)

1459
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,300
Alejandro, not the dad.

1460
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:31,040
(Oh, my god. This is such a relief)
(to hear because I was deeply sad)

1461
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,340
(when we got the "New York)
(or Nowhere" news. I was like:)

1462
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,310
(This is not the kind of news)
(you want to hear when you're)

1463
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,980
(on your proverbial honeymoon)
(with the hot hotel guy.)

1464
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,620
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

1465
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,490
(Chris didn't tell you?)
(Perfect.)

1466
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:46,760
(Yeah, um, we didn't)
(get the movie.)

1467
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,460
(I'm so sorry.)

1468
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,760
How long will the romance
with the star last?

1469
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:52,330
Alejandro, be optimistic.

1470
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,470
Please.

1471
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,900
They're young.
She is a famous star.

1472
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,240
A millionaire.

1473
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,710
How much do you make
a month at your job?

1474
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:02,310
- Don't listen to him.
- Here we go.

1475
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,670
No, come on.

1476
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:05,610
He is...

1477
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,780
They gave it to someone else.

1478
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,250
[Rachel] (I know, I know, you
were) (robbed. Movies are not life.)

1479
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:14,320
(Love is life. And you and)
(Alejandro are clearly in love.)

1480
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,450
Okay.

1481
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:16,950
- How much do you earn?
- Son.

1482
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,260
Do you know what will happen
to her in her next job

1483
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,760
when she falls in love
with the protagonist

1484
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,490
or the antagonist?
That's how they are.

1485
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:26,360
You have to focus
on what you must do.

1486
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,330
[Rachel] (I am so happy for
you.) (Can you let yourself)

1487
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,200
(be happy for you, for once?)
(I love you. Go enjoy.)

1488
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,270
- I love you.
[Rachel] (-Okay, bye girl.)

1489
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,050
Just because you do that,
doesn't mean she will.

1490
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,510
- I do that?
- What's the number

1491
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:44,950
- of this marriage?
- Honey.

1492
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:47,050
- Four right?
- Do you love her?

1493
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,620
We're talking about you.
It's always about you.

1494
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,460
- What do you expect from her?
- She is just a tourist.

1495
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

1496
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,470
What's wrong?

1497
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,170
Nothing.

1498
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,010
Oh, no, I just found out I didn't
book "New York or Nowhere".

1499
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,750
I'm sorry to hear that.
You know what?

1500
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,450
It wasn't meant to be.

1501
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:19,750
No, it's okay, it's the sudden
strike, it's a heartbreak.

1502
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:20,720
Perks of the job.

1503
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,620
Yeah.

1504
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:28,730
So, what are you gonna
do next after all this?

1505
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,830
After all this?

1506
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,100
Yeah, like, when you're
done with the movie.

1507
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,640
Uh...

1508
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,800
Uh, I don't know.

1509
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:43,670
I don't know. Go on a trip.
Or something. I guess.

1510
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,280
Sorry, I think I missed
something.

1511
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,420
Did you just tell your dad
that I'm just a tourist?

1512
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,450
I was joking.

1513
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,790
Okay, well, let me know how
much I owe you for the services.

1514
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,300
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a joke.

1515
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:09,270
Anything else you wanna say?

1516
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,240
No.

1517
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:18,410
[indistinct chatter]

1518
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:30,190
I feel like such an idiot.
Why am I here?

1519
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,190
You could've told me
if you didn't want me to come.

1520
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,820
You invited yourself.

1521
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:45,400
Okay, so, I'm sorry, I just...

1522
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,810
This is just a thing you do,
you take girls out

1523
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:50,210
and you show them how to
squeeze lime on everything

1524
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:52,340
- and then you sleep with them?
- Sophie, calm down.

1525
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,150
- Calm down?
- Yeah. You're acting a bit...

1526
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,680
Crazy?

1527
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,890
Sorry, I just think I'm realizing
that you might be full of shit.

1528
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,320
[Monica] The photo.

1529
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,460
[Daniela] Photo.

1530
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,490
[Grandma] The photo!

1531
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,600
[indistinct chatter]

1532
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,570
[Sebastian] Photo, come on!

1533
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,840
[Sebastian] Photo!

1534
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,040
I'm full of shit?

1535
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:26,510
You're in a fake relationship
with someone, Sophie.

1536
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,810
Now is just your little fantasy.

1537
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,520
- My little fantasy?
- Yeah, but that's what you do

1538
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,220
because actors play pretend.
And that's okay.

1539
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,690
I was very, very clear
from the very beginning.

1540
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:39,560
I was focused on my career
and I thought you were too.

1541
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,430
You never go after
what you want!

1542
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:46,800
And you have no idea
what you deserve.

1543
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,500
And you do?

1544
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:54,810
I thought I did.

1545
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:59,740
[indistinct chatter]

1546
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,450
[Daniela] Alejandro, come!
We're ready for the photo.

1547
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:04,580
A photo, yeah!

1548
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,420
[Daniela] -Come!
[Sebastian] -Come now!

1549
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,820
[Alejandro senior] Come!

1550
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:09,420
Come now!

1551
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,790
Here.

1552
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,890
One, two, three!

1553
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:20,430
[romantic music]

1554
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,440
[sound of waves]

1555
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,280
SOPHIE WILDER CHEATS ON
ADAM CLARK WITH HOTEL EMPLOYEE!

1556
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,720
- What will I do without you?
- Aurelia, it was a mistake!

1557
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,180
I'm sorry.

1558
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:43,020
- I don't want to lose you.

Well, now your plan can be
to go run away with your artist.

01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,930
Oh my God!

1734
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,700
I know, don't you love it?

1735
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:00,040
And if this works, honey, we can
do a prequel to the prequel.

1736
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,240
A Firephina story.

1737
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,040
What if... Hear me out now.

1738
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,340
What if, darling,

1739
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:08,980
we made it into a musical?

1740
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,220
Okay, too much. Or rather a film

1741
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:17,390
with music. You like it,
I see it, I love it.

1742
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,020
Oh, my God, kill me now!
I need a picture, please!

1743
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,060
[chuckles] Of course!

1744
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,470
You're my idol. I wanna be you
when I grow up. You've no idea!

1745
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:33,000
Oh! You're so sweet!
It's nice to meet you too.

1746
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,540
Keep that fire in you safe and

1747
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:38,310
one day when you're older,
you can be just like Firephina.

1748
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:42,280
I don't wanna be like her,
I wanna be like you! Okay, bye!

1749
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:52,920

[sighs]

1752
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:11,240
Goddamnit!

1753
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,150
- Oh, you want me to leave.
- No. No. No.

1754
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:18,280
Don't leave.
Goddamnit is because

1755
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,480
I thought I'd
never see you again.

1756
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,790
You're moving.

1757
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:28,630
I'm opening my place
in San Miguel.

1758
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,280
You took my advice!

1759
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,100
I did.

1760
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:37,400
What are you doing here?

1761
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:42,510
Do you have a late night menu?

1762
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:57,350
I'm standing here

1763
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:58,490
in your...

1764
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:00,360
outdoor kitchen

1765
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,530
asking you:

1766
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,230
Do you have a late night menu?

1767
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,050
Because I'm hungry.

1768
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,650
The thing is

1769
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,020
I hate cooking.

1770
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:37,460
It takes longer to make
the meal than it does to eat it.

1771
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,400
Great.

1772
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:52,280
[romantic music]

1773
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,950
I love you too,

1774
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,680
by the way.

1775
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:09,420
[romantic music]

1776
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:41,790
- Hey!
- Hi!

1777
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,200
I guess I gotta try
Doctor Thunder.

1778
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,730
Okay. Coming right up.

1779
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:50,370
- Hi, Tachi.
- Hey.

1780
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,440
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

1781
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,410
I actually just convinced
Jennifer Coolidge

1782
01:36:56,610 --> 01:37:00,710
to play Mrs. Potato Head
in a very dark origin story.

1783
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:02,050
It's gonna be good.

1784
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,150
Oh! That sounds incredible!

1785
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:08,540
- You're good at your job, huh?
- Big time stuff.

1786
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:11,450
- I'm a big fan, mister Clark.
- Thank you, very much.

1787
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,860
You know?
I'm an aspiring actress myself.

1788
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,630
Got any tips for me?

1789
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:18,300
Yeah, um...

1790
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,460
Always stay in character,
never try and be funny.

1791
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,930
- All right?
- Thank you!

1792
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,600
Good luck!

1793
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,300
My dream is to be a dancer,
you know? I'm always practicing.

1794
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,340
Dance music, why not?

1795
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,870
[chuckles]

1796
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:34,610
I love dancing. Let's see it.

1797
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:38,150
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1798
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:39,650
Okay.

1799
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,120
I have to go and tell Joe.

1800
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:44,540
She doesn't have the rights
to remix "Who Let the Dogs Out".

1801
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:48,460
And I said, if not her, who?
Who, who, who?

1802
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,460
- Yeah?
- Sure, okay.

1803

[dancing music]

1804
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,200
[chuckles] Okay!

1805
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,680
Oh!

1806
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,810
My goodness! Wow!

1807
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,520
I'm speechless. Speechless.

1808
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,240
Thank you! Cheers!

1809
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:21,260
Yeah.
