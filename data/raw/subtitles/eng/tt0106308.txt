1
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,757
<i>My name is Ash, and I am a slave.</i>

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,913
<i>Close as I can figure it,
the year is 1300 AD,</i>

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,429
<i>and I'm being dragged to my death.</i>

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,233
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,715
<i>I had a real life once.</i>

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,952
<i>A job.</i>

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,515
<i>Ash to price check four.</i>

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,429
Um, hardware. Aisle 12.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,551
Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,638
<i>I had a wonderful girlfriend - Linda.</i>

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,036
<i>Together we drove
to a small cabin in the mountains.</i>

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,398
<i>It seems an archeologist
had come to this remote place</i>

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,318
<i>to translate and study his latest find:</i>

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,429
<i>"Necronomicon ex Mortis",</i>

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,949
<i>"The Book of the Dead".</i>

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,796
<i>Bound in human flesh and inked in blood,</i>

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,198
<i>this ancient Sumerian text
contained bizarre burial rites,</i>

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,598
<i>funerary incantations
and demon-resurrection passages.</i>

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,878
<i>It was never meant for
the world of the living.</i>

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,958
<i>The book awoke
something dark in the woods.</i>

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,635
<i>It took Linda.</i>

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,638
<i>And then it came for me.</i>

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,195
<i>It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.</i>

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,673
<i>But that didn't stop it. It came back.</i>

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,116
<i>Big time.</i>

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,196
My God! How do you stop it?!

27
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,838
Where the hell...?

28
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,035
Now... easy now, chief.

29
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,233
I don't know how I got here,
and... I'm not lookin' for any trouble.

30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,317
What a piece of armor this is!

31
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,877
- Wiseman!
- Fall back. Back on your horses.

32
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,595
<i>My lord, I believe he is the one
written of in the Necronomicon.</i>

33
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,154
He who is prophesied
to fall from the heavens

34
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,874
and deliver us from
the terrors of the Deadites.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,552
What? That buffoon?
Likely... he's one of Henry's men!

36
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,593
Kneel, rapscallion!

37
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,710
I say to the pit with him!

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,753
Thou shalt soon learn
the horrors of the pit.

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,190
- To the pit!
- You miserable bastard!

40
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,711
Get off of me!

41
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,236
Pick up your feet.
Stop draggin' your feet. Come on.

42
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,954
Move along. Come on now.

43
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,758
Come on, pick it up. Have a taste of this.

44
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,877
You men, you've got something to look
forward to when you get to the castle.

45
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,199
Lord Arthur approaches.
Raise the portcullis!

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,759
Lord Arthur!
Lord Arthur approaches!

47
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,431
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Did he not ride with you?

48
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,630
Aye. And fought valiantly.

49
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,150
But last night he fell in battle
to Duke Henry's men.

50
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,116
I'm sorry, Sheila. Come on.

51
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,470
Foul thing!

52
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,239
A pox on your throat! Thou art a murderer!

53
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,316
A black murderer!

54
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,514
My brother's death shall be avenged!

55
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,195
Company, halt!

56
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,235
Get that yoke off him.

57
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,798
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.

58
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,350
Who are you?

59
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,994
Who wants to know?

60
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,111
I am Henry the Red,

61
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,552
Duke of Shale, lord of the Northlands
and leader of its peoples.

62
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,677
Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.

63
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,396
You ain't leadin' but two things right now -
jack and shit. And jack left town.

64
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,957
- Shut your bleedin' hole!
- Noble gentlemen, Lord Arthur!

65
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,156
There is an evil awakened in this land.

66
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,829
And while my people fight
for their very souls against it,

67
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,758
you, Henry the Red, wage war on us.

68
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,836
Charlatan!

69
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,438
It was you who first turned
your swords on us,

70
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,518
and this evil has befouled
my people as well!

71
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,518
Your people are no better
than the foul corruption

72
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,679
- that lies in the bowels of that pit.
- Right! You're no better!

73
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,758
May God have mercy upon your souls.

74
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,235
In God's name,
what hell-spawned thing lurks there?

75
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,669
Into the pit with those
bloodthirsty sons of whores!

76
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,358
No! No!

77
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,989
Heavenly God!

78
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,676
He's escaping!

79
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,074
Hold him!

80
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,076
He trembles!

81
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,352
- They don't look so clever now.
- He's frightened!

82
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,154
Whoa, whoa.

83
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,078
Wait a minute. Hold it.

84
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,193
Wait a minute.
You gotta understand, man.

85
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,073
I never even saw these assholes before.

86
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,877
What are you waiting for?

87
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,912
Henry, you gotta tell him
you don't know me.

88
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,031
We never met. Tell him!

89
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,158
I do not think he'll listen, lad.

90
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,672
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

91
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,359
I'm tellin' you,
you got the wrong guy.

92
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,878
Don't you like the pit?
Isn't the pit wonderful?

93
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,431
Why, you...

94
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,673
Hah!

95
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,352
Spikes.

96
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,438
Hey, if he says spikes, give him spikes.

97
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,632
Make way.

98
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,512
Strange one.

99
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,440
Strange one!

100
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,352
Yes!

101
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,634
Damn you. Damn you!

102
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,074
You know, your shoelace is untied.

103
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,352
All right.

104
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,995
Who wants some?

105
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,872
Who's next?

106
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,434
Huh? How about it?

107
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,950
Who wants some? Huh?

108
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,396
Who wants to have a little?

109
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,232
You.

110
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,839
You want some more?

111
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,712
Huh?

112
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,156
You want a little?

113
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,792
Do you?

114
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
Do you want some more? Huh?

115
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,352
Huh?

116
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,998
Now get on those horses
and get outta here.

117
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,996
Let him go!

118
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,869
Halt!

119
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,953
Thank you, generous hosts!

120
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,472
Sword boy!

121
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,719
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.

122
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,551
Yeah.

123
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,309
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

124
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,670
See this?

125
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,759
This... is my boomstick!

126
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,917
It's a 12-gauge, double-barreled
Remington. S-Mart's top of the line.

127
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,432
You can find this in
the sporting-goods department.

128
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,757
This sweet baby was made
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

129
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,519
Retails for about 109.95.

130
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,077
It's got a walnut stock,
cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger.

131
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,039
That's right. Shop smart, shop S-Mart.

132
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,435
You got that?

133
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,835
Now I swear,

134
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,997
the next one of you primates

135
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,351
even touches me...

136
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,479
Now, let's talk about how I get back home.

137
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,188
I prithee to forgive me, my lord.

138
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,959
I believed thee one of Henry's men.

139
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,038
First you wanna kill me,
now you wanna kiss me.

140
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,272
Blow.

141
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,313
So, what's the deal?
Can you send me back or not?

142
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,831
<i>Only the Necronomicon has the power,
an unholy book which we also require.</i>

143
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,794
Within its pages are passages
that can send you back to your time.

144
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,673
Only you, the Promised One,
can quest for it.

145
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,191
I don't want your book, or your bullshit.
Send me back to my own time, pronto...

146
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,193
You shall die!

147
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,309
<i>You shall never take the Necronomicon.</i>

148
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,195
We shall feast upon your soul!

149
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,835
It's a trick. Get an axe.

150
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,196
Oh, my eyes! I'm blind!
Oh, God! I'm blind!

151
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,156
Yo, she-bitch.

152
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,794
Let's go.

153
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,513
<i>If the Deadites had the Necronomicon, all
mankind would be consumed by this evil.</i>

154
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,995
Now will thou quest for the book?

155
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,997
That one.

156
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,639
Hyah!

157
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,312
Groovy.

158
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,757
What's the matter?
You raised in a barn? Shut the door.

159
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,317
<i>Probably was raised in a barn,
with all the other primitives.</i>

160
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,672
The wisemen say that
thou art the Promised One.

161
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,153
'Tis said that thou wilt journey
for the book to help us

162
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,669
and thou wilt lead
our people against the evil.

163
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,554
The only reason I'm goin'
to get the book is to get home.

164
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,636
- I believe thou wilt leave in the morning.
- Don't touch that!

165
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,389
Your primitive intellect
wouldn't understand alloys and...

166
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,034
things with molecular structures and...

167
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,714
What are you doing here anyway?

168
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,072
I wanted to say that all of my hopes
and prayers go with thee,

169
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,156
and I made this for thee.

170
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,634
Good. I could use a horse blanket.

171
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,395
Gimme some sugar, baby.

172
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,318
Hyah!

173
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,396
Come on, boy!

174
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,235
Hyah!

175
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,233
Hyah!

176
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,516
Steady now. Whoa.

177
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,032
What? What is it?

178
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,517
This path will lead you
to an unholy place - a cemetery.

179
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,632
<i>There the Necronomicon awaits.</i>

180
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,789
When thou retrievest the book
from its cradle, you must recite:

181
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,593
Klaatu verata nikto.

182
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,310
Klaatu... verata... nikto. OK.

183
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,396
Well, repeat them.

184
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,034
Klaatu verata nikto.

185
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,355
- Again!
- I got it! I got it!

186
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,758
I know your damn words, all right?
Now you get this straight, the both of you:

187
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,633
If I get that book, you send me back.

188
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,115
After that, I'm history. Hyah!

189
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,632
What is it, boy?

190
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,029
Hyah! Come on!

191
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,352
Ugh! Argh!

192
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,396
Ramming speed!

193
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,478
- Ready.
- Aim.

194
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,669
Fire!

195
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,556
Shake a leg!

196
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,872
You lousy little...

197
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,718
Ahahaha!

198
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,994
Oh, you little bastards!

199
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,554
Whoa!

200
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,348
Wait a minute.

201
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,232
Oh, God.

202
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,031
I can't move!

203
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,116
Alley-up!

204
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,831
Whoa!

205
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,475
Geronimo!

206
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,750
OK, little fella!

207
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,633
How about some hot chocolate, huh?

208
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,714
How'd you like the taste of that, huh?
How'd you like the ta...?

209
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,794
Oh, dear God, it's growing bigger!

210
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,072
Hey! What's the big idea takin' my...?

211
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,156
Why, you...!

212
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,834
Ooh! Ooh, I'm blind. I'm blind.

213
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,275
Where are you takin' me?

214
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,636
What are you? Are you me?

215
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,548
"What are you? Are you me?"

216
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,272
You sound like a jerk!

217
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,598
- Why are you doin' this?
- You wanna know? The answer's easy.

218
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,235
I'm Bad Ash, and you're Good Ash.

219
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,157
You're Goody Little Two-Shoes.

220
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,239
Goody Little Two-Shoes.
Goody Little Two-Shoes.

221
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,828
Little Goody Two-Shoes.
Little Goody Two-Shoes.

222
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,110
Little Goody Two-Shoes.
Little Goody Two-Shoes.

223
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,670
Little Goody Two-Shoes.
Little Goody Two-Shoes.

224
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,035
Little Goody Two-Shoes. Ha-ha!

225
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,310
I ain't that good.

226
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,595
Now you see what's what.

227
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,558
A man's body is
his own personal property.

228
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,798
Don't let anybody try
and take that away from him.

229
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,237
That'll teach ya.

230
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,555
Yeah, that'll teach ya.

231
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,075
<i>You shall never retrieve
the Necronomicon.</i>

232
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,237
You'll die in the graveyard
before you get it.

233
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,875
Hey, uh... what's that
you got on your face?

234
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,228
Huh?

235
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,715
See how that works?

236
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,796
I'll come back for you!

237
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,672
I'll...

238
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,152
Hyah!

239
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,756
Come on, boy!

240
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,475
Hyah!

241
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,876
Hyah! Come on!

242
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,036
Three books?

243
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,595
Wait a minute. Hold it.

244
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,837
<i>Nobody said anything about three books.</i>

245
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,636
Ooh, that stinkin' wiseman!

246
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,799
He was so busy fillin' me full of
his secret little words and his bullshit

247
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,196
that he never said anything about this!

248
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,156
Like, what am I supposed to do?
Take one book, or all books? Or what?

249
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,192
Well...

250
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,675
Whoa. Wrong book.

251
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,796
Ow! Ow!

252
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,552
Ooh, you...

253
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,636
I'll get back to you.

254
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,912
Well...

255
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,036
Seems fairly obvious.

256
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,831
Ooh! Wait a minute.

257
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,349
The words. All right, all right, all right.

258
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,436
Say the words.

259
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,837
Klaatu... verata...

260
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,712
n...

261
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,479
Necktie.

262
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,999
Nectar.

263
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,678
Nickel.

264
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,472
Noodle.

265
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,239
It's an n-word.
It's definitely an n-word.

266
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,595
It was definitely an n-word.

267
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,313
Klaatu... verata...

268
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,076
n...

269
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,029
OK, then.

270
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,116
That's it.
