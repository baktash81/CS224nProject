1
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,820
Do you speak English?

3
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,860
Yeah.

4
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,700
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

5
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,300
Have you heard that
as couples age...

6
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,860
...they lose their ability
to hear each other?

7
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,020
No.

8
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,580
Supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear high-pitched sounds...

9
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,660
...and women lose hearing
in the low end.

10
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,380
I guess they nullify each other.

11
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,620
I guess. Nature's way of allowing
couples to grow old together...

12
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,580
...without killing each other.

13
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,940
What are you reading?

14
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,220
Oh, yeah.

15
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,180
How about you?

16
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,220
I was thinking about going
to the lounge car.

17
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,340
-Would you like to come with me?
-Yeah.

18
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,460
Okay.

19
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,100
How do you speak such good English?

20
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,860
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

21
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,500
-It's fine here?
-Yeah, this is good.

22
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,540
And I spent some time in London.

23
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,340
-Wow.
-How do you speak such good English?

24
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,140
Me? I'm American.

25
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,260
-You're American? Are you sure?
-Yeah.

26
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,340
No, I'm joking.
I knew you were American.

27
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,060
And you don't speak
any other language, right?

28
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,420
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

29
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,740
I'm the crude, dumb,
vulgar American...

30
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,460
...who doesn't speak other languages,
who has no culture. But I tried.

31
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,140
I took French in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

32
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,620
...I stood in line
at the metro station.

33
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,940
I was practicing.

34
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,460
Whatever.

35
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,900
And I get up there,
and I look at this woman...

36
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,820
...and my mind goes blank. And I say,
"l need a ticket to get to...."

37
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,420
So anyway....

38
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,540
So where are you headed?

39
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,700
Well, back to Paris.

40
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,060
-My classes start next week.
-You're still in school? Where?

41
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,260
La Sorbonne. You know?

42
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Sure.

43
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,860
You're coming from Budapest?

44
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,980
-I was visiting my grandmother.
-Oh. How is she?

45
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,580
She's okay.

46
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,860
-She's all right?
-She's fine.

47
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,020
-How about you? Where are you going?
-I'm going to Vienna.

48
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,300
Vienna?
What's there?

49
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,620
No idea.
I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

50
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,300
You're on holiday?

51
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,620
I don't really know what I'm on.
You know?

52
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,940
I've just been traveling around,
riding trains for two or three weeks.

53
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,900
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

54
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,540
I had a friend in Madrid, but....

55
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,140
-Madrid, that's nice.
-I got a Eurail pass...

56
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,420
...is what I did.

57
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,700
That's great.

58
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,260
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

59
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,260
Yeah, sure. It's been....
It sucked.

60
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,060
What?

61
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,020
It's had its....

62
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,740
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window...

63
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,100
...has actually been kind of great.

64
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,980
What do you mean?

65
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Well, you know, for instance...

66
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,300
...you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldn't have.

67
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,460
-What kind of ideas?
-Want to hear one?

68
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,540
-Tell me.
-All right.

69
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,580
I have this idea, okay,
for a television show.

70
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,340
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

71
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,060
Do you know what that is?

72
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,100
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

73
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight.

74
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
What you do is you get...

75
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,020
...365 people from cities
all over the world...

76
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,100
...to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

77
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,780
Capturing life as it's lived.

78
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,780
You know, it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning...

79
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,940
...and taking the long shower...

80
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,700
...eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

81
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,980
...reading the paper....

82
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,140
Wait. All those mundane,
boring things...

83
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,260
...everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

84
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

85
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,060
You say it your way.
I'll say it my way.

86
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,180
-Think of it like this--
-Who's gonna watch?

87
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,340
Think about it like this. Why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun...

88
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,100
...is so beautiful?
It is. It's beautiful.

89
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,780
But a guy taking money
from a bank machine...

90
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,900
...Iooks like a complete moron?

91
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,140
So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.

92
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,140
Yeah.

93
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,100
What do you think?

94
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,980
Yeah, I can see it.
Like, 24 boring hours-- Sorry--

95
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,500
...and a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

96
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,580
Yeah, and that would
be a great episode.

97
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,060
People would talk about that episode.

98
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,980
You and your friends could
do one in Paris if you wanted.

99
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,780
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

100
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,740
Getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously.

101
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,420
Because it would have to play all
the time, or it just wouldn't work.

102
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,500
Thank you.

103
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,020
Thanks.

104
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,500
You know what?
Not service oriented.

105
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,300
Just an observation about Europe.

106
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,060
My parents never really
spoke of the possibility...

107
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,660
...of my falling in love or
getting married or having children.

108
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,940
Even as a little girl...

109
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,420
...they wanted me to think as
a future career as a, you know...

110
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,700
...interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

111
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,580
I'd say to my dad,
"l want to be a writer."

112
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,460
And he'd say, "Journalist."

113
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,980
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats. He'd say, "Veterinarian."

114
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,660
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

115
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,700
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these...

116
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,140
...practical moneymaking ventures.

117
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,780
I had a good bullshit detector
when I was a kid.

118
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,340
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

119
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,500
By high school, I was dead set...

120
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,740
...on listening to what everybody
thought I should do with my life...

121
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
...and doing the opposite.

122
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,180
Nobody was ever mean about it.
I just could never get very excited...

123
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,420
...about other people's ambitions
for my life.

124
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,540
But you know what?
If your parents never...

125
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,220
...fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive...

126
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,380
Right.

127
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,540
...it makes it even harder
to officially complain.

128
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,460
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

129
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,980
You know what I mean?

130
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,420
I hate it.

131
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,300
I really hate it.

132
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,180
Well, you know, despite all that
kind of bullshit...

133
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,940
...that comes along with it...

134
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,180
...I remember childhood as...

135
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,980
...this magical time.

136
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,900
I do. I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

137
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,660
My great-grandmother had died, and my
family had visited them in Florida.

138
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,820
I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

139
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,340
Anyway, I was in
the back yard playing...

140
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,980
...and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

141
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,260
...and do it in such a way that...

142
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,060
...it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow.

143
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,300
And so I was doing that...

144
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
...and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

145
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,900
And she was just standing there,
smiling at me.

146
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,100
And I held it there for a long time...

147
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,020
...and I looked at her.

148
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,380
And then finally, I let go
of the nozzle, you know?

149
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,460
And then I dropped the hose...

150
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,300
...and she disappeared.

151
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,740
And so I run back inside
and tell my parents.

152
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,220
And they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how...

153
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,300
...when people die, you never see
them again, and how I'd imagined it.

154
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,940
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was glad I saw that.

155
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,940
I've never seen anything
like that since. But I don't know.

156
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,020
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

157
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,620
Even death.

158
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,100
You're lucky you can have
this attitude toward death.

159
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,780
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

160
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,260
I swear. I mean, that's why
I'm in a train right now.

161
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,020
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm scared.

162
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,420
-Oh, come on.
-I can't help it.

163
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,860
I know the statistics say,
"Na, na, na, it's safer." Whatever.

164
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,060
When I'm in a plane,
I can see the explosion.

165
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,460
I can see me falling
through the clouds.

166
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,740
And I'm so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness...

167
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,220
...before you die.
When you know you're gonna die.

168
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,180
I can't stop thinking that way.

169
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,780
It's exhausting.

170
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,460
Yeah, I bet.

171
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,380
Really exhausting.

172
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,500
-I think this is Vienna.
-Yeah.

173
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,380
-You get off here, no?
-Yeah, what a drag.

174
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,100
I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

175
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,540
Yeah, me too.

176
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,340
It was really nice of you too.

177
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,020
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this...

178
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,140
...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

179
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,060
What?

180
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,700
I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...

181
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,540
...but I feel like we have
some kind of...

182
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
...connection. Right?

183
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,380
Yeah. Me too.

184
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,540
Right. Great.
Here's the deal.

185
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,020
Get off here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

186
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,780
-What?
-Come on. It'll be fun.

187
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,860
-Come on.
-What would we do?

188
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,460
I don't know. All I know is I catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

189
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,860
...and I can't afford a hotel,
so I was going to walk around...

190
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,860
...and it'd be more fun
if you came with me.

191
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,620
And if I turn out to be a psycho,
just get on the next train.

192
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,940
All right, all right.
Think of it like this.

193
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,860
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

194
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,180
And you're married.

195
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,060
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy it used to have.

196
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,180
You start to blame your husband.

197
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,180
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

198
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,860
...and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

199
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,980
I'm one of those guys.
That's me.

200
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,980
So think of this as time travel...

201
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,940
...from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

202
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,340
What this could be is
a gigantic favor...

203
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,020
...to you and your husband to find out
you're not missing anything.

204
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,100
I'm just as big a loser as he is.
Unmotivated. Boring.

205
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,820
You made the right choice.
You're happy.

206
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,820
Let me get my bag.

207
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,420
We should get a locker for all this.

208
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,420
What's your name?

209
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,700
My name?

210
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,260
Jesse. James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

211
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,540
You mean, Jesse James, no?

212
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,980
No. No, just Jesse.

213
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm Celine.

214
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,660
This is a nice bridge.

215
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,060
Yeah.

216
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,780
This is kind of weird.

217
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,580
Isn't it? I mean,
I feel a little awkward.

218
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,420
-But it's all right. Right?
-Yeah, this is great.

219
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,220
-Let's go to some places.
-Yeah, let's go to some places.

220
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,860
-Let's ask these guys.
-Okay.

221
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,340
Excuse me. Excuse me?

222
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,180
Sprechen sie English?

223
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,700
-Ja. Of course.
-Do you speak German for a change?

224
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,620
-What?
-No, it was a joke.

225
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,460
We just got into Vienna today, and
we're looking for something fun to do.

226
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,340
Like museums, exhibitions....

227
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,820
But museums are not that
funny anymore these days.

228
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,140
They are closing right now.
How long are you going to be here?

229
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,460
Just for tonight.

230
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,660
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

231
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,700
We're on honeymoon.

232
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,860
Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married....

233
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,420
I don't believe you.
You're a bad liar.

234
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,900
This is a play we're both in.
We would like to invite you.

235
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,340
You're actors?

236
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,660
Not professional.
Part-time for fun.

237
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
It's a play about a cow and
lndians searching for it.

238
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,500
There are also
politicians, Mexicans--

239
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,540
Russians, communists....

240
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,540
-You have a real cow on stage?
-No, an actor in a cow costume.

241
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,580
-He's the cow.
-Yes, I am the cow.

242
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,780
-And the cow's a bit weird.
-The cow has a disease.

243
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,260
She's acting a bit strange.
Like a dog.

244
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,980
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it.

245
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,300
And she can smoke with hoofs
and everything.

246
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,180
-Great.
-As you see, there is the address.

247
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
It's in the second district.

248
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,780
Near the Prater. You know it?

249
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,780
The big Ferris wheel?
We should go. We should.

250
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,420
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

251
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,340
It starts at 2130.

252
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,700
-2130?
-It's at 9:30.

253
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,860
-9:30.
-Oh, right.

254
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,700
What's the name of this play?

255
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,860
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns
of Wilmington's Cow."

256
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,100
I'm Wilmington's cow.

257
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,980
-All right.
-Great.

258
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,220
-You'll be there?
-We'll try.

259
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,140
I'm the cow.

260
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,300
Goodbye.

261
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,420
I got an idea. Are you ready?

262
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,180
It's Q and A time.
We've known each other a little while.

263
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,180
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

264
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
All right?

265
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,580
-We ask each other questions?
-And you have to answer honestly.

266
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,460
-Of course.
-Okay.

267
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,380
All right, first question.

268
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,700
-You.
-Yes, I am going to ask you.

269
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,460
Describe for me your
first sexual feelings...

270
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
...towards a person.

271
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,780
My first sexual feelings?
Oh, my God.

272
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,580
I know. I know.

273
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,460
Jean-Marc Fleury.

274
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
Jean-Marc Fleury?

275
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,780
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

276
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,220
He had bleached-out
chlorine hair and green eyes...

277
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,580
...and to improve his times,
he'd shave his legs and arms.

278
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,060
-That's disgusting.
-He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

279
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,380
My friend Emma
had a big crush on him.

280
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,860
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

281
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,700
...and he came walking up beside me.
I told him...

282
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,140
..."You should date Emma.
She has a big crush on you."

283
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,820
And he turned to me and said...

284
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,740
..."Well, that's too bad, because
I have a big crush on you."

285
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,980
So, yeah, it really scared
the hell out of me...

286
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,260
...because I thought he was so fine.

287
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,260
Then he officially asked me on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

288
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,540
You know, I was so afraid of
what I might do, you know.

289
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,460
So I went to see him swim
a few times at the competition.

290
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,540
And he was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

291
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,060
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

292
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,540
...and, you know, promised we would
keep writing forever...

293
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,900
...and meet again very soon and--

294
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Did you?

295
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,740
Of course not.

296
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,580
Then this is the opportune time
to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

297
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,340
-Really?
-Yeah.

298
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,420
-I make note of that.
-Okay.

299
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,980
-So it's my turn. No?
-Yes, your turn.

300
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,380
Hit me.

301
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,940
Have you ever been in love?

302
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,580
Yes.

303
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,860
Next question.

304
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,020
-What was the--
-Wait a minute.

305
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,500
-So I can give one-word answers?
-Why not?

306
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,460
After I went into detail
about my sexual feelings?

307
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,900
They're different questions. I could
answer the sexual-feelings thing.

308
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,660
But, you know, love-- I mean,
what if I asked you about love?

309
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,460
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

310
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,140
Love is a complex issue, you know?

311
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,900
I mean, yes, I've told somebody
that I love them, and I've meant it.

312
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,180
But was it totally unselfish,
giving love?

313
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,220
Was it a beautiful thing?

314
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,340
Not really.
You know, it's like, love....

315
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,660
I mean, I don't know.

316
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,140
You know?

317
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,740
-Yeah. I know what you mean.
-But as far as sexual feelings go...

318
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,660
...it started with
an obsessive relationship...

319
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,780
...with Miss July, 1978.
Do you know Playboy magazine?

320
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,220
-I've heard of it.
-You know Crystal?

321
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,020
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

322
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,700
Is it my turn now?

323
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,500
Tell me something that
really pisses you off.

324
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,140
-Really drives you crazy.
-Pisses me off.

325
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,980
-God, everything pisses me off.
-List a couple.

326
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,380
Oh, I know. I hate being told
by strange men...

327
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,380
...strange men in the street...

328
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,180
...you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

329
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,740
What else?

330
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,220
I hate....

331
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,740
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war...

332
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,060
...people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do.

333
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,460
Or they don't give a shit.
I don't know.

334
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,140
I hate that the media's
trying to control our minds.

335
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,900
-The media?
-Yeah, the media.

336
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,460
It's very subtle, but it's
a new form of fascism, really.

337
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,380
I hate....

338
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,660
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America...

339
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,220
...each time I wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything...

340
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,540
...they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

341
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,980
I hate that.
I can't stand that. Really.

342
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Is that all?

343
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,660
Well, there's a lot of things, but....

344
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,260
-So it's my turn.
-Okay.

345
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,660
-You're gonna answer.
-Yes, I'll answer.

346
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,540
What's a problem for you?

347
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,500
You, probably.

348
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,700
What?

349
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,300
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

350
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,220
...qualifies as a problem.

351
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,460
What is it?

352
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,540
It was a thought I had
on the train, so....

353
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,300
Okay. All right.

354
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,300
Do you believe in reincarnation?

355
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,420
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

356
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,700
A lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that, you know?

357
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,220
And even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

358
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,620
...people have a notion
of an eternal soul.

359
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
-Yeah.
-Okay.

360
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,260
This is my thought:
50,000 years ago...

361
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,340
...there's not even a million people.

362
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,220
Ten thousand years ago,
there's, like, two million people.

363
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,220
Now there's between five and six
billion people on the planet.

364
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,860
If we all have our own...

365
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,900
...individual, unique...

366
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,020
...soul...

367
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,180
...where did they all come from?

368
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,820
Are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls?

369
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,820
If they are, that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

370
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,620
...in the last 50,000 years, which is
a blip in the Earth's time.

371
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,940
So at best, we're these
tiny fractions...

372
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,540
...of people walking--

373
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,900
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

374
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,580
Wait a minute, I'm not sure--

375
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,100
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

376
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,100
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

377
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,380
I agree with you.

378
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,420
Let's get off this damn train.

379
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,260
This place is pretty neat.

380
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,420
Yeah.

381
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,860
There's even a listening booth.

382
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,700
Have you heard of this singer?

383
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,580
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

384
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,980
Do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works?

385
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,300
Yeah, okay.

386
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,900
There's a wind that
Blows in from the north

387
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,740
And it says that loving
Takes this course

388
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,620
Come here

389
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,220
Come here

390
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,180
No, I'm not impossible to touch

391
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,020
I have never wanted you so much

392
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,020
Come here

393
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,900
Come here

394
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,020
Have I never laid down by your side

395
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,660
Baby, let's forget about this pride

396
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,700
Come here

397
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,660
Come here

398
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,060
Look at this. This is beautiful.

399
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,420
Quick. It's leaving.

400
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,500
Look, there's a rabbit.

401
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,060
Yeah.

402
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,580
Hey there, rabbit.

403
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,060
It's so cute.

404
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,860
I visited this as a young teenager.

405
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,340
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums.

406
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,260
Yeah? It's tiny.

407
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,500
I know.

408
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,060
A little old man talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

409
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,980
He explained that most
of the people buried here...

410
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,580
...had washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

411
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,420
How old are these?

412
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,540
Around the beginning of the century.
It's called No Name Cemetery...

413
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,220
...because they often didn't know
who those people were.

414
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Maybe a first name, that's all.

415
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Why were all the bodies washing up?

416
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,540
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

417
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,900
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

418
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,420
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

419
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
When I was a little girl,
I thought...

420
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,180
...if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

421
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,300
...then it's like
not really being dead.

422
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,260
People can invent the best
and the worst for you.

423
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,580
Here she is, I think.

424
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,100
Yeah, this is the one
I remember the most.

425
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,420
She was only 13 when she died.

426
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,060
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

427
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,940
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

428
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,140
That's funny.

429
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,580
That's the Danube over there.

430
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,660
That's a river, right?

431
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,860
Yeah.

432
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,980
This is...

433
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,580
...gorgeous.

434
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,580
Yeah, this is beautiful.

435
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,740
I mean, we got....

436
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,580
We got a sunset here.

437
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,740
-Yeah.
-We got the Ferris wheel.

438
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,500
It seems like...

439
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,700
...this would be a....

440
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,500
What?

441
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,740
You know....

442
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,060
Are you trying to say
you want to kiss me?

443
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,460
But you know what?

444
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,500
It doesn't matter what
generation you're born into.

445
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,900
Look at my parents.

446
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,100
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

447
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,940
The government, their conservative
Catholic backgrounds....

448
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,460
Then I was born, and my father
became a successful architect.

449
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,580
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges...

450
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,900
...and, you know, towers and stuff.

451
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,860
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

452
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,980
They love me more than anything...

453
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,180
...and I've been raised with all
the freedom they fought for.

454
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,300
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

455
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,700
We have to deal with the same shit,
but we can't really know...

456
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,300
...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

457
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,220
I don't know if
there really is an enemy.

458
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

459
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,900
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

460
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,380
Too much attention,
not enough attention.

461
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,660
They either left or
taught them the wrong things.

462
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,500
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other much...

463
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,500
...who got married and had a kid.

464
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,900
And they tried their best
to be nice to me.

465
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,900
-Did your parents divorce?
-Yeah, finally.

466
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,260
They should have done it sooner.
They stuck together...

467
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,940
...for the well-being of my sister
and l. Thank you very much.

468
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,540
I remember my mother told me
right in front of my father...

469
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,180
...that he didn't really
want to have me.

470
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,540
That he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant.

471
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,220
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

472
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,500
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

473
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,660
That's so sad.

474
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Well, I mean, I eventually
kind of took pride in it.

475
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,460
You know, like my life
was my own doing.

476
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,660
You know, like I was
crashing the big party.

477
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,820
That's the way to see it.

478
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,260
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

479
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,180
But I think it's healthy to rebel
against everything that came before.

480
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,620
You know, I've been wondering lately...

481
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,620
...do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

482
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,100
Yeah, sure. You know,
I know happy couples.

483
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,820
But I think they lie to each other.

484
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,740
Yeah.

485
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,660
People can live their
whole life as a lie.

486
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,700
My grandmother was married...

487
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,860
...and I thought she had an
uncomplicated love life.

488
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,900
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

489
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,060
...dreaming about another man
she was in love with.

490
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,460
She just accepted her fate.
It's so sad.

491
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,660
In the same time, I love that
she had these emotions...

492
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,060
...and feelings I never
thought she had.

493
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,420
I guarantee you
it was better that way.

494
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,820
If she'd known him, he'd have
disappointed her eventually.

495
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,300
-How do you know?
-I know. I know.

496
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,940
People put romantic projections
on everything.

497
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,740
It's not based in any kind of reality.

498
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,460
Romantic projections?
Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

499
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,860
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

500
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,380
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

501
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,220
Check these guys out.

502
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,740
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not
wearing underwear underneath this."

503
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,500
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you? "

504
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,020
Can I tell you a secret?

505
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Yeah.

506
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,660
Come here.

507
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
-What?
-Come here.

508
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,740
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

509
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,900
Yeah.

510
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,740
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?

511
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,580
-I made eye contact.
-She's not coming over here.

512
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,700
-Yes, she is.
-Oh, shit.

513
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,860
Oh, no.

514
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,020
-You want your palm read?
-No.

515
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,300
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

516
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
-Okay.
-Hello.

517
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,780
Oh, here she is.

518
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,460
I want your palm read.

519
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,580
Yeah. How much is it?

520
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,420
For you, 50.

521
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,740
Okay?

522
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,020
Okay.

523
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,220
So you have been on a journey...

524
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,300
...and you're a stranger
to this place.

525
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,860
You are...

526
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,540
...an adventurer.

527
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,500
A seeker.

528
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,380
An adventurer in your mind.

529
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,300
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

530
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,220
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

531
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,820
You're becoming this woman.

532
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,060
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

533
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,980
Only if you find peace
within yourself...

534
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:12,020
...will you find
true connection with others.

535
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,820
That is a stranger to you?

536
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,900
I guess so.

537
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,980
You will be all right.
He's learning.

538
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,700
Okay.

539
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,180
Money.

540
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,540
You're both stars.

541
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,220
Don't forget.

542
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,620
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

543
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,500
...they formed everything
that is this world.

544
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,460
Everything we know is stardust.

545
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,420
So don't forget, you are stardust.

546
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,620
That's very nice and all.

547
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,060
I mean, that we're all stardust...

548
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,580
...and you're becoming this great woman.

549
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,540
But I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

550
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,780
...than some horoscope
in a newspaper.

551
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,100
What? She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other...

552
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,060
...and that I was going
to become this great woman.

553
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,540
But what was that
"l am learning" bullshit?

554
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,940
That's way condescending, you know?

555
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

556
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,500
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth...

557
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
...it would put them
out of business.

558
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,260
Just once, I'd love to see some
little old lady save up all her money...

559
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,940
...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd
get there and the woman would say...

560
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,860
..."Tomorrow and all
your remaining days...

561
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,020
...will be exactly like today...

562
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,620
...a tedious collection of hours.

563
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,940
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

564
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,420
...and no new travels.

565
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,420
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

566
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,740
Fifty schillings, please."

567
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,580
That I'd like to see.

568
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,980
It's so funny how...

569
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,580
...she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.

570
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,780
She was really wise and intense.
I really loved what she said.

571
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,660
You pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself.

572
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,180
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

573
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,860
Would you like that?

574
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,100
You're so....

575
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Stardust. Stardust.

576
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,020
There's an exhibition.

577
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,900
I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

578
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,180
Yeah, I think so.

579
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,020
I actually saw this one in a museum.

580
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,140
I stared and stared at it.

581
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,540
Must have been 45 minutes.

582
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,260
I love it.

583
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,460
La voie ferrée.
It's great.

584
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,580
I love the way the people are
dissolving into the background.

585
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,860
Look at this.

586
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,980
It's like the environments...

587
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,460
...are stronger than the people.

588
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,900
His human figures are
always so transitory.

589
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,060
It's funny. Transitory?

590
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,940
Transitory.

591
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,140
-You think this is open?
-I don't know. Let's try it.

592
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,140
I was in an old church like this...

593
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,340
...with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

594
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,100
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

595
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,220
...I can't help but feeling for
those people that come here...

596
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,540
...Iost or in pain, guilt...

597
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,500
...Iooking for some kind of answers.

598
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,420
It fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness...

599
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,860
...of so many generations.

600
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
You're close with your grandmother?

601
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Yeah.

602
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,020
I think it's because I always
have this strange feeling...

603
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,060
...that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

604
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,700
You know, that my life is just...

605
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,660
...her memories or something.

606
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,820
That's so wild.

607
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,220
I always think that I'm still
this 13-year-old boy...

608
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,380
...who doesn't really know how
to be an adult, pretending to...

609
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,900
...Iive my life, taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

610
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,060
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

611
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,820
That's funny.

612
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,820
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like...

613
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,900
...this very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

614
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,420
Do you know anything about
the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

615
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,860
No, not much.

616
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,220
Well, I went to
this Quaker wedding once...

617
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,220
...and it was fantastic.

618
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,660
What they do is...

619
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,940
...the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation...

620
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,620
...and they stare at each other.

621
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,540
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

622
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,340
...or say something.

623
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,780
And then, after an hour or so of just...

624
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,980
...staring at each other...

625
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,740
...they're married.

626
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,540
That's beautiful. I like that.

627
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,100
This is a horrible story.

628
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,060
What?

629
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,900
It's not the appropriate place
to tell it.

630
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,900
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

631
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,940
He's a big atheist, you know.

632
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,860
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

633
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,260
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

634
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,820
...and leans out the window...

635
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,140
...and he says,
"Do you believe in God? "

636
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,500
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

637
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,580
He says...

638
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,540
..."Yes, I do."

639
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,580
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

640
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,220
We drove away.

641
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,460
That's mean.

642
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,980
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train?

643
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,020
No, not yet.

644
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,260
What would you be doing?

645
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,020
I'd probably be hanging around
the airport...

646
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,460
...crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

647
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,020
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

648
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,100
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

649
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,100
So I'm just a dumb American...

650
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,260
...momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

651
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
-I'm having a great time.
-Really?

652
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,860
Me too.

653
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,500
I'm glad, because
no one knows I'm here.

654
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,580
I don't know anyone
that would tell me...

655
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,820
...all those bad things you've done.

656
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,260
-I'll tell you some.
-Yeah, I'm sure.

657
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,020
You hear so much shit about people.
I always feel like...

658
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,540
...the general of an army
when I start dating.

659
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,740
Plotting my strategy
and maneuverings...

660
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,340
...knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

661
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,980
It's horrible.

662
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,820
If we were always around each other...

663
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,660
...what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

664
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,220
No. I'm not going to
answer this question.

665
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,380
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

666
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,100
"What about me bugs you? "

667
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,860
Finally I said, "l don't think
you handle criticism too well."

668
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,020
She flew into a rage and
broke up with me. That's true.

669
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,260
All she wanted was
to have an excuse...

670
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,020
...to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

671
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,420
Is that what you want?

672
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,260
Something about me bugs you?

673
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,540
-What is it about me bugs you?
-Nothing at all.

674
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,100
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

675
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,820
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

676
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,460
...I kind of didn't really like this
reaction at the palm reader.

677
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,940
You were like this rooster prick.

678
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,900
What the hell
is a rooster prick?

679
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,540
You were like a boy whining...

680
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,300
...because all the attention
wasn't focused on him.

681
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,460
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

682
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,900
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

683
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,740
...crying because his mom
won't buy him a milk shake.

684
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,860
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about--

685
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,060
What?

686
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,180
I understand a little,
but he doesn't at all.

687
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,540
May I ask you a question?

688
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,580
So I would like to
make a deal with you.

689
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,420
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

690
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,020
You give me a word, I take the word,
and then I will write a poem...

691
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,660
...with the word inside.

692
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,220
And if you like it,
if you like my poem...

693
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,060
...if it adds something to
your life in any way...

694
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,780
...then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

695
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,340
I'll write in English, of course.

696
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,140
-Okay.
-All right. Great.

697
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,660
So?

698
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,940
Pick a word.

699
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,780
A word.

700
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,420
-Milk shake.
-Milk shake? Oh, good.

701
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,420
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milk shake.

702
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,980
"Milk shake"?

703
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,220
Okay, milk shake.

704
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,780
-All right, so....
-Good.

705
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,420
I gotta say, I like this
Viennese variation of bum.

706
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,580
I like what he said about
adding something to your life.

707
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,460
So, were we having
our first fight back there?

708
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,820
I think so. I think we were.

709
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,460
Even if we were, why does everyone
think conflict is so bad?

710
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,380
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

711
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,260
Yeah, I guess so.

712
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,740
I always think if I could
just accept the fact...

713
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,700
...that my life was supposed to be
difficult, that's what's expected...

714
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,660
...then I might not get so pissed off.

715
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,540
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

716
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,180
That's why I'm still in school.

717
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,740
It's easier to have
something to fight against.

718
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,540
Well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

719
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,940
You know, I can be doing
the most nothing thing.

720
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,380
Throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

721
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,300
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

722
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,620
I have got to win.

723
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,140
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

724
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,620
What do you mean?

725
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,620
I got a poem.

726
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,460
Oh, all right.

727
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,700
Will you read it to us?

728
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,540
Sure. Okay.

729
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,260
"Daydream delusion

730
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,580
Limousine eyelash

731
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,700
Oh, baby, with your pretty face

732
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,740
Drop a tear in my wine glass
Look at those big eyes

733
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,020
See what you mean to me

734
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,100
Sweetcakes and milk shakes

735
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,460
I am a delusion angel

736
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,100
I'm a fantasy parade

737
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,340
I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore

738
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,860
You have no idea where I came from

739
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,020
We have no idea where we're going

740
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,980
Lodged in life

741
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,700
Like branches in the river

742
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,700
Flowing downstream
Caught in the current

743
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,380
I carry you

744
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,100
You'll carry me

745
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,420
That's how it could be

746
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,180
Don't you know me?

747
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,860
Don't you know me by now? "

748
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,220
Great.

749
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,980
-Thanks.
-Thanks, man.

750
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,620
Here you go.

751
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,980
-Thanks.
-All right.

752
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,300
-Here. Thank you.
-Thank you.

753
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,340
Good luck.

754
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,580
It was wonderful, no?

755
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,620
-What?
-He probably didn't just write that.

756
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,380
He wrote it, but he
probably plugs that word in.

757
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,740
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

758
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,500
What do you mean?

759
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,780
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

760
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,660
You know what drives me crazy?
People talking about...

761
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,420
...how great technology is,
how it saves all this time.

762
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,500
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

763
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,940
If it just turns into more busy work.

764
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,380
I never hear anybody say, "With the time
I've saved using my word processor...

765
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,380
...I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

766
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,580
-You don't hear that.
-Time is so abstract anyway.

767
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,300
-Are you looking at this girl?
-What?

768
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,820
Nothing.

769
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,820
You wanna go in here?

770
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,300
-You wanna go in here?
-Yeah. It's a club, no?

771
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,300
Wanna go?

772
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,540
Hello.

773
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,100
Fifty schillings.

774
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,060
-Each.
-I got 100. Here, I got it.

775
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,940
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

776
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,100
-You gonna buy me a beer?
-Yeah.

777
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,460
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

778
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,860
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

779
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,220
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

780
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,100
-No, not right now.
-But you did.

781
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,100
We broke up six months ago.

782
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,660
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

783
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,500
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
Tell me about it.

784
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,300
No way. I can't.
It's really, really boring.

785
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,380
Come on. Tell me about it.

786
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,260
I was really disappointed.

787
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,340
I thought this one would last
for a while. He was...

788
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,460
...very stupid, ugly,
bad in bed, alcoholic....

789
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,820
-You know.
-A real prize winner.

790
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,740
I was kind of giving him a favor.

791
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,580
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

792
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:38,300
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

793
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,500
But anyway, I was traumatized
and became--

794
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,220
And became totally obsessed with him.

795
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,700
So I went to a shrink, and it came up
that I had written...

796
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,180
...this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

797
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,460
...and how she'd do it.

798
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,820
It's all the details
of how to do it and not get caught--

799
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,940
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

800
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,940
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

801
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,340
No, I understand.

802
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,260
This stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

803
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,980
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

804
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,020
She had to call the police?

805
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,340
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

806
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,340
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

807
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,340
She said, looking into my eyes,
"The way you said it...

808
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,340
...I know you are going to do it."

809
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,980
She was totally out of her mind.

810
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,220
It was my first and last session.

811
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,100
So what happened then?

812
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,900
I totally got over him.

813
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,620
But now, I'm obsessed...

814
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,100
...that he's gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

815
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,540
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

816
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,580
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't...

817
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,420
...really like that much?

818
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,940
I don't know.

819
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,220
So how about you?

820
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,220
-What?
-Are you with anyone?

821
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,660
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long.

822
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,540
But now you have to tell me.

823
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,860
Well, I kind of see love...

824
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,100
...as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

825
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,220
It's funny.
People always talk about how...

826
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,100
...Iove is this totally unselfish,
giving thing.

827
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,420
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

828
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,420
I know.

829
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,100
So who just broke up with you?

830
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,060
What?

831
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,500
You sound like you just were hurt.

832
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,940
Do l?

833
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,380
All right.

834
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,900
Big confession.

835
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,100
I should've told you this
earlier or something.

836
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,420
I didn't come to Europe just to...

837
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,700
...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

838
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,580
I saved up my money all spring to
fly to Madrid...

839
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,220
...and spend the summer
with my girlfriend--

840
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,060
-Your girlfriend?
-My ex-girlfriend...

841
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,460
...who has been on this art history
program for the last year.

842
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,940
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

843
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,060
...and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends.

844
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:17,780
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

845
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,060
...Maria, Suzy from home.

846
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,500
She managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days...

847
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,140
...and I stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

848
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,460
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna.

849
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,980
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

850
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,620
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

851
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,140
It's when you remember
how little you thought about...

852
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,940
...the people you broke up with,
and you realize...

853
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:52,620
...that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

854
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,020
You'd like to think
you're both in pain...

855
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,100
...but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

856
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,620
Believe me, I know.

857
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,740
You should look at bright colors.

858
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,180
That's what the shrink told me.

859
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,860
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

860
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,260
...to hear that l
was a homicidal maniac...

861
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:15,380
...but I could shift my obsession if l
would concentrate on bright colors.

862
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,780
Did it work?

863
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,140
-Didn't help your pinball.
-Well, no.

864
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,380
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

865
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,860
Not lately?

866
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,980
That's good.
You're cured then.

867
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:39,220
There's breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

868
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,940
...all the time.

869
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,260
And they turn out to be
the least violent...

870
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,300
...the most peaceful, the most happy.

871
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,900
So maybe fooling around's
not so bad.

872
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,100
-Are you talking about monkeys?
-Yes, I am.

873
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,620
-I thought so.
-Why?

874
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,340
I never heard this one.
But it reminds me of this perfect...

875
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,900
...male argument to justify them
fooling around.

876
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,380
Women monkeys are fooling around too.
Everybody's fooling around.

877
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,540
That's cute. I have this awful,
paranoid thought...

878
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,820
...that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could...

879
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,260
...fool around more.

880
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,500
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

881
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:21,020
We're all happy and free, as long as
I can fuck as much as I can."

882
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,700
All right.

883
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,060
But maybe there's some
biological things at work here.

884
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,700
If you had an island...

885
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:32,340
...and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man...

886
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:35,220
...in a year, you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

887
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,620
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

888
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:43,260
...in a year, you have the possibility
of only one baby. So....

889
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,500
You know what?

890
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,660
On this island, I think there
will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

891
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,620
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

892
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,860
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

893
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,660
...and no more man.

894
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,300
Because they would've all
eaten him alive.

895
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,860
Oh, yeah?

896
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,700
There's something to that.

897
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,900
On some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

898
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,820
I was walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

899
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,300
...and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

900
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,540
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

901
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,260
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

902
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,940
Plus, there were four of them.

903
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,020
Exactly. But she says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

904
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,260
And I'm like, "Okay.
Wait a minute, here."

905
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,900
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

906
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,940
So who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one?

907
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,980
Women say they hate it
if you're all protective.

908
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:45,340
But if it suits them, then
they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

909
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,500
You know what? I don't think
woman really wants to destroy man.

910
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,660
Even if they want to,
they don't succeed.

911
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,940
I'm sure even men are
destroying women...

912
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,100
...or are capable of destroying women
much more than women--

913
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,500
Anyway, it's depressing.
You know what?

914
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,180
-You wanna stop talking about this?
-I hate it.

915
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,860
Men, women, it's....

916
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,460
There's no end to it.

917
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,420
It's like a skipping record.

918
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,660
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

919
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,900
And nobody came up with anything.

920
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,180
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

921
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,780
A birth dance?

922
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,700
Should I give her some money?

923
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,060
Everything that's interesting
costs a little money.

924
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,420
So a birth dance, huh?

925
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,260
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

926
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,140
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

927
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,620
In part of the world,
they still do it.

928
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,180
The woman in labor enters a tent...

929
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,860
...and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

930
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,260
They encourage her
to dance with them...

931
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,660
...so as to make
the birth less painful.

932
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,180
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

933
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,420
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

934
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,980
I like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in.

935
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,180
I know. I heard about this old guy...

936
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,420
...who was watching
some young people dance.

937
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,940
He said, "How beautiful.

938
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,940
They're shaking off their genitals
to become angels."

939
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,020
I like that.

940
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,340
One question, though.

941
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,060
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

942
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,300
...where are the men?

943
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,620
Are we out food gathering? Are we not
invited? You all don't need us?

944
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,020
Men are lucky we don't
bite off their heads after mating.

945
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,060
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

946
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,580
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

947
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,260
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

948
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,500
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

949
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,380
No, no. Wait a minute.
Talking seriously here.

950
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,340
I mean, I always feel
this pressure of being...

951
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,060
...a strong and independent
icon of womanhood...

952
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,180
...and not making it look like...

953
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,380
...my whole life is revolving
around some guy.

954
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,140
But loving someone...

955
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,660
...and being loved
means so much to me.

956
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,540
I always make fun of it and stuff...

957
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,420
...but isn't everything
we do in life...

958
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,380
...a way to be loved a little more?

959
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,820
I don't know.

960
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,100
Sometimes I dream...

961
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,180
...about being a good father
and a good husband.

962
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,740
And sometimes it feels really close.

963
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,220
But then other times...

964
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,180
...it seems silly...

965
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,780
...Iike it would...

966
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,860
...ruin my whole life.

967
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,540
And it's not just
a fear of commitment...

968
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,740
...or that I'm incapable
of caring or loving because...

969
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,140
...I can.

970
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,940
It's just that, if I'm
totally honest with myself...

971
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,820
...I think I'd rather die knowing...

972
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,420
...that I was
really good at something.

973
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,340
That I had excelled
in some way...

974
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,420
...than that I'd just been in...

975
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,740
...a nice, caring relationship.

976
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,980
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

977
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:47,700
...that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career.

978
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,100
He was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

979
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,780
...that he had never really
given anything of himself.

980
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,460
His life was for no one and nothing.

981
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,940
He was almost crying saying that.

982
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,180
I believe if there's
any kind of God...

983
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,300
...it wouldn't be in any of us...

984
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,420
...not you or me...

985
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,140
...but just this little space
in between.

986
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,980
If there's any kind of magic
in this world...

987
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,420
...it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something.

988
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,740
I know, it's almost
impossible to succeed...

989
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,220
...but who cares really?

990
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,620
The answer must be in the attempt.

991
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,900
I think this is a civilization in
decline. Look at the service.

992
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,380
Where is the waitress?
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

993
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,180
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

994
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,340
...who I'm supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours.

995
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,420
Pick up.

996
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,460
-Pick up the phone.
-All right.

997
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,740
I've been working on my English.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

998
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,460
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

999
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,460
I don't think I'll be able to
make it for lunch today.

1000
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:40,660
I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

1001
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,780
Are you crazy?

1002
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,140
Probably.

1003
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,500
-He's Austrian? He's from there?
-No, No.

1004
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,220
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow.

1005
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,740
Why'd you get off?

1006
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,220
Well, he convinced me.

1007
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,740
I mean, actually, I was ready to
get off the train with him...

1008
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,820
...after talking to him a short while.

1009
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,940
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

1010
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,660
In the lounge car,
he began to talk about...

1011
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,820
...him as a boy seeing
his great-grandmother's ghost.

1012
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,260
I think that's when I fell for him.

1013
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:21,020
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

1014
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,980
He trapped me.

1015
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,660
And he's so cute.

1016
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,940
He has beautiful blue eyes...

1017
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,060
...nice pink lips...

1018
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,380
...greasy hair.

1019
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,620
I love it.

1020
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,700
He's kind of tall,
and he's a little clumsy.

1021
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,620
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

1022
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,100
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

1023
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,700
-What?
-Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

1024
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,580
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

1025
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,900
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

1026
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:06,900
I told him the story about
the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

1027
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,820
He must be scared to death.

1028
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,140
He must be thinking I'm
this manipulative, mean woman.

1029
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,700
I just hope he doesn't feel
that way about me.

1030
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,740
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

1031
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,980
The only person I could
really hurt is myself.

1032
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,660
I don't think he's scared of you.

1033
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,620
I think he's crazy about you.

1034
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,220
-Really?
-I've known you a long time.

1035
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,820
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

1036
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,780
We haven't talked about that yet.

1037
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:45,860
Okay, it's your turn.
You call your friend.

1038
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,900
All right, all right.

1039
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,580
I usually get this guy's
answering machine.

1040
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,740
Hi, dude. What's up?

1041
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,300
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

1042
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,900
Cool. Yeah.

1043
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:05,580
So how was Madrid?

1044
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,220
Madrid sucked.

1045
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,420
Lisa and I had our
long overdue meltdown.

1046
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,780
Too bad. I told you, no?

1047
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,980
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

1048
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,140
I was only in Madrid
for a couple days.

1049
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,900
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

1050
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:26,900
You know, it really wasn't
that much cheaper. I just....

1051
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,180
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

1052
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,020
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

1053
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,900
So are you okay now?

1054
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,020
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
That's the thing.

1055
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,500
I'm rapturous.

1056
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,620
And I'll tell you why.

1057
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,620
I met somebody
on my last night in Europe.

1058
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,380
-That's incredible.
-I know, I know.

1059
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:52,820
You know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

1060
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:57,020
Well, she was literally
a Botticelli angel...

1061
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,740
...telling me everything
would be okay.

1062
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,740
How did you meet?

1063
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,700
On the train.

1064
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:10,180
She was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting...

1065
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,420
...so she moved. She sat
right across the aisle from me.

1066
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,460
So we started to talk.

1067
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,780
She didn't like me much at first.

1068
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,060
She's super smart...

1069
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,860
...very passionate...

1070
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,540
...and beautiful.

1071
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,420
And I was so unsure of myself.

1072
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:30,340
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

1073
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:35,060
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

1074
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,780
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

1075
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,500
No, and by the way,
she sat next to you.

1076
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,340
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

1077
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,820
Oh, yeah?

1078
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,060
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

1079
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,700
They act strange,
the little I know of them.

1080
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,500
Don't they?

1081
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,020
I feel like this is
some dream world we're in.

1082
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,740
Yeah, it's so weird.

1083
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,220
It's like our time together
is just ours.

1084
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,180
It's our own creation.

1085
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,820
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine.

1086
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,820
And what's so cool
is that this whole evening...

1087
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,340
...all our time together,
shouldn't officially be happening.

1088
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,860
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

1089
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,340
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

1090
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,420
I know.

1091
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,220
But now, you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper...

1092
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,940
...and see if it fits.

1093
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,260
It'll fit.

1094
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,660
This friend of mine had a kid...

1095
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,940
...and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

1096
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,820
But he said at that
profound moment of birth...

1097
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,860
...he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time...

1098
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,900
...trying to take its first breath.

1099
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,460
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

1100
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,620
...that was gonna die someday.

1101
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,940
He couldn't get it out of his head.

1102
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:30,100
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

1103
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,020
But don't you think that's what...

1104
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,420
...makes our time and specific moments
so important?

1105
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,460
Yeah, I know.

1106
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,860
It's the same for us tonight, though.

1107
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:46,260
After tomorrow, we'll probably
never see each other again, right?

1108
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,220
You don't think we'll
ever see each other?

1109
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,980
What do you think?

1110
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,540
Actually, I don't know.

1111
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,740
I hadn't planned another--

1112
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,380
Me too. I live in Paris,
you live in the U.S. I understand.

1113
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:10,220
I'd hate to make you fly.
You'd hate to fly, right?

1114
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,540
I'm not so scared of flying.

1115
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,380
I mean, I could.

1116
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,180
Well, if you were gonna...

1117
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,940
...come to the U.S...

1118
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,500
...or if, you know, if l....

1119
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,020
I mean, I could come back here.

1120
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,180
What?

1121
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:28,060
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

1122
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,500
We should try something different.

1123
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,820
It's not so bad if tonight
is our only night, right?

1124
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,900
People exchange numbers, addresses.

1125
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,820
They end up writing once,
calling each other twice.

1126
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,700
Right. Fizzles out.

1127
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,380
Yeah, I don't want that.
I hate that.

1128
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,860
I hate that too.

1129
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,620
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever?

1130
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,860
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

1131
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,060
But you think tonight's it?

1132
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,700
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

1133
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,580
It's the only way, no?

1134
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,860
Well, all right.

1135
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,540
Let's do it.

1136
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,100
No delusions, no projections.

1137
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,380
We'll just make tonight great.

1138
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,100
Let's do that.

1139
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,020
We should do some kind of handshake.

1140
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,700
Give me your hand.

1141
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,820
To our one and only...

1142
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,060
...night together...

1143
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,220
...and the hours that remain.

1144
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
What?

1145
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,420
It's just....

1146
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:10,500
It's depressing, no?

1147
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,100
Now, the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

1148
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,180
...when we'll have to say goodbye.

1149
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,820
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't worry about it.

1150
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,300
Now?

1151
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,180
Say goodbye.

1152
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,820
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

1153
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,260
Au revoir.

1154
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,140
-Later.
-Later, yeah.

1155
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,220
Here's the plan.

1156
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,580
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

1157
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,700
-Red wine.
-Red wine. Right.

1158
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,900
-You think you can do that?
-No problem.

1159
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,700
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

1160
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,620
Hello.

1161
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,220
Do you speak English?

1162
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,380
-A bit.
-Yeah? A bit?

1163
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,100
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

1164
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,020
...which is that....

1165
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,220
You see that girl over there?

1166
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,780
Well, this is our only night together...

1167
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,900
...and she....

1168
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:46,060
The problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine...

1169
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:48,340
...and I don't have any money.

1170
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,020
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

1171
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,420
...give me the address of this bar,
and I would promise...

1172
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,100
...to send you the money, and you'd
be making our night complete.

1173
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,140
You would send me the money?

1174
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,220
Your hand?

1175
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,020
For the greatest night in your life.

1176
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,820
Thank you very much.

1177
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:56,020
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

1178
01:17:56,220 --> 01:18:00,100
...Iike traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise.

1179
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,380
And I knew those were special moments.

1180
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,100
But something was always wrong.

1181
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,340
I wished I'd been with someone else.

1182
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,140
I knew that what I was feeling...

1183
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:17,220
...exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

1184
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,620
But I'm happy to be with you.

1185
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,620
You couldn't know
why a night like this...

1186
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,220
...is so important
to my life right now...

1187
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,740
...but it is.

1188
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,620
This is a great morning.

1189
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,860
It is a great morning.

1190
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,260
Do you think we have others like this?

1191
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,100
What about our rational, adult decision?

1192
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,900
Oh, yeah.

1193
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:59,220
I know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasn't there.

1194
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,060
It's just, usually, it's myself...

1195
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,340
...that I wish I could get away from.

1196
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,780
Seriously, think about this.

1197
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,380
I have never been anywhere...

1198
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,220
...that I haven't been.

1199
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,940
I've never had a kiss...

1200
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,100
...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

1201
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,100
You know, I've never...

1202
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,380
...gone to the movies when
I wasn't there in the audience.

1203
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,060
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there...

1204
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,780
...making some stupid joke.

1205
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:28,740
That's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

1206
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,980
It's just, they are sick to death...

1207
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,340
...of being around themselves.

1208
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,620
Let's say that you and l
were together all the time.

1209
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,980
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

1210
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,820
The way...

1211
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:45,140
...the way every time
that we would have people over...

1212
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,820
...I'd be insecure, and I'd get
a little too drunk.

1213
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,180
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

1214
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,060
...again and again.

1215
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,820
You see, I've heard
all those stories...

1216
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,620
...so of course I'm sick of myself.

1217
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,020
But being with you...

1218
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,700
...it's made me feel like
I was somebody else.

1219
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,180
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

1220
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,180
...you know, dancing...

1221
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,380
...or alcohol...

1222
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,740
...or drugs, or stuff like that.

1223
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:29,380
Fucking.

1224
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,620
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

1225
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:49,060
Do you know what I want?

1226
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,460
What?

1227
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,180
To be kissed.

1228
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,940
Well, I could do that.

1229
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,380
Wait.

1230
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,340
I have to say something stupid.

1231
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:23,900
All right.

1232
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,900
It's very stupid.

1233
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,980
I don't think we should
sleep together.

1234
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,500
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

1235
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,540
...it'll make me feel bad.

1236
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:44,020
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

1237
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,580
I know. It's not very adult.

1238
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,500
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

1239
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,780
Let's see each other again.

1240
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,220
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

1241
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:07,540
I don't want to just get laid.
I want to-- I mean....

1242
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,060
I mean, I think we should.

1243
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,180
We die in the morning, right?

1244
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,340
-I think we should.
-Then it's like some male fantasy.

1245
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,620
Meet a French girl,
fuck her and never see her again.

1246
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:24,260
And have this great story to tell.
I don't want...

1247
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,060
...this great evening to
just have been for that.

1248
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,260
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

1249
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,580
You don't want to see me again?

1250
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,180
No, of course I do.

1251
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,860
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

1252
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:51,860
...of to never see you again
or to marry you...

1253
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,140
...I would marry you.

1254
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,380
Maybe that's a lot
of romantic bullshit...

1255
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,220
...but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

1256
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,300
Actually...

1257
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:08,780
...I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

1258
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,060
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

1259
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,700
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

1260
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,300
I don't know.

1261
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:32,180
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

1262
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,100
Call my parents.

1263
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:35,660
What about you?

1264
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:39,940
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

1265
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,500
You have a dog?
I love dogs.

1266
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,260
-You do?
-Yeah.

1267
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,420
-Oh, shit.
-What?

1268
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,860
I don't know.
We're back in real time.

1269
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,900
I know. I hate that.

1270
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,460
What is that?

1271
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,380
Sounds like a harpsichord.

1272
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,420
Check that out.

1273
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,500
Somebody's playing.

1274
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,980
That's cool.

1275
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,980
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

1276
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,460
Of course.

1277
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,260
Oh, wow.

1278
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,980
I'm gonna take your picture...

1279
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,100
...so I never forget you...

1280
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,540
...or all this.

1281
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,820
Okay, me too.

1282
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,140
"The years shall run like rabbits."

1283
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:51,700
What?

1284
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,940
Nothing.

1285
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,460
I have...

1286
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:01,020
...this recording of Dylan Thomas...

1287
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,180
...reading a W. H. Auden poem.

1288
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,940
He's got a great voice.

1289
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:08,980
It's like....

1290
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,340
"All the clocks in the city

1291
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:15,220
Began to whirr and chime:

1292
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,860
'O let not Time deceive you

1293
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,540
You cannot conquer Time.

1294
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,900
In headaches and in worry

1295
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,980
Vaguely life leaks away

1296
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,340
And Time will have his fancy

1297
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:31,020
Tomorrow or today.'"

1298
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,140
Something like that.

1299
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,220
That's good.

1300
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,220
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

1301
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,940
...how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

1302
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,020
...by anticipating their reactions...

1303
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,140
...or getting tired
of their mannerisms.

1304
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:56,140
I think it would be
the opposite for me.

1305
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:01,420
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

1306
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,180
The way he's gonna part his hair...

1307
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,420
...which shirt he's gonna
wear that day...

1308
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:10,700
...knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

1309
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,740
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

1310
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,780
-Hey, guess what.
-What?

1311
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:40,020
We didn't go to those guys' play.

1312
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,380
Play?

1313
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,860
The cow?

1314
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,700
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

1315
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,060
Oh, no. We missed it.

1316
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,580
You know what bus to take
to the airport?

1317
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,660
No problem.

1318
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:18,140
-I should get on this one.
-Right here. You wanna get on there?

1319
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,620
I guess this is it, no?

1320
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,660
I really....

1321
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:34,060
-You know....
-Yeah, I know. Me too.

1322
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:43,780
Have a great life. Have fun
with everything you're gonna do.

1323
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:46,260
Good luck with school and all that.

1324
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,060
I hate this.

1325
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,140
Me too.
The train is about to leave.

1326
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,220
You know all this bullshit
we're talking about...

1327
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:04,860
...not seeing each other?
I don't want that.

1328
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,220
I don't either.

1329
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,900
-You don't?
-I waited for you to say it.

1330
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,620
Why didn't you say something?

1331
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,860
I was afraid
you didn't wanna see me.

1332
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,300
What do you wanna do?

1333
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:17,220
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

1334
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,540
Five years? That's a long time.

1335
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:23,020
It's awful. It's like
a sociological experiment.

1336
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:25,140
-How about one year?
-One year.

1337
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,020
-How about six months?
-Six months?

1338
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,580
It's gonna be freezing.

1339
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,300
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

1340
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,220
Six months from now or last night?

1341
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,140
Last night. Six months
from last night, which was...

1342
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:44,620
...June 1 6th.

1343
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:49,140
So track nine, six months from now
at 6:00 at night.

1344
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,260
December.

1345
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:54,220
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

1346
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,820
But I'm gonna be here.

1347
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,220
-Okay, me too.
-All right.

1348
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,380
We won't call, write or--

1349
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:02,940
No, it's depressing.

1350
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,820
Your train's gonna leave.

1351
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,580
Say goodbye.

1352
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,060
Bye.

1353
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,460
Goodbye.

1354
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,700
Au revoir.

1355
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,260
Later.
