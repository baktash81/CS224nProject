1
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,451
Every day in the heart of Africa,

2
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:50,685
amazing true stories happen
that no one ever sees.

3
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,760
Not so long ago on these plains,

4
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,861
two mothers battled forces
that sought to destroy them.

5
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:35,666
Only by showing extraordinary courage
would these mothers prevail.

6
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,302
A mighty river divides this land.

7
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:19,939
It marks the boundary
between two rival families of lions.

8
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:25,847
To the south lives the River Pride,

9
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,723
six lionesses and their cubs.

10
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,030
They're a close-knit family,

11
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:42,105
and rely on each other for comfort
and protection.

12
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:55,380
Layla is the oldest
and most experienced lioness.

13
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:57,882
She has just one cub,

14
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:00,654
six-month-old Mara.

15
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:13,266
Layla's age is starting to show.

16
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,972
A lifetime of hunting has taken its toll.

17
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:37,955
The cubs are fed and raised
by the lionesses,

18
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:41,362
but they are protected
by the pride's ruler,

19
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,061
Fang.

20
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,227
His broken tooth is a war wound
from a recent battle,

21
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,537
and a mark of his bravery.

22
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:57,614
He is the father of all of the cubs
and their defender.

23
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,056
To Mara, he's the best dad ever.

24
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:15,655
Fang keeps Mara and her mother safe,

25
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,963
and guards their pride lands,

26
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:22,802
rich lands that every year
host a great migration

27
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,904
a million strong.

28
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:42,754
Fang lets all other lions know that
he alone rules the southern kingdom.

29
00:04:54,538 --> 00:04:57,905
North of the river
lives a very different cat,

30
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:00,810
the fastest creature on land,

31
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:03,836
a cheetah.

32
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,081
Sita's life is different from a lion's
in every way,

33
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,315
because she lives alone.

34
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:18,623
Sita has a secret.

35
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:26,803
Not long ago, she gave birth
in this grassy den to five cubs.

36
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:39,973
They are still blind, helpless

37
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,517
and totally reliant on their mother.

38
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,632
Sita is a single mother,

39
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:06,768
and with no pride to help her,

40
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,769
she must leave her cubs all alone
when she hunts.

41
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:18,317
Cheetahs may be the fastest animals
on land,

42
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:21,056
but hunting still isn't easy.

43
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:28,458
The Thomson's gazelles she favors
are almost as fast and very agile.

44
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:09,332
Sita is built for speed,
but has no staying power.

45
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,369
To have any chance,

46
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:17,437
she must sneak as close as possible.

47
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:43,739
Under 30 seconds before exhaustion.

48
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:46,072
It's now or never.

49
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,891
Success.

50
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:44,458
Sita's cubs will not go hungry today.

51
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:07,688
The river is a great bringer of life
to this wilderness,

52
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:10,791
but it can also be a deadly foe.

53
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:16,762
The surging rapids can carry
even the strongest lion to his death.

54
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,935
This is where dragons dwell.

55
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:47,521
The River Pride feeds on a dead hippo
washed up on the river's bank.

56
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:12,982
Crocodiles don't fear
the rulers of the land,

57
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,116
with one exception.

58
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,455
Fang.

59
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:50,292
Today, the pride's protector
has earned his keep.

60
00:10:56,633 --> 00:11:00,865
A crocodile-infested river
does have one benefit.

61
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:04,465
It protects the pride from invasion
from the north.

62
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:16,045
The northern kingdom is ruled
by Fang's greatest enemy,

63
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,653
Kali.

64
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,308
And Kali is not alone.

65
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:43,245
He has four sons in their prime.

66
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,948
Together, they form
the most powerful force in this land,

67
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,289
one set on conquest.

68
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:11,932
Kali already rules the lionesses
of the north,

69
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,671
but he is not content with that.

70
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:26,179
He and his sons are driven
to expand their realm to the south.

71
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,851
lf he overthrows Fang,

72
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:33,659
he will kill Mara
and have new cubs of his own.

73
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:38,394
Kali is little Mara's greatest danger.

74
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,473
For now, the river is high,

75
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,274
a barrier that Kali will not cross.

76
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:54,015
But eventually, its waters will fall.

77
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,515
For Sita's five cubs,

78
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,656
living in their snug little home
seems like paradise.

79
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,074
The cubs are now old enough
For their first trip.

80
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,108
The gazelle herds have moved on,

81
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,842
and the family needs to catch up.

82
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,418
Sita quickly discovers
that herding cats isn't easy.

83
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:31,673
For Sita, it's time to cross
the open plains to find them food.

84
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:42,823
For the cubs, it's a huge adventure.

85
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,378
What an amazing first adventure.

86
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,431
Massive herds
still cross Fang's southern kingdom,

87
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,970
so food is plentiful for the River Pride.

88
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,275
Layla may be old, but she is
the most experienced hunter.

89
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:26,353
She knows the best place
to stage an ambush.

90
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:57,723
The lionesses hunt as a team.

91
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:21,915
With Layla leading,
they slowly begin to close the trap.

92
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:38,098
Despite her aging body,
Layla is determined to help the pride.

93
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:09,825
Hunting is always dangerous.

94
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,065
Layla and her sisters must eat quickly

95
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,333
if they are to get
the reward they deserve.

96
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:28,003
Fang, the protector,
demands the lion's share.

97
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:42,452
For Layla, the hunt is a disaster.

98
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:45,790
A zebra's kick has injured her further.

99
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:50,457
Staying fit is critical for a lioness.

100
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:56,204
The pride cannot carry a female
who is too weak to hunt.

101
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,120
Something's wrong.

102
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,796
Kali and his sons are on patrol.

103
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:38,778
Lions are Sita's greatest enemy.

104
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:46,352
A male is more than five times her size.

105
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,856
As a single cheetah, she would flee.

106
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:59,133
But with dependent cubs,
she must hold her ground.

107
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:14,216
She is totally focused on Kali.

108
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,734
Incredibly, she's goading him.

109
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,341
It seems insane, but it's a trick.

110
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,179
She's drawing him away from her cubs.

111
00:21:58,494 --> 00:21:59,791
Kali tires.

112
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:02,296
It worked.

113
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:13,704
His son, however, is more determined.

114
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:37,865
Sita is risking everything.

115
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:12,328
Her speed has won the day, for now.

116
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:21,603
Her terrified cubs
are scattered and lost, in danger

117
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:24,339
until they're back with their mother.

118
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:56,910
Time is not on their side.

119
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:07,282
The dark will cloak other predators.

120
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:46,448
It's a mother's worst nightmare.

121
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:49,117
Hyenas have taken two of her cubs.

122
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:54,429
They're gone forever.

123
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:06,163
The season is changing
and the pride lands are drying.

124
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:10,773
The great herds are moving on
in search of greener pastures.

125
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:19,481
They may be gone for a year or more.

126
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,232
With the herds gone,

127
00:26:34,837 --> 00:26:38,398
the River Pride will struggle
to find food.

128
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:42,838
Layla is exhausted by her injuries.

129
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:50,243
Mara tries to comfort her mother,
but there is little she can do.

130
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:07,762
With the herds moving on,
the pride must follow.

131
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:11,298
Layla cannot go on.

132
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:15,440
She needs rest so her body can heal.

133
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:24,314
Mara faces a terrible choice,

134
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:27,652
stay with her mother
or follow the pride.

135
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,129
Layla calls to the pride and to Mara,

136
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:44,233
begging them to wait for her.

137
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:48,910
But the pride must leave
in search of food.

138
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:54,306
They cannot jeopardize themselves
and the other cubs.

139
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:14,395
The pride moves
further and further away.

140
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:26,005
Layla forces herself to try and follow.

141
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:31,410
Mara stays with Layla,
but is in danger now.

142
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:37,415
Mother and daughter
have lost the protection of the pride.

143
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:50,000
Layla must find the strength
to catch up,

144
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,439
For the sake of her daughter.

145
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:14,360
Sita's cubs are growing in leaps
and bounds.

146
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:19,057
In their minds,
they're the fiercest hunters in the land.

147
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:57,669
Enemies approach.

148
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:00,805
Three cheetah brothers.

149
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,575
They may be fellow cheetahs,

150
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,609
but these brothers can be dangerous
for Sita's cubs.

151
00:30:12,154 --> 00:30:16,056
They are the one foe
she cannot outrun.

152
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,669
The brothers back down,

153
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,734
but they have separated Sita
from her young.

154
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,017
Male cheetahs
will sometimes attack small cubs.

155
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:23,483
Incredibly, the cubs hold their ground.

156
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:27,712
They have their mother's spirit.

157
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:47,600
In this land, even bullies get bullied.

158
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:31,981
The lionesses are tired
After their long journey.

159
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,990
But cubs will be cubs
and siesta time is soon over.

160
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:01,906
New playmates are always welcome.

161
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,353
Luckily, he can't get the lid off.

162
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:35,249
Layla and Mara have braved
the long journey and finally caught up.

163
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:40,053
But their timing couldn't be worse.

164
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:46,690
The river has fallen.

165
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:49,596
The pride's protective moat has gone.

166
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:54,501
Kali sees his chance
to invade the southern kingdom.

167
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:20,290
Kali and his largest son cross
the crocodile-infested waters.

168
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:04,505
Fang senses the danger.

169
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,568
Sounding strong might deter an attack.

170
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,087
But Kali is not fooled.

171
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,975
Fang sees it's two against one.

172
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,240
His chances are slim.

173
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:47,905
Kali attacks.

174
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:52,378
Fang has no answer.

175
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:57,822
Kali's son threatens, too.

176
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:03,428
Fang deserts his pride,
leaving them unprotected.

177
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,969
Kali is poised for takeover.

178
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:16,611
Mara may be killed.

179
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,049
But a mother will do anything
to save her cub.

180
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,852
Layla is the lionesses leader.

181
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:36,160
Despite her injury,

182
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:40,066
she puts herself between the invaders
and the precious cubs.

183
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,673
Inspired by Layla,
the other lionesses attack.

184
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:47,664
Layla and the lionesses have saved
the pride and their precious cubs.

185
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:51,065
Kali has lost this battle,

186
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:54,701
but next time
he may bring reinforcements.

187
00:38:58,513 --> 00:39:02,074
Fang has also been saved
by the lionesses.

188
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,747
But for how long?

189
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,329
The attack has taken a terrible toll.

190
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:40,210
This little cub is badly hurt
and lucky to be alive,

191
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:43,656
but Mara is nowhere to be found.

192
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:50,291
Layla has taken
Another devastating blow in the fight.

193
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:54,732
It takes all her strength
just to get to her feet.

194
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,543
She must find her Mara.

195
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:11,310
With a mother's desperate hope,
she calls for her cub.

196
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:15,776
Mara has survived.

197
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:19,278
Her mother's bravery has saved her.

198
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:36,532
There is no greater bond

199
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,668
than that between a lioness
and her cub.

200
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:05,858
The rains have returned,
but the herds are still far away.

201
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,972
Hunting is never easy.

202
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:16,936
Now, it's dangerous for Sita as well.

203
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,386
Hyenas.

204
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:14,766
Sita has already lost two of her cubs
to these deadly enemies.

205
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,976
Her biggest fear is that
they will steal the others.

206
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:44,556
The hyenas call,
drawing in more and more of the pack.

207
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:52,695
They know Sita is hiding something.

208
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,675
Bit by bit, they tighten the noose.

209
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,824
The hyenas have been kept at bay.

210
00:45:21,863 --> 00:45:26,095
This time, Sita's courageous defense
has saved the cubs.

211
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,259
Cold, hard rain.

212
00:46:00,335 --> 00:46:03,168
This is a time of suffering for everyone.

213
00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:00,159
For the River Pride, the cold rain
has been a blessing in disguise.

214
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:06,095
It allows them to appreciate the bond
and protection of a larger family.

215
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:13,700
One of Layla's sisters, Malaika,
has small cubs of her own.

216
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:20,203
With her injuries not healing,

217
00:47:20,248 --> 00:47:23,843
Layla is drawn closer
to her sister's family.

218
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,020
lf Layla builds a bond with her sister,

219
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:39,864
then Malaika might look after Mara
as well as her own cubs.

220
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:45,502
Layla's time is short.

221
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,603
Strengthening the bond with her sister
may be Mara's best chance to live.

222
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:59,381
Layla may soon have to
give up her cub.

223
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:16,363
And Mara's life will depend on
getting closer to her cousins.

224
00:49:04,552 --> 00:49:05,917
It's happening.

225
00:49:05,954 --> 00:49:09,651
Mara is being adopted by Malaika
and the pride.

226
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:20,696
There's nothing better for a lion
than close companionship.

227
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,929
With Mara safe,

228
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,965
Layla can go.

229
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:44,716
The time has come
for Layla to leave the pride

230
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,822
forever.

231
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:48,647
Layla struggles to find a quiet,
safe place to be alone.

232
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:07,437
The pride is now far away.

233
00:51:13,014 --> 00:51:18,247
Mara searches for any scent,
any sign of her mother,

234
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,047
but it's not there.

235
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:30,188
All alone
with her precious cub far away,

236
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,695
Layla, at last, gives up the fight.

237
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,973
Sita's cubs have grown in size
and strength,

238
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:53,008
and they can't wait to show off
their new powers.

239
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:38,652
Since the failed invasion,

240
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:43,754
Kali has prowled the southern side
of the river with his largest son.

241
00:53:44,298 --> 00:53:48,200
Now, he calls on his other sons
To join them.

242
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:37,083
Kali goes to greet his sons.

243
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:40,280
They have been separated
for some time.

244
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:11,780
The family bonds between
these ruthless fighters are very strong.

245
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:17,414
But there is also fierce rivalry
between them.

246
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:21,288
They all want the crown.

247
00:55:30,238 --> 00:55:32,035
But Kali is their father

248
00:55:32,073 --> 00:55:35,941
and he lets them know
that he is still king.

249
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:56,186
Together, they are the most powerful
force in the land.

250
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:17,045
Together, they will make another
assault on Fang and the River Pride.

251
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:28,589
Fang's future as leader
is hanging by a thread.

252
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:40,698
As the months have passed,
the cubs have grown into young adults.

253
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:45,369
Within this close-knit family,
Mara has thrived.

254
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:48,640
She is now a teenager in lion years.

255
00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:58,148
The bonds of affection within the
River Pride have never been stronger.

256
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:20,805
Kali and his sons
are coming with a vengeance.

257
00:57:36,764 --> 00:57:39,130
Fang's enemies lock in.

258
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:47,474
They launch the attack.

259
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:50,210
Fang's only hope is escape.

260
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:55,742
He runs for his life.

261
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:06,985
Fang will be shown no mercy
if he stays.

262
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:20,101
Kali's gang is victorious,

263
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:24,802
and Fang is never seen again.

264
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:33,651
Now the invaders attack
the rest of the River Pride.

265
00:59:10,558 --> 00:59:13,049
The fighting is over.

266
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:24,262
Kali and his sons rule.

267
00:59:25,172 --> 00:59:31,077
Their will is now law
on both sides of the river.

268
00:59:37,017 --> 00:59:40,043
Kali's sons try to make peace
with the lionesses.

269
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:45,958
But in the battle
the youngsters were driven away.

270
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:49,758
The pain of losing them
is still too fresh.

271
00:59:59,273 --> 01:00:02,709
The pride's young males
are in the greatest danger.

272
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:07,972
Kali's gang view them as a threat
and hunt them down.

273
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:22,895
Mara also fled in the battle,

274
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:25,990
but as a lioness, is in less danger.

275
01:00:28,135 --> 01:00:31,400
For the first time in her life,
she is alone.

276
01:00:32,907 --> 01:00:34,966
She has lost everything.

277
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:41,937
Kali's gang
drive out Mara's young male cousins,

278
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:45,241
banishing them
from the pride lands forever.

279
01:00:45,653 --> 01:00:50,352
And there is only one escape route,
across the river.

280
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:54,256
The river has swollen,

281
01:00:55,095 --> 01:00:59,361
but the young males
have no choice but to cross.

282
01:01:09,176 --> 01:01:13,476
And now,
the crocodiles have the advantage.

283
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:21,085
The youngsters know
what lurks just beneath,

284
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:25,057
but they fear Kali more
than they fear crocodiles.

285
01:01:47,815 --> 01:01:51,376
The current drags them down
into deeper water.

286
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:55,679
They are in over their heads
in every sense.

287
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:33,988
They've escaped,

288
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:38,089
But just by the skin
of a crocodile's teeth.

289
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:55,877
With all the warring between lions
south of the river,

290
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:00,047
life in the north has been
relatively carefree for Sita.

291
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:03,684
The cubs have grown to young adults,

292
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:06,653
but they're still cubs at heart.

293
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:35,452
Sita is not finished with their training.

294
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:38,221
It's time for another journey,

295
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:43,360
one where they can learn
the final lessons they'll need to survive.

296
01:03:57,211 --> 01:04:01,944
Lesson one, buffalo are very grumpy.

297
01:04:29,276 --> 01:04:33,406
Lesson two,
Never get fresh with an ostrich.

298
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:41,013
The savanna
is the greatest schoolyard,

299
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:44,057
but some of the other kids
are a bit different.

300
01:04:55,536 --> 01:04:59,131
A serval cat is drafted
into a game of tag.

301
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:14,484
It's no fun for the serval,

302
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:18,724
but the young cheetahs
can safely test their skills

303
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:21,956
against smaller teeth and claws.

304
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:28,995
And wouldn't every cat
just love to chase a dog?

305
01:05:31,338 --> 01:05:34,171
A jackal is the perfect size.

306
01:05:48,188 --> 01:05:51,851
Lesson three,
even little dogs bite back.

307
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:19,179
Lesson four,

308
01:06:20,787 --> 01:06:22,118
hyenas.

309
01:06:22,956 --> 01:06:28,451
The cubs remember all too well
Their terrifying encounters with hyenas

310
01:06:28,495 --> 01:06:29,928
when they were small.

311
01:06:29,963 --> 01:06:34,161
Now, they must learn
to stand their ground.

312
01:07:08,635 --> 01:07:11,502
The cubs have finally come to terms
with hyenas.

313
01:07:12,372 --> 01:07:15,466
They're close
to becoming independent cheetahs.

314
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:18,538
But not just yet.

315
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:27,876
With her family blown to the wind,

316
01:07:28,455 --> 01:07:31,856
Mara has found living alone
a challenge.

317
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:36,361
With no pride to hunt with her,
she's going hungry.

318
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:44,598
Warthogs seem to be the perfect meal,
small, tasty and easy to catch.

319
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,701
Not quite so easy after all.

320
01:08:30,517 --> 01:08:32,712
The herds are still gone,

321
01:08:32,753 --> 01:08:35,586
and all the other alternatives
seem to be

322
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:38,282
super-sized.

323
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:46,626
But young lions
think they're a match for anything.

324
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:58,741
lf only Mara had taken Sita's class
in avoiding grumpy buffalo.

325
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:26,004
Now the real cost of losing her family
is painfully clear.

326
01:09:26,706 --> 01:09:30,608
Mara was driven out
before she learnt to hunt.

327
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:45,418
The gazelles that Sita hunts
have crossed the river to the south.

328
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:53,363
She must follow them
or her family will starve.

329
01:10:00,941 --> 01:10:05,810
For the cubs, this may be
their most dangerous lesson yet.

330
01:10:10,217 --> 01:10:12,777
Sita rarely crosses the river.

331
01:10:13,386 --> 01:10:15,854
She knows it's deadly.

332
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:11,439
They've just entered Kali's new realm.

333
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:29,054
The River Pride lionesses

334
01:11:29,095 --> 01:11:32,792
once again proclaim
their ownership of the pride lands.

335
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,300
They have made peace with Kali.

336
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:40,198
Their new ruler has become
a committed protector.

337
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:51,207
Mara is still an outcast.

338
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:56,346
With food scarce, the lionesses
don't want Mara taking a share.

339
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:59,623
She must fend for herself.

340
01:12:00,727 --> 01:12:02,592
It seems harsh,

341
01:12:02,629 --> 01:12:05,826
but the other lionesses
have new priorities.

342
01:12:09,236 --> 01:12:10,396
Cubs.

343
01:12:11,004 --> 01:12:12,494
Kali's cubs.

344
01:12:22,148 --> 01:12:24,309
Kali has achieved his goal.

345
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:29,381
The lionesses
are now raising his cubs, not Fang's.

346
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:50,767
Sita and her family confidently
stride across Kali's land.

347
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,586
The young cheetahs
now have the confidence

348
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:05,648
to challenge everything in their path.

349
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,529
Even lions.

350
01:13:34,954 --> 01:13:36,251
But wait.

351
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:40,658
The young cheetahs have yet to learn
that lions live in prides.

352
01:13:51,304 --> 01:13:53,898
The hunters are being hunted.

353
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:05,150
This lesson is not hunting lions,

354
01:14:05,185 --> 01:14:07,016
it's escaping them!

355
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,144
Kali.

356
01:14:38,818 --> 01:14:40,547
The game is over.

357
01:14:44,424 --> 01:14:46,984
The most important lesson,

358
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:50,052
never mess with lions.

359
01:15:37,477 --> 01:15:42,176
The sight that Mara
and all the lions have been longing for.

360
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:57,558
At last the great herds
are returning to the pride lands.

361
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:04,561
For the lions, the good times are back.

362
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:08,026
With the pride lands rich again,

363
01:17:08,468 --> 01:17:11,835
it's also a chance for Mara
to end her hunger.

364
01:18:21,674 --> 01:18:26,338
No longer hungry,
Mara has one last goal,

365
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:30,608
to be accepted back
into the River Pride.

366
01:18:51,337 --> 01:18:53,396
Sita's work is done.

367
01:18:53,873 --> 01:18:57,434
She has taught her cubs
everything they need to know

368
01:18:57,477 --> 01:18:59,672
about this wilderness.

369
01:19:13,993 --> 01:19:17,952
The cubs have survived
the toughest of upbringings,

370
01:19:18,998 --> 01:19:21,626
but now they know what's safe,

371
01:19:21,668 --> 01:19:26,332
what's dangerous
and, above all, how to hunt.

372
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:52,728
Sita knows her cubs are ready
to fend for themselves.

373
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:59,065
She must return to the solitary life
of a cheetah.

374
01:20:06,212 --> 01:20:10,581
Against all odds, with the courage
that only a mother can bring,

375
01:20:11,117 --> 01:20:16,783
Sita has raised
three magnificent cheetahs.

376
01:20:30,803 --> 01:20:34,466
Mara is desperate
to rejoin her mother's pride

377
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:36,031
into which she was born,

378
01:20:36,809 --> 01:20:40,176
but will Malaika and the lionesses
welcome her back?

379
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:08,957
The lionesses have finally accepted
Mara back into their family.

380
01:22:09,502 --> 01:22:14,530
Layla's brave fight for her cub to live on
was not in vain.

381
01:22:41,634 --> 01:22:44,728
The River Pride is reborn.

382
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:10,986
Sita's cubs and Mara

383
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:15,967
are living proof
of the power of a mother's love.

384
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:15,967
