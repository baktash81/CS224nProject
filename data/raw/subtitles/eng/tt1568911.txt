346
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,543
Come on now, Mr. Lyons,
that's a bit rough, isn't it'?

347
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,965
Well, he'll destroy that horse.

348
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,346
I'll be over Thursday.

349
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,603
Give you a day to close it up.

350
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,195
Your wool.

351
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,944
I'm sorry, Rosie.

352
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,093
Now, boy!

353
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,300
You've got to do it, Joey!

354
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,098
You don't know, so I'm going to
have to do the knowing for you.

355
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,767
The rest of our lives depend on this!

356
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,188
So get set to pull! And pull straight!
And pull hard!

357
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,185
Now, boy! Go!

358
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,397
Walk on, Joey, walk on! Whoa! That's it!

359
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,654
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

360
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,291
Walk on! Walk on! Walk on!
Walk on, Joey!

361
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,841
Go on, walk on! That's it.
Walk on. Walk on.

362
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,429
Go around it!

363
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,227
Whoa, Joey!

364
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,650
Whoa. Joey! Joey!

365
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,278
Joey! Whoa! Whoa!

366
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,355
Joey, stop, you'll break the blade!

367
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,864
Will you look at you!

368
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,000
BOY: Mum, Dad! Come and look!

369
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,419
WOMAN 1: He's doing it!

370
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,062
MAN 1: Good lad, Albie!

371
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,313
WOMAN 2: Albert, well done!

372
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,900
MAN 2: I wouldn't have believed it!

373
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,404
I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plow blade.

374
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,700
He could lose a foot.

375
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,527
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons,

376
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:10,660
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son!

377
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,915
Or my plow, or my horse, or my field,
or my farm!

378
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,261
Come on, Albie! Push on through!

379
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:01,507
Get it done, Albie! Get it done.

380
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,108
Albie, are you all right?

381
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,530
Are you all right?

382
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,364
Up you get.

383
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,538
My pair of fools. My mighty fools.

384
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,396
You're as battered
and bloodied as he is.

385
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,268
- Where's Dad?
- Still in the bottom field.

386
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,694
Stumbling about, I suppose.

387
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,771
It's not the drink, Albert,
that makes him stumble.

388
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,902
He drinks, Mum!

389
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,485
So might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's seen.

390
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,990
He don't talk to me about it.

391
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:17,324
He don't talk about it 'cause he can't.
There aren't words for some things.

392
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,584
Come here.

393
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,265
The mice have been at it.

394
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,142
Sit down.

395
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,600
Here.

396
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,695
It's his campaign pennant.

397
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,445
He were Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry.

398
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,536
And that is
the Queen's South Africa Medal.

399
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,082
Every man who fought in the Boer War
got one of those.

400
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,750
And this...

401
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,204
That's the
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

402
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,461
- Not Dad's?
- Well, it isn't mine, dear.

403
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,215
He got that
after the fighting at Transvaal.

404
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,717
After he'd been hurt
and he'd saved some other lads,

405
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:14,969
and, well, I don't know what else.

406
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,050
He won't tell me, either.

407
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,386
But the first day he got home
he just tossed them out.

408
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,563
First day he could walk,
he threw them straight in the dustbin

409
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,437
and wouldn't hear a word I said not to.

410
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:30,231
See, what you done today,
you and Joey, you're chuffed up now,

411
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,567
and so you should be, my splendid boy.

412
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,574
It's good to be proud
when you've done something good.

413
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:40,954
But what he done in Africa,
whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.

414
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,832
Hard as it surely was
and however much pain it's cost him,

415
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,002
he refuses to be proud of killing,
I suppose.

416
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,172
I'd be proud.

417
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,262
If I'd gone off to war,
if I'd gone and saved my mates...

418
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,510
Whether or not you think
you'd do the same thing as him,

419
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,684
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud.

420
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,015
Your dad makes mistakes,

421
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,942
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that he's made,

422
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,358
but he never gave up.

423
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,611
And he does that for us.

424
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,529
And today, you showed the world
it's all been worth it.

425
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,533
You keep looking after Joey,
and he'll always be looking after you.

426
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:31,045
"Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
Imperial Yeomanry."

427
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,212
You see this, Joey?

428
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,423
It's been through an entire war.

429
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,979
I'm not stealing it.

430
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,984
I'll give it back to him someday.

431
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,147
Um...

432
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm the only boy that drives in
the village. No one else drives but me.

433
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,733
That's right, and this is my dad's car.

434
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,238
- You're lucky that you're in it.
- Your dad's car.

435
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,992
I'm not normally allowed to drive it
'cause it's so...

436
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,367
Is he a friend of yours?

437
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:07,312
Come on, boy.
Let's show her how to fly!

438

gave each man
his fair portion of bad luck.

I don't feel that any more.
I've had more than my share.

You can't.

You can't. He's mine.

- I trained him.
- Albert.

You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

486

I'm afraid it's too late, lad.
I've just paid 30 guineas for him.

Please. I'll get you money.

- Albert, sir.

- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.

496
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,254
- Is that the truth?
- No, sir, but I look 19

497
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,425
and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds,

498
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,674
and I'm strong, sir,
and I'm not afraid of anything.

499

I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert,

500

but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering.

Your father's done what he had to do,
you know that.

to purchase a horse

To be my own mount?

that I'll look after him

as closely as you've done.

508
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,796
I'll respect him and all the care
that you've taken with him.

And if I can, I'll return him to your care.

It's all right.

512
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,730
All right, turn it in. That's enough.

to base camp. They will pull guns.

Perhaps we could use some of them
with the ambulances,

- I'd like to try, sir.

694

It won't work. They're cavalry.

710
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:20,741

a parcel had come for Albert from the...

From the...

712
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,536
From over there. And I thought

713
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,116
I could go up that way in the morning,
and here it is.

714
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,037
Who'd be sending me a parcel
over there?

Well, open it and see.

01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,473
ALBERT: It's a sketchbook.

717
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,306
It's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!

718
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,901

how to fold a shirt.

Of course she did. I just wasn't listening.

But you need to listen now.
I promised her.

- Pity you didn't bring a second pair.

1211
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:44,529
Then I could cut the wire here.

1212
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:47,278
We need more wire cutters!

1213
01:55:58,493 --> 01:55:59,836

1214
01:56:01,037 --> 01:56:02,880
The cutters won't frighten him.

1215
01:56:03,999 --> 01:56:07,299
If you could cut here, holding this wire,

1216
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:10,551
- I could...
- Say no more. I'm right behind you.

1217
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:13,804
And you understand what's happening,
do you not, O Best Beloved'?

we can always send ours over

strictly speaking.

all the pretty girls.

Look at that horse!

1237
01:57:24,496 --> 01:57:28,000
Look at the muscles he's got.
Them long legs.

1238
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:31,758
They're made for running, horses.
Running away from danger.

1239
01:57:33,171 --> 01:57:35,265
Running away is all they have.

1240
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,684
And yet we taught 'em opposite.

- A war horse.
- Yeah.

1243
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,859
War horse.

1244
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:48,191
There he is.

1245
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:50,773
What a strange beast you've become.

1246
01:57:53,108 --> 01:57:54,451
And now?

1247
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:56,369
I'll take him back with me, yeah?

1248
01:57:57,028 --> 01:58:01,204
Since I supplied the cutters,
the horse is mine. This is fair, no?

1249
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,706
In a pig's eye.
He's English, plain to see.

1250
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:06,664
- You mean because he's so filthy?
- Because he's so smart!

1251
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:08,748
And you're none too clean yourself.

1252
01:58:11,376 --> 01:58:14,550

And the winner gets the horse.

and we'll be shooting again.

Don't believe I'll ever hit a target.

There are scarcely any horses left.

He's cut all over,
but this leg here has got the worst of it.

1289
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:39,592
- It's probably tetanus. It's no good.

MAN: One hundred pounds!

1406
02:11:27,421 --> 02:11:29,844
And, sir, if you bid against me,

1407
02:11:29,924 --> 02:11:34,521
I will sell the coat on my back
and bid to 110.

1408
02:11:34,595 --> 02:11:37,724
And if you bid against me again,
I will sell my farm,

1409
02:11:37,807 --> 02:11:39,901
and bid to a thousand!

1410
02:11:43,104 --> 02:11:45,106

Gone!

1413
02:11:59,453 --> 02:12:00,670
Sir.

1414
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:03,169
I'll give you all your money,
everything you paid,

1415
02:12:03,249 --> 02:12:04,341
when we get back to England.

1416
02:12:04,417 --> 02:12:06,715
- I'll give you twice what...
- You don't know anything about him.

1417
02:12:06,794 --> 02:12:09,047
But you're wrong, sir. I know everything.

1418
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:11,474
Yes, you found him.
I heard you found a horse

1419
02:12:11,549 --> 02:12:13,347
in the wire between the armies.

1420
02:12:13,426 --> 02:12:15,804
No, I found him. He raised him.

1421
02:12:17,805 --> 02:12:21,355
When I heard about the miracle horse,
I traveled three days

1422
02:12:21,434 --> 02:12:24,313
because I knew whose horse he was.

1423
02:12:25,146 --> 02:12:26,989
My granddaughter's.

1424
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:31,161
She saved his life.
He was everything to her.

1425
02:12:31,235 --> 02:12:33,203
Where is your granddaughter?

1426
02:12:33,279 --> 02:12:35,907
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

1427
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,459
He is all that I have left of her.

1428
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:48,552
(WHINNIES)

1429
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:04,276
Don't be worried, boy, when I go.

1430
02:13:04,393 --> 02:13:06,737
I won't worry over you none.

1431
02:13:06,812 --> 02:13:08,780
Hey, I found you, didn't I?

1432
02:13:10,316 --> 02:13:11,989
And you found me.

1433
02:13:15,988 --> 02:13:17,490
And we'll both...

1434
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:21,289
We'll both know
that we made it through.

1435
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:22,753
Now come on.

1436
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:26,833
We're the lucky ones.
Always have been.

1437
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:29,260
Lucky since the day I met you.

1438
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:33,256
God be with you, sir.

1439
02:13:36,175 --> 02:13:38,269
Do you know what this is?

1440
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,271
That's my father's.

1441
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:46,936
That's his regimental pennant.

1442
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:55,861
How did you come by this, sir?

1443
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:00,328
You may have this.

1444
02:14:08,457 --> 02:14:11,301
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.

1445
02:14:14,964 --> 02:14:16,341
And this.

1446
02:14:25,558 --> 02:14:26,684
- Sir, I...
- No, no, no.

1447
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:29,653
Not necessary. He belongs to you.

1448
02:14:30,813 --> 02:14:33,783
That is, of course,
what my little girl would have wanted.

1449
02:14:33,857 --> 02:14:35,825
And she was the boss.
(CHUCKLES)

1450
02:14:47,162 --> 02:14:48,505
What was her name?

1451
02:14:49,415 --> 02:14:50,758
Emilie.

1452
02:14:54,169 --> 02:14:56,171
Her name is Emilie.
