Right.

Will you look at the size
of this thing?

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,639
There's no way
I'm eating a dead rabbit.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,999

we were leaving.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
Start the fire, Nan.
We are leaving. Before lunch.

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,159
George, what happened to "home before
dark. Grab a bite on the way"?

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,319
Come on, Nan, we gotta cook it.
It's Ernie's first kill.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,349
Yeah, it's my first blood.

Hey, Dad.
Yeah.

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,759
Do you think I can get a pair of
real major league baseball cleats

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,119
when we get back?
You bet.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,759
Great. I'm gonna
spike Frankie McDowell.

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,919
NANCY: No, you're not.
Listen to your Mom, Ern.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,759
But he spiked me twice!

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,119
That's different. You go
right ahead then. George.

No, I'm fine, dear.

you can blast something.

I don't know.
I hardly saw it.

73

But it's gotta be a bear.

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,709
Could it be a gorilla?

they get that big around here,

76

SARAH: I think we should
just get out of here, Dad.

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,119
What if it's still alive?
What if it's in pain?

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,119
If it's still alive, it's
probably not in a very good mood.

79
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,105
No way it's alive!
You trashed him, Dad.

There's probably guts and
eyeballs hanging off the bumper.

81

Knock it off, Ern.

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,463

in the road, suffering.

120

have to help us lift this thing up!

I tried to hit it, Nan.

00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,839
and pick up some
cod liver oil and Tabasco.

354
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,269
It's a new energy diet. You
might wanna try it, George.

356
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,426
Exercise, Irene.
That's the only diet.

357
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,222
Plenty of energy right here!

358
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,599
Well, maybe it's just rotten
meat or eggs or something.

359
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,839
Exactly. No sense standing
around breathing it.

360
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,759
Thank you for
taking care of Little Bob.

Oh! Ernie!

362
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,439
What was that?

363
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,479
Ernie's experiment
for his science class.

364
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,119
(STAMMERING) He's got
one of those gerbils.

365
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,599
Yeah! It's so cute.

366
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,639
Only, it's more like...

367
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,959
A hamster.

368
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,345
Yeah, only bigger,
and it's always hungry.

369
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,519
Nothing more than rats getting a lucky
shake from society, if you ask me.

370
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,159
I know where you are if I need you.

371
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,586
Ernie!

372
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,589
Ernie, are you all right?

373
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,628
Boy, is this guy strong!

374
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,742
Ernie, give me your arms.
I'll lift you up.

375
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,399
It's Monday morning.
What am I gonna do about work?

376
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,679
You are going to call in sick,

377
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,519
that's what you're
going to do about work.

378
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,159
Dad's gonna just love that.

379
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,959
Can I be sick, too?
No.

380
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,719
I think you and Sarah will
be safer at school, Ernie.

381
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,519
Oh, well. At least I can
tell the kids at school

382
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,799
my dad creamed a Bigfoot.

383
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,501
You're sick, too.
We're all sick.

384
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,559
No one's going anywhere until
I figure out what to do!

385
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,783
Get out of the fridge,
Ernie.

386
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,067
Coffee?

387
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,990
Now, it took some doing, but...

388
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,301
At least for now
it seems to be trapped.

389
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,306
GEORGE: It's okay!

390
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,068

(GROWLING)

394
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,071
It's hurt.

395
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,519
Are we sure we don't have
anything that doesn't sting?

396
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,239
Don't I wish.

397
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,279
Yeah, this is going
to hurt a little, okay?

398
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,027
What I do is just close my
eyes real tight. Like this.

399
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,559

(BLOWING)

401
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,061
Good.

402
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,279
Does this mean we can keep him?

403
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,820
Oh, grow up!

404
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,661
Maybe we can.
I don't know.

405
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,159
You don't know?

406
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,159
The answer is "No."
Now you know.

407
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,399
It was just so different
when it was dead.

408
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,907
George, you were different.

409
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,639
And I'm convinced he wasn't dead.

410
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,422
Hey, hang on. I thought we were
gonna sell it, and get rich.

411
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,587
Let's keep it and get rich.
Exactly.

412
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,502

I don't believe this family! Sorry.

413
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,702
We are talking about a living,
breathing being here.

414
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,199
It might even be
some kind of a person.

415
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,343
It's a Bigfoot person.

416
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,223
We don't even know what it is.

417
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,039
We don't know
if it's male or female.

418
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,439
Definitely male.

419
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,390

420
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,239
Oh, don't answer that, honey.
Never mind.

421
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,719
Nan, I don't know how, but we gotta
figure a way to keep this thing.

00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,919
It's big bucks, don't you see?

423
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,519
I mean, it's a ticket
to a better life!

424
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,559
A better life for whom?
What about his life?

425
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,703
I'm thinking about us.

426
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,546
I just need time
to figure away to...

427
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,060
Oh, well.

428
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,588
At least he's safe here.

LAFLEUR: You should not have
given up, my old friend.

430
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,799
The only difference
between these and those

431
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,239
is I get a buck a strand for mine.

432
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,269
These are real, Doc.

433
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,999
I chased a set of tracks
for two or three miles.

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,747
Okay, Jocko, if you've got
castings, I'll buy them,

435
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,559
but let's keep the price
on the ground.

436
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,749
Listen, you don't understand!

437
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,799
I almost had him.
I was that close.

438
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,341
Then what, gun jam?

439
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,749
Or maybe a change of heart.

440
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,879
Had him in your sights
and couldn't do it?

441
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,786
What's the story this time?
I don't know.

442
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,559
I think he was hit by a car.

443
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,439
That should have made it easy.

444
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,919
Yes, I know but...

445
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,559
There are no traces,
no tracks, nothing.

446
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,023
He just vanished.

447
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,359
Well, like I tell my customers,

448
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,549

449
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,319
I don't know why the
hell I bother with you!

450
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,159
Because you figure I'm the only one

451
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,959
who deep down wants to believe you,

452
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,150
but I don't.
Not any more.

453
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,639
We both spent our whole lives
chasing after that beast,

454
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,119
and we both have to stare at
ourselves in the mirror every morning

455
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,479
and keep repeating,
"I'm not a fool!"

456
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,828
"I am not a fool!"

457
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,879
Only you finally blinked!

458
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,228
Or finally opened my eyes!

459
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,462
We'll find out soon enough!

460
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,063
Go for it, Jocko!
Raise a ruckus!

461
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,141
God knows, I can use the business.

462
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,987
Put the stuff
in the freezer, honey.

463
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,542
Where is he?
Living room.

464
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,027
Everything is melting. Have I
got something to show you.

465
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,039
George, give me a second.

466
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,759
Irene had us cornered out
there for 15 minutes.

467
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,279
She invited us to dinner and bowling.
Bowling?

468
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,319
Don't worry, George, I spared you.

469
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,319
I told her you had something to
drop off tonight, don't you?

470
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,439
Don't be so sure.

when you've seen what I've seen.

Come on.

473
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,279
George, those are
just empty calories.

474
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,345
Never mind about that.
No, no, no, no.

00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,306
That's great!
You taught him how to sit?

supposed to happen!

None of this was
supposed to happen,

505
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,479
but it did, and now we have
to do the right thing!

just give me one more week.

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,462
I think he likes it here.

526
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,239
<i>What kind of a way
is that to talk to a baby?</i>

527
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,701
<i>What do you mean?</i>

528
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,622
She's gone.
It's time to go.

529
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,350
Remember this?
Your favorite station wagon.

530
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,399
Right. What's left of it.

No, no, no.

533

It's really much nicer
on the inside. Come on.

534
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,661
Perfect.

535
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,239
Hungry? We're gonna
have a little party.

536
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,588
Yeah. A goodbye party.

537
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,744
Plan B.
No problem.

538
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,541
See what we're gonna be missing?

539
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,582
Never mind.
Let's eat. Nancy?

540
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,101
Here. Ern.

541
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,664
Have you ever had a burger?

542
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,191
Smells good.

543
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,199

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,786

546
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,559
Oh, right.

547
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,799
Yours was the fish. Here.

548
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,670
This is for him,

549
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,982
the burgers are for you.

550
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,621
You want another?
I ordered wrong.

551
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,148
Double fish on a sesame bun.

552
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,304
Catch of the day.

553
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,102
Covered with tartar sauce.

554
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,228
How about some fries, huh?

555
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,631
Extra larges, two orders.

556
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,666
You can wash it down
with a chocolate shake.

557
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,663
Look at all this stuff!

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,623

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,550
Comfortable?

562
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,871

563
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,306
Stay.

564
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,590
Stay right there.

565
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,385
You're not changing
your mind, are you?

566
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,908
Your mom's right, Ern.

567
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,345
I know it's hard.
It's hard for me, too.

568
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,747
But it's the right thing to do.

569
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,344
It was wrong of me to think that we
could just claim it like a stray dog.

570
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,279
He's more of a man than an animal.

571
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,469
You were the first one to see that.

572
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,383
He deserves to be free.

573
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,265
Mom's right.

574
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,267
He's gotta go back
where he belongs.

575
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,987
So why don't you and me

576
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,350
go on down there,
like a couple of real men

577
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,999
and say, "Goodbye, hairy friend."

And I'm from

and I'm investigating a possible
road-kill, with an animal

either killed or maimed
in a car accident.

Now, I know that you did
hit something on Route A-4

00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,839
which was a little fire road
off the I-90?

We couldn't see it.

Mrs. Henderson, obviously, our
main concern are for your family,

666
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,879
to be sure no one was injured.

667
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,024
No one was injured.
I'm so pleased.

668
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,439
Obviously our other concern is for the
safety of that poor little animal.

669
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,159
It could be out there suffering

670
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,624
and I know you would want to help
me find it so I could care for it.

00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,039
No. I mean, yes.

672

But I mean,
there's nothing wrong with it.

673
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,919
It walked into the woods.
I mean, it didn't even limp.

674
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,426
Walked?

675
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,279
It crawled, it scurried,
you know, it scampered,

676
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,222
it kind of wobbled, creeped,
like an animal does, you know?

677
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,430
Anyway, he's fine,
and we are fine and...

And a potty.

of us and bringing this to us.

No. Just into my own back yard.

There he goes, just like clockwork.

701
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,870
Jeez, Dad,
who the hell is that guy?

702
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,799
Jacques LaFleur.

703
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,999
He's always the first to show when
these crazy sightings start up.

704
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,144
He bought some
pretty serious ammo, .458s.

705
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,547
Before Sasquatch got under his
skin he was a Class A hunter.

Yeah.

708
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,159
Why would he part
with a trophy like that?

709
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,270
Probably because
it was the smallest one.

00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,919
you've seen hundreds,
thousands of pigeons, right?

742
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,224
Of course.
Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?

743
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,559
Well, neither have I.

744
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,067
But I got a hunch they exist.

745

I'm George Henderson.

746
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,669
Wrightwood ain't here.

747
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,639
Is he coming back?
He might.

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,439
Could I leave a message for...

in this, Mr. Henderson?

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,919
what if Jack and his family

00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,984
opened up their home

767
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,310
and their lives to this thing?

768
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,919
And, what if they found out that
he was more human than animal,

769
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,839
and they just said,
"We'll take him in.

770
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:42,306
"We'll accept responsibility for him until
a safe place can be found for him to be."

to take this creature in,

(IMITATING POLICE SIREN)

1211
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,919
George, could you go
a little faster?

1212
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,719
All right, Mom!
That sucker's history!

1213
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,581
Don't kid yourself. This
is the part he's good at.

1214
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,705
ALL: Yay!

1215
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,744
WRIGHTWOOD: I always miss it.

1216
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,502
Hurry.
Up here, George.

1217
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,741
Hurry!

1218
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,871
You better make this
a short goodbye, George.

1219
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,310
You've gotta go back
where you belong now.

1220
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,350
Come on, now.

1221
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,190
It's LaFleur!

1222
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,669
Harry, you've gotta go!

1223
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,946
LaFleur!

1224
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,831
Hurry, please, please!
There's no time!

1225
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,302
No, don't worry about us!

1226
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,664
We'll be all right.

1227
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,479
Get out of here!

1228
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,590
Can't you see
we don't want you anymore?

1229
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,790
Why can't you go back
where you came from?

1230
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,264
Now, leave us alone!

1231
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,501
Go.

1232
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,181
Go!

(WHIMPERING)

1234
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,864
Goodbye, my friend.

1235
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,183
There's no need to cry.

1236
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,700
We'll never see him again, will we?

1237
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:22,742
Sure we will! We can just
follow his footprints.

1238
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,065
Footprints.

1239
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,784
(WHISPERING) Scatter.
Anything to throw him off!

1240
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,189
It's a goddamn herd!

Good God! Harry, no!

(PANTING)

1254
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,359
Listen to me. You're wrong!
I was like you!

1255
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,319
I almost killed him myself!

1256
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,759
But it would have been murder!
He's not an animal!

1257
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,199
He's our friend!

1258
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,039
For God's sake, Jacques,
open your eyes!

1259
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,879
Are you people out of your minds?

1260
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:00,359
Do you think I'm going to stop now?

1261
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,039
I'm going to kill him.
You're not gonna kill him!

1262
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,213
You're not gonna hurt him!
I won't let you!

1263
01:42:05,214 --> 01:42:05,799
George!

1264
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,829
George!
I'll kill you first!

1265
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,109
Don't let him kill me!

1266
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:32,382
Don't let him kill me!
Please, don't let him kill me!

1267
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,744
Don't let him kill me! Please,
don't, don't let him kill me.

1268
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,221
I'm...

1269
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,786
No, no...

1270
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,825
Jacques LaFleur, meet Harry.

1271
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,830
Harry Henderson.

1272
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,508
Strange feeling, eh, Doc?

WRIGHTWOOD:
What are you talking about?

1274
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,519
LAFLEUR: It's over.
Over?

1275
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,788
Why, it's just the beginning.

1276
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,719
Jocko, this old ticker hasn't
thumped like this for years.

1277
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,599
It's like going to heaven with
your feet still on the ground.

1278
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,347
And we get to share it with
one of our oldest friends.

(LAUGHING)

1280
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,465
Goodbye, Harry.

1281
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,989
We gotta let him go.

1282
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,826
GEORGE: Harry...

1283
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:57,106
I never got a chance to thank you.

1284
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:03,546
I don't think you'll ever know
how much you've meant to us.

1285
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,861
You take care of
yourself now, okay?

1286
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,346
Okay.

01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,383

They have a language?

1288
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,227
Now, Jocko, what for you?
I don't know.

1289
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,788
There's always Loch Ness.
