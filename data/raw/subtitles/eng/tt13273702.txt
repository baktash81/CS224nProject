2
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,921
<i>The caterers are sets.</i>

3
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,857
I've just confirmed
the string quartet

4
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,038
and everything else you need
to know is in here.

5
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,928
Alphabetized and color-coded.

6
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,808
There shouldn't
be any surprises.

7
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,133
- It's black-tie formal.
- Just like the last three years.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,869
Well... not too
repetitive, I hope?

9
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,639
Its... its' more of a...
Christmas classic.

10
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,719
It's always a huge success,
so I'm not worried.

11
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,678
Although, you've always been here
to handle everything in person.

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,847
I know, I'm sorry.
This is the first Christmas

13
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,393
that my parents have been away
and my sister really...

14
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,885
Go. Don't worry. You've done
all the heavy lifting.

15
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,227
And if we need anything,
we can always ask Trey.

16
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,428
Go. Before
I change my mind.

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,331
Right. Going.

18
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,135
I'm just wondering, is there...
any news on the promotion front?

19
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,871
I'm sorry, not yet.

20
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:48,752
They promised to let me know
before you took of, but so far nothing.

21
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,354
It's okay, I get it,
everyone's busy with the holidays.

22
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,379
- Just keep your phone close.
- I always do.

23
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,759
And I'll call you
as soon as I hear.

24
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,117
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,578
Okay, before you say anything,
I'm almost there.

26
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:52,271
Hey, it's a Christmas miracle!
Didn't think they'd ever let you escape.

27
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,340
Careful.
There's still time.

28
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,676
Okay, how many times
has mom called you so far?

29
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,945
Four times,
just from the airport.

30
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,324
And twice when
they got to Hawaii.

31
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,215
I'm so happy they went, though.

32
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,996
I can't remember the last time
they went somewhere, just the two of them.

33
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,587
Dad said it was before you
guys adopted me. Is that true?

34
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,822
You mean back
when life was peaceful?

35
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,484
Oh, please.

36
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,471
No, I'm really glad you
decided to spend Christmas

37
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,329
- with me and Tim's family this year.
- I know. I'm so excited, too.

38
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,332
Plus, you said the magic words.

39
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,934
You-know-who won't be there.

40
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,504
Well...

41
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:29,107
Okay, I'm super excited
you're coming.

42
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,545
Yeah. I just have to quickly
stop for gas and I will be right there.

43
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,282
- Okay! See you soon. Love you!
- Love you!

44
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,999
- Hi!
- Hey! Let me help you with that.

45
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,101
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

46
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,702
Hi!

47
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,641
- Hi, Tim.
- Hey.

48
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,809
Thank you so much for having me!

49
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,221
You're so welcome.

50
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,680
Well, I'm very excited for
my first Barnett Christmas.

51
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,250
Me too. Well,
my first<i> as</i> a Barnett.

52
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,456
Okay, you two...

53
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,160
Sorry. Sorry.

54
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,906
Why don't I take these inside
and then I'll send Paul out

55
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,766
to grab the rest of the stuff.
This is... all of it, right?

56
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,746
Yeah. This is all of it.
Did you just... say Paul?

57
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,671
- Yeah.
- He's here?

58
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:10,008
- You know my brother.
- Not really.

59
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,190
You never know where
his vacation's gonna end up

60
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,399
until you get the postcard.
I mean, that's Paul.

61
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,262
Okay. I'm gonna take
these inside.

62
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,620
Nice and light.

63
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,988
Thank you!

64
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,216
Okay, before you say anything,
it's just for one night.

65
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,238
Why didn't you tell me?

66
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,206
It was super last minute
and I didn't want to give you

67
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,008
an excuse to turn around
and go back to work.

68
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,992
They do not get another
holiday out of you.

69
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:38,870
I'm sorry, but is it really
that big a deal?

70
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,007
I know he was a bit...
blunt at the wedding, but...

71
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,609
That's an understatement.
A big one.

72
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,323
He's still going
on his ski trip.

73
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,846
To Switzerland?

74
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,426
He's just leaving
in the morning now.

75
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,950
In the morning. Okay.

76
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,886
You know what?

77
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,521
It's fine. It's fine.

78
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,324
So, you won't say anything?

79
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:03,028
You don't have to worry
about me. I can handle anything.

80
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,230
For a night.

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
You're gonna love it here.

82
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,602
Judy said you're just upstairs.

83
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,973
- It's cold.
- Let me grab your bag.

84
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,075
You weren't kidding.
This is beautiful.

85
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,543
Oh yeah, gorgeous.

86
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,313
This is their vacation home?

87
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,715
Yeah, I know, right?

88
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,184
Come one!

89
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:30,122
Well, I should probably take
these off. I've got... snow everywhere.

90
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,160
I am so... sorry.
Are you okay?

91
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,729
- I...
- Yeah, I am fine.

92
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,698
I'm... I'm fine.

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,299
You made it.

94
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,969
Yup. I did.

95
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:48,206
Man, I hope it didn't take you
as long to get here as it took me.

96
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:52,911
I mean, getting out of the city
was brutal. Am I right?

97
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,447
What am I doing?
Let me get your bags.

98
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,649
No. No, I'm good.

99
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,984
No?

100
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,420
No.

101
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:05,323
Okay. Well, how 'bout
your pillow?

102
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,093
- I got it.
- Hey! Hi.

103
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,115
You remember my sister?
From the wedding?

104
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,298
Of course. How could I forget
our chicken dance, huh?

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,701
Well, it was a group dance,
wasn't "ours".

106
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,306
Okay. Good clarification.

107
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,775
You made it!

108
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,076
And in good time, too.

109
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,546
Hi! Thank you so much
for having me.

110
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,859
- Thank you for coming!
- Can I take those? Bring them upstairs?

111
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,917
Yeah.
That would be wonderful.

112
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,052
- Alright.
- Thanks. Thanks!

113
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,834
- You must be starving. Come on in!
- I am.

114
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,168
As much as I hate you
missing Christmas,

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,479
I know it's the only time
you can get away from work.

116
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,638
I know. Thank you, mom.

117
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,209
- You should be an accountant.
- Why?

118
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,246
You know your brother. He's not
really one for, you know, sitting still.

119
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,515
I don't wanna sit still.

120
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,017
There's a whole big world out
there just ready to be seen.

121
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,053
And I want to see it.

122
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:09,254
I'm just saying you get
a lot more time off

123
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:13,492
as an accountant as you do
as a building contractor.

124
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,760
Would you like
anything else, Hayley?

125
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,308
- You haven't really touched...
- No! I'm good. Everything was so delicious.

126
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,032
I just ate too much granola
on the way up here.

127
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:25,537
Hey, I was gonna ask...
where's that boyfriend of yours?

128
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,839
I'm sorry?

129
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,509
Simon, wasn't it?
Nice British fellow.

130
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,155
We had a good "chinwag"
at the wedding.

131
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,019
I think that's what
they call it. Chinwag.

132
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,416
Well, I'm guessing
he's back home in London.

133
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,918
I can't be so sure.

134
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,854
Why's that? Because...
not together anymore?

135
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,156
No. No. Not.

136
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,993
We actually broke up
shortly after the wedding.

137
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,829
You did?

138
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,765
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

139
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,570
Don't be. It's okay.
It's all good.

140
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,978
- Okay! Who wants dessert?
- I'll help you!

141
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,417
- It's just for one night.
- Yup.

142
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,724
Okay, now... don't worry,
it doesn't need to be fancy.

143
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,793
Just has to come from the heart.

144
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,063
- We're making gifts?
- A gift. One each.

145
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,776
Everyone will take a name and...

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,167
I guess whoever gets Paul

147
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,537
- will have to make something real quick.
- Wait. Where is Paul?

148
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,507
Is that mom again?

149
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,642
No, actually,
it's work. I...

150
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,078
- Take it outside.
- What?

151
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,659
- The reception's better out there, okay?
- Okay.

152
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,283
Kim! Hi. You're
breaking up. Can you hear me?

153
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:49,220
Kim? Hello? Can you
hear me now?

154
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:53,491
Your reception's not great.
And so far, no news.

155
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,862
Well, I guess that's
better than bad news, right?

156
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,043
They're now saying they
don't want to make the decision

157
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,933
until after the event
on the 23rd.

158
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,003
Okay.

159
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,640
Speaking of... how do you feel
about circus performers?

160
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,677
Trey's old idea?
The one we all shot down?

161
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,847
Well, personally,
I wouldn't hire them to serve

162
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,627
and I'm not a fan
of last-second changes,

163
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,551
but if it's shock value
you're after...

164
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,564
Hayley, everyone here
loves the idea.

165
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,191
You've already decided.

166
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,994
Well, I guess,
just keep me posted, then.

167
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,662
Of course, I will.

168
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,642
Yeah. Well,
you know where to find me.

169
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,199
Bye.

170
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,301
Bye.

171
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,671
Terrific.

172
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,907
You drop the call?

173
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,844
Happens a lot out here.

174
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:48,992
You know, sometimes there's better service
in the driveway if you want to try it.

175
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,950
- I'm fine.
- Did you try to shake it?

176
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,252
What?

177
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,121
Your phone. It helps.

178
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,092
I'm kidding.
It's a joke.

179
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,933
Okay. It might...
Did I do something?

180
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,537
Is that a question
or another joke?

181
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,639
Question.

182
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,987
You know, it's really
not a great time to ask.

183
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,011
Come on!

184
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,281
Fine. You really
wanna know?

185
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,016
I do.

186
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,454
You had no right
dooming my relationship.

187
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,489
Excuse me?

188
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,159
Do you not remember what
you said? At the wedding?

189
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,494
Oh no, I do.

190
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,963
But all I said was
that your boyfriend

191
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,732
was clearly going
to move back to London.

192
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,835
Yeah. Without me!

193
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,271
Who says that to someone?
At a wedding?

194
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,040
It was just an observation.

195
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,711
Yeah. An observation
which forced a conversation.

196
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,580
A conversation,
without which, who knows?

197
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,549
Might've worked out differently.

198
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,818
Why are you laughing?

199
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,786
I'm sorry. Sorry.

200
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,889
You actually blame me
for your breakup?

201
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,426
What? No. No. I...

202
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,307
You wanted to know if you did
anything and I just told you, okay?

203
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:15,467
Great. Great. Well, then,
can I make one more observation?

204
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,068
- No. You may not.
- No?

205
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,570
- No.
- No?

206
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,505
- No.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm sorry.
I must. I must!

208
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,544
If your relationship ended
because of one conversation...

209
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,749
it wasn't gonna work
in the first place!

210
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,918
Is that your expert opinion?

211
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,587
Yeah.

212
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,069
Well, that's... I'm sorry.
I find that actually really funny

213
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,527
because I've heard that
you're not quite an expert

214
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,773
in the relationship
department yourself.

215
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,098
You're too busy!
You're always traveling.

216
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,268
You're Paul
"Who Can't Sit Still".

217
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,805
What does that have
to do with anything?

218
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,185
Nothing. I'm just saying
I'm not surprised.

219
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,177
What? That I don't
have a girlfriend?

220
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,446
Word of advice...

221
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:06,017
observations aren't
always helpful. Or wanted.

222
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,820
Okay. Okay.

223
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,724
Well, thank you for that...
"observation".

224
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,960
- Anything else?
- No. I think we're good.

225
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,729
- Good.
- Good.

226
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,898
- Good!
- Good.

227
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,997
What am I supposed to do with an...
oven mitt?

228
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,506
Embellish.

229
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,276
You could make it
a fancy chapeau.

230
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,381
Okay! It's time
to pick names!

231
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,083
Hayley, as our guest,
you go first.

232
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,518
Okay. Yeah.

233
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,228
So, how'd it go?

234
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,698
You mean out there, right now?

235
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,734
- Yeah.
- With your work call?

236
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,971
Oh, that? It was...
it's not great.

237
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,708
I mean, it was... yeah.
Not great.

238
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,345
What'd the airline say?

239
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,448
They're not letting anybody out.

240
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,917
Out? What do you...
what do you mean "out"?

241
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,121
Well, turns out there's a big
snow storm in Northern Europe,

242
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,658
so... next flight out
isn't until Christmas Day.

243
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,904
Does this mean you're staying?!

244
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,363
For like... five more days?

245
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,233
Apparently.

246
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,035
- You just made my Christmas!
- That makes two of us.

247
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,219
Here you go.
Now you've got towels, water...

248
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,556
And these super cute jammies.
Thank you.

249
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,625
It's nothing.
They were on sale.

250
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,371
I get them for all
the kids every Christmas.

251
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,275
Whether they like it or not.

252
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,743
Are you sure you don't want me to sleep
on the couch? I honestly don't mind.

253
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,301
Oh, please! Paul insisted
you have his room.

254
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,763
- He did?
- He wasn't even supposed to be here.

255
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,773
Yeah. That's right.
Well, thank you.

256
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,276
Just let me know if you need
anything. Goodnight!

257
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,344
Goodnight!

258
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,062
He's been everywhere.

259
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,437
Did you really say something?

260
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,072
Cute jammies.

261
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,407
Did you?

262
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,343
What? It...
It wasn't that bad.

263
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,645
What did you say?

264
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:51,849
Just that he had no right
commenting on my relationship.

265
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,063
I actually think it was a really
good thing for him to hear.

266
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,220
Good? Good how?

267
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,190
From a personal-development
standpoint?

268
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,727
In fact, I think it actually might
help him in his future relationships.

269
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,497
I'm sure he was very
appreciative. Hayley!

270
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm sorry, okay?
I thought he was leaving.

271
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,736
And then... the words
just kind of came out.

272
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,506
- After that circus call.
- You mean with work?

273
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,177
I had everything set up,
down to every little detail

274
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,212
and then...

275
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,526
It doesn't matter because I'm not there,
so they hire someone else...

276
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,284
It will not be because
you took a break.

277
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,853
You deserve this
promotion, Hayle.

278
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,788
You know that.

279
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,859
You've been there forever and if
they don't promote you, just...

280
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,662
Just quit.
You could go anywhere.

281
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,131
- It's not that easy.
- Why not?

282
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,935
Because I've been there forever.

283
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,271
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

284
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,774
I know you wanted
this weekend to be perfect.

285
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:53,344
It's fine. Maybe even better
you got it off your chest?

286
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:57,248
I know you're lying.
But I appreciate it.

287
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,651
Just get a good night's
sleep, okay?

288
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,454
I plan on sleeping in as late
as humanly possible tomorrow.

289
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,491
Good.

290
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,294
- I love you.
- I love you more.

291
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,033
Okay, fine.

292
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:53,137
Fine. I'm up.

293
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,684
Good morning.

294
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,620
I can't believe everybody's
actually up.

295
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,322
Yeah.
You didn't you know?

296
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,991
We're all real early risers
here, especially Paul.

297
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,928
I had no idea.

298
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,230
You still clocked
a good eight, right?

299
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,900
Smoothie?

300
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,635
No.
I'm... I'm good with...

301
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,003
- Coffee.
- Yes.

302
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,939
Your second cup is standing by.

303
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,174
So, Hayley, how much time do
you need to get ready?

304
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,777
Ready? For what?

305
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,039
Well, if you want to know what's
happening, it's right over there.

306
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,138
- We're going ice skating?
- For a start.

307
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,696
Well...

308
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,865
I'm not the best ice skater.

309
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:58,169
So I'm just gonna hang here
and you guys can go.

310
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,107
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

311
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,577
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, our mom has a strict

312
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,147
no-man-left-behind policy
at Christmas, so...

313
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:13,251
Well, she likes us
all together, all week.

314
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,297
It's what makes
the holidays special.

315
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,422
Otherwise it's just
a lot of stuff we do.

316
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,559
- That's right, mom.
- Right?

317
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,595
Yeah.
You know I love it.

318
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,932
So what are we thinking?
Can we all be ready in ten?

319
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,200
- Ten.
- Yeah.

320
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,570
- Yep.
- Ready in ten? All right.

321
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,041
- Refill?
- Well, this is relaxing.

322
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,945
Just... think of all
the fresh air we're gonna get.

323
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,847
Yeah.

324
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,899
Bless you.

325
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,241
- Here, this'll warm you up.
- Thank you, honey.

326
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,903
I'm fine! You go on.

327
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,005
No. That's the last
thing they need;

328
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,708
the old man showing them up.

329
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,844
- Looking good, Hales!
- Thanks!

330
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,847
I was just thinking
the same thing.

331
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:26,891
Alright. So, I think
I already know the answer,

332
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,860
but are you sure you
don't want any help?

333
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,262
Positive.

334
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:37,668
Just one piece of advice...
don't look at your feet.

335
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,937
It sounds counterintuitive,
but trust me.

336
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,839
It'll make it a lot easier.

337
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,841
Okay. I'm fine!

338
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,714
Are you always this stubborn?

339
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,484
Stubbornness has nothing
to do with this.

340
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,222
Okay, okay, okay.
You're right. I'm sorry.

341
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,158
I probably should've
found a better time

342
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,728
to comment on your boyfriend
than at the wedding.

343
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,298
Thank you.

344
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,433
But you really should
have seen it coming.

345
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,270
Excuse me?

346
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,550
Well, I mean, look, I know
he was your type and all.

347
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,440
And I get it. I do.

348
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,910
But if I could see the handwriting
on the wall in just a weekend...

349
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,057
And how exactly do you know
what my type is?

350
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,814
Easy.

351
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,483
What?

352
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:29,220
- You're a creature of habit.
- No! No, I am not.

353
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,134
You sure about that? You have
two cups of coffee. Every morning.

354
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,725
So does every other person
on planet Earth.

355
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,664
I'm pretty sure you take trail
mix with you everywhere you go.

356
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,034
Well, I don't like to be hungry. And,
besides, it's granola.

357
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:48,439
You travel...
With your own pillow?

358
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,375
You clearly have a thing
for guys with accents.

359
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,943
I'm guessing...
mostly British?

360
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,945
- What?!
- Safe,

361
00:21:55,048 --> 00:22:00,518
predictable, suit-wearing
men with British accents.

362
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,987
Are those bad things?

363
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,692
They're not bad.
If they're working for you.

364
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,267
Okay, can you... can you give me
a little space, please?

365
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,936
You want me to leave?

366
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,507
Yeah. I do.
You know, actually,

367
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,110
I think it would probably be
in everyone's best interest

368
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,847
if you and I give each other
space the entire week.

369
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:34,618
Tricky, considering
my mom's policy, and all.

370
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,822
And the fact that we're staying
in the same house.

371
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:41,592
But, you know, I think
there's enough of us,

372
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,228
we could probably figure out
some sort of... buffer.

373
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,497
Great.

374
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,799
- Good.
- Good.

375
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,819
I'm just going to start
making the cookie dough.

376
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,555
- Honey, you need to lie down.
- It's almost Christmas!

377
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,191
We have to finish
decorating upstairs,

378
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,660
we've a ton of desserts
to make, a tree to get...

379
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,430
Not to mention
the charity event.

380
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,144
I haven't even checked
in on the decorations or the food for that.

381
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,179
Well, I already finished
the sleigh for the donations,

382
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,481
so you don't have to worry
about that, mom.

383
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:28,572
It really is beautiful.

384
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:32,309
Thank you. Now, please, would
you just get a... short nap?

385
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,712
No, I'm fine.

386
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,061
Well, you're right.
The reception is definitely

387
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,953
better out there, but...
still no updates.

388
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,658
- What's wrong?
- Judy's not feeling so great.

389
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
- Oh no, really?
- Oh, it's nothing.

390
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:53,197
I'll be fine after a quick...

391
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,832
Mom?

392
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,767
What was I saying?

393
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,470
Okay, that's it.
Time for bed!

394
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,612
- This can't be happening.
- Come on.

395
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,363
What am I gonna do?

396
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:03,952
Well, not worry about
Christmas for starters.

397
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,788
We'll take care of everything
while you rest, mom.

398
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,011
Yeah.

399
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,590
Well, what about
the charity gala?

400
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,993
If anything comes up, we're
all here to help with that, too.

401
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,850
- Come on.
- You know,

402
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,520
- I don't think this looks that bad.
- That's not her list.

403
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,857
Behind you.

404
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,736
Don't worry. Christmas'll
be perfect. I promise.

405
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,439
Listen to the kids.
They got this.

406
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,476
They'll do everything together,
just like we do every year.

407
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:41,111
Will you take a lot of photos?
And still make your gifts?

408
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:42,746
Yes, mama.

409
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,316
- And you...
- No! Bed time.

410
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,251
We'll get you some tea.

411
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,491
Well...

412
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,728
So much for a buffer.

413
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,854
I still don't know what I'm
supposed to do with an empty CD case.

414
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:16,046
Dude, your wife's an art
teacher. You know that, right?

415
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,893
- It's not rubbin' off.
- I don't know.

416
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:21,252
What about that time
you made me... never mind.

417
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,823
Okay, so I have taken
all of your mom's lists

418
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,093
and I've combined them and
made one massive spreadsheet

419
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,862
so we know exactly what we need
to do for the rest of the week.

420
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,464
- There you go.
- Thank you.

421
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,901
And one for you.

422
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,639
Are you always this organized?

423
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,908
- Yes!
- Yes.

424
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,778
She used to tidy up my toys.
When she was four.

425
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,914
I was thinking for
the more functional items,

426
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,383
we can divide and conquer?
Girls against boys.

427
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:55,786
So, is this your new buffer?

428
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,888
I just wanted us to get
on the same page

429
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,491
and now each of us have
our own page.

430
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:03,160
Okay, so let's look at today.
December 21st...

431
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,873
We're going to go
pick up the food

432
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,075
and you guys can go upstairs
and finish the decorating.

433
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,000
- Sound good? Great.
- Seems fair.

434
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,269
I can't believe I thought
mom was over the top

435
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,362
for making us camp out in front
of the Christmas tree every year.

436
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,387
Tim's mother is officially
next level.

437
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,715
I think it's actually
pretty mild in comparison.

438
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:33,991
To what?

439
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,895
You think Judy's
chart is too much?

440
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,342
Their grandma used to map out
all twelve days of Christmas.

441
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,799
For everyone.

442
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,170
What? What's wrong?

443
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,306
Nothing.
I... I'm fine.

444
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:53,043
Might just be the smell
of the blue cheese or...

445
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,812
the camembert.

446
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:57,247
Oh no...

447
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,383
No, no, no! Please!
You can't be getting sick, too.

448
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,120
You can't go down and
leave me alone with Paul.

449
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,256
Why are you looking
at me like that?

450
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,860
Wait! Wait, you're not.

451
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,630
Are you seriously pregnant?

452
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,610
Okay, okay. Alright,
I'll keep it down. But what?

453
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,867
I know.
It's still early,

454
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,914
so we're not telling anyone.
Not 'til Christmas.

455
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,405
So, that's why Tim
was acting so weird?

456
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:25,342
Well, he's a bit cautious,
anyways. In general.

457
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,444
That is true.

458
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:31,215
But he doesn't want anyone
to know yet. Not even you.

459
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:34,151
- Okay.
- Not 'til we tell his parents.

460
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,098
I don't know how
I'm going to tell them.

461
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,555
I mean, Judy is so good
at making everything special

462
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,492
and... I...

463
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:45,062
Hey. You're going
to be an amazing mom.

464
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,332
I hope so.

465
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,701
You will.
I'm so happy for you!

466
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,879
Thank you.

467
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,349
Why don't we just call Paul?
He's got that big truck.

468
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,984
He can pull us out in,
like, a second.

469
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:10,521
No. No, no. I got this,
okay? No need for Paul.

470
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,993
Okay. I think we're good.

471
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,105
So sorry.

472
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,847
I don't know why
I'm so exhausted.

473
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,875
I feel like all I do
is sleep all the time.

474
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,677
Hey! Don't apologize.

475
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,513
You just need to lay down and
I will cover for you. Okay?

476
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,615
I'm sorry. I know you're
not a big fan of Paul's.

477
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:41,485
Stop apologizing.
It's fine.

478
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,755
We will do anything we need
to do. And I promise...

479
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,757
I will act like I know nothing.

480
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,629
Hey there, Tim!

481
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,765
- Hey.
- Hi.

482
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,700
She knows, doesn't she?

483
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,237
- What?
- It's okay!

484
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,484
I mean, she's your sister and your best
friend, of course she knows.

485
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,008
Sorry, I tried.

486
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:09,146
And for the record... you both
have terrible poker faces.

487
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,357
Hey.

488
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,429
Hey. Thought I heard
you guys come in.

489
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,933
Yeah, about that.
They're not feeling that good.

490
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:33,904
Amy, especially, so they're
just gonna take it easy.

491
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,408
And considering your dad
is taking care of your mom,

492
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:40,711
that means it's just...

493
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,513
It's just the two us.

494
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,482
For the moment. Yeah.

495
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,685
But,

496
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:52,156
we do need to get a Christmas
tree tomorrow at some point.

497
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,625
Tut-tut-tut. Let me guess;

498
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,028
divide and conquer?

499
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,264
Well, unfortunately,
if we want to pick a tree

500
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,266
that meets your mom's
expectations,

501
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:06,336
it's probably going to take
at least two people.

502
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:13,610
You mean... you...

503
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,145
want to do this together?

504
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,849
You and me?

505
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,785
Well, 'cause you need
my help, I...

506
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,121
Need is a strong word,

507
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,658
but, yeah.
I guess so.

508
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,661
Okay. Well, look,
I just need you to know...

509
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:34,565
you see, my mother? Now she's
going to require a lot of photos.

510
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,034
Lots of pictures.

511
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,770
And that means you're going
to have to smile. A lot.

512
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,539
Whole bunch of holiday cheer.
And, you know...

513
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,341
Okay! Are you done?

514
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,977
No.
No, no, no, no.

515
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:52,015
I'm just gettin' started.

516
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,884
You're impossible,
you know that?

517
00:30:55,855 --> 00:31:00,190
Okay. Well, I'm going
but tree, tomorrow.

518
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:04,528
You got it. Hayley...
we're taking my truck.

519
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,630
Why?

520
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,932
'Cause we don't want
to waste any time

521
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,837
getting stuck in
the snow, now, do we?

522
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,672
Good night.

523
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,603
Mistletoe?
Definitely not.

524
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,574
What?

525
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:28,645
Nothing.

526
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,815
Okay, fine. I may eat
a lot of granola,

527
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:35,986
but at least I don't have
a creepy elf clock in my room.

528
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:42,259
Hey! And, one...
that's my childhood room.

529
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,595
Two... I won an award
for that clock.

530
00:32:45,698 --> 00:32:47,431
In the fifth grade.

531
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:49,733
You... you made it?

532
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:53,470
Well, I mean, it's not...
it's not creepy,

533
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,074
it's just...

534
00:32:57,176 --> 00:33:00,510
It's...

535
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,312
A little creepy.

536
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,217
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

537
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,786
It was just a silly
little contest, but...

538
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,889
it was the first time I realized
I liked making things.

539
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,192
And you've kept it
all of these years?

540
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,927
Yeah.

541
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,807
You're a lot more sentimental
than I thought you would be.

542
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,898
It's...
Hold that thought!

543
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,435
I wanted to get rid of it,
my mom wanted me keep it.

544
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,782
I just thought here might be
better than my apartment.

545
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,506
Good call.

546
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,508
Yeah.

547
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,400
Okay, we have definitely
already been down this way.

548
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,624
No, we haven't.

549
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:51,028
What about this one? Yes!
This has got to be it.

550
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,796
No, no, no.

551
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:56,033
What? Why? You can't just veto
every tree I pick.

552
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:58,702
It has no personality.

553
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,470
It's a tree;
not your future wife.

554
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,639
It's too predictable.

555
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,486
I mean, who wants a tree
that's just...

556
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,810
Perfectly symmetrical?

557
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,011
Exactly.

558
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,119
This. This is what
I'm talking about.

559
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,954
This has personality.

560
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,389
It's a bare tree.

561
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,892
It's not bare.

562
00:34:21,994 --> 00:34:26,096
It's just, you know... has
its... its own thing going on.

563
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,032
- Kind of like you.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

564
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,802
- What's that?
- What's what?

565
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,271
That smell.
You smell that?

566
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,007
I don't know. Pine?

567
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,044
No, it's...
Yes! I'm so excited.

568
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,562
Really?

569
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,931
You get this excited about nuts?

570
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,100
Have you ever had roasted
chestnuts before?

571
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:07,537
Sure. At some point in
my life. I don't remember.

572
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,473
You'd remember.

573
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,242
I'm just so happy!
I make them every year.

574
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:16,313
It's kinda like my own Christmas
tradition. Like your...?

575
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,115
My...?

576
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,217
Well, come on!

577
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,486
You must have some sort
of holiday food ritual.

578
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:26,123
No. No, I...

579
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:30,460
I'm more into new experiences
than traditions, you know?

580
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,430
And, besides, I'm really
not a nut person.

581
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,009
Well, you might change
your mind after this.

582
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,033
I doubt it.

583
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,168
We'll see.

584
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,737
I'll have two boxes, please.

585
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,873
- Wait!
- One for my sister.

586
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,656
Every time I eat them it's
like my whole childhood

587
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,047
flashes before my eyes.
It's amazing.

588
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,995
And you are definitely
as sentimental as I thought you were.

589
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,952
I will take that
as a compliment.

590
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,921
There you go. Thank you.

591
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,400
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

592
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,158
Da, da, da...
hold right there.

593
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,627
Perfect opportunity.
Just wait right there.

594
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:04,928
Paul, what are you doing?

595
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,364
Alright.

596
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,332
- Smile.
- Okay. You get one.

597
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,134
Oh, come on, smile!

598
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,037
- Bigger.
- What?

599
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,006
It's for my mom.

600
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,608
- Okay. Fine.
- Alright.

601
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,012
There we go! Beautiful.
She's gonna love it. It's magic.

602
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,980
Come on.

603
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,783
So, you really have
no holiday food traditions?

604
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,719
I mean, that's what
makes it taste so good;

605
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,988
it's that feeling
you get with it.

606
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,457
I know your mom. I know
she goes all out, so...

607
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,827
No, look, don't get
me wrong, it's nice.

608
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,797
I just don't get emotional
about things like that.

609
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,810
Well, do you want to try one?

610
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,836
Paul!
I can't believe it!

611
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,072
I thought your mother said
that you'd be in Sweden?

612
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,574
Switzerland.

613
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,177
Hey, buddy!

614
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,457
No flights, you know? It looks
like I'm here 'til Christmas.

615
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:00,383
Well, that's great! That
means you can come to the gala.

616
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,185
Holiday Hounds.

617
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:05,755
That's where I met Maxie
last year, isn't it?

618
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:08,758
Well, I guess it just depends
on my flight, you know?

619
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,294
Yeah, look, I know your mom
is so upset about being sick,

620
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,897
but tell her we have it
totally under control.

621
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,834
She sure does.

622
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,270
Hey. So, when did
you get into town?

623
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,340
Yesterday. I decided
to come in a day early.

624
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,909
She may be a Los Angeleno now,

625
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,022
but we can't keep her away
from the East Coast for long.

626
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,146
You know, I thought for sure

627
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,315
that you'd be away
for the holidays, again.

628
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,752
- He's going away on Christmas.
- Of course he is.

629
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,393
Well... tha... tha...

630
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:44,728
This is Amy's sister.

631
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,830
She...

632
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,965
She's a professional
event planner,

633
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,369
so if you guys need
any help, it's...

634
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,107
I'm Hayley. Hi.

635
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,775
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:06,082
You know, we really
should pay for that tree.

637
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,484
We should?

638
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,786
Yeah. It's pretty perfect

639
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,488
and,

640
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,024
I don't think
it's gonna last long.

641
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,659
- Okay.
- Yep.

642
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,505
Guys, it was so good
to see you guys again. Both.

643
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,040
- Merry Christmas.
- So nice meeting you.

644
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,675
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

645
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,365
Merry Christmas.

646
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:29,039
Just so I'm clear...

647
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,308
we're going with my tree, right?

648
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,143
Yes, perfectly symmetrical.

649
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,592
Bit brisk.

650
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,462
Here. This is a good one.
I will allow you to use this.

651
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,765
- You will allow me?
- Yeah.

652
00:38:55,867 --> 00:39:01,671
Very well, Your Highness.
My mother will be pleased.

653
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,408
You sure you don't want any of
these? They're kind of amazing.

654
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,843
Still good.

655
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,747
I'm sorry about that.

656
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,216
Well, if you're not a nut
person I'm not gonna force you.

657
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:17,287
No. Back there with
Patti and Michelle.

658
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,456
I know it was a little awkward.

659
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:25,762
I have no idea why I offered you
up for help but... thank you.

660
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,397
For what?

661
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:31,968
Rolling with it.

662
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,770
So, you guys dated?

663
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,739
That obvious?

664
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,507
Yeah.

665
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:44,080
Are you sure you don't
want any of these?

666
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,150
I mean, I don't know if it's the
elevation, or all the fresh air,

667
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,419
but I'm starving and...

668
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,599
I don't know how much longer
they're going to last.

669
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,789
Okay. Get out.

670
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,125
- What? Why?
- Come on.

671
00:39:55,227 --> 00:40:00,630
- Let's go. It's not that far. Come on.
- I thought we were going back?

672
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,732
Not until we get you...

673
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,068
some real food.

674
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,789
<i>You've reach Kim in marketing,
please leave a message.</i>

675
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,615
Kim. Hi! It's me again
leaving another message.

676
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:21,217
I just wanted to make sure
that you had everything

677
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,287
you needed for tonight.
Okay, great.

678
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,757
Or not.

679
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,627
- Still nothing?
- Nope.

680
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,328
I mean, I guess
I should be happy

681
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,498
that things are running
smoothly without me.

682
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,169
- It is all just meat?
- Yeah.

683
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,238
Pretty much just meat
and a few sides.

684
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,175
Pumpkin spiced ribs?
Is that really a thing?

685
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,988
At Christmas it is.

686
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,346
Okay, well...
before we order,

687
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,215
I should probably let you know

688
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,017
that I'm not the most
adventurous eater.

689
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,119
And that's why we're here.

690
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:59,389
Alright, we'll take some
of the pumpkin spiced ribs.

691
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,759
The cranberry
barbecued pulled pork and...

692
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:07,197
The jalapeno mashed
potatoes. Please.

693
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:11,100
Is it possible to have those
jalapenos on the side?

694
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:15,125
- No.
- No? What about the sauces?

695
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:19,776
Okay, then.

696
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,250
You know, considering
that I usually like my plate

697
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,019
half-green, half-protein
with a side of fruit,

698
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,988
I'm surprised how much
I love this.

699
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,456
See.

700
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,924
No.

701
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,026
No. You cannot say
I told you so.

702
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,695
I won't.

703
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:41,117
You're about to. I can tell
it's on tip of your tongue

704
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,510
and you're just
itching to say it.

705
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,501
It's on the tip
of my tongue? Right?

706
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,547
You know, you have a little a...

707
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,041
Look, I just think that,

708
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:55,245
you know, tastes can change
a little. That's all.

709
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,080
Oh, really?

710
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:00,049
Hey, Paul!

711
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:03,152
- How long has it been?
- Hey! Too long.

712
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,833
- Good to see you.
- You too. How's everything tasting?

713
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,125
Honestly, I've never
had barbecue so good.

714
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,263
Now this is coming from Hayley.

715
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,933
She's a fancy event planner
from Manhattan, so "uh uh."

716
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,869
Only on good days,
but this is really tasty.

717
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,071
Stop. No, really, go on.

718
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:28,344
- I'll grab you my card?
- Okay. That'd be great.

719
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,947
Why do you do that?

720
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,982
Do what?

721
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,695
You sell yourself
short like that.

722
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,687
What? No, I don't!
How could you think...

723
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:43,560
You know what? No more
observations out of you, mister.

724
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:46,195
Yeah.

725
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,398
Okay.

726
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,969
Well, I think you're fancy.
In a good way.

727
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,338
How's that?

728
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:12,255
So, you two went for lunch?

729
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,692
And how was that?

730
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,061
Fine.

731
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,430
Fine? Really?

732
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:22,865
That seems like a big shift
since two days ago.

733
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,969
Okay, I'll admit,

734
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,271
it wasn't as bad as I thought
it was going to be.

735
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,173
Wait.

736
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,674
Do you actually like him?

737
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,777
What? No. No, I don't
"like" like him.

738
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:41,050
I just... I don't dislike him
as much as I thought I did.

739
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:45,521
- Good.
- What?

740
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:49,559
I mean, good you like him,
but don't "like" like him.

741
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,894
I mean, that would be
a bit awkward.

742
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:54,163
Right.

743
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:58,201
Though I do have to say you
look a lot more relaxed now.

744
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,271
Well.
It's probably the fresh air.

745
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,821
Okay, here you go.
Here you go.

746
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,345
A warning...
my mom usually has, like,

747
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,525
six other families out
here caroling, so...

748
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:13,461
- Sometimes eight.
- Yeah, I'm not sure how it's going to sound

749
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:16,419
- with just us...
- Mi, mi, mi, mi...

750
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:22,158
I feel pretty good.

751
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,627
I think someone's dog howled

752
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,130
through the entire chorus
of Carol of the Bells.

753
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:29,076
- And they ran back inside.
- To hide.

754
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,934
I think he was just impressed
with my vocal prowess.

755
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,770
Of course!

756
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,153
That's a problem.
And we will find a solution.

757
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,541
- Hi, Patti.
- Hi.

758
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,777
- Everything okay?
- Yeah,

759
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,547
- just a tiny snag with the gala.
- A snag?

760
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:48,117
Hayley, I think we might
need your help after all.

761
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,603
Well, last year,
we didn't have to do anything.

762
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:57,393
We just put the link up online

763
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,595
and half the town bought
tickets. But now...

764
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:02,343
You know, it's actually pretty
normal for a second year fallout.

765
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,978
Especially after
the initial excitement.

766
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,804
Yeah, but this is like...
half the excitement.

767
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,406
Not even. God! I can't
let the pooches down.

768
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,009
This is the charity's
big event of the year!

769
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:15,912
- What do we do?
- You don't do a thing.

770
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:18,281
Penn's right, sweetie.
You look awful.

771
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,984
I actually am feeling
much better, but thank you.

772
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,564
I bet Hayley
has some good ideas.

773
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:25,888
She's amazing. She does
all kinds of events...

774
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,158
private, corporate, charity.
All super successful.

775
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,462
Well, I haven't had
time to give it any real thought,

776
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:35,331
but you said the theme was
Taste of the Shores, right?

777
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:39,435
- Yes. Well, that's a whole other problem.
- What problem?

778
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,482
Well, if we don't get
more restaurants to donate,

779
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:45,141
our "taste" is going
to be more of a "bite".

780
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,944
Well, okay. For ticket sales,
you just need to tease it.

781
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:52,248
Give people a "taste"
of what they're in for.

782
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,351
What if we rename it
Taste of the Holidays?

783
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,487
To remind people
what it's all about.

784
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:00,289
Good people, good food
and giving back.

785
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,136
This will get people
buying tickets?

786
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,927
Not on its own,
but give me a couple of hours

787
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:07,829
and I will come up with a plan
and give it to you first thing tomorrow.

788
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,543
She's a hard worker, isn't she?

789
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:23,446
Way too loyal, if you ask me.

790
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:24,781
What do you mean?

791
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:27,550
She's way overdue
this promotion at work.

792
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,819
She'd never admit it, but...

793
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:32,032
everything she does
turns out amazing.

794
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,186
We'll stand
in front of the venue.

795
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,110
We'll create a festive
atmosphere...

796
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:56,078
People are going to be out
and about anyway.

797
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,314
And then we'll
just... see.

798
00:46:58,416 --> 00:46:59,682
See?

799
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:04,554
I know it sounds a little...
grassroots,

800
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:07,490
but I really believe
that people want to give back.

801
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:11,093
We can all just be wrapped up
in our own world sometimes.

802
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,428
Especially at the holidays.

803
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,845
It's funny, I was convinced
I was going to work through this cold.

804
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,902
"I don't need to rest."

805
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:23,973
But Penn was right.

806
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,909
I guess sometimes
what you think you want

807
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,312
isn't always what you need.

808
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:49,065
I gotta say it...

809
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,367
these roasting kits
were a great idea.

810
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:57,406
Amy was right about you...
you are good at your job.

811
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,753
And this coming from a guy
who hates chestnuts.

812
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:03,446
Well, thank you for
helping me with all this.

813
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:08,284
Happy to help.
So, what's next, coach?

814
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:13,856
Merry Christmas!
We'll see you tomorrow night!

815
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,025
Chestnuts!
These are beautiful!

816
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,247
Be sure to check our website
for tickets. They're going fast.

817
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,831
Merry Christmas!

818
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:25,067
- Hey. Everything's good to go in there.
- Thank you.

819
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,448
It's beautiful. And this is
going to look amazing inside.

820
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,939
I still can't believe
Paul made this.

821
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,241
And why not?

822
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,688
I mean, come on, people need
somewhere to put their donations, right?

823
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:37,013
Well, I don't know. It's kind
of traditional for you,

824
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:40,249
isn't it?
Too symmetrical?

825
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,852
I deliver what the client needs.

826
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:46,322
In this case, classic
Christmas seemed ideal.

827
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,558
And I...

828
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,328
may have directed a large
group of people your way.

829
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,297
You're gonna be busy.

830
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:57,233
Did you lure them in with
your beautiful singing voice?

831
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,702
Quite possible, yes.

832
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,478
Okay, I think we're
gonna get out of here.

833
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,958
- Sure.
- Unless you need help with anything else?

834
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:14,216
No. I think we're good.
I'm almost done.

835
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,819
- Okay.
- Okay.

836
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,460
Alright, I'm gonna go
hunt down some more people.

837
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,128
Okay, you do that.

838
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,230
Yeah, you know.

839
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,333
How's my favorite event planner?

840
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:33,536
Well, I think I might be
your only event planner,

841
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,271
but I'm good.

842
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,451
You know, I didn't think these
nuts were gonna do it

843
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,975
but our ticket sales
are already up.

844
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:41,143
- Really?
- But the food...

845
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:43,624
I know. I've got to figure
it out but don't worry,

846
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,381
I think I have an idea.

847
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,616
Well, keep this up
and I'll have to tell

848
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,585
my friend Miranda Watson
to hire you.

849
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,188
Did you say Miranda Watson,
as in Watson Creative?

850
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,856
- She's your friend?
- Yes.

851
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,058
Oh, my gosh, her firm
does amazing work.

852
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,028
Well, I might just have
to snatch you up myself.

853
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,596
Philanthropy is exhausting.

854
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,432
Well, I think I'm good
where I'm at, but thank you.

855
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,702
Plenty of time to talk about
that after the big night.

856
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,871
Now, it's... back to work!

857
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,288
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks!

858
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,272
- We'll see you tomorrow?
- You sure will!

859
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,572
So, how'd it go?

860
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,809
How do you feel
about cinnamon ribs?

861
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,445
Good.

862
00:50:50,782 --> 00:50:52,848
Good, because he just
agreed to donate

863
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,450
a ton for tomorrow night!

864
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:07,663
Marketing division.
Kim speaking.

865
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,999
Hi, Kim. It's Hayley.

866
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,034
I'm so glad I finally
reached you!

867
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:16,172
It went well? Excellent.

868
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,773
So...?

869
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:43,599
Looks like everyone's turning
in for the night so...

870
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:48,404
It's nine o'clock, grandma.

871
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:50,206
I know but...

872
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,644
Everything okay?

873
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,113
With work?

874
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:01,517
Yeah, it's fine.

875
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,452
I finally got a hold of her.

876
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:07,389
Turns out they wanna
promote the both of us.

877
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:10,459
For the next six months,
and see who does better.

878
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:13,729
So, like a co-promotion?
Is that a good thing?

879
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,235
Sure... for the one who
doesn't get demoted afterwards.

880
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,904
I don't know.

881
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,340
I guess it's better
than nothing, right?

882
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:26,575
Is it?

883
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,828
I guess I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

884
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:34,884
Okay.

885
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:39,288
Or...

886
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:44,059
maybe... you could show me

887
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,861
how it's done.

888
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:00,609
So, it's basically like s'mores.

889
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,944
Without the marshmallows.

890
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:04,980
Or the chocolate.

891
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,615
Or the graham crackers.

892
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:11,387
So, it's... basically
nothing like s'mores.

893
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,055
Pretty much.

894
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:22,131
Alright, look, I'm just
going to come out and say it.

895
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,593
You don't like my holiday
food tradition?

896
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:27,002
I'm sorry.

897
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:32,041
Well, I guess I forgive you

898
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,921
'cause at least you tried it.

899
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:37,413
No...

900
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:38,747
Not about that.

901
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:45,254
I'm sorry about what
I said at the wedding.

902
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:49,191
Let's not go back there.

903
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:50,793
I'm serious.

904
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:58,500
It's okay. I'm over it.
I've moved on.

905
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,636
I said it...

906
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,439
Because I wanted you to know
you deserve better.

907
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:09,411
And I thought that then -
I barely knew you -

908
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,147
I know that now.

909
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:17,920
I just want you to know that.

910
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,236
You don't have to say that.

911
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,495
Do I look like someone who would say
something they don't mean?

912
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:30,199
No, you don't.

913
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,617
I've just always been that way.

914
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,041
Like, when I get something
in my head, I...

915
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:42,811
have to stick to it. Even when
I shouldn't sometimes.

916
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,880
You know?

917
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:51,854
As much as I hate to admit it...

918
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,122
you were right.

919
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:03,565
I should have seen it
coming with my ex.

920
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,971
He wasn't reliable and,
in the long term,

921
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,953
he wasn't gonna stick around.

922
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,546
It's okay.

923
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:22,117
You know...

924
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:25,688
you're not the only one
who didn't see things coming.

925
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,294
Now she wants a fire.

926
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,997
Almost ten o'clock at night

927
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,099
and she wants a fire
in the bedroom.

928
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,102
You know what I think, son?
I think she's milking it.

929
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,284
Are those chestnuts you're roasting?

930
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,809
Well, yes, sir, they are.

931
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:50,245
Hayley is showing me one of her
special Christmas traditions.

932
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,614
I still can't believe
he doesn't have one.

933
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,251
What?
A Christmas tradition?

934
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,087
Oh, he has one.

935
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,359
Thanks, dad.

936
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:04,593
Wait, what?

937
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:08,497
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

938
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:12,534
Fine. I might have one.

939
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:17,106
But it's specific
to Christmas Eve.

940
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,287
Well, are you going to tell me?

941
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:24,413
Well, you're just going to have
to set your alarm and find out.

942
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,194
I gotta say,

943
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:14,496
I didn't know your elf yelled.

944
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,632
Not to mention "shimmied".

945
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,600
Oh, yeah.

946
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:23,439
Actually, I was going
for more of a shake but...

947
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,452
He's growin' on you, isn't he?

948
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:32,948
Alright, well,
I come bearing gifts.

949
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,050
I brought coffee.

950
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,952
Two cups in one.

951
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,590
I'm touched.

952
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:46,962
I'm glad.

953
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,431
So, this is your one
holiday tradition?

954
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,502
Watching the sun rise
on Christmas Eve.

955
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:56,371
Yup. This is it.

956
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:00,142
How long have you been
doing this for?

957
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:02,311
Oh, gosh...

958
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:05,380
As long as I can remember.

959
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,616
It actually started
with my grandfather.

960
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,785
He used to...

961
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:12,688
He used to bring me out here
every year when I was a kid.

962
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:19,127
My grandma, she micro-managed
the twelve days of Christmas.

963
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,197
It'd get a little hectic so,
you know, he'd just

964
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:26,101
come out here for
a little quiet...

965
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,103
Just soak it all in.

966
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,173
The meaning of Christmas?

967
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:33,242
Yeah, but...

968
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,712
Also, how fortunate...

969
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:39,248
we are to be surrounded
by family and friends.

970
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:44,319
So, for me,

971
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:46,541
I just thought it was
a good thing to keep going.

972
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:51,527
So, I do it every year.

973
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,195
No matter where I am.

974
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:56,932
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

975
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,868
This day last year,

976
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,039
I watched the sun rise
in Cape Town.

977
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,841
Clear across the Atlantic.

978
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:08,143
See?

979
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,412
You are more sentimental
than you think.

980
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:13,215
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

981
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,319
You are far more
adventurous than you think.

982
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:19,421
I don't know about that.

983
00:59:19,523 --> 00:59:22,057
I mean, I've still got
my two cups of coffee.

984
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:27,029
True, but...

985
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:29,698
you're out here.

986
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,769
With me.
At the crack of dawn.

987
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,738
This is true.

988
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,449
I'm glad you came.

989
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:48,951
Me too.

990
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,990
I'm glad you stayed.

991
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,462
Me too.

992
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,242
Are you sure
you're well enough to go?

993
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:18,146
Absolutely!
I feel so much better.

994
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,148
Okay. You sure?

995
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:25,153
You know what? I think we're
going to drive separately

996
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,955
in case we need to leave early.

997
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,557
Why would you leave early?

998
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,993
No reason.

999
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,962
I think we should do the same.
Well, just in case.

1000
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:37,065
Right, well, that just leaves.

1001
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,017
Just beautiful.

1002
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,487
Thanks, sir.
It's a nice suit.

1003
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:04,793
You think?

1004
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,362
Okay, should we go?
We should go.

1005
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:13,301
- Right, well, we'll see you there.
- We're driving separately?

1006
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,537
Okay...

1007
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:20,108
Well, it looks like
you're stuck with me.

1008
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,854
You really do look beautiful.

1009
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:36,591
Thank you.

1010
01:01:38,595 --> 01:01:41,263
- So...
- What's that?

1011
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,533
Of course, I had
to pull your name.

1012
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:47,536
And you're leaving
early in the morning...

1013
01:01:47,638 --> 01:01:51,073
And I figured that these might
come in most useful tonight.

1014
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:55,977
I'm supposed to open this now?

1015
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:03,985
So, I originally made you
an ornament for your truck

1016
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,723
out of the same stuff, thought you
could hang it on the mirror or something,

1017
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:12,794
but then I thought the cufflinks
were a better option.

1018
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,596
They're perfect.

1019
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:17,532
Thank you.

1020
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,935
You're welcome.

1021
01:02:29,346 --> 01:02:31,680
Well, honey, what do you think?

1022
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,982
I can't believe I'm out.

1023
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,252
And everything looks perfect!

1024
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:39,988
Yes, it does.

1025
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,256
Stop.

1026
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:54,236
I can't believe so many people
showed up. It's amazing.

1027
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:58,473
And look at your sleigh!
All the donations!

1028
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:01,476
You did it.

1029
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,779
We all did it.

1030
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,914
Now, more importantly,

1031
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,650
let's go find some ribs.

1032
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,186
We should probably follow them.

1033
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,955
Okay, so, I think
I've got it figure out.

1034
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,969
I'm going to get a cake for
tomorrow night's dessert.

1035
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:19,795
And it's going to say, "Baby
Barnett, coming soon" Soon-ish.

1036
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,808
Or maybe I should just write
the due date on the cake?

1037
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,598
Isn't Christmas cute enough?

1038
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:40,682
Okay, you know what?

1039
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:46,054
- These are better today.
- Really?

1040
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,491
I think it's the memory.

1041
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,227
Like you said.

1042
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,162
The feeling the food evokes...

1043
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:57,332
I think it might
just be the cinnamon.

1044
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,135
I don't know. I don't know
because every bite I take

1045
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:04,172
I just keep having this vision,
this picture in my head...

1046
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,275
you and BBQ sauce
all over your face.

1047
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:11,179
- Stop!
- I see... I might even have a photo.

1048
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,826
- Are you kidding?
- I am not.

1049
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,383
No! No. Give that to me.

1050
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:16,885
No. Screen-saver.

1051
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:19,354
Give that to me.

1052
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:21,957
- Sorry. Hayley Parker?
- Yeah.

1053
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:25,026
Hi, Miranda Watson. I was just
talking to Patti about you.

1054
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,661
Oh, you were?

1055
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:29,931
I know you're off-duty,
so I won't keep you but...

1056
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,667
if you're up for coffee
some time, I'd love to chat.

1057
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,170
You've done a really
great job here.

1058
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,739
Yeah, coffee sounds great.

1059
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:39,922
Terrific. Okay, I'll be in touch.
Merry Christmas!

1060
01:04:40,072 --> 01:04:42,611
- You too.
- Thanks. Merry Christmas!

1061
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:47,382
Okay.

1062
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:49,484
What?

1063
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:55,257
You, thinking about
another job opportunity.

1064
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:00,862
It's pretty adventurous.

1065
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:02,864
Well, this guy once told me

1066
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:05,600
that a little adventure
might do me some good, so...

1067
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,684
You know what else
might be good.

1068
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:15,744
What's that?

1069
01:05:15,846 --> 01:05:16,578
Dinner.

1070
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,282
In the city.

1071
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:23,218
Just the two of us.

1072
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:27,355
Make it a proper date.

1073
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:33,306
Okay, hold that thought,
hold that thought, hold that thought...

1074
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,965
On the off chance
you might say yes,

1075
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:39,267
I think I should get seconds

1076
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:43,338
so I can create another
positive food memory.

1077
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,807
I'll be right back.

1078
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,416
Oh, my gosh, I love
these... thank you!

1079
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:57,652
- Hi!
- Oo-wee!

1080
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,994
Everyone is super impressed.

1081
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,763
But, god, I'm sorry you had
to work over the holidays.

1082
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:12,434
I mean that's fine.
It's a really good cause,

1083
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:15,103
and I wasn't the only
one who pitched in.

1084
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,706
He's pretty great, isn't he?

1085
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:20,342
I'm sorry?

1086
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:24,879
Paul. At pitching in.
You know, making things fun.

1087
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:28,984
Yeah, yeah, no, he was
definitely a lot of help.

1088
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,253
Yeah, it's just too bad that he's
impossible to pin down, right?

1089
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:35,857
Always on the move. Or at least
trying to find a way to be.

1090
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:40,228
I don't know a lot
about that, so...

1091
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,836
Listen...

1092
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,939
You seem like a nice,
smart, talented woman.

1093
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,908
I just... I wouldn't
wanna see you get hurt.

1094
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:57,345
Excuse me?

1095
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,080
He leaves tomorrow, right?

1096
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,727
Yeah.

1097
01:07:01,877 --> 01:07:04,519
Yeah. First flight out
he can possibly get?

1098
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,255
He's like that.
He's always been like that.

1099
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,257
And he's never gonna change.

1100
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:13,028
You'll never be as important
to him as his trips.

1101
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:17,999
Trust me, I know.

1102
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,136
But hey, wish him
a good trip from me.

1103
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:37,385
Right.

1104
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:41,327
Okay, I might be a bit biased,
but this is the best donut I have ever had.

1105
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47,629
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1106
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:51,332
I just...
Nothing. I'm good.

1107
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:54,202
Where's Paul?

1108
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,906
Hey, they're about to...

1109
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:00,775
<i>Alright folks, gather 'round.</i>

1110
01:08:00,877 --> 01:08:04,245
<i>It's time for
the Christmas raffle.</i>

1111
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:06,325
Hey. Do you want
to find him?

1112
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:12,754
No, I'm fine.
Let's go.

1113
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:17,592
<i>Hi, I'm Patti Larson, the founder
of Mill Creek Hounds Dog Rescue.</i>

1114
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:22,197
<i>Just before we get
to the big raffle winners,</i>

1115
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,632
<i>I wanted to take a moment
to thank you all so much</i>

1116
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,234
<i>for coming out tonight</i>

1117
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:29,838
<i>to help our holiday hounds
find their perfect home,</i>

1118
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:33,908
<i>and to support all those who
take care of them until they do.</i>

1119
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:38,146
<i>I also wanted to send a special
thanks to Hayley Parker</i>

1120
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:40,915
<i>who really made this evening
possible. Right, Judy?</i>

1121
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,720
<i>Absolutely, Patti.</i>

1122
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:48,256
<i>Hayley helped us figure out
what we really needed.</i>

1123
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:51,326
<i>So, thank you, from all of us!</i>

1124
01:08:56,066 --> 01:09:00,168
<i>And make sure you eat a lot more,
because tonight, every bite counts.</i>

1125
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:04,072
<i>And don't forget to come
and have your picture taken</i>

1126
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:06,374
<i>right here with
my favorite pooch.</i>

1127
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,844
So cute!

1128
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:11,880
<i>Okay, who's ready
to win some big prizes?</i>

1129
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,419
Take it away, Judy.

1130
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:27,128
There you are.

1131
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,198
Two things... one, I think
I lost our table

1132
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,078
and two... man, I got right
to the front of the line,

1133
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,769
guy took the last ribs
right before I got there.

1134
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,238
But I got us some...
potatoes.

1135
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,608
I'm good, thanks.

1136
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,555
I know there are
some jalapeños on it,

1137
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:45,059
but I feel like you're warming
up to them, right.

1138
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,149
You okay?

1139
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:50,285
Yeah, I'm good.

1140
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:54,022
I actually think I'm gonna head
back early with Amy and Tim.

1141
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,791
Right now?

1142
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,727
Why?

1143
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,829
'Cause I'm the one who's
gotta get up early.

1144
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:04,966
Yeah, I just think I have to go.

1145
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,969
What's going on?

1146
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:12,607
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

1147
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,376
Hey, hey.

1148
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:19,948
I don't understand.
What just changed?

1149
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,662
Well, you don't understand because you
don't stand still enough to notice.

1150
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:25,587
Hey, hold your horses.
That's a bit harsh.

1151
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,756
Okay, I'm sorry. I don't
know if it was the holidays,

1152
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:31,159
or my head getting lost
in the clouds

1153
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:34,295
and then this thing
that happened between us -

1154
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,232
if you can even
call it a thing...

1155
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:40,935
But you're still going on this trip,
and I don't expect you to change.

1156
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:44,405
Is that really what you think?

1157
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,887
I just don't wanna get more
invested and then have you leave.

1158
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,644
Hayley, it's one trip.

1159
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:55,950
Okay, that's not what
I'm talking about, though.

1160
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,663
Okay, why are you
trying to sabotage this?

1161
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:00,355
- I'm not.
- That's what you're doing.

1162
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,034
What, because I wasn't
part of your plan?

1163
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:05,593
Please, do not turn
this around on me.

1164
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:09,530
You were right. Okay, you
were right. Are you happy?

1165
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:13,034
I should've seen all
of the signs with my ex...

1166
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:18,439
I don't wanna make
the same mistake again.

1167
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,812
Okay, so if I'm reading this
right - I'm pretty sure I am -

1168
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:27,649
I'm going to make
one more observation...

1169
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:33,821
I'm guessing you want
your space again?

1170
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,801
Well, you're leaving
first thing tomorrow morning

1171
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:40,662
so now, this time,
it'll be really easy.

1172
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:45,566
Yeah, I guess so.

1173
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:47,702
I have to go.

1174
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:34,075
I guess we're both
excited for the day.

1175
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,444
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

1176
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:40,014
So, are we the only ones up?

1177
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:41,516
Well, Paul is already gone.

1178
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:44,552
Probably halfway
to the airport by now.

1179
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,654
Are you okay?

1180
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:50,324
Me? Yeah, I'm fine.

1181
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:55,963
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1182
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,600
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1183
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:02,470
I feel like I barely
saw you last night.

1184
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:06,441
So, the three of you
left together?

1185
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:08,509
Is everything okay?

1186
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,946
Yup! No, it's good.

1187
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:15,883
'Cause Paul seemed a little off as well,
so I was just wondering...

1188
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:20,121
- I'm pregnant!
- What?!

1189
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:23,090
Wait... did I just hear
that correctly?

1190
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:24,559
We're pregnant!

1191
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:27,895
Honey! Congratulations!

1192
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,066
We have to call your brother.

1193
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,746
We already told him
late last night.

1194
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,881
Sorry, we were going to wait
until dinner to tell you guys,

1195
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:39,207
we had it all planned out, there
was this cute cake announcement and...

1196
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:43,644
Well, I wanted it to be perfect
and I just blabbed it out.

1197
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:46,647
Are you kidding me,
this is perfect.

1198
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,983
I'm so excited.

1199
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,319
Well, it's not<i> your</i> perfect.

1200
01:14:51,421 --> 01:14:54,355
I know it might not be
how you planned telling us,

1201
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:57,291
but the news itself...

1202
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:02,864
It's the best
Christmas gift ever.

1203
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:08,402
Thank you.

1204
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,716
Alright, everybody, get
your jackets. I have a surprise.

1205
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,673
- You do?
- I do.

1206
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:14,487
And I think it's the
perfect time for it.

1207
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,878
You can't be the only one
who's over-the-top at Christmas.

1208
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,058
Although I think Amy might
have beat us all this year!

1209
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:21,616
- I was involved!
- Alright, come on.

1210
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:23,417
I have no idea.

1211
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,285
Thank you for covering for me.

1212
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,727
You've been covering
for me all week.

1213
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:43,771
You okay?

1214
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:47,542
Yeah. You mean about...

1215
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,244
Yeah.

1216
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:53,080
He wasn't my type anyway.

1217
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:55,650
Right.

1218
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,637
Guess the flight will be
pretty empty.

1219
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,059
Not a lot of people flying
on Christmas Day.

1220
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:24,478
Still, sounds pretty
exciting to me.

1221
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:28,482
Yeah, it should be.

1222
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,731
Okay, mister.
Are you going to tell us

1223
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,444
where we're going,
what we're doing?

1224
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,768
All you need to know is
I brought hot chocolate.

1225
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:54,942
- This is for us?
- This is your surprise?

1226
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:58,212
That's so cool!

1227
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:01,115
- Are we going far?
- It's just an hour, round-trip.

1228
01:17:01,217 --> 01:17:02,917
I know you love horses.

1229
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:05,186
This is wonderful.

1230
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,157
They're beautiful!

1231
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:12,994
I'm sorry...

1232
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:16,163
I mean, this looks...
amazing,

1233
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,699
but if it's okay,
I'm feeling a little tired.

1234
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,035
You should stay, relax.

1235
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,104
Really?

1236
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:26,607
You deserve a real day
off after all the hard work you put in.

1237
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:36,050
I don't know what
happened last night,

1238
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,653
but I do know that Paul
didn't delay his vacation

1239
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:41,288
because of some storm.

1240
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:44,191
He stayed because of you.

1241
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:46,327
What? How do
you know that?

1242
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:50,531
I'm his mother. It's my job
to know these things.

1243
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,299
Oh, and Hayley,

1244
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:54,522
I think he left something
for you under the tree.

1245
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:06,814
- Alright! Here we go!
- My lady.

1246
01:18:57,867 --> 01:18:59,233
What am I doing?

1247
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:11,438
Come on, answer.

1248
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:13,073
<i>Hey, it's Paul.</i>

1249
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:14,787
<i>I'll be off the grid
until the New Year</i>.

1250
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:16,722
<i>I hope you can wait until then.</i>

1251
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:20,247
Hi... it's Hayley.

1252
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:23,217
Listen, Paul, I...

1253
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,719
Hey!

1254
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,127
Hi.

1255
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:36,263
Hi.

1256
01:20:39,068 --> 01:20:41,135
What are you doing here?

1257
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,904
You are supposed
to be in Switzerland.

1258
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:49,443
Were you just calling me?

1259
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:59,520
I know I'm supposed to be
giving you your space...

1260
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,121
But I can't.

1261
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:04,458
- You can't?
- Nope.

1262
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,629
Sorry. 'Cause I was on my way,

1263
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:10,931
and I'm thinking about my trip,

1264
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,868
and I'm wanting so badly
to be excited about it.

1265
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,938
But the only thing
that got me excited

1266
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:24,979
was the thought of getting to
know you more and more and more.

1267
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:27,581
And all your little quirks.

1268
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,650
I don't have any of those.

1269
01:21:29,752 --> 01:21:31,952
And all your adorable habits.

1270
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,688
Okay, I might have
a few of those.

1271
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:39,927
I know you don't think
I'll ever stand still.

1272
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:42,429
But here I am.

1273
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:47,434
Right here, right now,
standing still.

1274
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,409
I think I just needed
the right reason.

1275
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,879
You.

1276
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,821
So, what do you say?

1277
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,259
You wanna give it a try...

1278
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,929
For that date in the city?

1279
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,901
I'm up for anything
at this point.

1280
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:27,875
I'm really sorry about
last night. I had... a moment.

1281
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:30,511
Really?

1282
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,614
Yeah.

1283
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:39,787
So, is this considered
creating a new experience?

1284
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:41,722
Which part?

1285
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:44,558
All of it?

1286
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:49,964
Well, if I may.

1287
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:56,003
I was kind of hoping...

1288
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:59,239
we could make it a tradition.

1289
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:02,142
Which part?

1290
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:05,212
All of it.

1291
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,897
I love that you
made me an elf clock.

1292
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:27,134
Still too creepy?

1293
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:29,370
You know,

1294
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:31,972
I think he might grow on me.

1295
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:39,250
There they are!
