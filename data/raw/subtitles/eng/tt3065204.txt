1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,318
After everything we've seen,

2
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,864
there isn't much that rattles
either of us anymore.

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,151
But this one...

4
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,670
This one still haunts me.

5
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,219
Two months prior to our involvement,

6
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,619
the Lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night,

7
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,593
claiming that the house was haunted.

8
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,353
The Church had reached out to us for help.

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,718
They wanted to see

10
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,887
if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the Lutzes.

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,711
Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,511
Okay.
We ready?

13
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,432
Then let's get started.

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,279
I'd like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes.

15
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,195
Envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light.

16
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,511
It will protect you.

17
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,699
The year before
the Lutzes moved in,

18
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,582
a young man named Ronny DeFeo

19
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:12,610
had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house.

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,739
We'd hoped to discover if the killings
had been motivated purely by anger

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,299
or if,

22
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,779
as Ronny DeFeo testified in court,

23
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,232
he had been under the influence
of something demonic.

24
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,580
Stay here.
Stay.

25
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,195
Kill her.
Kill her.

26
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,939
Shoot them.

27
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,739
Shoot them!

28
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,117
Shoot her!

29
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:46,693
What did you do?

30
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,155
Shoot her.
Kill her.

31
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,674
Shoot her!

32
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,915
Shoot them all.

33
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,062
Shoot!

34
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:14,964
Kill!

35
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,339
Kill her.
Shoot her.

36
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,349
Kill her.
Shoot her.

37
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,435
Honey, you okay?
What are you seeing?

38
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,389
Lorraine.

39
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,689
Lorraine, what is happening?

40
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,659
I have to see.

41
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,622
We're through. We're through.
It's time to come back.

42
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,295
What is happening?

43
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,149
It wants to show me.

44
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,115
Lorraine!

45
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,475
Lorraine!

46
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,179
Oh, God!
Oh!

47
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,339
Honey.

48
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,809
Honey.

49
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,869
It's okay.

50
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,754
It's okay.

51
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,836
Ed.

52
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,837
This is as close to hell
as I ever wanna get.

53
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:18,726
THE CONJURING 2

54
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,939
- Damn kids!
- Really.

55
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,275
Yeah.

56
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,491
Oh, my gosh.

57
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,739
Keith and I are going to sneak
out tonight with his friend, Michael,

58
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,579
he wants to meet you,
by the way.

59
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,339
No way.
If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.

60
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,165
So don't get caught, you priss.

61
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,995
Here, hold this.

62
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,150
Gotta give you back
the spirit board that we made.

63
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,659
I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.

64
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,699
What?
No way!

65
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,435
What you two doing?

66
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,155
Janet, give that to me.

67
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,355
And get inside, both of you.

68
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,680
Go.

69
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:52,779
M-M-M-M-Margaret.

70
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,438
Margaret!
Johnny!

71
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,204
Janet!
Billy!

72
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,579
Hello.
How was your day?

73
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,819
Not good.

74
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,099
Why?
What happened?

75
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,259
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

76
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,782
All right, then.

77
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,819
W-w-what's up?

78
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,577
B-B-B-B-Billy?

79
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,019
Shut up, Peter.

80
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,179
Lesbo!

81
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,059
What, are you talking about your mum?

82
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,619
Oh.

83
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,059
Thank you, Camilla.

84
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,475
No problem!

85
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,075
He's just a wanker.
Ignore him.

86
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,018
Okay.

87
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,179
- Mum's gonna kill me.
- What did you do now?

88
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,019
It wasn't me,
it was Camilla.

89
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,878
What did you do
with Camilla?

90
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:35,219
It's a long story.

91
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,582
Boys!
Watch the road!

92
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,475
- Janet!
- Up you go, Billy.

93
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,887
Ow!

94
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,472
Come on.

95
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,879
I'm saying I won't be able
to pay my rent this month.

96
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,795
No. I talked to them,
and they put me through to you.

97
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,419
Please keep calm...

98
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,675
I am being calm.

99
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,504
Well, I don't understand
why you can't help me.

100
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,779
No.

101
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,640
No. He hasn't paid a penny
of child maintenance for three months.

102
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,339
- We're home!
- I see, another form to fill in on it.
That's bloody brilliant.

103
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,995
- Hi, Mum!
- You have a good afternoon as well.

104
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,179
Janet.

105
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,619
Are things not bad enough around here,

106
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,659
that I've got to get a call
from your headmistress

107
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,451
who says that you was caught smoking?

108
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,746
I wasn't! I wasn't smoking.
I promise.

109
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,041
- Did you get the biscuits?
- Did you just not hear me?

110
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,659
I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone.

111
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,172
How can you stand there
and lie to me like that?

112
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:33,459
I'm not lying!

113
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,819
Yes, she is!
It's all over the school.

114
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,019
She was smoking with Camilla.

115
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,315
Shut up!
You are such a liar, Johnny!

116
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,899
Mum! You said
we would get me some...

117
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,544
No, Billy.
I didn't get any bloody biscuits

118
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,869
because we don't have any bloody money!

119
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,885
Mum's coming.

120
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,675
You better quit messing with that
and brush your teeth!

121
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,478
All right.

122
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,739
Sounds like the whole city's
burning down in here.

123
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,894
Look what I found!

124
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,817
Biscuits!

125
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,179
But you said we
don't have any money.

126
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,539
Well, I've been meaning
to quit smoking anyway.

127
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,379
- Margaret?
- Yes?

128
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,099
Have you got your
school uniform for tomorrow?

129
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,619
Yes, Mum.
I'm getting it.

130
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,379
Johnny, did you
brush your teeth?

131
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,779
I did it already.

132
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,213
Come on, Billy.
Time for bed.

133
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,038
Coming, Mum.

134
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,525
Put that down, Johnny.
Come on. Time for bed.

135
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,112
Oh, where'd that come from?

136
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,496
Camilla and I made it at school.

137
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,762
Ugh.
That doesn't look right.

138
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,739
It really works, I swear.

139
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,099
We already asked it all sorts of stuff.

140
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,072
Come on, I'll show you.

141
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,398
All right.

142
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,155
What should I ask?

143
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,219
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

144
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,775
Okay.

145
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,866
My sister and I want to know...

146
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,103
Are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us?

147
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,718
Is Dad ever coming home?

148
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,017
Are there any spirits here
who can answer my question?

149
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,099
Don't worry about it.

150
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,019
It's just a stupid game.

151
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,678
It isn't real.

152
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,349
Why're you
pounding on the door?

153
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,355
I'm not.

154
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,341
You're barmy.

155
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,366
You know, she's pushing the boundary,
isn't it?

156
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,059
She says she wasn't smoking.

157
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,499
I don't think you should
agonize over it, Peg.

158
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,539
God knows I had my share
of fags at school, didn't you?

159
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,699
Oh, lots.

160
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,499
But it's not what she did
that bothers me.

161
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,379
It's that, she don't listen
to what I say anymore, Pegs.

162
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,501
Just a phase, isn't it?

163
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,899
I mean, I can punish her,
but then I feel guilty

164
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,358
because I know it's not really her fault.

165
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,419
She loves her dad

166
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,929
and she took it very hard
when he left. Poor thing.

167
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:44,235
But I can't just let it go either, can I?

168
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,299
I'm loath to ask, but have you
told Richard about it?

169
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,307
I would, if I ever saw him.

170
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,539
Sod.

171
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,419
Now, it's like I'm having
to do both jobs.

172
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,139
I'm half the mum I was before.
I'm just rubbish, Peggy.

173
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,628
You are not, Peggy.
You're too hard on yourself.

174
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,435
- Ooh!
- Oh!

175
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,672
- This sodding house!
- Oh!

176
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,619
We are back with real
life ghost hunters,

177
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,259
Ed and Lorraine Warren,

178
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,739
talking about their experiences
at the Amityville house.

179
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,219
And now we're gonna talk
to my next guest,

180
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,112
Dr. Steven Kaplan,

181
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,899
who says that the investigations
the Warrens conducted

182
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,579
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

183
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,179
Why is that?

184
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,179
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

185
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,699
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

186
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,899
Yes, it has.

187
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,459
The Lutz family made everything up

188
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,579
so they could profit off
of all the publicity.

189
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,179
That's just not true.

190
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,059
Look, we see this all the time.

191
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,419
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.

192
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,019
But it's something very different

193
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,299
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself.

194
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,619
I don't need to go to the moon

195
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,309
to know that it's not
made out of green cheese.

196
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,219
Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house
that he didn't think was haunted.

197
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,859
And by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells

198
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,579
they've got everybody else
believing in ghosts, too.

199
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,766
What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway?

200
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,859
Come on, Warren.
Try and show a little class, will you?

201
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,219
I'm not gonna show class to somebody

202
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,739
who's sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me.

203
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,856
- Be careful who you call a liar.
- What are you gonna do about it?

204
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,739
We go on these shows to inform people.

205
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,419
But every time I open my mouth,
another one of these little...

206
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,233
- Ed.
- Ass...

207
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,942
Academics...

208
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,659
Pops up.

209
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,379
Tries to undo everything we've done.

210
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,699
- Could you please take a breath?
- I know. I know. I know.

211
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,371
I'm counting to 10.
I'm counting to 10!

212
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,179
All right, Billy.

213
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,375
You ready to do a speech?

214
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,300
THE CROOKED MAN

215
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:59,662
There was a crooked man,
and he walked a crooked mile,

216
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:04,493
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile.

217
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,977
It's all right.
We'll just try again.

218
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,229
You ready?

219
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:14,338
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile.

220
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:18,286
He bought a crooked cat,
which caught a crooked mouse.

221
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:23,218
And they all lived together
in a little crooked house.

222
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,899
Good boy!

223
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,699
You're getting so good.
Now you may have a biscuit.

224
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,099
Biscuit!

225
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,102
All right. Come on.
Off to bed with you.

226
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,164
- Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.

227
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,136
Now, don't eat too many of those

228
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,699
or you'll wake up thirsty
in the middle of the night. All right?

229
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,265
I won't.

230
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,953
You promise?

231
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,337
- Night, boys.
- Night, Mom.

232
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,732
No.

233
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,074
Help.

234
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,839
Stop it.

235
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,527
No.

236
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:21,872
Janet?

237
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,275
- Please.
- Janet?

238
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,091
Janet, wake up!
You're dreaming.

239
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,299
This is my house.

240
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,675
No.
No, it's not.

241
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,435
Go away.

242
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,395
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

243
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,711
Playing a game with Billy.

244
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,219
Leave Billy alone.

245
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,019
Janet, who are you talking to?

246
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,039
You have to go away.

247
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,139
You're the one trespassing.

248
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,509
Janet, wake up.

249
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,779
I'll tell my mum if you don't stop.

250
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,129
I'll break her neck.

251
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,336
No, please.

252
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,379
Dying with Billy.

253
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,720
No.

254
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:10,154
Janet.

255
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,622
Janet, it's all right.

256
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,665
It's all right, come on.

257
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,186
Go back to sleep.

258
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,966
Stay away from Billy!

259
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,299
Leave us alone.
You hear me?

260
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,034
Janet, what are you doing?
There's no one here.

261
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,473
This is my house.

262
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,275
Mum!
Mum!

263
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,740
Mum!
Mum!

264
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,248
Billy?
What's wrong?

265
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,788
There's someone in my tent!

266
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:34,899
What?

267
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,037
There's someone in my tent!

268
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,435
Mummy.

269
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,509
See?
Nothing.

270
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:09,398
You just had a bad dream.
That's all.

271
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,993
Go to your room.

272
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,819
Oh, my God.

273
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,159
Janet!

274
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:47,683
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What're you doing down here?

275
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,875
I think I've been sleepwalking again.

276
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,872
What do you mean "again"?

277
00:27:54,393 --> 00:27:56,011
You all right?

278
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,419
You're burning up.
Come on.

279
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,915
Come on, let's get you back upstairs, eh?

280
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,954
Think you better stay home
from school tomorrow.

281
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:10,456
Come on.
Let's get you back into bed, eh?

282
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,806
You know I want to be a hair
artiste and become a credible painter.

283
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,293
Don't give me any of your
brute hype and airy-fairy hair...

284
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,045
...back 30 years.

285
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,060
Now, I've gone back to the age of 10.

286
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:49,660
Everything is shot in soft focus.

287
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,219
Some bogus excuses.

288
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,979
When're you gonna leave
that posh school, eh?

289
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,620
And get yourself a proper
man's job down...

290
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,835
Yes, a Christmas carol.

291
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,912
- Which one?
- All of them.

292
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,153
And within minutes...

293
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:26,715
Mr. Chairman, Mr. President,
ladies and gentlemen.

294
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,675
I stand before you tonight,

295
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,344
in my Red Star chiffon evening gown.

296
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:57,386
Hodgson residence.

297
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,779
Oh.
Hi, Mum.

298
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,118
Yeah, a little.

299
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,072
I just ate,
so I'm not really that hungry.

300
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,967
Yeah.
I'm here.

301
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:31,319
Do you know when you'll be home?

302
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:34,549
All right.

303
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:36,135
Bye, Mum.

304
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:53,144
Yes, I am an iron lady.

305
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,645
The Iron Lady of the Western world.

306
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:02,715
No, no. You are a bad one,
you know, you.

307
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,979
Mother dearest, I'm sorry I am late.

308
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:08,520
But I had to stop off
to get you a health-giving brown loaf.

309
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,586
I do not wish to hear
about that sort of thing.

310
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:12,899
I want you to come over here,

311
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,299
if you don't mind me,
and let your old mum

312
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,616
scrape the fluff out of your belly button.

313
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:22,360
Nice and clean for the big parade
and very good on Sunday.

314
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,837
I shall be there, you know,
watching you.

315
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,989
My house!

316
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,814
You're up early.

317
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,957
Hey.
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

318
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,419
You get inspired?

319
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,631
I don't know if I'd
call it that.

320
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,915
I had this crazy dream.

321
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,153
Saw this thing.
When I woke up...

322
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,017
Couldn't get it out of my head.

323
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:47,424
So, thought maybe this might help.

324
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:07,923
Hey, I know I'm no Picasso,
but I didn't think it was that bad.

325
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:20,964
We need to stop.

326
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:27,037
We could still do the lectures,
but no new cases.

327
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:29,239
At least not for a little while.

328
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,784
All right. Uh...

329
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:34,522
Could I ask why?

330
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:39,898
Because if it's the TV shows and publicity
then we won't do that.

331
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,655
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

332
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,093
Morning.

333
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,398
Do you trust me?

334
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,759
You know I do.

335
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,857
Then please trust me now.

336
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,517
Okay.

337
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:22,970
Oh.
What are you doing that for?

338
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:25,734
In case I go
sleep walking again.

339
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:53,225
Mum?

340
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:59,454
Johnny?

341
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,359
Janet! What's wrong?
What is it?

342
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,821
There's someone in the room!

343
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,116
There's no one!
What you talking about?

344
00:39:09,194 --> 00:39:10,215
What?

345
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,039
- There's someone in our room!
- What!

346
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,559
Our beds are shaking up and down!

347
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,799
Janet, I swear to God
if you're making it up...

348
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,350
I got bit. I'm not lying!
He bit me! Look!

349
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:19,737
Oh, my God.

350
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,399
Have you two been
playing with this?

351
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,759
Taking turns scaring the wits
out of each other?

352
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,511
No wonder I can't get
a good night's sleep!

353
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:50,742
- But, Mum...
- No! I don't wanna hear another word.

354
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,287
Now get back to bed,
the lot of you!

355
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,959
Help us!

356
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,159
- Please help!
- Help!

357
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,799
Peggy!
Vic, open the door!

358
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,215
Open the door!

359
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,159
I've seen it with my own eyes.

360
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,413
The bloody thing
went clear across the room.

361
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:16,738
But...

362
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,731
- Well, then...
- What? Well?

363
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,935
It's cold.
Well, I've been through the house.

364
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,969
Top to bottom.
There's no one there.

365
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:26,039
What about Margaret and Janet's room?
Did you...

366
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,535
No, no. I looked there,
every room.

367
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,830
Even went down the basement.
There's no one there.

368
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:31,335
What's he doing?

369
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,480
Oh. We've taught him to ring the bell
when he wants to go.

370
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:36,565
Do you wanna let him out, Billy?

371
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:48,462
Look!
The police are at our house!

372
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,366
Now, what they doing here?

373
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,519
- Oh, I called them.
- What?

374
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,319
Well, I mean, it's got to be somebody
playing a joke on you, right?

375
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,908
It's got to be.
Yeah.

376
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,869
So, ma'am. You didn't actually
see the man yourself?

377
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:29,373
No.

378
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:32,815
But I don't think she's making it up.
Not anymore.

379
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,215
Well, look.
There has to be some sort of explanation.

380
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,895
Sir, that's why we're here, okay?

381
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:01,713
Bring me a chair from the kitchen.

382
00:42:22,403 --> 00:42:24,714
It's coming from inside the wall.

383
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,135
Then what?
Mice, maybe?

384
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,414
Big bloody mouse.

385
00:42:42,033 --> 00:42:44,919
Well, there's nothing
we can do about that.

386
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,959
We can file an incident report
and we'll stand by it if anyone asks.

387
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,075
But that's about all.

388
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,239
A report?
Oh. That's brilliant.

389
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,781
Every problem I have,
there's another bloody form to fill out!

390
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:55,790
Oh, for God's sake.

391
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,199
Listen.

392
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,173
I think this is a bit beyond us.

393
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,461
The priest at our church
is a family friend.

394
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:05,493
I'll ask him to call on you.

395
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,519
...to us and tell us that...

396
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,119
There are still some honest
people left in the world.

397
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,151
And she said, what happened was,
that she was at the grocery store.

398
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:23,135
She left her wallet there,
at the grocery store.

399
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,639
It had money in it, a lot of money.

400
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:28,243
And she thought,
"Well, that's that. It's gone."

401
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:30,095
She thought someone
was just gonna pick it up.

402
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,739
That's it, that's that.

403
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:33,975
But just to see what she could do,

404
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,599
she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough.

405
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,279
Some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there.

406
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,439
She got everything back.
She got her money.

407
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,129
She got everything
that was in the purse.

408
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:05,027
Judy?

409
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:16,015
Honey...

410
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,525
What's wrong?

411
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,211
Mom.

412
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,659
Who's that?

413
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,196
Go back.

414
00:48:02,238 --> 00:48:04,648
Who are you?

415
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,879
Tell me who you are!

416
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,959
- Mom! Mom. Mom! Wake up!
- No!

417
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,877
What do you want?

418
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,022
I'm sorry, Lorraine.

419
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,001
Are you okay?

420
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,073
I'm okay.

421
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,115
Mrs. Hodgson.

422
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,379
Yes?

423
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,432
My name's Kent Allen.

424
00:48:55,457 --> 00:48:58,262
We're with the television
news program Wide Angle.

425
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,435
I was hoping to have
a word with you about the

426
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,998
disturbance
at your home last week.

427
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,779
How'd you find out about that?

428
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,067
The police constables filed
an incident report. It's...

429
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:10,224
Well, it's raised a few eyebrows.

430
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,600
I'd rather not have my business
spread all over the telly,

431
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,216
if you don't mind.
Good day!

432
00:49:17,241 --> 00:49:20,470
Is it still happening? Because if it is
getting your side of the story out

433
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:23,352
might be your best chance
of finding help.

434
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:28,469
This thing on?
Okay.

435
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,594
Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house

436
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,499
in Ponders End, North London,

437
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,870
is a family living in a nightmare.

438
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,918
I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,

439
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:42,437
Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.

440
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,468
So we run back inside and sure enough

441
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:47,219
there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.

442
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,014
One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.

443
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,397
I saw the chair slide by itself,

444
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,288
across the floor,
a distance of several feet.

445
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:59,099
I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.

446
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,070
Maurice Grosse is an
engineering consultant

447
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:04,499
and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.

448
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,036
Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.

449
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:09,995
The sheer number of documented
incidents in this case

450
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,153
is absolutely staggering.

451
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:14,975
But, Anita Gregory,
a parapsychologist and lecturer

452
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,197
at the Polytechnic of North London,
is not convinced.

453
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:20,447
Our principal characters here
are all children.

454
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,822
And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.

455
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,585
At the center of these
frightening activities

456
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,678
is 11 -year-old Janet Hodgson.

457
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:30,188
I recently interviewed Janet
and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret.

458
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:33,115
What happened next will astonish you.

459
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,589
How does it feel
living in a haunted house?

460
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,059
I don't know.

461
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,059
You don't get used to it.

462
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,670
You see, we was just a normal family
before all this.

463
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:48,208
It's been getting worse
since Mr. Grosse started talking to it.

464
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:50,355
How do you mean?

465
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,659
Like, asking it questions.

466
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,059
Saying knock twice for "yes"
and one for "no."

467
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,619
That sort of thing.

468
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,734
I wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now?

469
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,441
Is anybody there?

470
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,846
Is anybody there
who wishes to communicate?

471
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,453
I say again, is anybody there?

472
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:22,045
Nothing.

473
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,435
Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it?

474
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:45,674
Janet, are you all right?

475
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:56,032
Janet?

476
00:52:03,046 --> 00:52:04,346
Mmm.

477
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,114
Janet.

478
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:11,079
Janet, are you feeling all right?

479
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:14,852
Stop calling me Janet!

480
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:17,420
Isn't that your name?

481
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:20,895
Janet's asleep...

482
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,867
And I'm talking.

483
00:52:29,777 --> 00:52:31,908
Well, what should I call you?

484
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:46,975
What is your name?

485
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,361
You don't belong here.

486
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,675
My name is Maurice Grosse.

487
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,450
Who are you?

488
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,961
This is my home.

489
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:04,035
Get out now!

490
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,485
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

491
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:11,635
Knock, knock.

492
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:15,633
Very well.

493
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,284
Who's there?

494
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,121
Bill.
Bill.

495
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:24,571
Bill.
Bill.

496
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:26,955
Bill who?

497
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:36,005
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

498
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,335
Where do you come from?

499
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,879
I come from the grave.

500
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,626
How did you die?

501
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,279
I went blind and had a hemorrhage.

502
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,120
And I fell asleep
and I died in the chair in the corner.

503
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:03,099
Why have you come here?

504
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,874
I like to hear them scream.

505
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,879
Why don't you just leave us alone?

506
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,068
Shut up, you old cow!

507
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,489
Janet, darling.

508
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:29,913
Darling, are you all right?

509
00:54:29,938 --> 00:54:31,695
I'm sorry.

510
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,189
Janet.

511
00:54:43,902 --> 00:54:45,535
Peggy, what am I gonna do?

512
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,759
Oh...

513
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,528
You don't need to think
about it tonight.

514
00:54:48,553 --> 00:54:51,855
And you and the kids can stay here
as long as you like.

515
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,579
Mum.

516
00:54:54,434 --> 00:54:57,229
Billy, aren't you supposed
to be getting ready for bed?

517
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,698
I thought you might
like some biscuits.

518
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:05,644
Oh...

519
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,339
Oh, thank you!

520
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,693
B-B-Baron?

521
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,120
Baron?

522
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:34,860
There was a crooked man,

523
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:40,935
and he walked a crooked mile,

524
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,057
Mum!
Mum!

525
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,719
Mum!
Mum!

526
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,479
- What happened? What is it?
- The Crooked Man!

527
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,399
What? Crooked what?
What are you talking about, darling?

528
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,471
- The Crooked Man!
- Calm down and just tell me what happened.

529
00:57:52,496 --> 00:57:53,757
- What?
- What is it?

530
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,727
I don't know.
I think he's been walking around...

531
00:57:55,754 --> 00:58:01,154
Thr crooked man stepped forth
and rang a crooked bell.

532
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:06,831
And thus his crooked soul
spiraled into a crooked hell.

533
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:16,540
Murdered his crooked family
and laughed the crooked laugh.

534
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:31,471
Janet!
Janet!

535
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,419
Janet?

536
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,518
Oh, my God!
No!

537
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,229
Someone get an ambulance!

538
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:44,018
This is my home.

539
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:45,899
Get out now.

540
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,367
No. This is not your house.
Now, what's your name?

541
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,555
Knock, knock.

542
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,698
Very well.
Who's there?

543
00:58:57,317 --> 00:58:59,568
Bill.
Bill.

544
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:02,231
Bill.
Bill.

545
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,359
Bill who?

546
00:59:04,677 --> 00:59:12,128
My name is Bill Wilkins
and I'm 72 years old.

547
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,057
What do you make of that voice?

548
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,790
He sounds confused.

549
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:20,588
Is he senile?

550
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:23,902
The voice on this tape

551
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,413
is coming from an 11 -year-old girl.

552
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,399
The family's reached out
to the Church for help?

553
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,455
Yes.

554
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,875
But truthfully, we've been
reluctant to get involved.

555
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,259
The case has turned into
a media circus over there.

556
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,795
They're calling it "England's Amityville."

557
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,979
Great.

558
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,715
You're afraid it's a hoax.

559
00:59:49,856 --> 00:59:54,271
The Church's ability to help people
depends on its reputation.

560
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,291
So, what do you want us to do?

561
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:58,206
We'd like you to fly to London

562
00:59:58,231 --> 01:00:02,935
for 3 days to act as
our unofficial eyes and ears.

563
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,899
Now, you don't have to do anything.

564
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:08,078
If it is a hoax, you just
turn around and leave.

565
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:10,198
But if it's not...

566
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:15,510
Then there is a family in London
that desperately needs our help.

567
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:20,289
Well, thank you for your faith in us.

568
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:22,405
- All right. Well, just let me know.
- Okay.

569
01:00:27,317 --> 01:00:29,247
I told him we'd talk about it.

570
01:00:30,116 --> 01:00:31,735
There's nothing to talk about.

571
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,039
Honey, you heard him.

572
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,866
They don't want us to get involved.
Just observe and report back.

573
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,069
There have always been cases
we've turned down.

574
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:43,337
There has never been a family
that we've refused to help.

575
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:47,118
I had a vision in Amityville.

576
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:51,723
It was the same one
I had 7 years ago.

577
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,515
I had a premonition of your death.

578
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,059
Wait. That's why you locked
yourself away for 8 days?

579
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,393
You saw my death?

580
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:07,276
You've seen it, too.

581
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,219
The demon in your painting is real.

582
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,295
We have both seen
the same inhuman spirit.

583
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,079
It's a warning.
If we keep doing this,

584
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,064
you are going to die.

585
01:01:20,379 --> 01:01:22,902
Your visions are a gift from God.

586
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:26,663
And if God is showing you my death,
then he's doing it for a reason.

587
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,048
Maybe you're meant
to prevent it from happening.

588
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:32,401
Come on.

589
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,056
We don't run from fights.

590
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:45,439
If we go...

591
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,437
If we do this...

592
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,977
You have to promise me
that we're just there to observe.

593
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,999
If anything turns out
dangerous in any way,

594
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,279
we're gonna tell the Church,
and we're gonna get out.

595
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,881
Promise me.

596
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,693
Promise me, Ed.

597
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,613
I promise.

598
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,246
Mr. and Mrs. Warren,
I'm Maurice Grosse.

599
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:19,081
Thank you so much for coming.

600
01:02:19,106 --> 01:02:23,199
I believe you're gonna be staying
at the Hodgsons' house. Is that right?

601
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,879
Always better to be in the mix.

602
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,776
Oh, yeah.
I agree.

603
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:30,597
You didn't have to do this.

604
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,143
- So kind of you.
- It was a complimentary...

605
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,919
This is it.

606
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,079
Thank you very much.

607
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,919
- How you doing? You all right?
- I'm all right. How are the kids?

608
01:02:38,944 --> 01:02:40,002
Yeah.
They're fine.

609
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:41,726
Here we are.

610
01:02:43,837 --> 01:02:45,215
There we go.

611
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,919
Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.

612
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,119
I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.

613
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,239
Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.

614
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,382
You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.

615
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,215
Vic Nottingham.
Hi, Vic.

616
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,439
How are you?
Ed Warren.

617
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,031
Hello, Ed.

618
01:03:03,056 --> 01:03:05,495
How are you?
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.

619
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,130
- Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
- How do you do?

620
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:08,674
- This is my wife, Lorraine.
- How do you do?

621
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

622
01:03:10,124 --> 01:03:11,363
Well, I'll be off then, Peg.

623
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:12,743
Will you tell the kids
I said hello?

624
01:03:12,768 --> 01:03:14,411
Yeah. Of course, I will.
Nice to meet you.

625
01:03:14,436 --> 01:03:15,595
- Nice meeting you.
- You too, hon.

626
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,339
- So, here we are, Peggy.
- All right. Do come in.

627
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,499
It's just me
and Janet here now.

628
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,459
My other kids are staying with them.

629
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,659
This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.

630
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,748
Why not?

631
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,932
Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.

632
01:03:28,957 --> 01:03:31,136
We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,

633
01:03:31,161 --> 01:03:33,128
which is why we keep it locked.

634
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:35,039
I understand that Janet has levitated.

635
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,239
Did that happen in here as well?

636
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,679
- Yeah, more than once.
- Yeah.

637
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,239
We've got photographs of that as well.

638
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,718
I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.

639
01:03:49,489 --> 01:03:52,599
The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,

640
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,446
hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.

641
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,659
Has it worked?

642
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,554
No.
We can hear it all night.

643
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:27,130
Hi, there.
I'm Lorraine.

644
01:04:30,058 --> 01:04:32,030
Mind if I have a seat?

645
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,815
Do you know why I'm here?

646
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:47,708
Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on

647
01:04:47,733 --> 01:04:49,936
and I'm here to help,
if I can.

648
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:52,083
Would you like to talk about it?

649
01:04:56,436 --> 01:05:01,075
You know, when I was about your age,
um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital

650
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,628
and I saw an angel.

651
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:06,710
Yeah.

652
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,459
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.

653
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,619
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

654
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,495
And it looked right at me.

655
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,719
Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,

656
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,879
but I knew it was real.

657
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,161
Look, I know how it is.

658
01:05:29,733 --> 01:05:33,343
I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.

659
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,919
But I also know that
one person can change everything.

660
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,871
And you just have to open up to them.

661
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,255
How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?

662
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,874
I didn't.

663
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:58,270
Sometimes I got hurt.

664
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,178
And it took a long time, but...

665
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,727
I finally found someone
who believed me.

666
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:12,083
What did you do then?

667
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,929
I married him.

668
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:30,038
I'm just so tired.

669
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:34,979
I can't sleep here.

670
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,302
I used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there

671
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,891
because I was so worn out.

672
01:06:46,548 --> 01:06:49,078
But now I can't even do that.

673
01:06:53,933 --> 01:06:56,701
Everyone's afraid of me.

674
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,788
I got no friends.

675
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,976
No place I can go to.

676
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,899
It makes me feel like
I'm not normal.

677
01:07:12,217 --> 01:07:17,417
You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.

678
01:07:17,442 --> 01:07:19,279
But why?

679
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,883
Because that's what makes it stronger.

680
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,373
Around the time this all started,

681
01:07:25,398 --> 01:07:28,705
Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.

682
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:33,159
This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.

683
01:07:33,926 --> 01:07:36,137
Where'd you get it from?

684
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,639
Uh...

685
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,399
My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.

686
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,369
If you don't mind me asking...

687
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,180
Uh, is your ex-husband
still in the picture?

688
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:46,604
Nope.

689
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,179
I'm sorry to hear that.

690
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:53,079
Any chance of reconciliation?

691
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,292
He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.

692
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,746
So I'm gonna
take that as a "no."

693
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,554
- Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.
- Hmm.

694
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,319
He took all the music
the day he left.

695
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,836
I know it must feel like
that sometimes...

696
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:11,319
No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.

697
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,599
My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.

698
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,318
- They've been through so much.
- Hmm.

699
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,206
And now, all this is happening on top.

700
01:08:19,231 --> 01:08:20,870
Yeah.
The timing isn't a coincidence.

701
01:08:20,895 --> 01:08:23,915
Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.

702
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,390
They like to kick you
when you're down.

703
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,070
That hardly seems fair.

704
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,272
No, it really isn't.

705
01:08:31,297 --> 01:08:33,827
Do you know when
the voice is gonna speak?

706
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,379
Sometimes.

707
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,428
And when it does, does it feel
like it's coming from inside you?

708
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,260
No.

709
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,986
More like it's coming from behind me.

710
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,877
Like I'm being used.

711
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:57,555
Does it ever say things just to you?

712
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,711
That only you can hear?

713
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:06,335
What does it say?

714
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,169
It said it wants to hurt you.

715
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,737
When did it say that?

716
01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:23,605
Right now.

717
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,578
Do we really need that?

718
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,470
Oh. We'd like to be
able to prove to the Church

719
01:09:37,495 --> 01:09:39,319
that she's not making
the voice herself.

720
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,759
So, by holding the water in her mouth,

721
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,415
we'll be able to show that
it's not some form of ventriloquism.

722
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,568
Does she have to be in the chair?

723
01:09:46,593 --> 01:09:47,599
Just...

724
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,545
It makes me sick to see
her sitting there like that.

725
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:52,759
We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.

726
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,052
It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.

727
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,456
You'll be all right.

728
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,715
You ready for this?

729
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,359
I guess so.

730
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,199
It's December the 21 st, 1977.

731
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,678
This is Ed and Lorraine Warren,
sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson.

732
01:10:17,703 --> 01:10:20,477
Also present is Maurice Grosse.

733
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,880
All right.
Let's get started.

734
01:10:34,809 --> 01:10:37,566
If there's something here that would
like to communicate with us,

735
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:40,300
we're all ears.
Speak up.

736
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,134
What do you want
with this girl and her family?

737
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,379
It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.

738
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,099
Strange!
I wonder why not?

739
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,294
It's not been shy about
talking up until now.

740
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,955
How about if we all turn our backs?

741
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,217
Think it'll speak if we do that?

742
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:19,242
Maybe.

743
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,075
Well...

744
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,447
Let's try this again.

745
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,119
So what do you think, Bill?

746
01:11:45,144 --> 01:11:46,868
We've given you your privacy.

747
01:11:46,893 --> 01:11:49,035
Now come on out
and talk to us.

748
01:12:07,466 --> 01:12:10,945
Here I come.

749
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,268
Am I talking to the spirit
that's oppressing this family?

750
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:23,088
Is that what I am?

751
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,097
Is that what I'm doing?

752
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,780
Yes.

753
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:30,175
And I have come to put a stop to it.

754
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,898
Do you know who I am?

755
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,696
Ed.

756
01:12:37,713 --> 01:12:39,280
Eddie.

757
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,981
Edward.

758
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:45,696
Ed is fine.

759
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,366
Your father called you Edward.

760
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,719
Not true.

761
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:56,728
My father called me Ed,
just like everybody else.

762
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,959
Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist

763
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,576
and I'm not here to talk
about my father.

764
01:13:05,601 --> 01:13:07,920
Let's get down to business,
what do you say?

765
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:09,245
Hmm?

766
01:13:10,728 --> 01:13:13,826
Why don't you
just leave these people alone?

767
01:13:17,233 --> 01:13:20,001
Because this is my house!

768
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:23,282
It's not your house.

769
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,298
Yes, it is.

770
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,615
I come here to see my family,

771
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,999
but they're not here now.

772
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,999
That's because you're dead.

773
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,475
If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.

774
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:45,125
Where are they?

775
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,132
I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.

776
01:13:50,946 --> 01:13:53,180
I don't need your help.

777
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,290
Then why don't you just move on?

778
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,689
I don't believe in that.

779
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:06,531
Why not, hmm?

780
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,488
What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?

781
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,510
I... am not
a heaven man!

782
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:24,618
Well, I got news for you, Bill.

783
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,534
You see, I don't care what you believe in.

784
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,165
You see this?

785
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,698
Help... it... let... go!

786
01:14:42,723 --> 01:14:48,277
Help... it... let... go!

787
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,392
Are you sensing a presence?

788
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:24,971
No, just the opposite.

789
01:15:24,996 --> 01:15:27,263
I'm not sensing anything.

790
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:31,475
We could be looking
at hysterical neurosis.

791
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,939
That would explain
the multiple personalities

792
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,019
and hallucinations.

793
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,731
That doesn't feel right, either.

794
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,959
Well...

795
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,279
I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.

796
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,879
I heard that voice
with my own ears,

797
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,782
but all I can sense
is their own fear.

798
01:15:48,807 --> 01:15:51,337
I can't seem to see beyond that.

799
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,845
I don't think I can sleep
this far away from you.

800
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,639
Well, you're gonna.

801
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,296
It'll give you something
to look forward to when we get home.

802
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,159
Oh, love.
I wish you wouldn't do that.

803
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,079
It helps me sleep.

804
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,505
At least I know
I'm not going anywhere.

805
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,239
I didn't smoke, Mum.

806
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,540
Eh?

807
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,559
That day with Camilla at school.

808
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,314
I was holding the cigarette,

809
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:10,160
but I wasn't going to take
a puff. I swear.

810
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:14,639
I just wanted to look cool
in front of her.

811
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,475
It was stupid.

812
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,479
Oh, love.

813
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,214
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

814
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,120
Oh, darling.

815
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:16,398
Help!

816
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,028
Help!

817
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,588
Hmm.

818
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,481
Janet!

819
01:20:24,618 --> 01:20:26,033
Ah!

820
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,879
Janet?

821
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,981
Oh, my God.

822
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:32,499
Janet?

823
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,799
Janet?

824
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,461
- Help!
- Janet?

825
01:20:36,486 --> 01:20:37,944
Janet!

826
01:20:38,612 --> 01:20:40,439
Please help me!

827
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,799
Mum!

828
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,741
Please!
Mum!

829
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:46,874
- Janet!
- Help! Get me out!

830
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:48,239
There's somebody in here!

831
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,908
I can't open it!

832
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:52,602
- Mum, help me!
- It won't open.

833
01:20:58,014 --> 01:20:59,586
Janet!

834
01:21:01,182 --> 01:21:02,185
Janet!

835
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:05,070
- What's going on?
- There's someone in there with Janet!

836
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,121
I can't get it open!

837
01:21:08,146 --> 01:21:10,164
Get the key.
Go get the key now!

838
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:16,298
Janet! Hold on!
We're coming!

839
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,042
I got the key!
I got the key!

840
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:21,624
Okay. Okay.

841
01:21:22,064 --> 01:21:23,364
Come on!

842
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,346
Janet, we're coming!

843
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:31,639
- Janet.
- Janet darling.

844
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,369
Get it off her!
Please get it off her!

845
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:38,455
What was that?

846
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,488
There was someone in here!

847
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,423
I saw him with me own eyes.

848
01:21:42,448 --> 01:21:44,308
He did this to my girl.

849
01:21:59,203 --> 01:22:02,017
This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.

850
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,617
It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.

851
01:22:05,927 --> 01:22:08,359
Wow.
That's pretty distinctive.

852
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,490
Two missing teeth.

853
01:22:09,515 --> 01:22:11,615
That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.

854
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,279
You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?

855
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,959
I tracked down the home owner.

856
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,228
And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.

857
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:19,799
His name was William Wilkins

858
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,995
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair.

859
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,939
Everything she said is true.

860
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,579
All public information, by the way.

861
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,195
She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.

862
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:31,906
And what about the claims
that Janet has been

863
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:34,419
teleporting around the
house in her sleep?

864
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,855
About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.

865
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,999
Were any of you there
when it happened?

866
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,319
No.
But I have pictures of that too.

867
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,039
Yeah. There you go.

868
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,059
I set my camera up
in the girls' room

869
01:22:46,084 --> 01:22:48,236
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.

870
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:50,884
And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.

871
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,639
I have to admit.

872
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:56,421
The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.

873
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:58,359
It looks like she's just jumping.

874
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,399
What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.

875
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,879
You saw it with your own eyes.

876
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,359
Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.

877
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,715
But she teleported herself into a room

878
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,139
locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.

879
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,899
And what about her voice?

880
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,419
How do we explain that?

881
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,299
I think the first time
she was making that voice

882
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,339
it was in front of television cameras.

883
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,219
And she couldn't do it
with water in her mouth

884
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,619
until you looked away.

885
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,607
So she could have spit it out,

886
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:26,035
taken another sip
before you turned back.

887
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,982
Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.

888
01:23:30,007 --> 01:23:32,099
Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,

889
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:36,757
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.

890
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:40,417
The demons are worse.

891
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,499
But you must admit,
it is suspicious.

892
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,099
You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?

893
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,398
And what about Peggy?

894
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:51,499
She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

895
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,517
to get better housing from the council.

896
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:54,965
She's already applied!

897
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,335
Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.

898
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,279
Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.

899
01:24:00,304 --> 01:24:02,513
To believe when nobody else will.

900
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,992
So you really do believe them?

901
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,835
Yes.
We do.

902
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,899
But the Church can't do
anything without proof.

903
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,179
That's what we need.

904
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,057
Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,

905
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,795
see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.

906
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,699
In the meantime,
Ed and I can be spending time

907
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,316
with Peggy and the kids,
because they need to be a family again.

908
01:24:22,782 --> 01:24:24,415
Hi, Mom!
We're back!

909
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,819
What are you doing back?

910
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,339
What's all this, then?

911
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,619
Mr. and Mrs. Warren
bought us some vinyls.

912
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,819
They got us an Elvis record!

913
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,262
Oh, Blue Hawaii.

914
01:24:31,287 --> 01:24:33,659
Hope you don't mind.
A little American culture.

915
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,764
Not at all!

916
01:24:34,789 --> 01:24:36,647
- Janet!
- Billy.

917
01:24:37,024 --> 01:24:38,865
I missed you.

918
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,509
Hey, guys, I missed you.

919
01:24:43,523 --> 01:24:46,822
So, have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully?

920
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:49,636
Pete, at school.

921
01:24:49,661 --> 01:24:51,876
He's always picking on Billy.

922
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,902
And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?

923
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,439
They stick up for me.

924
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,977
Good, because the spirit in this house

925
01:24:59,002 --> 01:25:00,915
- is a lot like that bully.
- Yes.

926
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,499
And he's got it in for Janet.

927
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,031
So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.

928
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:07,550
Family sticks together.

929
01:25:07,575 --> 01:25:09,680
This, on the other hand,
is a lost cause.

930
01:25:09,705 --> 01:25:11,202
Oh, bloody hell.

931
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:12,995
We've had all sorts of things stop working

932
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,777
- for no reason at all.
- Mmm.

933
01:25:14,802 --> 01:25:18,174
We're gonna have music in here
one way or another.

934
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,768
Whose guitar is that?

935
01:25:20,793 --> 01:25:23,387
Oh, it was Dad's,
but he said I could have it.

936
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:25,095
Yeah, do you mind?

937
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,489
No.

938
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:33,650
I'm a little rusty,
so you gotta promise not to laugh.

939
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,325
Especially you.

940
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:50,366
Wise men say

941
01:25:50,803 --> 01:25:55,469
Only fools rush in

942
01:25:55,494 --> 01:25:56,833
Thank you.

943
01:25:57,328 --> 01:25:58,777
Hey, don't laugh now.

944
01:25:59,444 --> 01:26:10,331
But I can't help
falling in love with you

945
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:16,514
Shall I stay?

946
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:21,975
Would it be a sin?

947
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:33,711
If I can't help
falling in love with you

948
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:40,729
Like a river flows
surely to the sea

949
01:26:40,754 --> 01:26:49,107
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

950
01:26:50,202 --> 01:26:52,302
Everybody now.

951
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:57,547
Take my hand,

952
01:26:57,647 --> 01:27:04,106
Take my whole life, too

953
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:16,327
For I can't help
falling in love with you

954
01:27:16,446 --> 01:27:30,856
For I can't help
falling in love with you

955
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,414
Thank you very much.

956
01:27:44,063 --> 01:27:46,066
It's so small and light.

957
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:50,058
Why do you do this?

958
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,339
Help people like us?

959
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,266
When you were little, did you ever
worry that there might be something

960
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,965
hiding under your bed at night?

961
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:59,840
Yeah?
Well...

962
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,969
My bed,
actually had something under it.

963
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,381
Yeah.

964
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,655
Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.

965
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,224
It was too dark to see under there,

966
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:13,544
but let me tell you,
I ran out of there so fast.

967
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,074
You know what my dad did?

968
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:19,393
He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.

969
01:28:20,016 --> 01:28:22,511
And I was scared to death.

970
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:27,115
But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.

971
01:28:27,388 --> 01:28:30,503
"God will be there for all who need."

972
01:28:31,478 --> 01:28:37,004
So, I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?

973
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,399
And I tell whatever's under there

974
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:43,250
that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.

975
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,241
Best thing my dad
ever did for me.

976
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,879
Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.

977
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,239
It took me years
to finally find someone who did.

978
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,178
And you know what I did then?

979
01:28:57,277 --> 01:28:59,045
You married her?

980
01:29:03,017 --> 01:29:05,595
So you've heard this story before?

981
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,568
All right.

982
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,919
How you getting on in here?

983
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,211
Hey!
We're done here.

984
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,239
Fixed the closet door, too.

985
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,599
And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.

986
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,599
Oh.
No, I couldn't ask you to do that.

987
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,100
It's a disaster down there.

988
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,428
Come on.
How bad can it be?

989
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,020
Oh.

990
01:29:29,173 --> 01:29:30,760
Bloody hell.

991
01:29:31,605 --> 01:29:33,283
Everything still quiet in there?

992
01:29:33,308 --> 01:29:36,176
Yes. Thank goodness.
Yes.

993
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,359
It would be something though, wouldn't it?

994
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:41,160
If we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

995
01:29:41,185 --> 01:29:44,933
that there is a life
beyond this?

996
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,059
It would be historic.

997
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:50,651
Is that why you're doing this?

998
01:29:50,676 --> 01:29:53,261
Because you want to be a part
of something historic?

999
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:57,039
This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.

1000
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,108
And I think helping that family
is the only thing that matters.

1001
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:02,786
No, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean that.

1002
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,696
My daughter died in a car
crash several years ago.

1003
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,715
Afterwards, I started
to experience things.

1004
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,998
I think she wanted to
communicate with me.

1005
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:18,344
And, yes, it would help
if I knew that she was...

1006
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:20,371
I don't know.

1007
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,272
Somewhere.

1008
01:30:36,023 --> 01:30:37,756
That's not it.

1009
01:30:44,975 --> 01:30:46,673
Oh, great.

1010
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,528
I think I found it.

1011
01:31:06,692 --> 01:31:08,043
All right.

1012
01:31:21,378 --> 01:31:23,147
It's right here.

1013
01:31:24,314 --> 01:31:26,334
Come and get it.
Margaret!

1014
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:28,769
Johnny, come and get it.

1015
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,309
Okay.

1016
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,671
I think I got it.

1017
01:31:54,648 --> 01:31:56,127
All right.

1018
01:31:58,117 --> 01:32:00,014
There we go.

1019
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:22,408
What's that?

1020
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:25,428
There we go.

1021
01:32:44,154 --> 01:32:47,762
Ed? There's...
There's something behind you.

1022
01:33:04,846 --> 01:33:06,655
What?
What is it?

1023
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,037
Oh, Jesus!

1024
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:10,839
Whoa!

1025
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:12,119
Peggy!

1026
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,189
Peggy!

1027
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,257
He grabbed me.

1028
01:33:16,282 --> 01:33:19,483
It was him.
He tried to pull me under.

1029
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,589
Oh, my God!
Look!

1030
01:33:23,943 --> 01:33:25,193
Oh God, you're scratched.

1031
01:33:25,218 --> 01:33:26,680
That's not a scratch,
that's a bite mark.

1032
01:33:26,705 --> 01:33:29,663
He bit me.
It's just like he did Janet.

1033
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,059
Aw.

1034
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,599
Hey, Janet, can you get me another one?

1035
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,900
Yeah.

1036
01:34:48,383 --> 01:34:49,820
Janet?

1037
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,472
What's wrong?

1038
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,412
Don't you see it?

1039
01:34:56,155 --> 01:34:57,777
See what?

1040
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:02,537
In the kitchen.

1041
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,258
Tell me what you see.

1042
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,980
It's playing with the knives,

1043
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,408
hiding in the dark.

1044
01:35:25,537 --> 01:35:28,444
Johnny!
Johnny, what you doing?

1045
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,839
Johnny, no!
Johnny, don't go!

1046
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,599
Remember what Mr. Warren said?

1047
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,652
We can't let it bully us.

1048
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,417
This is our house.

1049
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,557
Johnny.
Johnny, please come back.

1050
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,535
What's the matter?
What's happened?

1051
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,658
Janet's gone!
She was just right here!

1052
01:36:11,617 --> 01:36:12,954
Come on.

1053
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:21,359
No!

1054
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,491
- Mum!
- Johnny!

1055
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,448
Ed?
What's going on?

1056
01:36:28,473 --> 01:36:29,773
Mum.

1057
01:36:30,586 --> 01:36:32,439
Mum, Johnny's in there!

1058
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,681
No!

1059
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:35,110
Mum!

1060
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,922
Johnny!

1061
01:36:37,314 --> 01:36:38,901
Johnny!

1062
01:36:39,022 --> 01:36:40,303
Step back.

1063
01:36:42,985 --> 01:36:44,285
Come on.

1064
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,884
Where are they?
Where are they?

1065
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:56,170
Johnny?

1066
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:58,073
Johnny?

1067
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,757
Darling!

1068
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,611
Oh, darling, come here.

1069
01:37:06,477 --> 01:37:08,096
Are you all right?

1070
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,411
It's all right, darling.

1071
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,951
It's all right.

1072
01:37:17,076 --> 01:37:18,590
Where's Janet?

1073
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,638
Where's Janet?

1074
01:37:24,433 --> 01:37:25,961
Janet!

1075
01:37:44,528 --> 01:37:47,103
Guys, I'm picking up something in here.

1076
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,860
Ed, watch the...

1077
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,171
Me... Won't...

1078
01:38:11,196 --> 01:38:13,484
Me... Won't...

1079
01:38:13,509 --> 01:38:14,919
Me...

1080
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:26,695
Janet.

1081
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,615
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on. Come on.

1082
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,919
Come on, now.

1083
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,999
It's okay.
Watch out. Look out.

1084
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,805
- Slowly!
- Okay.

1085
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:38,309
Darling, it's all right.

1086
01:38:38,334 --> 01:38:41,846
It's all right, Mum's here.
Mum's here, darling.

1087
01:38:43,639 --> 01:38:45,774
How did she get in there?

1088
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,680
It's all right, darling.
What's that?

1089
01:39:01,649 --> 01:39:03,098
It's fine.

1090
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:09,179
Can I, uh...

1091
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,714
What is it?

1092
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,178
She's faking it.

1093
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,139
What?

1094
01:39:19,164 --> 01:39:20,956
I have proof.

1095
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,435
So much for your leap of faith.

1096
01:40:11,575 --> 01:40:12,975
What?

1097
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,039
My girl didn't make this up.
I've seen things.

1098
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,970
She was caught red-handed faking an event.

1099
01:40:17,995 --> 01:40:20,765
No, it's not possible.
Have you seen it in there?

1100
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:23,448
How could a 12-year-old girl
throw a table across the room?

1101
01:40:23,473 --> 01:40:25,810
It's over.
Do you understand?

1102
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:29,459
For the sake of your daughter,
don't make this harder than it already is.

1103
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,896
She couldn't have pulled this off alone.

1104
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,415
Oh, how dare you.

1105
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,335
What, you think I put her up to this?

1106
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,625
What about the police?
Are they in on this, too?

1107
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:40,889
No, it's all right.

1108
01:40:40,914 --> 01:40:42,647
What about you two?

1109
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,861
You believe us, don't you?

1110
01:40:50,374 --> 01:40:52,133
We wanna help.

1111
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,679
But the Church take one look at
that video and that'll be the end of it.

1112
01:40:56,267 --> 01:41:01,239
They'll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax.

1113
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,104
I'd like you to leave, please.

1114
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:10,093
Now, go on, get out.

1115
01:41:10,597 --> 01:41:12,569
Get out, the lot of you!

1116
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,729
Get out!

1117
01:41:26,746 --> 01:41:30,119
Perhaps, you could somehow
reach out to the spirit.

1118
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,559
You know, make contact with it yourself.

1119
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,134
I can't.
Believe me, I've tried.

1120
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,575
I'm sorry, I'm just not
sensing anything here.

1121
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,879
So, that's it, then?

1122
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,639
You hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away?

1123
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,759
We don't like this
any more than you do.

1124
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,999
We'll tell the Church
about everything we've seen.

1125
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,639
But, the only piece
of concrete evidence we've got,

1126
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,359
is a video of Janet faking an incident.

1127
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:54,516
Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.

1128
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:55,679
You might want this.

1129
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:58,873
And, just because she faked it this once,
doesn't change the fact that...

1130
01:41:58,898 --> 01:42:00,624
No, it changes everything.

1131
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,959
We're agents of the Church here.

1132
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:06,616
They'd be calling us home
even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave.

1133
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,099
You've done really
good work here, Maurice.

1134
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,906
You were here for them
when no one else was.

1135
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:20,727
Uh, thank you.

1136
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:26,274
But, sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith.

1137
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:29,639
Believe when nobody else will.

1138
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,764
This doesn't feel right.

1139
01:43:09,913 --> 01:43:11,427
I know.

1140
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,252
Have a safe trip.

1141
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,772
Did you really do it?

1142
01:43:54,874 --> 01:43:57,120
Wreck the kitchen and all that?

1143
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,236
But, why?

1144
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:06,277
It said it would kill you,

1145
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,027
if I didn't make them leave.

1146
01:44:11,382 --> 01:44:13,097
Don't you think
it's a little convenient

1147
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:15,001
that she just happened
to fake an incident

1148
01:44:15,026 --> 01:44:18,256
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it?

1149
01:44:18,281 --> 01:44:19,581
Yeah.

1150
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,749
No.

1151
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,149
Oh, damn it.

1152
01:44:39,542 --> 01:44:40,911
Lorraine.

1153
01:44:41,552 --> 01:44:43,693
Help me set up these tape recorders.

1154
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:58,580
Thread it through
and start it from the top.

1155
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:04,899
All right.

1156
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,675
Remember those strange,
garbled messages we got from Janet?

1157
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,579
- You know, from Bill?
- Yes.

1158
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:12,154
There were two of them, right?

1159
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:13,720
Here's the first one.

1160
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,750
Help!
It...

1161
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,275
Let go!

1162
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,736
Help!
It... Let...

1163
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:27,693
Go!

1164
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:30,939
We thought
he was referring to himself, right?

1165
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:33,743
- Yes.
- Listen to the second one.

1166
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:38,193
Me... Won't...

1167
01:45:38,549 --> 01:45:40,890
Me... Won't...

1168
01:45:40,915 --> 01:45:42,414
Me...

1169
01:45:53,768 --> 01:45:55,786
If I'm right about this...

1170
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:05,871
Help me!
It won't let me go!

1171
01:46:05,896 --> 01:46:11,244
Help me!
It won't let me go!

1172
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:53,302
I come here to see my family.

1173
01:46:53,651 --> 01:46:56,456
But they're not here now.

1174
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,193
I think,

1175
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:03,685
I'd like to go now.

1176
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,622
- But I can't.
- Why not?

1177
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,584
It wants her.
So badly.

1178
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:14,051
It almost has her.

1179
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,485
Tell me how to stop it.

1180
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:23,695
I'm given and I'm taken.

1181
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,454
I was there at your first breath.

1182
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:28,831
You didn't ask for me.

1183
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,761
But I'll follow you till death.

1184
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:36,415
Wait.
I don't understand.

1185
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,266
I...
Please... I...

1186
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,481
Oh, God!

1187
01:47:42,506 --> 01:47:43,894
You're bleeding!

1188
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,019
What is happening?

1189
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:56,209
The old man's spirit is just a pawn.

1190
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,377
He's been enslaved
to where he's to weaken Janet's will.

1191
01:47:59,402 --> 01:48:00,889
Enslaved?
Enslaved by who?

1192
01:48:00,914 --> 01:48:02,408
Something inhuman.

1193
01:48:02,433 --> 01:48:05,611
Something that's taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith.

1194
01:48:05,636 --> 01:48:08,243
There is a demonic presence
in that house.

1195
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:11,756
You need to get Vic before he leaves.
We need to go back.

1196
01:48:11,781 --> 01:48:13,182
Okay.

1197
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,893
Mom, help me, please!
Mom!

1198
01:48:35,918 --> 01:48:38,745
Please, Mom, help me!
Help!

1199
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:40,023
Ha ha ha...

1200
01:48:40,048 --> 01:48:44,060
For God's sake,
leave us alone!

1201
01:48:46,542 --> 01:48:47,973
Margaret!

1202
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,962
Margaret, no!
No.

1203
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:59,182
Come on, let's get out of here!

1204
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,947
Come on, let's get out!

1205
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,081
- Go to Peggy's house!
- What, you're not coming?

1206
01:49:07,106 --> 01:49:08,810
I can't leave Janet!

1207
01:49:09,914 --> 01:49:12,727
- No! Janet!
- Mum!

1208
01:49:13,222 --> 01:49:14,522
Janet!

1209
01:49:14,547 --> 01:49:15,719
Well, I don't understand it.

1210
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,840
I mean, first you say it's not real,
now it is.

1211
01:49:17,865 --> 01:49:20,399
Her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit.

1212
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,799
The old man's spirit

1213
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,208
couldn't break through
until we left that house.

1214
01:49:24,233 --> 01:49:27,468
Everything they've experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic.

1215
01:49:27,493 --> 01:49:29,572
The Old Man, the Crooked Man,
they're just a facade,

1216
01:49:29,597 --> 01:49:31,474
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house.

1217
01:49:31,499 --> 01:49:33,919
In my vision, he wanted to help me,
but he was too afraid.

1218
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,806
And he kept speaking
in a kind of riddle.

1219
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:43,810
Something like, uh,
"I am given and I am taken.

1220
01:49:43,835 --> 01:49:45,834
"I was there at your first breath.

1221
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:48,029
"You didn't ask for me.

1222
01:49:48,651 --> 01:49:51,465
"But I will follow you until your death."

1223
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,199
Your name. You didn't ask for it.
It was given, when you were born.

1224
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,524
That's it!
Knowing the demon's name

1225
01:50:00,549 --> 01:50:02,373
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out.

1226
01:50:02,398 --> 01:50:04,895
Yeah, sure,
but we don't know its name.

1227
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,199
But, maybe we do.

1228
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,359
Huh?

1229
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,359
Why else would he give us that clue?

1230
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,745
He must think that
we know it somehow.

1231
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:13,319
So, what do you do now?

1232
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,550
An inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud Lorraine's sight

1233
01:50:15,575 --> 01:50:16,729
is more than a match for me.

1234
01:50:16,754 --> 01:50:19,580
We need to get Janet to the Church
before it kills her.

1235
01:50:22,593 --> 01:50:23,765
Janet!

1236
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:26,181
- What happened?
- Margaret.

1237
01:50:31,242 --> 01:50:32,542
Janet!

1238
01:50:34,762 --> 01:50:36,177
Janet!

1239
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,354
Thank God you're here.

1240
01:50:38,379 --> 01:50:40,158
- Janet's in there!
- Come on!

1241
01:50:42,859 --> 01:50:44,159
Damn it.

1242
01:50:44,422 --> 01:50:45,658
Here.

1243
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,255
Huh?

1244
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:10,136
- Ed! Are you okay?
- Yeah!

1245
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,614
I'm gonna go around back!

1246
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,108
No! Ed!
No!

1247
01:51:15,133 --> 01:51:16,775
Ed, no, no, no.

1248
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,783
I'm gonna come with you!

1249
01:51:20,598 --> 01:51:22,048
- Peggy, stay here.
- No! No!

1250
01:51:22,073 --> 01:51:24,467
- Wait in the car with the kids! Wait!
- Janet!

1251
01:51:24,492 --> 01:51:25,965
Janet!

1252
01:51:28,467 --> 01:51:29,706
Get in the car.

1253
01:51:29,731 --> 01:51:32,998
Go in, go on.
You, too, Peggy. Come on!

1254
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,220
Ed?

1255
01:51:43,685 --> 01:51:44,985
Ed?

1256
01:51:52,752 --> 01:51:54,389
Ed?

1257
01:51:54,414 --> 01:51:56,777
No!
Come on!

1258
01:51:58,244 --> 01:51:59,781
Ed!

1259
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,359
It won't open!

1260
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:05,239
Let me try.

1261
01:52:06,821 --> 01:52:08,428
- We need to break it down!
- All right.

1262
01:52:08,453 --> 01:52:09,981
- Wait here.
- Break it!

1263
01:52:11,032 --> 01:52:13,094
Ed, hon, wait right there.

1264
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:14,581
Wait.
Vic will be right back.

1265
01:52:14,606 --> 01:52:16,896
I can't wait.
I'm going on ahead.

1266
01:52:16,921 --> 01:52:18,959
No, Ed, don't!
Stop!

1267
01:52:18,984 --> 01:52:20,933
You can't fight this alone.

1268
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,377
She needs our help!

1269
01:52:25,402 --> 01:52:29,245
Ed, please.
Please, just wait for me.

1270
01:52:29,362 --> 01:52:31,304
Please wait for me.

1271
01:52:38,434 --> 01:52:43,239
I can't lose you.
I am so scared.

1272
01:52:46,021 --> 01:52:47,436
I know.

1273
01:52:48,807 --> 01:52:50,256
Me, too.

1274
01:52:50,633 --> 01:52:52,605
But I have to help her.

1275
01:52:54,008 --> 01:52:56,252
But, what about my vision?

1276
01:52:58,097 --> 01:53:00,786
I know I made a promise to you, hon,

1277
01:53:02,454 --> 01:53:04,346
but I have to do this.

1278
01:53:06,754 --> 01:53:08,439
I love you, Lorraine.

1279
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,635
ED, NO!
NO!

1280
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,439
STOP!
DON'T!

1281
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:16,815
ED!

1282
01:53:17,382 --> 01:53:19,220
No...!

1283
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:20,675
Ed.

1284
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:23,434
No.
Stop.

1285
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:28,758
Ed!
Someone! Help!

1286
01:54:31,427 --> 01:54:33,316
Ahhh!

1287
01:54:37,891 --> 01:54:39,146
Move.

1288
01:54:58,948 --> 01:55:00,363
Oh, God.

1289
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:07,395
Janet, where are you?

1290
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:08,789
Come on!

1291
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:23,995
Help!

1292
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,749
Janet!

1293
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:26,943
Janet!

1294
01:56:26,968 --> 01:56:28,555
Help me!

1295
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:30,029
Janet!

1296
01:56:36,167 --> 01:56:39,664
In the name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1297
01:56:39,907 --> 01:56:42,264
Vade retro Satana.
(Be gone, Satan.)

1298
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:45,141
Sancte Michael Archangele,
(Saint Michael Archangel,)

1299
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:47,511
defende nos in proelio,
(defend us in battle,)

1300
01:56:47,818 --> 01:56:50,486
.

1301
01:56:50,512 --> 01:56:52,148
.

1302
01:56:52,173 --> 01:56:54,434
Te Deum. Te Deum.
(Holy God. Holy God)

1303
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:04,176
What's your name?

1304
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,792
What's your...

1305
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:08,655
What's your name?

1306
01:57:19,044 --> 01:57:20,922
I do know your name.

1307
01:57:21,122 --> 01:57:22,515
I asked you.

1308
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:24,019
Tell me who you are!

1309
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:25,686
And you told me.

1310
01:57:25,985 --> 01:57:28,328
You told me your name.

1311
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:32,479
And I wrote it down.

1312
01:57:37,731 --> 01:57:38,946
I need my Bible!

1313
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:40,836
Why?
What's happening?

1314
01:57:40,861 --> 01:57:42,118
What...

1315
01:57:45,631 --> 01:57:47,715
.

1316
01:57:48,024 --> 01:57:51,297
.

1317
01:57:51,463 --> 01:57:52,865
.

1318
01:57:54,791 --> 01:57:57,299
The demon's name
gives us power over it.

1319
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:01,220
V.

1320
01:58:01,245 --> 01:58:03,484
A.
L.

1321
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:05,785
A.
K.

1322
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:09,544
Valak.

1323
01:58:35,927 --> 01:58:37,421
Janet!

1324
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,048
Janet?

1325
01:58:58,618 --> 01:59:00,874
There was a crooked man

1326
01:59:00,899 --> 01:59:04,046
And he walked a crooked mile

1327
01:59:04,071 --> 01:59:09,706
He found a crooked sixpence
upon a crooked stile

1328
01:59:09,731 --> 01:59:15,215
He bought a crooked cat
which caught a crooked mouse

1329
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:19,923
And they all lived together in a little...

1330
01:59:46,007 --> 01:59:48,806
Vic! Vic!
Let me through.

1331
01:59:48,831 --> 01:59:50,900
- No, wait, Lorraine, let me try.
- I'm going! No!

1332
01:59:50,925 --> 01:59:52,524
Let me go in.
Lorraine!

1333
01:59:52,549 --> 01:59:53,921
Ed!

1334
01:59:54,522 --> 01:59:55,927
Lorraine!

1335
01:59:57,460 --> 01:59:59,073
Lorraine!

1336
02:00:04,184 --> 02:00:05,620
Ed!

1337
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,589
Janet?

1338
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,205
Janet!
No! No!

1339
02:00:49,337 --> 02:00:50,715
I got you.

1340
02:00:51,255 --> 02:00:52,639
Come on.

1341
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,952
No!

1342
02:00:54,492 --> 02:00:55,641
Janet.

1343
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:57,957
Ed!
Ed!

1344
02:00:57,982 --> 02:01:00,298
Ah!
Ah.

1345
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:06,826
Ed!

1346
02:01:13,356 --> 02:01:15,234
Lorraine!

1347
02:01:31,229 --> 02:01:33,141
Ed!

1348
02:01:36,564 --> 02:01:39,561
Your name gives me dominion
over you, demon.

1349
02:01:39,586 --> 02:01:41,856
And I do know your name!

1350
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:46,275
You are Valak!

1351
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:47,953
The defiler.

1352
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:52,050
The profane, the marquis of snakes!

1353
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:56,631
In the name of the Father
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1354
02:01:56,656 --> 02:02:00,087
I condemn you back to hell!

1355
02:02:12,295 --> 02:02:13,731
No!

1356
02:02:14,064 --> 02:02:15,429
Ed!

1357
02:02:18,009 --> 02:02:19,309
Come on!

1358
02:02:19,766 --> 02:02:21,118
Ed!

1359
02:02:22,782 --> 02:02:24,755
- Okay. We're good.
- Oh my God.

1360
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:26,010
Okay.

1361
02:02:26,636 --> 02:02:29,391
- Ed, are you okay?
- Yeah, check on her.

1362
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:30,751
Janet?

1363
02:02:30,993 --> 02:02:33,277
Oh, my God!
Is she all right?

1364
02:02:33,302 --> 02:02:35,123
I'll call an ambulance.

1365
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:37,848
Oh, Janet.
Here darling, sit up.

1366
02:02:37,873 --> 02:02:39,322
Here you go now.

1367
02:02:39,411 --> 02:02:41,319
Take a big, deep breath.

1368
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,926
Big, deep breath.
There you go.

1369
02:02:55,217 --> 02:02:56,842
You all right?

1370
02:03:23,005 --> 02:03:24,738
He'll be fine.

1371
02:03:36,242 --> 02:03:38,795
- Does she look all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1372
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:40,523
You saved her.

1373
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,948
No.

1374
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:45,625
You saved us.

1375
02:03:47,125 --> 02:03:49,570
Didn't I tell you
it was meant to be?

1376
02:03:51,916 --> 02:03:54,037
But you believed in me.

1377
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,420
I couldn't have done it without you.

1378
02:04:10,325 --> 02:04:12,789
Thanks for coming back for us.

1379
02:04:12,814 --> 02:04:14,224
Oh.

1380
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:16,167
Aw.

1381
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:20,035
Here, sit down.
Sit down.

1382
02:04:25,715 --> 02:04:27,084
You know...

1383
02:04:28,381 --> 02:04:33,232
This has kept me safe
since I was a kid.

1384
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:36,393
I want you to have it.

1385
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,791
And, when you grow up,

1386
02:04:44,214 --> 02:04:47,376
you find someone who needs it,
you give it to them.

1387
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:50,108
Deal?

1388
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,392
I'm so lucky.

1389
02:04:59,692 --> 02:05:03,470
You said one person
could change everything.

1390
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:05,599
But...

1391
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,794
I've got two.

1392
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,607
Oh.

1393
02:06:18,304 --> 02:06:19,819
Okay.

1394
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:52,716
Tell me about the beginning,
the first night of your happening.

1395
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:56,256
- What was your brother doing?
- Brothers playing and fooling about.

1396
02:07:56,281 --> 02:07:57,800
I wasn't quite sure, no.

1397
02:07:57,825 --> 02:08:00,051
- They were scared?
- Yeah, petrified.

1398
02:08:00,076 --> 02:08:01,988
Janet?
What about Janet?

1399
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:06,648
When it comes from your area, Janet,
do you feel anything in your throat?

1400
02:08:06,673 --> 02:08:09,135
- No.
- You just don't feel anything?

1401
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:10,859
Now, I'm looking at Janet.

1402
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,359
Don't fight in here.

1403
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,759
And the voice comes from her,

1404
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,460
but her mouth doesn't move
and nothing moves.

1405
02:08:15,485 --> 02:08:16,817
Turn it off!

1406
02:08:16,842 --> 02:08:17,911
I know...

1407
02:08:17,936 --> 02:08:21,279
Janet, can you tell when
the voice is gonna come through you?

1408
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,409
No.
No, I don't ever.

1409
02:08:23,434 --> 02:08:25,273
You know who I am?
Do you know what my name is?

1410
02:08:25,298 --> 02:08:27,997
Yeah.
Ed. Ed!

1411
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:34,249
Were you... Were you a Christian?

1412
02:08:34,274 --> 02:08:36,656
No!
You know it!

1413
02:08:36,681 --> 02:08:38,552
What year did you die?
Do you remember?
