1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,605
Mars surface ops,
this is Houston. We're go for data.

2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,943
Copy, Houston. Base pedal
temp good. Remote pedal actuator good.

3
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:31,489
Probe primary and auxiliary
transponders a-okay.

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,117
Shunt voltage three zero.

5
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:39,205
D.S.N. uplink rate is now 61.101.

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,374
Copy. We'll see if we
can better that for you.

7
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,543
This is the probe's

8
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,879
We need all the data we can get.

9
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:51,009
Uh, standby.
We're getting a low current level here.

10
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,679
Voltage is down to, uh, 185.

11
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,475
Here's our rock, fellas. One-one-niner.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,727
-Beautiful.
-There it is again. There it is again.

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,064
Voltage down to 113.

14
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,232
-Can you repo the solar arrays?
- Uh, negative.

15
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,568
M.P.C. load is critical.

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,820
-Mars surface ops,
we're losing the signal.

17
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,990
-We're losing the signal here!

18
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:19,079
Roger that.
Transmission terminated.

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,082
-Well, people, congratulations.

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,543
We collected data
on over a dozen new rocks.

21
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:30,674
I'd say this was five years
and three trillion dollars well spent!

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,597
Come on, gentlemen, keep up with me.
I want an exclusive...

23
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,766
with that policeman who was
in the Santa Barbara shootout.

24
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,810
-I'll take it.
-Glad you could make it, O'Hara.

25
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,479
Prescott, it's yours.
Take Harrison and camera car five.

26
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,815
I want it for the 6:00.
It's no good at 10:00. You got that?

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,818
-It's no good at 10:00.
-What are you, a parrot? Get movin'.

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,447
I want footage of that 1st Monument Bank
that got knocked off down in Oxnard.

29
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,490
-I'm all over it.
-Van Gundy?

30
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,743
-Sir!
-And get that security camera's
videotape, you got that?

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,995
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-No tape, no story.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,748
You got it, boss.
Whatever you say, boss.

33
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:49,169
I like Van Gundy.
I need something on that
shuttle launch tonight at Vandenberg.

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,671
-Well, that's me.
I know Vandenberg, chief.
-Chief?

35
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,299
Who are you, Clark Kent?
FFelix, it's yours.

36
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,843
Get interviews
with all the top brass involved.

37
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,096
Oh, take Brace with you. It's a good
story for her to cut her teeth on.

38
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,017
Brace? Are you sure? Because I usually
produce Brace's on-camera segments.

39
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,854
We're a team. I mean, we're more
than a team. Brace and I are-

40
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,565
You and my daughter are what?

41
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,615
-Um, nothing.
-That's right.

42
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,534
I didn't send Brace to all those
fancy English boarding schools...

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,996
to wind up with the likes of you.

44
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,209
Oh, O'Hara, I've got something here
that's right up your alley.

45
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,545
A senior citizens' tanning contest
being held tomorrow at Sunset Pier.

46
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,674
The Hawaiian Tropic Senior
Cocoa Butter Classic.

47
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,218
-Huh?

48
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,470
I want footage
of all the old farts baking,

49
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:45,016
an interview with the doctor on
the dangers of sunbathing, yadda, yadda.

50
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,813
Something to fill time
if my idiot weatherman runs short.

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,193
Mr. Channing? Mr. Channing?
Excuse me. Sir?

52
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,240
You hired me because I had ten years'
experience as a newspaper reporter.

53
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,244
Now, I will go to the ends of the Earth
to bring you a great story.

54
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,414
But I need the chance.

55
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:12,502
You know, Tim, when I look at you,
I see myself at your age.

56
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,422
-Really?
-And I was a moron!

57
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,925
-Huh.
-But you got a lot of nerve,
O'Hara, and I like that.

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,594
Sometimes.
Okay, it's yours.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,055
-B-B-B-But you said-
-Shut up, Felix.

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,391
You won't- You won't regret this, sir.
You really won't.

61
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,854
O'Hara! You screw up this Vandenberg
thing, you're fired. Is that clear?

62
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,190
Yeah.
Crystal.

63
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,276
Attention, all personnel.

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,570
We are T minus five minutes
and counting.

65
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,448
We're here at the Vandenberg Air Force
Base, where for the first time,

66
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,034
-Cut. Brace?
-the shuttle Atlantis
will be launched...

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,953
-Sweetie, could we lose the gum?
-Billy!

68
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,039
Excuse me, Sergeant.

69
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,124
-I love show business.

70
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,460
Yeah, okay. Everybody back
to one, please. Here we go.

71
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:58,590
Same thing.
In five, four, three, two-

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,633
We're here at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

73
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,053
-We're here
at Vandenberg Air Force Base,
-Where just minutes from now,

74
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,057
where just minutes from now,
the shuttle Atlantis will be
launching for the first time...

75
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,142
-on the west coast.
-I understand that Project Deadhead...

76
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:13,480
I understand that Project Deadhead
is carrying a sophisticated satellite...

77
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,233
-to study the Fiona comet.
-to study the Fiona comet.

78
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes, the satellite has
a specialized guidance system...

79
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,782
which will allow it to pass
closer to the comet than ever before.

80
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,825
Yeah, yeah.
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,119
What?

82
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,414
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

83
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,126
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

84
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,421
-Well, yes, actually.
-Yes!

85
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,174
Project Deadhead
gets its name from the fact...

86
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,844
that its payload includes
the ashes of famous rocker...

87
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,013
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.

88
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,182
How in the world
did you know that?

89
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,018
-It's my job to know that.
-It's my job to know these things.

90
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,688
Well.

91
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,668
-Okay, Lizzie, go to Brace.

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,379
All right, Brace, here we go.
The big wrap-up.

93
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,632
-And so, on this the night
of the Fiona Comet,
-And so, on this,

94
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,385
the night of the Fiona Comet,
our thoughts turn...

95
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,888
to that satellite's only passenger-
Jerry Garcia.

96
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,184
-I'm Brace Channing-
-I'm Brace Channing for KGSC.

97
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,520
-Thank you, Captain Dalton.
-Thank you.

98
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:40,066
-God, you're beautiful.
-God, you're beautiful.

99
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,696
-Thank you. So are you.

100
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,865
And we're out.

101
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,077
-Tim, I'd like a word with you.
-And I'm dead.

102
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,915
-Colonel?
-Yes?

103
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,419
-You might want to take
a look at this, sir.
-The Fiona Comet?

104
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,589
-So what?
-It's changing direction, sir.

105
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,759
That's impossible. Are you sure it's not
the trajectory of our own satellite?

106
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,429
Yes, sir. Uh, the comet's
just changed direction again, sir.

107
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,848
-It's gotta be the equipment.
-I've got down line confirmation.

108
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,018
No, sir. Our backup computers
verify all systems go.

109
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,937
It's- It's coming down, sir.

110
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,941
-The satellite?
-No, sir. The comet.

111
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,110
Okay, let's go to general alert.

112
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,196
-Major, scramble the F-16s.
-Yes, sir!

113
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,365
-Sergeant, get SETI group on the line.
-Copy that.

114
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,534
Showtime, boys.
We got ourselves a U.F.O.

115
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,246
Excuse me.

116
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,708
-What's this?
-It's Capt. Dalton's telephone number.

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,795
Well, he's not really my type, but-

118
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,464
-You made me look such an idiot.
-Brace, come on.

119
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,634
-Let me explain.
-Just wait until I tell my daddy.

120
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,303
-No, Br- Brace, come on!
-Billy!

121
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,389
-Wait a minute! Look, I-
-Nice knowin' ya.

122
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,100
Ooh-hoo.
Let us know where you end up.

123
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,769
-It wasn't a complete disaster.

124
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,105
Oh, compared to what?

125
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,148
-The Hindenburg?

126
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,984
Titanic.
I'm sorry, pal.

127
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,404
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

128
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,656
Sorry.

129
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,127
The blues kept knockin'
upon my door

130
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,129
-Get your nose up! Pull up!

131
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,173
I said up, not out of joint!

132
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,510
We're goin' down!

133
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,847
-Mayday! Mayday!
-Oh, not another ticket.

134
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,860
-Whoa!

135
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,050
-Aaah!

136
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,886
Are you crazy?
You could have totalled my car!

137
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,971
-Did you see it? Did you see it?
-See what?

138
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,140
There was a crash. A plane or some-

139
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,225
It was like a stealth fighter!
I don't know!

140
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:23,063
-It happened so fast!
-Oh, my God, a plane crash!

141
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,566
Well, that's terrible!
We don't even have any video!

142
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,319
Good! It's over here.

143
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,072
- Tim, wait for me!
-Humans.

144
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,451
-Wait, not so fast!
It's my story too, remember?

145
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,251
- What was that?
- Hmm? What was what?

146
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,837
It was this flicker, this-
this light that-

147
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,840
-Never mind.
-What, Tim?

148
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,927
Tim, wait!
Oh, my heel!

149
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,846
These are really expensive shoes,
you know!

150
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,437
Come on, Tim, where is it?

151
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,691
It was this huge thing!
It was this-

152
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,444
You know, it's really creepy out here.

153
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,781
Ow!

154
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,577
Tim?

155
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,540
-You've got 30 seconds and I'm leaving!
-Hmm.

156
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,550
-Look at this.
- What's that?

157
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,261
I don't know.
I-I- I don't know.

158
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,223
-Is this your idea of a joke?
-No, I swear to you- look at-
I mean, this thing was huge.

159
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,227
Oh, really? And I thought
you were one of the normal ones!

160
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,313
-I am one of the normal ones, normally.

161
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,774
Ha ha ha.

162
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,486
Nice try, Tim.

163
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,615
You and me, alone on the beach, on
the night of a lunar eclipse, no less.

164
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,660
-I didn't make this up!
-Keep this as a memento
of our last date.

165
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,329
Last date?
We haven't even had our first date!

166
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,999
-Well, consider this both.

167
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,835
-Brace? Brace!

168
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,301
Ahh.

169
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:20,388
Nurplex.
Ay-yi-yi-yi mmm!

170
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,157
Humans.

171
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,160
-Come on, come on, come on.

172
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:50,669
-Savages!

173
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,670
-Tim!
-Aaah! Mrs. Brown.

174
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,506
-Too much lipstick?
-Uh, well,

175
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,092
no, no, no, no.

176
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,387
No, it's just that you, uh...

177
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,597
kind of appeared, that's all.

178
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,933
I saved you some
of my special brownies.

179
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,269
Mrs. Brown, brownies. Get it?

180
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,354
-Yes! That's good.
-There you go.

181
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,940
-Thank you very much.
- Did you see the eclipse?

182
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,901
Wasn't it très magnifique?

183
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,279
-Those French tapes are really
paying off, aren't they?
-Oh, you noticed.

184
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,614
-Thanks for the brownies, Mrs. Brown.

185
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,243
Oh, Tim.
I wanted to remind you...

186
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,954
about the charity rummage sale
this weekend.

187
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,790
If you have anything
you want to donate, leave it
in the garage and I'll pick it up.

188
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,251
Well, trust me, this will be
right on top of the pile.

189
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,921
-Ahh.
-Good night, Mrs. Brown.

190
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:21,259
One more thing I wanted to tell you,
Tim! Oh, good night, Tim!

191
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,902
I'm havin' a bad night.

192
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,780
I couldn't agree with ya
more completely.

193
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,241
-Shut up.
-How do you do it?

194
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,495
-O'Hara here. Please leave a message.
Make it short.

195
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,249
-Channing here. You're fired.

196
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,627
-Short enough for ya?

197
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,922
What more can I say?
When you're right, you're right!

198
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,409
Hmm.

199
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,472
Stay where you are, little Earth man,

200
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,683
and no harm will come to you.

201
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,228
Say, I wish I'd thought of that!

202
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:59,065
- Hello?
-What more can I say?
When you're right, you're right!

203
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,693
-Be silent.
-How do you do it?

204
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,362
I thought I told you to shut up.

205
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,990
I couldn't agree with you more-

206
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,576
You leave me no choice.

207
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,912
Who's there?
I got a gun!

208
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:30,013
Static.

209
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:50,742
-Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

210
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,119
-Hey! -That's it, Earthling!

211
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:57,749
-It's alive!

212
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,086
Hyah!

213
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,589
Okay, you wanna play games?

214
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,635
-Slide through.
-I must be going... nuts.

215
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,389
One strike, no balls.

216
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,642
Over here, Tiger Woods.

217
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,936
Aaah!

218
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:23,108
-Hey, look- Jimmy Hoffa.
-Leisure suit from hell!

219
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,448
-I'm gonna...
-Ohh!

220
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,617
mutilate you!

221
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,624
Come on!
Show your face... if you have one.

222
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,089
Where- Where'd he go?

223
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:53,680
What the heck
was in those brownies?

224
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,349
When dealing with primitive life-forms,

225
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,310
sometimes one must
resort to primitive acts.

226
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,313
-Are you okay, Zoot?

227
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,692
If you don't mind my asking,
where were you?
This alien was trying to kill me!

228
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,485
Don't be such a wet blanket.

229
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,655
Wait a minute.
Leave my mother out of this!

230
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,824
It's your fault we ended up
on this no-good, carbon-based,

231
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,952
-over-oxygenated,
miserable excuse of a-

232
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,204
- Tim?
-Oh, no. It's another one!

233
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,041
I know you're not asleep yet.

234
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,335
Tim, it's Lizzie!

235
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,712
Blotz! It's Lizzie!

236
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,797
What's a Lizzie?

237
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,717
I would say a Model T Ford,
but this one has better tires.

238
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:34,387
-Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!
-I know what a woman is,
but what do I do with it?

239
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,016
Help, Mr. Lifeguard, I'm drowning.
I need mouth-to-mouth.

240
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,477
Ugh, saliva exchange.

241
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,229
I would never partake
in such an unsanitary interaction.

242
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,690
There must be some other way
to greet a female and then be rid of it.

243
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,734
-Tim!

244
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,153
If it was me, I'd be he.

245
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,365
-Tim, please.
-Good thinking, Zoot.

246
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,178
Okay, Tim,
I'm picking up the hide-a-key.

247
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,142
-Gonna open the door.

248
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,522
-Tim?
-Lizzie!

249
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,774
My dear friend or family member.

250
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,276
Uh, oh, my gosh.

251
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,279
Oh, inappropriate.

252
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:38,451
-Oh, boy.
- I told you
they cover their flingdat here.

253
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,579
Lizzie, my dear friend
or family member.

254
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,832
You sound funny.
Are you catching a cold?

255
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,126
A cold, a virus? Yes.

256
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,670
A contagious
bubonic plague. You better leave.

257
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,464
What? What in the world-

258
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,634
Are- Are you a Trekkie?

259
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,762
Uh, yes, I am.

260
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,306
Okay, what's going on?

261
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,184
-What's going on?
-Tim, are you okay?

262
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,603
-You don't seem like yourself.
-Oh, I'm Tim, all right.

263
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,815
-Tim O'Hara, no reason to doubt it.
-Uh, what's going on?

264
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,317
Lots.

265
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,075
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

266
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,833
-Lizzie.
-Yeah?

267
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,961
If you're my sister,
an explanation is in order.

268
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,214
Yeah.

269
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,967
-Does this mean that you and I are-
-Indeed.

270
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,804
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do, and you...
-What?

271
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,015
-need...to go.
-Huh?

272
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,226
Wha-

273
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,191
-Human emotions.
-Crazy monkeys.

274
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,095
Welcome, sir.

275
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,890
Where's Coleye?

276
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:28,228
Examining mucus-type protoplasm.

277
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,273
Hmm. It's saline-based.

278
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,277
Good God, Coleye,
put that on a slide next time.

279
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,739
I want this stuff analyzed
and the cigarette dusted for prints.

280
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:43,952
-I want to know whose this was.
-There's more, sir.

281
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:49,082
Quadroped becomes... biped?

282
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,085
It must have taken human form!

283
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,587
The footprints stop at the road.

284
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,715
We think someone
may have picked them up.

285
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,217
Evidence of a crash,

286
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,803
no spaceship and alien
in human form?

287
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,431
It's just like the incident of '64!

288
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,058
Keep your mouth shut, you idiot.

289
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,436
That incident is not only classified,

290
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,147
but it never happened, you got it?

291
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:16,067
-Yes, sir.
-Once again, we have no alien, no U.F.O.

292
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,445
If you can't get me either one,

293
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,572
then you'd better start
looking for another job.

294
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,324
Well, you heard him! Move it!
It's out there somewhere!

295
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,452
-So, move it! Go! Move!
-Yes, sir!

296
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:29,622
And God help the poor soul...

297
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,083
who picked him up.

298
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,181
Silence, subculturer!

299
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,477
-Let me down!
-Look what you did to me. Barbarian!

300
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,812
-Let me down!
-As you wish!

301
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,031
For a thief,
you are extremely clumsy.

302
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,659
-Thief? I'm not a thief.
-So I see.

303
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,662
Tim O'Hara.
You are a reporter.

304
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,332
Reporter? No.
I'm a producer, pal!

305
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,710
-Let me tell ya, I- Aaah!

306
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,673
Look, I didn't steal anything, okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.

307
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,342
-All right, all right.

308
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,512
No! No!

309
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:28,682
Warning, Tim O'Hara. Any attempt
to expose me will be useless.

310
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:37,524
-I think we use more than ten.
-Your astronauts
pee in their space suits.

311
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,652
Case closed.

312
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,075
Okay. Okay, just-

313
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,877
Whoa!

314
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:07,554
Okay, it's just a dream.
It's a very bad dream.

315
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,684
Just- Come on.
Wake up. Wake up!

316
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,270
What's with that?

317
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:19,566
-I believe it's called
a nervous breakdown.
-Last night did not happen.

318
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,861
-I don't believe in aliens.
-I heard that!

319
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,573
To us, you are the alien.

320
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,409
If you must know,
I am from the planet you call Mars.

321
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:33,580
-And what, I'm from Uranus? I never-
-I was getting to you!

322
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,790
Don't get a crease in your Sputnik.

323
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,084
Please,
just introduce me to monkey boy.

324
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:42,255
This is my Zoot.

325
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,925
-A polymorphous Zootenex 3,000.
-Just look, don't touch.

326
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,429
-Your suit talks?
- Incessantly.

327
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,473
Corduroys talk,
nobody gives them grief.

328
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,600
- Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
-Mars? Wait a minute.

329
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:57,562
There's no life on Mars.
We've sent probes.

330
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:01,232
I'd try to explain it, but you people
still think "E" equals "MC" squared.

331
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:05,445
-You're still trying to
analyze our rocks. Ha-ha!

332
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,115
Oh! Blasted sand particles.

333
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,410
They've completely crystallized
the vortex generator.

334
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,954
-Hey, do you mind?
- Tim!

335
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,790
-Now what?

336
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,250
-Thank God, an eyewitness.
-Eyewitness? Negative.

337
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:23,463
-You must tell no one.
-No offence, but your ship is
double-parked in my living room.

338
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,007
You're the biggest story
in the history of mankind!

339
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,802
There is intelligent life
out there in the universe!

340
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,637
I hope you're not including yourself
in that statement!

341
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,473
Tim, listen, I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

342
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,517
but I got a hold of your mail,
and I wanted-

343
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,187
Could you just- please, come here.
Take a look at that!

344
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,190
Aaah!

345
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:47,153
Tim, you definitely need a maid!
Oh, hello!

346
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:54,285
-Greetings.
-Oh, I'm sorry to catch you
in your... pyjamas.

347
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,039
-Pyjamas? - Where's the spaceship?

348
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,667
- Spaceship?
-Right here.

349
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,712
Oh, for the rummage sale!
Does it come with an action figure?

350
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,715
-You're looking at him.
-Oh. I don't believe we've met.

351
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,843
-No, don't touch him! He's a Martian.
-Tim, what's going on?

352
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,886
-I beg your- Mart- Martin?

353
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,514
-Yes. Martin.
-No, no, no, no!

354
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,017
-He's a- uh-
-Uncle!

355
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:20,353
-Martin.
-Oh.

356
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,523
-Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
-He turns invisible, okay?

357
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,567
His suit talks-
he's got a talking suit.

358
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,694
He's got these things that
pop out of his head- You just-

359
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,196
-Show her. Go ahead.
Come on, give her the finger.
-Tim!

360
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:34,701
No, I didn't mean that.
I don't know what I mean. Forget it.

361
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,746
You'll have to forgive Tim, Mrs. Brown.
He lost his job last night,

362
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,873
and he's experiencing
a nervous breakdown.

363
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,083
Oh, poor dear.

364
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,210
-I hope it doesn't affect the rent.

365
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,213
-Don't worry,
I'm here to look after him.
-Ha!

366
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,176
He's very lucky to have
an uncle like you in his life, Martin.

367
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,055
And you, Mrs. Brown,
are like a brilliant quasar
in the black hole of my day.

368
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,350
Oh! Call me Lorelei.

369
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,269
Lorelei.
The sound of...

370
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:05,398
pure mountain spring water
from the centre of the Earth.

371
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,151
Oh, my.

372
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,286
Oh!

373
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,956
I obviously misconstrued a custom.
I apologize.

374
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:25,418
I'm from... New York.

375
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:28,380
No, actually, it's- It's fine.

376
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:32,092
It's perfect. 

377
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:35,053
-Oh, brother.
-Oh, Martin?

378
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,097
Yes, Lorelei?

379
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:43,103
Um, Mr. Brown... passed away
several years ago.

380
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:48,108
-I thought you might like to know that.
-Hmm.

381
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,903
Au revoir.

382
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,947
Hmm?

383
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,491
Just for the record,
a handshake will do for me.

384
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,618
You think that I actually enjoyed...

385
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,787
tasting that female's exoskeleton?

386
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:04,791
I merely used my data on
your primitive species to determine...

387
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,252
the optimum way
to avoid suspicion.

388
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,922
-Yeah, but what's the optimum
way to get home?
- Blotz!

389
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:15,427
I don't know, Zoot. Where on this
barbaric swamp of a planet...

390
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:18,763
can we find the makings
of an electron accelerator?

391
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,808
-Maybe your new girlfriend has one.
-Oh, that's very funny.

392
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,270
Excuse me. Fellas,
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

393
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:30,483
I-I, you know, I think I might be able
to help you find that electron thing.

394
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,277
We're toast.

395
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,113
I don't believe this.
You really think you can...

396
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,157
repair your ship
with all this junk?

397
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,534
Everything has been carefully chosen
for its potential to fashion...

398
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,162
a crude vortex electron accelerator.

399
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:45,206
Except for this.
A pooper scooper.

400
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,001
I have no idea what it does,
but it's fascinating.

401
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:52,630
Excuse me. Where are your
nuclear implosion couplers?

402
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,091
For a garden hose?

403
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,846
I'm never going to get off
this infernal planet.

404
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,140
The I.Q. of a pancake.

405
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,225
You're right. Humans are truly
the amoebas of the universe!

406
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,895
Yeah, this from a guy
who talks to his tin foil suit.

407
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,065
-Hey, what was that for?
-It wasn't me, it was Zoot.

408
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,235
-Come here a sec.

409
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,030
Listen, you've been on Earth,
what, all of ten minutes?

410
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,532
-It's not so bad here.
- That's what Neenurt said.

411
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:23,536
-Who?
-Exactly. One of my planet's
most gifted scientists,

412
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,206
and now he's gone without a trace.

413
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:30,043
He arrived on Earth in 1964,
and, I presume, was abducted
by your government.

414
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,253
I shudder to think what they did to him
in the name of science.

415
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,591
-What are they laughing at?
- Hey, space man!

416
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,719
-I've been discovered!

417
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,347
-Sorry about that.

418
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,099
-Oh, my-
-What happened?

419
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,434
They don't know anything.
They were just making fun of your-

420
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,938
Making fun. I'm one of
the best-dressed beings on my planet.

421
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,065
Yo, Elvis! Nice suit.

422
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,403
Well, Dorothy, I hate to tell you this,
but you're not in Kansas any more.

423
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:58,571
That's great.
The minute I turn my back,

424
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:01,074
you're getting into
someone else's pants!

425
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,202
I need to blend in,
and you stand out like a putt
stick at a blackbell convention.

426
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,246
I should have known
by the way you've been gawking...

427
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,415
at every T-shirt
and sweat pant we pass.

428
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,793
-Don't come apart at the seams!
-Why is Zoot always the last to know?

429
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,254
-All right, all right, all right!

430
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,133
-Martian footage, take one.
-Zoot, this is tearing me apart too.

431
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,052
I know I'm not what I used to be.

432
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,930
I mean, a stretch mark here,
a line stain there.

433
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,772
-Hey!
-Pervert!

434
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,900
It's not safe
for a woman around here!

435
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,986
I'm ready to blend in now.

436
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,910
-Outstanding.
-Martin, that outfit looks ridic-

437
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,663
-Stylin', bro!
-Thanks, bro.

438
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,790
Real cool.

439
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,834
I've got the touch on two planets.

440
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,253
I gotta get out more.
How did your Zoot take the-

441
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:57,630
Zoot, he's highly intelligent.
He understands.

442
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:01,134
Aaaah!
You used me, you buttonhole!

443
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:05,305
-Go and have your fling.
Colours fade! You'll see!

444
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,766
-Hello?
-Huh? Oh, incoming.

445
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,518
Hello?
Man.

446
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,980
Oh, geez!

447
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,816
Talk about a tacky suit!

448
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,818
-Tacky, huh?

449
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,698
Hey! Hey! What?

450
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:29,204
-Now turn the other cheek.
-Ow! Hey!

451
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,874
-Catch you later, Spanky.

452
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,464
All right, I'm bustin' out!

453
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,549
-There.
-Go ahead, try 'em all on.

454
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,011
See if I care.
Whoa!

455
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,682
If love is a crime, lock me up!

456
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,811
I'm guilty.
Look at her.

457
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,480
A perfect size six,

458
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:59,150
and never been worn!

459
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:03,530
Darling, don't speak.
Just come to me. 

460
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:07,367
Oh, this is crazy.
I'm a polymorph, and you're a polyester.

461
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:10,412
Yes, you're synthetic,
but I like that in a girl!

462
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,164
Give me some thread, baby!

463
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,543
-Oh, what's this, Velcro? Ohh!
-Zoot!

464
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,379
Ah! No, thank you, little girl,
I don't want to buy any cookies!

465
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:22,841
You lecherous leotard!
Have you no shame?

466
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,052
Look who's talking,
Mr. Clothes Horse!

467
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:30,098
Now, in you go, or you'll take
a long walk on a short hanger.

468
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,225
Coming in for a landing!
Flaps down!

469
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,187
-I said bag it, mister!

470
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,691
All right, all right, you don't
have to throw me in the hamper.

471
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,488
Dork.

472
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,910
-Next time, the dry cleaner.
-Bite these.

473
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,913
You- Blasted nurplex!

474
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,460
Oh, Venus, Neptune!

475
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,087
-Help me, Tim!
-Mm-hmm.

476
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,923
Tim, it's a little blue one!

477
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:06,634
No!
Give me that,

478
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,304
you age-impaired little blotz.

479
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,431
Mine! Gum!

480
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,768
-Mine! Nurplex!

481
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,320
Why wouldn't you give
the kid a piece of gum?

482
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,907
Okay, sure, right.
Here, have one.

483
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,242
-Come on, let's go. No, no, come on.
-What are you doing?

484
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,453
-What are you doing?
-Trust me.

485
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:35,413
-Not the finger! Don't do the finger!
-Try some.

486
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,832
-Why?
-You don't want to try Martian gum?

487
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:42,087
-No, not particularly.
-Afraid, Earthling?

488
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,805
You know what, that is not bad.

489
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,810
-The centre's got
a nice little zing to it.
-Notice anything different?

490
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,646
Hmm, no.
No, not really.

491
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,941
What time do you have?

492
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,984
Aaaah!

493
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,113
Aaaah!

494
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:11,324
-Spit, spit, spit.

495
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,666
-Everything okay in there?

496
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:23,545
-Zipper trouble.
-Yeeow.

497
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,509
This "gum", as you call,
allows me to take on the outward
appearance of a human being.

498
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,636
On you, it has the reverse effect.

499
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:34,723
Oh, so that's what you
really look like.

500
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,851
Don't be disgusting.
That was Fluvian Nurplex.

501
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,854
-Oh.
-We carry many different planets.

502
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:46,026
If you think that was bad,
this is Veenox Seven.

503
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:50,155
-Oh, well, that's-
-Don't ever mess with a Veenox Seven.

504
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,950
When it comes to Veenox Seven,
just say no.

505
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,373
Me man got fire

506
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:03,209
Me so on fire
feeling hot, hot, hot

507
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:06,087
All right, come on, the rest of you,
come on up on stage!

508
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:09,591
The sun, while you can get it.
The sand, the surf.

509
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,677
Usually, the beach conjures up
images of our youth,

510
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:17,015
but come on down to Sunset Pier today,
and your contraceptions of-

511
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,225
-Preconceptions!
-Contraceptions.

512
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,186
-Preconceptions!
-Felix!

513
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,605
I said preconceptions!
I swear, preconceptions!

514
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,233
-Billy! Billy!
-Preconceptions!
I know I said preconceptions!

515
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,403
I should listen to my parents
and be a doctor. I hate this!

516
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,073
-Ooh!

517
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:35,909
-Are we still rolling?
-Nobody said "cut."

518
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,787
-Feeling hot, hot, hot
-What do you think?

519
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:40,914
I think your bathing suit
should have a top.

520
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,541
Cut! Cut! Cut!

521
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,128
-Felix!

522
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,589
Felix is toast.

523
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,384
If Tim doesn't get here soon,
we could all be looking for work.

524
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:01,559
Wait here.

525
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,603
What is the meaning
of this divergence?

526
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,648
-I gotta see some friends.
-Negative! Exclamation point.

527
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,484
We're wasting valuable time.
My ship must-

528
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:13,238
Look at that!

529
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,448
Do you have any idea
how fortunate you are?

530
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:18,660
The only water we get back on Mars
has to be squeezed from rocks.

531
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:22,080
-Well, surf's up, dude.
-Tim, I'm so glad you came.

532
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,791
-Hurricane Brace hit again.
-Oh, okay. Uh, Martin?

533
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,127
-I gotta go. I'll be right-
-Lizzie!

534
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,629
How nice to see you again.

535
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,674
-Have we met?
-Of course!

536
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,969
Not. How nice to see you again
for the first time.

537
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,680
I'm Tim's Uncle Martin.

538
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:43,852
-Oh, I-

539
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,064
-I, uh-

540
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:55,321
-What was that?
-I must find nourishment.

541
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,158
-That came from your stomach?
-Stomachs.

542
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,494
Oh, he is- He is such a kidder.

543
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,830
Listen, I'll be with you
in couple minutes, okay?

544
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,499
You just- I'll be right over.
Tell her to-

545
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:09,336
We gotta get you- ah!

546
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,884
Excuse me, could I have
a double dip-

547
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,386
actually, make that a triple dip,
chocolate chip, please.

548
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:22,223
-Yes, sir.
-Tim, I need nourishment,
not coloured buckets of frozen lard.

549
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,518
Look, this is very
nutritious food here on Earth.
We eat this for breakfast.

550
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:29,147
Tim, you don't need to try poison
to know that it kills.

551
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:32,317
Here, take this.

552
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,028
Give me five minutes, okay?
I have to go to the news van.

553
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:38,156
Blecch!

554
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,701
- Felix!
-I said "preconceptions", I swear!
Preconceptions!

555
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:45,747
You unprofessional little man!
All you have to do is come up
with the dumb things I say!

556
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:53,380
-Billy!
-Brace! Brace!

557
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:57,217
-You'd rate this tantrum?
-About a seven-five on the Brace scale.

558
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:02,097
-I'll talk to Felix.
-You never told me about your uncle.

559
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,766
Are you-

560
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:08,728
Look, I'm glad you beeped me. We really
need to talk. This is really big.

561
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,272
-I know.
-You do?

562
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,733
Yes. Look, I've been thinking, and...

563
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,696
our friendship really means a lot to me,
and I don't want to screw that up.

564
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,073
-Okay.
-So I think it would be better...

565
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:24,244
if we just pretended that nothing
ever happened between us last night.

566
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,205
-What happened last night?
-Exactly!

567
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,582
I'm not sure I understand what-

568
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,710
Me either.

569
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,968
I guess we're both a little confused,
huh, Tim?

570
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,808
-Easy, easy.

571
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:50,645
I thought you were her. She's terrible,
Tim. How did you last so long?

572
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,772
She's a little high-maintenance,
but she's okay.

573
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:57,610
-Oh, lust is blind.
-Do we still have that hidden camera
stuff somewhere?

574
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:02,073
You're sitting on it.
Why?

575
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,784
-Here, let me help you with this.
-Would you please?

576
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,787
-These words are way too big.
-Huh? Humidity?

577
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,498
-Hot.
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.

578
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,917
Wave for everybody!

579
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:17,964
By God, if I were only 40 years older,
I'd be right there with 'em!

580
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,677
- Miss Channing?
-Hmm?

581
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,389
-Could I have a word with you, please?
-Okay.

582
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:31,561
I've already signed it.

583
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:35,315
Come on, who are you guys, huh?

584
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:49,204
Okay, guys, you're all set.

585
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,331
-Where's Brace?
-I don't know. She took off.

586
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:53,833
She quit!
And her dad gonna blame me!

587
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,169
Hey, what's going on
over there?

588
00:38:56,294 --> 00:39:00,173
-Uh, Billy, put that in my car.

589
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,467
-I gotta go.
-Call me!

590
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,678
Martin!

591
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,358
-I like it!
-Martin!

592
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:26,491
Tim, you're here!
You've got to save me from myself!

593
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:32,038
It's intoxicating.
Ooh, cookie dough!

594
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:36,042
-I need to get you back to the home!

595
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,878
All they give him there is Jell-O.
There we go.

596
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:45,510
Cookie dough!

597
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:02,318
Martian footage, take two.

598
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:14,039
-Chubby Hubby hangover, huh?

599
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,085
I swear, I'll never
touch that stuff again.

600
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,088
One scoop's too many,
and a million aren't enough!

601
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:25,425
So, how's it coming, anyway?

602
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,719
Oh, I converted a blow dryer,
two elastic bands...

603
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,889
and an Acme Bug-Away insect bomb...

604
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,932
into a temporary electron accelerator.

605
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,435
-Is it working?
-Not at all, but on the positive side,

606
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,604
your garage is now cockroach-free.

607
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:40,315
Blasted rental!

608
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,817
-This is a rental, is it?
-My regular ship is in the shop...

609
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:45,445
for its mid-millennium tune-up.

610
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,073
Where's your, uh, you know,
your suit, Zoot... thing.

611
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:51,451
Oh ho, washing up.

612
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:54,120
-Owwww! Spin me, mama!

613
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,998
So nice, so good

614
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:59,459
Five more minutes, Zoot,
then into the dryer.

615
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:02,796
You're bringing me down, man!

616
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:07,258
What I wouldn't give
to shed this grotesque human facade...

617
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:11,304
and let the cool Earth waters
caress my Martian skin.

618
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:14,766
-Oh!
-So why don't you?

619
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,310
Why not, indeed?

620
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,313
-Move over, Zoot!
-Martin, I meant-

621
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:23,441
I meant out in the hot tub, out back.
It would be private, by yourself.

622
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,653
You mean spit out my Nurplex...

623
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,155
and revert to Martian form
right outside your domicile?

624
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,826
-Exactly.
-Oh, do you think that's safe?

625
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,328
Oh, yes, of course it's safe.

626
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:38,039
-I'll do it!
-Good. Let's go.

627
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,125
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

628
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,502
-Tim? Thanks.
-Yeah?

629
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,546
It's just a hot tub, Martin.
No big deal.

630
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,673
I don't mean just that.
I know I must have...

631
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,968
created complete havoc with your
simple life since the moment I arrived.

632
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:53,555
Anyway, I just wanted to say...
thank you.

633
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:01,062
Hello!

634
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,982
Hello!
Would somebody please...

635
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,109
come and tell me
what's going on here?

636
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,698
All right, Miss Channing.

637
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:15,535
Do you know what this is?

638
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,579
This has been
positively identified...

639
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,206
by my team of experts
as your cigarette.

640
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:24,169
It was discovered
at the site of a U.F.O. crash!

641
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,047
-What?
-And on it are trace elements...

642
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:31,092
of what we believe
to be alien DNA.

643
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:35,013
-Alien?
-Oh, don't play dumb with me!

644
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,058
You are an alien...

645
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:40,977
inhabiting the body of a woman!

646
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:46,566
A very, very attractive woman.

647
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:48,568
Oh, please.

648
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:51,529
Dr Coleye, we've run the tests
on the other cigarette.

649
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,573
It's human DNA.

650
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:56,910
Oh.
So sorry.

651
00:42:57,035 --> 00:43:01,581
An honest mistake.
So, Miss Channing,

652
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,084
do you have any idea
how alien DNA...

653
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,544
ended up on your cigarette?

654
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,091
I might. First of all,
let's talk about what's in this for me.

655
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:16,471
The safety of this entire planet
may depend on what you say to me.

656
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:19,724
There's nothing in it for you!

657
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:23,311
-Dr Coleye.

658
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:26,940
May I call you... Doctor?

659
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,943
Think about it.
When this story breaks,

660
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:34,447
you will be the most
famous scientist in history.

661
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:39,119
You will be on the cover
of Scientific... whatever.

662
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:44,457
You will be the man
that proves that aliens exist.

663
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:49,754
And I will be the woman
who tells the world your story.

664
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,134
We'll do it together.

665
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:57,137
Okay.

666
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:30,170
-Tim?

667
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:32,380
What are you doing up there?

668
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:35,008
My Uncle Martin's in the hot tub,

669
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,344
and I'm... watching.

670
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:42,265
Oh.

671
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,478
What a strange family.

672
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:50,190
You can, uh-
You can sleep here.

673
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,901
-You guys do sleep, don't you?
-Oh, most definitely.

674
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:56,196
Oh, great.
We have something in common.

675
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:58,365
You're very kind, Tim O'Hara.

676
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,203
-No, just very tired.
-Ohh, enjoy your rest cycle.

677
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:05,872
-I'll do the same.

678
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,208
I could use a little shut-eye.

679
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,710
- So could I.

680
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:16,216
-Rise and shine!
-Yeah, yeah right.

681
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,259
What's on tap for today, Tim O'Hara?

682
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,428
I feel like a million radix.

683
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:22,722
Hey, it's still tonight.
You've been asleep for 30 seconds.

684
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:26,393
Thirty seconds?
Wow, I really was tired.

685
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,229
What are we waiting for?

686
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:32,899
There's a whole metropolis out there
just waiting to be discovered!

687
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:34,943
No, not in the middle
of the night, there isn't.

688
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:37,570
I feel like ice cream,
and there's no time like the present.

689
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:42,033
Hello? Why aren't they open?

690
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:46,079
-What's wrong with this planet?
-I told you they don't open till 10:00.

691
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:49,290
-I could be first in line.
-They aren't gonna let you in
when they do open,

692
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:52,502
not after that little stunt
you pulled yesterday.

693
00:45:57,173 --> 00:46:01,594
-We call that breaking and entering.

694
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,141
Ah, the smell of moist air.

695
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:10,103
I'll never forget this.
Your ocean!

696
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:12,897
Ice cream!

697
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:15,316
This primitive planet
may not compare to Mars,

698
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,610
but it's not the rotten rock
I thought it was.

699
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:19,946
Don't look now,
but I think we're being followed.

700
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,115
Impossible.
My acute sensory perception...

701
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,159
would have detected that immediately.

702
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,328
Now it's working.

703
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:29,330
Hey! Hey, buddy!

704
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,666
-What are you doing?
-I've been discovered!

705
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,960
-I'm doomed!
-No, no, no, just calm down.

706
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:36,004
It's probably
just some tourist or something.

707
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,632
Besides, even if you did get caught,
you'd probably be, you know, welcomed.

708
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:42,427
Welcomed?
Tim, where do Earthlings put...

709
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:45,513
their most beautiful
and rare animals?

710
00:46:45,638 --> 00:46:47,640
If I don't get that spaceship fixed,
I'm finished,

711
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,768
just like Neenurt.

712
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:52,520
Can you fix it?
'Cause I'm dyin' here.

713
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:55,315
I need a drink, is what I need.

714
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:00,320
Yeah.
Downy the hatch.

715
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:07,619
-What was that?
-What in blazes?

716
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,497
-What is it?

717
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:13,541
Oh, blotz!

718
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,670
Zoot, an I.S.S.!

719
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:28,223
-Blasted rental!

720
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:32,185
-Owww! Spin me, mama!

721
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,814
-So nice, so good

722
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:45,156
Uncle Martin, what are you-

723
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,334
-Tech department.
- Hi, it's me.

724
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:59,421
-Oh, hi.
-What are you doin'?

725
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:02,173
Uh, research.

726
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:05,719
Have you ever got into your head how-
how you felt about somebody,

727
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:10,056
and then something they said or did
just suddenly changed your mind?

728
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,767
Well, yeah, I-

729
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,103
Could you come over?

730
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:18,398
Please, I really need to see you.
It's important.

731
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:21,860
Sure. Could you give me
like a half an hour?

732
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:26,031
- You're the best, Lizzie.
-Okay, see ya!

733
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,074
Oh, my gosh.

734
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:37,417
-Martin?

735
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:40,086
-I'm not like you.

736
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:42,881
I need more than
twelve seconds of sleep.

737
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:47,260
All I need is one lousy
electron accelerator...

738
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:49,304
for a vortex generator.

739
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,098
But can I build it?
No.

740
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,101
You'll do it. You just gotta
give yourself a little time, that's all.

741
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:58,772
Time! I have no time!

742
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,899
I just discovered
that this blasted rental...

743
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:03,401
is equipped with an I.S.S.!

744
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:06,321
-Yeah, what's that?
-Interstellar Safety System.

745
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,282
A detonation mechanism
designed to prevent...

746
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:12,744
advanced technology
from falling into the wrong hands.

747
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,289
It's timer activates automatically
at the point of a crash.

748
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:18,958
Okay, wait,
I heard "detonation" somewhere in there.

749
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:22,796
If I don't take off by 9:00 tonight,
you'll hear a lot more than that.

750
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:26,925
-Uh, how much more?

751
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,136
-Uh-huh.
-Lublick.

752
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:35,266
-Uh, you b-

753
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:43,983
Ahhh!

754
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:51,366
I know you've done your best
to help me, but it's no use.

755
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:54,869
Oh, no.

756
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:58,832
I'm sinking into
a Martian depression.

757
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,376
Sinking? No, no sinking.
Come on, we gotta go fix this thing.

758
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,628
I'm falling apart, Tim.

759
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:05,755
Oh, no, you're not.

760
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,050
-Come on.

761
00:50:09,175 --> 00:50:12,470
-Yes you are.
-On Mars, when we get depressed,

762
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:16,850
we literally fall apart!

763
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,477
-Okay, no problem.

764
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:22,022
Don't move, don't make it
any worse than it already is.

765
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:25,025
-What we're gonna do is
we're gonna put you back together.

766
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,194
Does it screw in?
It's not-

767
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,699
-Okay, just-aaah! No!
-I wanna go home!

768
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,243
-We're gonna put our heads together-

769
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:37,829
-Aaaah!

770
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:39,706
-Coming!
-Who's that?

771
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:41,958
-It's Lizzie!
-Lizzie? Oh, no.

772
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,378
You wait here.

773
00:50:45,503 --> 00:50:47,714
-Where are you going with those?
-Just tidying up!

774
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,717
Give 'em back! Give me back my arms!
Give me back-

775
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,678
Why do I have to die here?

776
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,723
Hello?

777
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:59,225
-Yoo-hoo!
-Don't move.

778
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,102
Tim!

779
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:03,563
Does anything in this room
strike you as odd?

780
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:05,690
-Tim?

781
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:07,859
Just a minute!

782
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:09,736
-Aaah!
-Would you just be quiet?

783
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:13,073
Coming! Lizzie!
Oh, Br-Br-Brace!

784
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:15,575
Tim!
Are you decent?

785
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,371
Oh, yeah! Yes, I am. What a surprise!

786
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:21,915
-Yes, now get lost!
-What did you say?

787
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,251
Uh, I'm lost.
I mean, 

788
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,379
I'm at a loss
for how beautiful you look.

789
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey-

790
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,554
Now, Tim, I hope you're gonna
let me make it up to you.

791
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,765
Oh, no, you don't have to do that.
I mean, that-

792
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:44,437
Well, you know, that's up to you.
I mean, if that's-

793
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,442
I brought a little peace offering.

794
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:51,653
-Where are your wine glasses?
-No, no, no-

795
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,656
That's the bedroom.
No glasses up there.

796
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,783
Oh, well,
maybe I'll get a little tour later.

797
00:51:56,908 --> 00:51:59,119
- Don't miss the bathroom!
-I'm sorry?

798
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,287
I have to go to the bathroom later.
Later.

799
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:04,124
Um, glasses are in the kitchen.

800
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,292
Why don't I go get them,
and you just...

801
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,503
kind of make yourself at home.

802
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:11,047
Okay.

803
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:16,136
-Fantastic apartment, Tim.
-Thank you very much.

804
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:18,430
-Ah, yeah, there we go.

805
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:22,142
Oh! What a slob!

806
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,317
Cut it out!

807
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:35,363
-Hey!
-Yes, let's fall in love

808
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:37,532
-Ooh!
-Why shouldn't we

809
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:40,952
-Fall in love
-Mmm, that's the spot.

810
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:43,830
Let's take a chance

811
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:47,959
-Ooh, yeah. Mmm.
-Why be afraid of it, ba-ba-doo-day

812
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:50,378
-Let's close our eyes

813
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:53,381
And make our own paradise

814
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:58,553
-Little we know
-Oh, oh, no, harder, like before.

815
00:52:58,678 --> 00:53:01,723
-Ahhh.
-Oh, baby

816
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:04,517
-Where's the wine?
-Uh, uh-

817
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:08,396
Why shouldn't
we fall in love

818
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:11,066
-I'll get it.
-Now is the time for it
While we are young

819
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,818
Let's fall in love

820
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:15,904
You know, I asked Daddy
about giving you another chance.

821
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,198
Oh, oh, good!

822
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:24,913
-Here we go.
-Oh, lovely. Thanks.

823
00:53:27,665 --> 00:53:30,543
Hmm. You know, I thought
that crash of yours...

824
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,879
might make a kind of
cute little story.

825
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:36,049
-Oh, really? Good. That's-
-Mm-hmm.

826
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:38,176
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

827
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:40,887
Cut it out!

828
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:43,223
-What was that?
-Uh, I didn't hear anything.

829
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:46,726
Tim, get rid of-

830
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:49,104
Are you all right?

831
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:52,732
Yes, I just-
I really have to go to the bathroom.

832
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:57,404
-Well, hurry back.

833
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,615
-Why shouldn't we fall in love
-Be a minute.

834
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,410
-Now's the time while we're young

835
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:07,205
Tim!
Get me outta here!

836
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,041
Stop making all that noise!

837
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:13,086
Tell her to stop punching me!
Besides, what are you doing...

838
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,213
letting that female
in your apartment?

839
00:54:15,338 --> 00:54:18,466
I've been waiting a long time
to get Brace Channing into my apartment.

840
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:21,428
But you like Lizzie! I could tell
through your saliva exchange.

841
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:24,264
-Excuse me?
-Look, Tim, the other night,

842
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,391
when you were unconscious,
Lizzie came here.

843
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:29,102
-And you what, you kissed her?
-Yes- No, no-

844
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:31,396
Well, you did.

845
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:33,481
I did a molecular
identiclone of your body.

846
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:36,109
-What? You what?
-You'd never understand.

847
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:38,153
You people think E-mail is amazing.

848
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,947
The point is, while I was you,

849
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:43,950
I tapped into your subconscious,
and trust me, you like Lizzie.

850
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:46,786
That's why I thought it was okay
for you to kiss her.

851
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:49,164
I-I-I didn't kiss her, you did!

852
00:54:56,629 --> 00:54:59,841
Bingo!

853
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:05,096
Tim? I let myself
in the back door.

854
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:07,974
Hello?

855
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:12,312
-Oh, isn't this nice?
-Lizzie, is that you?

856
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:16,024
Oh, you look, um, nice.

857
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,485
He's in the bathroom,

858
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,987
and he's all yours.

859
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:23,281
I got what I came for.

860
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,663
-Oh, this is great.
-Tim!

861
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,958
-We don't have a lot of time here!
-I'm confused, all right?

862
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:36,836
-Everything was going along fine
until you came along.
-Don't kid yourself.

863
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:39,839
Even a substandard species
such as yours has feelings.

864
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:44,010
Just slow down for one millisecond
and look into your heart.

865
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:46,513
Whose face do you see?

866
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:56,231
Look, Brace, I think-
Lizzie!

867
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:00,527
Whoa!
Lizzie, no, wait, wait-

868
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,822
-No, please!
-This better be good.

869
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,657
Oh, it is. It is.

870
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,576
Uh, remember that guy
I was with at the pier yesterday?

871
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:11,788
-Your Uncle Martin.
-He's not my uncle.

872
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:13,915
He's a Martian!

873
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,834
-Yeah.

874
00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:19,587
-You are such a jerk!
-No, no, no. He's a Martian!

875
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:22,757
It's the truth. In fact,
he's the one who kissed you, not me.

876
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:24,634
-Really?
-Yeah.

877
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:27,178
His head's in my sink right now.

878
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:30,140
-Get some sleep. You look awful.

879
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,435
-Lizzie-
-And if there was anything kinky
on that videotape,

880
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,980
you better get Brace to give it back.

881
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:45,280
Fine!
Since when did I become a mechanic?

882
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:48,950
-Do I look like overalls?

883
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:54,330
Uncle Martin!

884
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:57,208
- Okay. Don't cut the red one.

885
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:59,878
-Or was it the blue one? -Ooh!

886
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:03,048
I can't see a thing down here!

887
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,175
Oh, thanks.

888
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,513
-Ow! Geez, that hurt!

889
00:57:10,638 --> 00:57:12,724
-No!

890
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:15,352
Lady, please!
Put a sock in it! Quiet!

891
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,395
The baby's sleeping!

892
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,856
Martin, I told you.
We gotta get to the...

893
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:21,983
TV station before Brace does.

894
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:24,319
- Open the bag!
-Okay, okay.

895
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,696
- I can't breathe!
-I'm sorry.

896
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,574
-Where is that confounded Zoot?
-Zoot? Uh-

897
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:33,370
Zoot! Zoot! I think he's
in the middle of a spin cycle.

898
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:37,248
Leave him! Quick, Tim!
Get my arm out of the other bag!

899
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,876
-All right. Okay, okay, okay.
-Okay.

900
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:43,380
-Okay.
-Yes! Excellent! Toward the ship!

901
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,340
-Huh? What?
-Higher! Higher! Okay, here!

902
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,259
Here we go! Yes!

903
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,929
- Easy. Oh, no!

904
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,683
-Oh, no! Don't send me
to the shrink!

905
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,559
-Ohh!

906
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,521
-What was that?
-Uh-oh.

907
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,608
Sweetie-pie,

908
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,735
this is the most amazing footage
I've ever seen.

909
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,196
Felix!
O'Hara's tapes are going on the 6:00.

910
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,407
-Van Gundy, call the network.
-Yeah?

911
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:13,243
Brace is going out live
with the story of the century!

912
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,956
I'm feeling a little carsick!

913
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:20,083
-Oh!
-Sorry.

914
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:26,423
I can't take it any more.
I can't take it any more!

915
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:30,552
-We're running out of time.
Try and pull yourself together.
-Why? We're all doomed anyway.

916
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:34,139
Without my blasted electron accelerator,
the I.S.S. will blow!

917
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,433
I feel like a hacksaw murderer.

918
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,977
What the heck is
an electron accelerator anyway?

919
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:42,105
It's a simple low-amperage power source
that activates the main thrusters.

920
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,984
-Oh. Kind of like an alternator?
-What's an alternator?

921
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:49,112
-It, uh, turns over the engine in a car.
- A car?

922
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:51,823
That's it! That should work!
We're saved!

923
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:53,950
-Not quite.
-Yes, we are.

924
00:58:54,075 --> 00:58:56,703
-Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha, ha.
-Listen, I've been-

925
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,622
I've been videotaping you.
I've got everything. I got the ship.

926
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:02,876
I got Zoot.
I even got you in your Martian form.

927
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:05,670
I was putting together a story,
and I was gonna get it on the air,

928
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:07,839
-but I couldn't do it.
-Why not?

929
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:09,632
Because I like you, Martin.

930
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:11,843
I like you. I-

931
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:13,887
And I'm sorry.
I-I just- I'm sorry.

932
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:17,390
I I- I apologize.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

933
00:59:17,515 --> 00:59:20,310
-You're a good human, Tim O'Hara.
-Oh, oh, yeah. I'm a terrific-

934
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,479
Martin!
You're back!

935
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,731
And I like you too.

936
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:27,484
-Oh-ho!
-I've never had feelings before!

937
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,486
-Oh.

938
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,572
Now, let's go fix my ship.

939
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:34,741
Yeah, okay- No!
No, we got a problem- the tapes.

940
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:38,328
-Brace goes on with the
Martian story in five minutes.
-Oh, blotz.

941
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:42,165
Yeah, and I got to get these tapes and
get to Brace before she gets on the air.

942
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,834
But there's not enough time.
You can't be in two places at once.

943
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:48,338
Yeah. Wait a minute!
Come on!

944
00:59:48,463 --> 00:59:50,882
Is there an alien amongst us?

945
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:54,844
Is there an alien amongst us?

946
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:57,347
-Is there an alien among-

947
00:59:57,472 --> 01:00:01,017
Billy, now what?

948
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:03,770
I want to be Brace Channing.

949
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:06,272
Yeah, well, get in line.
I'm sorry.

950
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:07,899
I really don't have time
to do any auto-

951
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,779
-Quaint, aren't they?

952
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:15,532
These days, most of our young
are born cable-ready.

953
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:17,534
You're the-

954
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,787
Daddy!

955
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,207
Heads up. Four minutes to air.

956
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:27,544
First positions, everyone.

957
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:31,464
Tim! What are you doing here?
You look, uh, tired.

958
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:34,718
Oh, yeah. I was up all night with Brace
working on the alien story.

959
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:38,263
I made a couple of mistakes
in tape number two,
but that's the corrected version.

960
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:43,059
Now if I could just get through this
without having to look in a mirror.

961
01:00:43,184 --> 01:00:46,646
-Hmm.
-Coming up on three minutes to air.

962
01:00:58,241 --> 01:01:00,285
Tim!

963
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,580
-Martin, is that you?
-Does a wild bear blotz in the woods?

964
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:07,500
Good, good. Okay. Just-
Just read the copy as written. Go.

965
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,463
-Hi, Brace.

966
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:14,591
-Congratulations, Brace.
-Yes, I'm Brace Channing.

967
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,177
Let's hear it for Brace!

968
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:24,768
-Dr Coleye, you're going
to become a very famous man.
-Thirty I.D. and open.

969
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:26,936
- KGSC.
-Ready camera one live.

970
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,147
-The news for southern California...

971
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:34,027
with anchor Howard Greenly and
on special assignment, Brace Channing.

972
01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:36,529
-What the hell is she wearing?
-You know Brace.

973
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:40,617
-Yeah. Must be trendy.
- Fifteen seconds, people.

974
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:45,622
Sweetie-pie, get rid of the gum.

975
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,875
-Billy!
-Come on, Brace!
-Leave the gum, Billy!

976
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,462
-Get the gum, Billy!
- Brace, ten seconds.
-No.

977
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:54,631
Ready?
Camera two live in five-

978
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:56,299
-Give me the gum, Brace!
-No! No! No!

979
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,635
-Four-
-No!
-Leave it! Leave it!

980
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,304
-Three-
-Get the damn gum!

981
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:04,683
-Are there aliens amongst us?

982
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:07,185
This report is being broadcast live.

983
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,979
-The gum is out.
-Oh, good. Thanks to you, Felix.

984
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:13,900
And now, Howard Greenly...

985
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:16,236
-And cue Howard.
-and Brace Channing!

986
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,655
-Good evening. I'm Howard Greenly.

987
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,366
-What's up with her?
-I don't know.

988
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:26,746
...a story developing throughout the day
right here in southern California.

989
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:31,501
Our own Brace Channing has been
following the events as they take place.

990
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:33,920
-Brace?

991
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:36,423
-What is she doing?
-Howard-

992
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,550
-Camera two go.
-No!

993
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:41,261
Brace?

994
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:43,513
-Brace!
-Just read the copy!

995
01:02:43,638 --> 01:02:46,516
Just get the nurplex.

996
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:48,893
What's going on here?

997
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,021
Is there an alien amongst us?

998
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,024
-Oh. It's all right.
-According to Dr Elliot Coleye,

999
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:57,527
chief biologist and head researcher
for the SETI group,

1000
01:02:57,652 --> 01:02:59,946
the answer is-

1001
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:02,782
-Yes.

1002
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:06,369
-She's an alien!
-She's not an alien. She's my daughter!

1003
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:08,788
What you're
about to see is that evidence...

1004
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:11,541
of the actual footage of the alien.

1005
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,210
But I warn you-
it's appearance is unlike...

1006
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:16,880
anything you are
likely to have seen before.

1007
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,133
She's going under the table.
She's going under the table!

1008
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:23,053
-And go.

1009
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:26,389
-Feelin' hot, hot, hot
-What the hell is this?

1010
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:29,893
-Somebody mislabelled the tapes!
-Come on. Got it!

1011
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:32,437
-I don't know. Let's go back live.
-Tim!

1012
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:34,898
What is O'Hara doing with my daughter?

1013
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:37,817
-I-I-I don't know. I-
-Get me out of here!

1014
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:43,239
-Get me the network!

1015
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,742
-You're a dead man, O'Hara!
-Come on!

1016
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:49,412
I think that went pretty well,
don't you?

1017
01:03:49,537 --> 01:03:52,123
- All right. Calm down.

1018
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:54,668
Search everywhere!

1019
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:57,796
Boy, her head was dark and empty.

1020
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,298
-There they are! There they are!

1021
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:02,509
Wait!

1022
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:07,430
I think Miss Channing might have been
contaminated by the alien.

1023
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:10,475
-Hmm?
-I'm just going to give her
a quick examination.

1024
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,769
No!

1025
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:14,979
I'll just be a moment.

1026
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:17,107
Ah.
There we go.

1027
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:19,275
Let's see.
Am I forgetting something?

1028
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:22,278
Oh.

1029
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:25,115
There it is.

1030
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,285
-Mrs. Brown! Down here!
- Lady, please.

1031
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,831
-Oh, this is darling.

1032
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:35,291
-I'm gonna hurl!

1033
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:38,837
This will make some child very happy...
if he's got a buck or two.

1034
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:47,887
-Hey, Mrs. B. How are you?
-Hello, fellows.

1035
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:53,059
Zoot!
Blotz!

1036
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,311
My ship! Where's my ship?

1037
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:57,981
-We only have two hours
before it explodes!
-I'll check upstairs.

1038
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:00,066
Hurry!
Zoot!

1039
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:03,319
Zoot?
Where are you?

1040
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:06,573
Blotz! You're not Zoot.
Where could he be?

1041
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:09,492
I'm not leaving this planet
without Zoot. Tim!

1042
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:12,162
Not upstairs.

1043
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,998
-What's a "rummaggie" sale?
-"Rummaggie" sale?

1044
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:18,418
R- Rummaggie-
Rummage. Mrs. Brown.

1045
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,011
-Looks like we got company.
-Blotz!

1046
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,514
It's them!
After them!

1047
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:37,187
-Hang on.

1048
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,439
-Ooh.
-I repeat, Gilford and Third.

1049
01:05:39,564 --> 01:05:43,693
Give me that thing.
I want a roadblock!

1050
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:48,031
-We're never gonna lose 'em!
-Can't you drive any faster,
you pinhead?

1051
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:54,621
-Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
- Maximum thrust!

1052
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:57,082
-What?
-Stand on it, Stan!

1053
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,877
-We're gonna crash!

1054
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:03,380
-I think not!

1055
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,427
-Aah!

1056
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,098
-Oh!
-Shoot it! Come on!

1057
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,602
-They're shooting at us!
-Duck in that garage.

1058
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,146
-What garage?
-There!
-Hang on!

1059
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:27,153
Oh. Tim, why are we stopping?

1060
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:32,075
-They're right there.

1061
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,829
God!

1062
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:39,249
-Get me that thing over there!
We're gonna flush 'em out!
-Yes, sir.

1063
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,751
-I dropped it!
-What? Dropped what?

1064
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:44,504
-My molecular compressor!
-Here.

1065
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:46,756
Use this.

1066
01:06:46,881 --> 01:06:50,760
-This won't work!
-No, use it to find it.

1067
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:55,598
That'll do very nicely.
Now, get it in there!

1068
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,684
Uh! Uh!
Nuts!

1069
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,769
Ahh! I found it!

1070
01:06:59,894 --> 01:07:02,022
We've got you now!

1071
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:05,358
-Tim!
-I see it!

1072
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:10,655
- Sorry.

1073
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:23,960
-Faster. Faster.
-It's getting closer!

1074
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:27,630
-I'm going as fast as I can!
-That's not fast enough!

1075
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:41,061
Martin! Martin, up ahead!
We're trapped! Quick, make us smaller.

1076
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:48,401
We're not gonna make it!

1077
01:07:48,526 --> 01:07:51,237
Hang on!

1078
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:58,828
-Are we clear?
- Whoa-ho, I think we did it!

1079
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:01,664
-I see light ahead!
-Oh. Whoa, whoa-ooh!

1080
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:19,349
-Where the heck are we?
- Hey, Elma,
where's my new Field and Stream?

1081
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:22,519
It's in the bathroom,
right where you left it.

1082
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:25,063
Oh, yeah.
I see it now.

1083
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:28,024
By the way,
where's my tuna sandwich?

1084
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:31,361
-You want it in there?
-Ha-ha. Ohh!

1085
01:08:31,486 --> 01:08:34,781
Why'd I eat that fourth burrito?

1086
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:37,909
-Uh-oh.

1087
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:49,462
-Do it. Do it now.

1088
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:52,090
Uh! Uh, uh, uh-

1089
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:04,227
-Sorry, buddy.
-I'll get you, you son of a b-

1090
01:09:04,352 --> 01:09:08,106
-No!
-Sir, the police just had a crank call.

1091
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:11,151
-A '62 Plymouth just came out
of a toilet on Woodlawn.
-Aah!

1092
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:16,906
Stop! Pull over! Pull over!

1093
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:18,992
We need to talk!
Pull over!

1094
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:23,288
-Pull over there.
-Where? Oh.

1095
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:26,124
-Get the alternator. I'll get the ship!
-Okay.

1096
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:30,503
Oh, my goodness! Martin!
What's wrong?

1097
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:32,589
Forgive me, Lorelei,
but this is urgent.

1098
01:09:32,714 --> 01:09:35,091
-You have something I need desperately.
-Oh, wow.

1099
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:38,595
-Martin, don't say that
unless you mean it.
-You don't know the half of it.

1100
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,767
-I'm from another world.
-Oh, well, I could have told you that.

1101
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:52,984
-Oh! Mmm!

1102
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:55,862
Mar- Martin?

1103
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:58,281
Martin, come on!

1104
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,994
When you look at the stars,
think of me.

1105
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:05,789
-Oh. -

1106
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:10,168
Oh! Whew!

1107
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:12,796
Feelings for an Earth woman-
I've gotta get off this planet.

1108
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,881
I've got it!

1109
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:17,384
I don't have the right tools,
so I'm having trouble getting-

1110
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:21,137
Oh!
Or we could do it your way.

1111
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:24,641
But wait! This means your vehicle
will cease to function.

1112
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,352
I know how much it means to you.

1113
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:30,814
Well, that's too bad.
Just had the darn thing washed too.

1114
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,198
That's good!
That's-

1115
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,325
Martin? Martin?

1116
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:47,580
- Direct hit!
-Uncle Martin?

1117
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:03,013
Hey! Hey, what-

1118
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:06,683
Hey, you don't know what you're doing!
Hey, hey!

1119
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:11,438
Don't mess with that spaceship!
It's gonna explode!

1120
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,606
-Narrow the beam.
-Intensify.

1121
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:19,195
I'm not flame-retardant!

1122
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,365
We're in here!
Stop it!

1123
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:24,409
-We're gonna die.

1124
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:28,538
-Die? And I'm still virgin wool!
-It's okay.

1125
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:31,207
I'm scared! Hold me!

1126
01:11:31,332 --> 01:11:33,251
Oh, this is nice.

1127
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:42,886
Easy does it.

1128
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,889
Great.

1129
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:50,226
-Wow. Fascinating.
- Doctor.

1130
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,729
It appears to be some sort of...

1131
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:55,398
biomechanical transmitting device.

1132
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:57,776
Doctor, there's some chewing gum
wedged back in his molar.

1133
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,570
Leave it!
Pestering me with Juicy Fruit!

1134
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:04,240
This guy's got a radio station
inside of his skull! Here.

1135
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:07,911
We'll put this under the electron
microscope later. Whoa-ho!

1136
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,623
Excellent.
Armitan's gonna be eating his words!

1137
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:15,251
Perfect ending
to an already perfect day.

1138
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:19,255
-He's a little pale.
-I think he's having a negative
reaction to the tranquilizers.

1139
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,633
Well, two CCs of adrenaline, stat!

1140
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:24,636
-Doctor, I think we're losing him.

1141
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:27,305
-Nothing.
- Shut it down.

1142
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:31,142
-Get ready to try it again.
This time, full power.
-He's pointing to something.

1143
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,271
-He's pointing to the thing.
-Pick it up. Pick-

1144
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:37,482
Pick it- Yeah.
No. No, no, no.

1145
01:12:37,607 --> 01:12:39,943
No, that one. That one.

1146
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:42,987
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1147
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:46,032
This. Do this.

1148
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:50,495
-Yes!

1149
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,339
Whoa-oh-oh!

1150
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:06,845
No. No, no. Oh.

1151
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,139
-Tim!
-Oh!

1152
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:11,641
All right, back off, Gomer.
Hey.

1153
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:13,643
Give me that, dipstick!

1154
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:15,729
You get Tim.
I'll scare the locals.

1155
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:19,899
-Let's get out of here!
-Call security!

1156
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:22,402
-Nobody will take on the suit!

1157
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:24,988
My zipper is stuck,
and I'm mad as hell!

1158
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:27,824
-Lizzie, what-
-Tim! Oh, are you okay?

1159
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,243
-Fine, fine. Are you okay?
-Oh, you wouldn't believe-

1160
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:34,330
-Yeah.

1161
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:37,584
-We got to find Martin.
-Yeah.

1162
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:40,587
Back off!
You heard me.

1163
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:43,173
You don't understand. That spaceship's
gonna explode in 20 minutes.

1164
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,925
-It is?
-On the floor. Now.

1165
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,679
Excuse me.
Arnold, Jean-Claude?

1166
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:53,266
Not working. Oh.

1167
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:56,019
-It's an empty suit.
-Empty suit?

1168
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:59,230
Now you've done it, Grasshopper.
Whoo-aah!

1169
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,861
Boxing?

1170
01:14:04,986 --> 01:14:07,030
-You should be boxing groceries.

1171
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,574
That tickles, ya big ox!

1172
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:12,702
Say, aren't you
one of the Spice Girls?

1173
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,455
-Alley-oop!

1174
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,376
Beavis down, Butt-head to go.

1175
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:22,879
So, is it true you peed your bunk
in summer camp? Ouch!

1176
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:29,427
Oh, Gee- Tim! Lizzie!

1177
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:41,272
-Ooh!

1178
01:14:56,204 --> 01:14:58,581
-Uh-oh.

1179
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,792
-This is gonna hurt.
-Ooh!

1180
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,670
-Ow!

1181
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:06,798
-Lizzie!

1182
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:08,758
The ship's going to explode!

1183
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:11,428
Veenox Seven.
Chew this.

1184
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:14,597
- You gotta believe it!

1185
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:27,777
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1186
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,812
Uh-oh.

1187
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:05,523
Did you do something with your hair?

1188
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:09,486
Glad you noticed.

1189
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,245
Whoop!

1190
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:27,671
-I think I liked you
better the other way.
-Oh, really?

1191
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:31,049
-Well, that can be arranged.
-No, no. We gotta find Martin.

1192
01:16:31,174 --> 01:16:35,178
-Where's Zoot?

1193
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:37,931
Oh, no.

1194
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:41,768
Come on!
Come on!

1195
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:44,562
Doctor, he's gone.

1196
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,857
He's not gone till I say he's gone,
so back off!

1197
01:16:47,982 --> 01:16:50,568
-Back off! Now!
- Charge the paddle.

1198
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,780
- All right, we're charged.
- Clear! Clear!

1199
01:16:53,905 --> 01:16:57,033
All right. Clear!

1200
01:16:57,158 --> 01:17:00,412
-Come on, Martin.

1201
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:02,622
-Oh, damn!
-There's no pulse, Doctor.

1202
01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:06,918
All right, all right.
I'm calling it. 8:15.

1203
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:11,214
-We're too late.
- No, hurry!

1204
01:17:11,339 --> 01:17:14,718
- Would you like me
to do the autopsy, Doctor?
-Are you insane?

1205
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:17,262
-You get out of here! Get out!
-All right. All right.

1206
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:19,889
All of you idiots, you get out.
You get out.

1207
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,642
-I'm goin'!
-You get right out. Clowns!

1208
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,769
Come on.

1209
01:17:24,894 --> 01:17:29,899
Okay, my sorry little Martian.

1210
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:33,069
Have it your way.

1211
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:35,905
Let's open you up.

1212
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:40,326
- Assistance, Doctor?
-What? No! You-

1213
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:42,912
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not-

1214
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:45,582
-She came with me.
-Oh.
-Clear.

1215
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:58,678
Must... be together.

1216
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:20,367
Zoot!

1217
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:35,215
-Martin?

1218
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:41,721
-Martin!
- Tim! Lizzie!

1219
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:44,641
-You're- You're-
- Breathin', baby!
I still got the touch.

1220
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:47,477
Oh, you beauteous bathrobe!

1221
01:18:47,602 --> 01:18:49,646
-Martin-
-Let's see cotton do that, huh? Easy.

1222
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,649
-I got an image!
- Okay, okay.

1223
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,734
Martin! Martin!

1224
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:57,862
-We don't have much time.
-Blotz!

1225
01:18:57,987 --> 01:19:00,657
-Shut down and monitor all exits.

1226
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:05,912
All units stand by for total lockup.

1227
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,916
-Martin, can you get the lock?
-I think so.

1228
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,753
-Come on!

1229
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:18,675
-Biotech units on alert.

1230
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,678
All non-security personnel...

1231
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:24,723
-are to report to their holding areas.
-Come on. Stay down!

1232
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:28,518
-Stay down.
-Here's a place!

1233
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:30,770
All right.
Stand back, you two.

1234
01:19:40,655 --> 01:19:43,533
-What's going on? Where's the alien?

1235
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:46,703
-There's been a slight problem.
-Open that gate. Let's find Dr Coleye.

1236
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:48,621
-Yes, sir, yes, sir. Right away.
-Come on!

1237
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,582
Let 'em through!

1238
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,960
Here.

1239
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,466
There. Contact.

1240
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:02,302
There.
I think that's going to work.

1241
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,056
I'm gonna miss you, Martin.

1242
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:10,226
-You too, Zoot.
-You're so full of starch!

1243
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,937
Hey, let 'em know how you feel!

1244
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:15,065
You're the best pet I ever had!

1245
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,400
Stop being such a baby blanket!

1246
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:22,947
Lizzie, my dear friend.

1247
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:27,118
Take care, Uncle Martin.

1248
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:33,958
I've done that before. It's very nice.
I highly recommend it.

1249
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:39,798
Good luck, you two.

1250
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,263
Something tells me
you're gonna miss your flight!

1251
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:50,475
-Then in two minutes, we all die.
-You're lying.

1252
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,312
Are you certain about that, Coleye?

1253
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:57,357
-Because I'm not.
-What are you saying?

1254
01:20:57,482 --> 01:21:00,652
-Release him.
-Release him?

1255
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:04,364
I have spent an entire career
trying to prove that aliens exist.

1256
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:06,366
Now he's my proof!

1257
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:09,953
Dead or alive,
he's staying with me!

1258
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:11,788
Oh. Ohh! Ohh!

1259
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:14,290
Whoa! Aah!

1260
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,794
-Martin?
-I don't understand! I- I-

1261
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:21,506
Coleye, you always were a little blotz.

1262
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:25,010
- What?
-Neenurt!

1263
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:28,805
Ha ha ha! I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

1264
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:33,226
-Pronounced properly, anyway.
-You mean it was you all along?

1265
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:38,523
I can't believe this!
I should have known! You're a Martian?

1266
01:21:38,648 --> 01:21:40,650
I was-
Uhh! Aah!

1267
01:21:50,493 --> 01:21:54,039
Waaah!

1268
01:21:54,164 --> 01:21:57,917
-Wait. You're the one I saw at the pier.

1269
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:59,669
I was trying to get to you
before they did.

1270
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:02,672
I've been trying
to hitch a ride home for 30 years!

1271
01:22:02,797 --> 01:22:06,176
What a beauty!
Oh, by the way,

1272
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,595
I believe these belong to you.

1273
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,514
My antennae.

1274
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:15,018
I can't go home without these. I have a
hard enough time getting dates as it is.

1275
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:19,064
Mine's always giving me trouble too.
And everything's in black and white.

1276
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:22,525
-And those commercials-
"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz"-

1277
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:26,112
That gum lost its flavour in '66.

1278
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:29,074
All right. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

1279
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,285
-Got to go. Farewell.
-Come back for a visit sometime.

1280
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:35,038
Maybe.

1281
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:38,083
I'm beginning to see a glimmer
of potential among you Earthlings.

1282
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:42,045
One word of advice: You'll never
completely advance as a culture...

1283
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:45,882
until you take care of your oceans
and do away with daytime talk shows.

1284
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,553
Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds!

1285
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,431
Ah, stop being such
a hysterical housecoat.

1286
01:22:53,556 --> 01:22:58,895
-See ya, Zoot.
-Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'

1287
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:03,942
Aliens!

1288
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:10,657
Wait! No!

1289
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:12,909
Please! No! You can't!

1290
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:15,829
Don't go! Come back!

1291
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:19,582
No-o-o!

1292
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:23,628
Aah!

1293
01:23:23,753 --> 01:23:26,006
What the-
Eeew!

1294
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:29,592
Gum. Gum!

1295
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:32,929
Wait, this is the alien gum!
Yes!

1296
01:23:33,054 --> 01:23:35,265
Wait, wait.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1297
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:38,518
Well, you're not me, are ya?

1298
01:23:40,395 --> 01:23:42,355
I can learn more about them...

1299
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,649
from their leftover-

1300
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:46,860
Wha-
That's brilliant!

1301
01:23:46,985 --> 01:23:49,487
I can feel every molecule of my body...

1302
01:23:49,612 --> 01:23:51,656
starting to change!

1303
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:58,371
Aah!

1304
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:01,833
Oh, no.

1305
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,381
Hold it! Don't move!

1306
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:11,801
-No!
-Stop! Don't shoot!
Get the tranquillizer gun.

1307
01:24:11,926 --> 01:24:14,346
No, not that, you idiots!

1308
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:17,849
-I'm not a Martian.
-We got him, boys.
Get the tranquillizer gun.

1309
01:24:17,974 --> 01:24:20,143
We've got one-
a real live Martian!

1310
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:24,356
It's me. Coleye. No! No!

1311
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:26,733
Aah!

1312
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:29,569
The truth is out there!

1313
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:33,198
We are not leaving until they
listen to us! We've got proof!

1314
01:24:33,323 --> 01:24:36,493
I saw one!
He cloned my body!

1315
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,495
He could be anywhere by now!

1316
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,997
The truth is out there!

1317
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:43,041
The truth is out there!

1318
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:46,503
So that's the story here
from Santa Barbara City Hall.

1319
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:49,673
-I'm Bill Randall, KGSC.
-The truth, the truth,

1320
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:52,425
the truth, the truth, the truth!

1321
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,594
It's all I-

1322
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:03,061
-Hey, sleepy. Brought you some tea.

1323
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:10,694
Listen, I've been thinking. Now that
I really know what happened between us,

1324
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:14,030
I think maybe we should just go back
to the way things used to be.

1325
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:15,532
Mmm.

1326
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,701
Our friendship really does
mean a lot to me.

1327
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:21,287
Yeah, well, I've been thinking too,
and, uh,

1328
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:23,623
I think I've got enough friends.

1329
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:54,988
-One giant leap for man,
one step backward for Martians.

1330
01:25:55,113 --> 01:25:58,408
-Zoot?
-Hey, Tim, Lizzie! We're back!

1331
01:25:58,533 --> 01:26:02,245
-Zoot- 

1332
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:05,498
Oh! Geez!
Call a skycap, for cryin' out loud.

1333
01:26:05,623 --> 01:26:07,751
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

1334
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,087
We've decided to stay here with you.

1335
01:26:11,212 --> 01:26:15,008
-Y-You what?
-I kept thinking how lonely
I was gonna be without you.

1336
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,260
And since you said
you were gonna miss me,

1337
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:20,805
I thought I'd save us both
the heartache of separation.

1338
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:22,974
Ya-hah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1339
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:27,854
B-B-B-But, Martin, I can't miss you
if you don't go!

1340
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:31,441
Exactly!
Isn't it wonderful?

1341
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:34,944
Farewell, Neenurt!

1342
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,489
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where's he going?

1343
01:26:37,614 --> 01:26:40,283
To Mars, of course!

1344
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:47,999
-Whoo! -Wh-

1345
01:26:48,124 --> 01:26:50,710
Martin. Martin.
What are you doing?

1346
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:54,339
Tim, since we'll be living together,
let's do something about this furniture.

1347
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,050
-Living together? What do you mean-
-I say we get rid of this couch,

1348
01:26:57,175 --> 01:27:00,637
and buy a hyperbolic resting chamber
like normal beings have.

1349
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:03,390
-No! No! You're not staying here.
-Hey, who wants ice cream?

1350
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,476
-Tonight I'm craving praline swirl.

1351
01:27:06,601 --> 01:27:08,645
-Martin- You think this is funny?

1352
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,647
You haven't seen him eat ice cream.
It's not pretty!

1353
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:14,359
Rocky road! Rocky road! Rocky road!

1354
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,569
-Martin, you can't- He doesn't sleep.

1355
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:18,655
He doesn't let me sleep.
This can't happen.

1356
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,990
I can't have a Martian for a roommate.

1357
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:23,493
I can't. I just-

1358
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:25,704
-Oh, maybe I can.

1359
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:30,542
Zoot! We've got cookie dough.
Want some?

1360
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:32,919
Zoot.
Zoot, where are you?

1361
01:27:33,044 --> 01:27:37,173
Bartender, a Mai "Tide", please.

1362
01:27:37,298 --> 01:27:40,385
Ah, Victoria's Secret.

1363
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:43,847
You people know how to live!

1364
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:46,433
Lycra.

1365
