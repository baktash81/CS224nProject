2
00:11:33,000 --> 00:12:25,000
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.

3
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thanks for coming, Al.

4
00:17:33,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.

5
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.

6
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He can?t even tone it
down at Mom?s funeral?

7
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What do you expect? Dad?s still
living in the ?50s.

8
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He expects his granddaughter to dress a
little more modestly.

9
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, well your kid?s wearing
a Timberwolves jersey.

10
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I?m sure Dad appreciates that.

11
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The point I am trying to make is that there?

12
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:50,000
s nothing anyone can do that
won?t disappoint the Old Man.

13
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It?s inevitable.

14
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That?s why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.

15
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:35,000
the deal with the boat motor, the
broken bird bath,

16
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It?s always something.

17
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What are we going to do with him?

18
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Don?t you think he?ll get in trouble over

19
00:25:33,000 --> 00:26:00,000
there all by himself in
the old neighborhood?

20
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why don?t you have him move in with you?

21
00:30:25,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Death is often a bittersweet
occasion to us Catholics.

22
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Bitter in the pain.

23
00:31:45,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sweet in the salvation.

24
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.

25
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:20,000
... and their families

26
00:33:21,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Sweet to those who know the salvation that
awaits.

27
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And some may ask,
what is death?

28
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Is it the end?

29
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Or is it the beginning?

30
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And what is life?

31
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:45,000
What is this thing we call life?

32
00:36:46,000 --> 00:37:32,000
All these questions can frustrate you at
times like this.

33
00:37:33,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...

34
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Because the Lord is the sweetness.

35
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.

36
00:41:45,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There is a platoon, E-Company,
March 2, 1952.

37
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Korea?
- Where's Korea?

38
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, people showed up after
the service, huh?

39
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard
there?d be a lot of ham.

40
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I?ll go down the basement and get some
chairs.

41
00:44:46,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now

42
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:38,000
not next week.

43
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.

44
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:40,000
How much longer do we have to stay?

45
00:50:41,000 --> 00:51:22,000
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
and I?m bored.

46
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Ashley, honey. Why don?t you help
Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

47
00:51:48,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Me?
- Yes, you.

48
00:52:37,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with
these four chairs.

49
00:53:22,000 --> 00:54:06,000
No, you probably just painted your nails.

50
00:54:38,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Your dad is driving me crazy.

51
00:55:31,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're
leaving soon?

52
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Come on, let's go.

53
01:01:31,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
can get in one room?

54
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Grandpa, when?d you get the
vintage car??

55
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:37,000
1972.

56
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I never knew you had a cool old car.

57
01:07:23,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah, it's been here since
before you were born.

58
01:08:18,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So, what are you going do with it when you
like...

59
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:42,000
die?

60
01:10:40,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Then what about that super cool
retro couch that you have in the den

61
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Cause I was thinking I?m going
to State next year,

62
01:11:29,000 --> 01:12:01,000
and I think it would look really
good in my dorm room.

63
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And I don't have any furniture at all.

64
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:48,000
God.

65
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Who are you? - Hi, I am Tao. - What do you
want?

66
01:14:43,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.

67
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.

68
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Do you have jumper cables? My
uncle?s car is old and.....

69
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:56,000
- No we don't any jumper cables .

70
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And have some respect, zipper head, we?re
mourning  here..

71
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:12,000
How you holding up, Walt?

72
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Mr. Kowalski.

73
01:17:32,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

74
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Right, Mr. Kowalski.

75
01:18:44,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Your wife and I became quite close these
last few months.

76
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:40,000
She asked that I
watch over you when she passed on.

77
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I told her I watch out for my
entire flock.

78
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But she made me promise I?d keep an extra
sharp eye on you.

79
01:20:31,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to
my wife.

80
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Now that you?ve spoken your piece,

81
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:42,000
why don?t go and attend
some of your other sheep?

82
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Ok?

83
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was
her desire for you to go to confession.

84
01:22:48,000 --> 01:23:13,000
She said she couldn?t remember the last time
you went.

85
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Is that so?
- It is.

86
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Well, I confess that I never really cared
for church very much.

87
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:48,000
The only reason I went was because of her.

88
01:24:49,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And I confess that I have no
desire to confess

89
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:50,000
to a boy that is
just out of the seminary.

90
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids
home.

91
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.

92
01:32:26,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I?ll call in a few, see how you?re doing.
- Alright.

93
01:33:39,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Kill you to buy American.

94
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Huh ...

95
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?

96
01:34:49,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Jesus. It?s always Rice-Burner this or
Jap-Burner that. You know.

97
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Even at Mom?s funeral, he can?t let it go.

98
01:35:39,000 --> 01:36:05,000
At least he didn?t say anything this time.
-He didn?t need to.

99
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Well, what do you expect, Mitch? The man
worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.

100
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I suppose that?s my goddamned fault?

101
01:36:51,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Just give it a rest. Drive. Ok?

102
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Kids, do you want the radio on? Yes.
You want to listen to some music? Good.

103
01:40:29,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Damn, barbarians

104
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Oh, Jesus ...

105
01:57:45,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he
could see his lawn now.

106
01:58:39,000 --> 01:59:18,000
What the hell the chinks had to move in
this neighborhood for?

107
02:03:47,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Have you gone completely deaf or something??

108
02:04:38,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Hi there, Walt.

109
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?

110
02:05:42,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.

111
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:44,000
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.

112
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Thought I?d drop by and
see how you are doing.

113
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I haven?t seen you in church in a while

114
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Okay. Well now when you
tipped on your good deed,

115
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:49,000
now why don?t you just
take off down the road?

116
02:07:49,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I?d really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.

117
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Why?

118
02:08:42,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.

119
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:26,000
No, I do.

120
02:09:27,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Well I think you?re an  overeducated,
27-year-old virgin

121
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:35,000
who likes to  hold the hands of old ladies
who are superstitious

122
02:10:36,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and promises them eternity.

123
02:13:49,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can?t
tell

124
02:14:35,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Hey, Chicito.  If you was in pink, I would
fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.

125
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:40,000
What you reading, jackass
and The rice stalk?

126
02:15:41,000 --> 02:16:21,000
That?s right, you keep walking.

127
02:16:21,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.

128
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Fucking pigs

129
02:17:48,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Look at that, man.

130
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:42,000
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?

131
02:19:43,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?

132
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:38,000
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?

133
02:20:39,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Let's go down and see what the fucking
they're doing to him.

134
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I love your jungles too.

135
02:22:45,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Hey, they fucking with you?

136
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:54,000
They fucking with you?

137
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:20,000
We can do this right now.

138
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:38,000
You go fucking back here, don't you?

139
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Yeah!

140
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:40,000
You are fucking rise niggers!

141
02:26:29,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Ok go!

142
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Tao, come on man, get in the car.

143
02:28:42,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Dog, get in the car.

144
02:29:41,000 --> 02:30:04,000
We just bailed your ass out, dawg.

145
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Come on, dawg, get the fuck in here.

146
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Get in the car, man, come on.

147
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Chill with us, man.

148
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:53,000
We just bailed your ass out!

149
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Come on.

150
02:32:44,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Come on, Tao, man.
- Fuck him, man, let's go.

151
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Come on Spider.
- Fuck it.

152
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Get it man, let's go.
fuck his ass.

153
02:33:51,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.

154
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:42,000
- Don't be like a little girl!
Tomorrow.

155
02:34:43,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Come let's go, man. We've got a gun, man.

156
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's get
this strapped.

157
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Pussy!

158
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Hey, Tao.

159
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Hey what's up?

160
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:57,000
What's up, Tao?

161
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:33,000
What are you doing little man?

162
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Why are you doing woman's work?

163
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:19,000
What do you want?

164
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:57,000
What? We can't just come and talk to my
little cousin?

165
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:32,000
He doesn't want to talk to you.

166
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:56,000
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?

167
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:13,000
What's up?
- Spider?

168
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Is that what he just
called you, Fong?

169
02:43:41,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?

170
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:43,000
What are you doing here?

171
02:44:43,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Hey, so how old are you anyways?

172
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?

173
02:45:39,000 --> 02:46:03,000
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.

174
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Sue!

175
02:46:35,000 --> 02:47:01,000
How your little brother, do this gardening.

176
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Fine, stupid.

177
02:47:37,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?

178
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.

179
02:48:42,000 --> 02:49:14,000
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.

180
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Look, dawg. I've been there, I've done it
and I've seen it.

181
02:49:42,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me,
dawg.

182
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:25,000
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.

183
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?

184
02:50:52,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Come on.
- We are cousins right?

185
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:31,000
We are a family.

186
02:51:32,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is
brother to me.

187
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Come on.
Take this shit off.

188
02:52:47,000 --> 02:53:29,000
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.

189
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:27,000
So what do I have to do?

190
02:54:29,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Spider told that old boy next door had a
bad ass whip.

191
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Told you we got him.

192
02:55:45,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Come on.

193
02:56:10,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.

194
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Yo, that's a nice car.

195
02:58:44,000 --> 02:59:28,000
1972 Gran Torino,  Fastback.

196
02:59:29,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.

197
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.

198
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:23,000
I've got one.

199
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:59,000
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into
the bar.

200
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:45,000
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"

201
03:02:55,000 --> 03:03:27,000
So, here?s where my flock
congregates when they?re not in church..

202
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel. Hey, Darrel.

203
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.

204
03:04:31,000 --> 03:05:06,000
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?

205
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:49,000
No, I just came down to talk
Walt if that's ok.

206
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?

207
03:06:45,000 --> 03:07:10,000
I promised your wife.

208
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:43,000
All right, let's get booze.

209
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:55,000
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.

210
03:08:56,000 --> 03:09:37,000
I'll have a  Diet Coke.
- Bullshit. This is a bar. You have a drink.

211
03:09:38,000 --> 03:10:21,000
I'll have a  gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!

212
03:10:35,000 --> 03:11:07,000
So, what you want?

213
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:37,000
I promised your wife I?d get you
to go to confession.

214
03:11:37,000 --> 03:12:12,000
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.

215
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:32,000
She made me.

216
03:12:33,000 --> 03:13:11,000
Well you're kinda found of promising
things you can?t deliver on, right, father?

217
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Let?s talk about something else.
- What?

218
03:13:39,000 --> 03:14:00,000
Life and death.

219
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:50,000
Life and death. What the hell do you know
about life and death?

220
03:14:51,000 --> 03:15:09,000
I?d like to think I know a lot.

221
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:29,000
I?m a priest..

222
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:58,000
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and
death.

223
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:27,000
But all what you know is what you learned
in a priest school.

224
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook

225
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:20,000
I don't know about that. I think...

226
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:39,000
That is bittersweet.

227
03:17:40,000 --> 03:18:23,000
Sort of bitter in its pain. But
sweet in its salvation.

228
03:18:24,000 --> 03:19:04,000
That's what you know of life and death,
and that's pathetic.

229
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:28,000
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

230
03:19:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
I know a lot. I lived there almost three
years in Korea. Thanks.

231
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:54,000
We shot men.

232
03:20:55,000 --> 03:21:59,000
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked
seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels

233
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:36,000
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.

234
03:22:37,000 --> 03:23:28,000
Horrible things,
but things I live with.

235
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:54,000
And what about life?

236
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:53,000
Well, I ...

237
03:24:54,000 --> 03:25:21,000
I survived the war.

238
03:25:47,000 --> 03:26:13,000
got married... and had a family.

239
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:57,000
Sounds like you know more about
death than you do living.

240
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:26,000
Maybe so, father.

241
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:49,000
Maybe so.

242
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:49,000
Son of a bitch.

243
03:39:46,000 --> 03:40:12,000
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!

244
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:33,000
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!

245
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:59,000
Fuck man, get in!

246
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:35,000
Hello?

247
03:44:36,000 --> 03:45:01,000
Morning, Dad, it?s your number one
son, Mitch.

248
03:45:02,000 --> 03:45:40,000
Morning? It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.

249
03:45:41,000 --> 03:46:18,000
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.

250
03:46:28,000 --> 03:47:03,000
So what do you want?
- What?

251
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:36,000
Me? Nothing. I mean, what would I want?

252
03:47:37,000 --> 03:48:29,000
Well, I don?t know. Your wife has already
gone through all of your mother?s jewelry.

253
03:48:39,000 --> 03:49:02,000
No, dad. I was just calling to see how are
you doing?

254
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:34,000
Well, anything new with the old
neighborhood?

255
03:49:38,000 --> 03:50:22,000
No.
- Great. Smooth sailing then.

256
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:54,000
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.

257
03:50:55,000 --> 03:51:27,000
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.

258
03:51:28,000 --> 03:52:23,000
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy
from the plant who has Lion season tickets?

259
03:53:04,000 --> 03:53:23,000
Dad?

260
03:58:32,000 --> 03:59:02,000
Ain't she sweet?

261
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:59,000
Come on.

262
04:04:27,000 --> 04:04:45,000
Hey, what's up?

263
04:04:46,000 --> 04:05:12,000
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.

264
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:54,000
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.

265
04:05:58,000 --> 04:06:19,000
What are you guys doing here?

266
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:46,000
What?

267
04:06:47,000 --> 04:07:17,000
Can I just come here to hang with my little
cousin?

268
04:08:00,000 --> 04:08:40,000
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?

269
04:08:41,000 --> 04:09:12,000
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.

270
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:43,000
Why not? - Come on, man, we are going to
give you another shot.

271
04:09:44,000 --> 04:10:11,000
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.

272
04:10:12,000 --> 04:10:38,000
Come on, let's go
- Come.

273
04:15:53,000 --> 04:16:22,000
What the hell is this?

274
04:16:38,000 --> 04:17:20,000
Get up.
- G?t off my lawn.

275
04:17:39,000 --> 04:18:02,000
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with
me.

276
04:18:03,000 --> 04:18:27,000
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.

277
04:18:28,000 --> 04:18:49,000
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.

278
04:18:50,000 --> 04:19:27,000
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face
and then I'll go in a house.

279
04:19:28,000 --> 04:19:57,000
And I'll sleep like a baby
You can count on that.

280
04:19:58,000 --> 04:20:35,000
We used to stack fucks like you five
feet high in Korea,

281
04:20:36,000 --> 04:21:06,000
used you for sandbags.

282
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:57,000
Ok.

283
04:22:04,000 --> 04:22:42,000
You better watch your back...

284
04:24:44,000 --> 04:25:04,000
Thank you.

285
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:42,000
Get off my lawn.

286
04:31:17,000 --> 04:31:43,000
What the hell is this?

287
04:33:27,000 --> 04:34:27,000
No, no, no, no more.

288
04:34:49,000 --> 04:35:19,000
Stay right there.

289
04:35:19,000 --> 04:35:37,000
Why can't you people just leave me alone?

290
04:35:37,000 --> 04:35:55,000
We brought you some shallots to plant in
the garden.

291
04:35:55,000 --> 04:36:12,000
I don't want them. They?re perennials, they
come back every year.

292
04:36:12,000 --> 04:36:47,000
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage
anyway.

293
04:36:48,000 --> 04:37:09,000
Because

294
04:37:12,000 --> 04:37:30,000
Because you saved, Tao.

295
04:37:31,000 --> 04:38:17,000
I didn't save anybody. I just. I kept a
bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .

296
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:41,000
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.

297
04:38:41,000 --> 04:39:11,000
Too bad, they think you are and that?s why
they're keep bringing you the gifts.

298
04:39:11,000 --> 04:39:28,000
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.

299
04:39:28,000 --> 04:40:09,000
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!

300
04:40:34,000 --> 04:41:07,000
This is my mom, Vu, I?m Sue and
that's  my brother, Tao.

301
04:41:08,000 --> 04:41:34,000
We live next door.
- So?

302
04:41:35,000 --> 04:42:08,000
Tao wants to say something.

303
04:42:22,000 --> 04:43:00,000
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?

304
04:43:01,000 --> 04:43:25,000
For trying to steal your car.

305
04:43:43,000 --> 04:44:05,000
Let me tell you something boy.

306
04:44:06,000 --> 04:44:49,000
You step on this property again, you are
done...

307
04:48:33,000 --> 04:48:56,000
Good afternoon, Walt.

308
04:49:00,000 --> 04:49:45,000
I  told you I?m not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?

309
04:49:46,000 --> 04:50:05,000
What?

310
04:50:06,000 --> 04:50:25,000
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I

311
04:50:25,000 --> 04:50:47,000
heard there was some trouble
in the neighborhood.

312
04:50:48,000 --> 04:51:16,000
Why didn't call the police?

313
04:51:21,000 --> 04:51:41,000
Well ...

314
04:51:53,000 --> 04:52:42,000
You know why, I've prayed that they would
show up, but..

315
04:52:43,000 --> 04:53:16,000
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?

316
04:53:17,000 --> 04:53:54,000
Someone could have been killed.
We?re talking life and death here.

317
04:53:55,000 --> 04:54:29,000
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.

318
04:54:30,000 --> 04:55:14,000
When we were in Korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our land..

319
04:55:15,000 --> 04:56:02,000
... we didn't call the police. We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,

320
04:56:14,000 --> 04:56:46,000
I?ve been thinking about our
conversation on life and death.

321
04:56:47,000 --> 04:57:05,000
About what you said.

322
04:57:06,000 --> 04:57:45,000
About how you carry around all the horrible
things you were forced to do

323
04:57:45,000 --> 04:58:10,000
Horrible things that won?t leave you.

324
04:58:12,000 --> 04:59:05,000
It seems that it would do you good to
unload some of that burden.

325
04:59:07,000 --> 04:59:35,000
Things done during war are terrible.

326
04:59:36,000 --> 04:59:56,000
being ordered to kill ...

327
04:59:57,000 --> 05:00:27,000
killing to save yourself,
killing to save others.

328
05:00:28,000 --> 05:01:09,000
You?re right, those are things I
know nothing about.

329
05:01:14,000 --> 05:01:37,000
But I do know about forgiveness.

330
05:01:38,000 --> 05:02:18,000
And I?ve  seen a lot of men who
have confessed their sins,

331
05:02:18,000 --> 05:02:57,000
admitted their guilt and left
their burdens behind them.

332
05:02:58,000 --> 05:03:21,000
Stronger men than you!

333
05:03:23,000 --> 05:03:53,000
Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things...

334
05:03:54,000 --> 05:04:21,000
and are now at peace.

335
05:04:23,000 --> 05:05:16,000
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You
came here with your guns loaded this time.

336
05:05:17,000 --> 05:05:53,000
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.

337
05:05:54,000 --> 05:06:34,000
About stronger men than me,
reaching their salvation.

338
05:06:34,000 --> 05:07:05,000
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.

339
05:07:06,000 --> 05:07:59,000
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

340
05:08:00,000 --> 05:08:59,000
The thing that haunts a man the most is what
he isn?t ordered to do.

341
05:09:45,000 --> 05:10:21,000
There, finally, you look like a human being
again. .

342
05:10:22,000 --> 05:11:01,000
You shouldn?t wait so long
between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.

343
05:11:02,000 --> 05:11:24,000
Well I am surprised you are still around.

344
05:11:24,000 --> 05:11:44,000
I was always hoping that
you die off and they get

345
05:11:44,000 --> 05:12:08,000
somebody in here they knew what
the hell they are doing.

346
05:12:08,000 --> 05:12:45,000
Instead you just keep hanging around, like
the dump wop dago you are.

347
05:12:46,000 --> 05:13:29,000
- That?ll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.

348
05:13:29,000 --> 05:14:03,000
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.

349
05:14:03,000 --> 05:14:35,000
It?s been ten bucks for the last
five years and you hard-mellows,

350
05:14:35,000 --> 05:14:46,000
Pollack son of a bitch.

351
05:14:47,000 --> 05:15:30,000
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.

352
05:15:32,000 --> 05:16:05,000
Not if I see you first, dipshit.

353
05:17:29,000 --> 05:17:48,000
That's cool, you know.

354
05:18:52,000 --> 05:19:23,000
Look at this.

355
05:19:47,000 --> 05:20:22,000
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.

356
05:20:23,000 --> 05:21:02,000
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.

357
05:21:18,000 --> 05:22:00,000
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.

358
05:22:07,000 --> 05:22:29,000
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood,
boy?

359
05:22:30,000 --> 05:23:22,000
None, Just going to the corner spot, you
know get some CDs, sound good, bro?

360
05:23:22,000 --> 05:23:58,000
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?

361
05:23:59,000 --> 05:24:17,000
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.

362
05:24:18,000 --> 05:24:47,000
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your
motherfucking face off .

363
05:24:48,000 --> 05:25:27,000
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?

364
05:25:28,000 --> 05:26:10,000
You here to bring this little present?

365
05:26:11,000 --> 05:26:50,000
Oriental yummy? Don't worry, I'll take a
real good care with her.

366
05:26:51,000 --> 05:27:24,000
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!

367
05:27:49,000 --> 05:28:13,000
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.

368
05:28:35,000 --> 05:28:57,000
Keep your ass right here.

369
05:28:58,000 --> 05:29:10,000
Oh great.

370
05:29:11,000 --> 05:29:55,000
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian
girls. God, it gets so old.

371
05:29:56,000 --> 05:30:17,000
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?

372
05:30:18,000 --> 05:30:34,000
My name?

373
05:30:35,000 --> 05:30:52,000
Get your ass out of here, okay.

374
05:30:53,000 --> 05:31:04,000
It?s 'take your crude,

375
05:31:04,000 --> 05:31:39,000
overly obvious come-on to every woman
who walks past and cram it.'

376
05:31:40,000 --> 05:32:00,000
That?s my name.

377
05:32:18,000 --> 05:32:35,000
Who do you think you are talking to?

378
05:32:36,000 --> 05:33:15,000
Who does it look like?

379
05:33:21,000 --> 05:33:42,000
Man she's tough.
- What? You gonna hit me now?

380
05:33:42,000 --> 05:34:03,000
That'd pretty much complete the picture.

381
05:34:04,000 --> 05:34:23,000
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

382
05:34:23,000 --> 05:34:49,000
Put a choke chain on her and
yank that motherfucker.

383
05:34:50,000 --> 05:35:16,000
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype
thesaurus - Oh yeah

384
05:35:16,000 --> 05:35:54,000
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same
sentence. -Bitch is crazy.

385
05:35:55,000 --> 05:36:28,000
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.

386
05:37:14,000 --> 05:37:54,000
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson

387
05:37:55,000 --> 05:38:21,000
Stop! Let me go!

388
05:38:46,000 --> 05:39:08,000
Take your ass over there.

389
05:39:49,000 --> 05:40:16,000
What the fuck are you looking at old man?

390
05:40:20,000 --> 05:40:44,000
What the hell are you spooks up to?

391
05:40:45,000 --> 05:40:59,000
Spooks?

392
05:41:00,000 --> 05:41:31,000
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while
I still let you.

393
05:41:32,000 --> 05:41:55,000
That's you'd better do.

394
05:41:56,000 --> 05:42:23,000
What the fuck he thinks he is?

395
05:44:00,000 --> 05:44:31,000
Have you noticed how you come across
somebody once in a while  ...

396
05:44:32,000 --> 05:45:06,000
... you shouldn't fucking with?

397
05:45:33,000 --> 05:45:55,000
That's me.

398
05:46:01,000 --> 05:46:23,000
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.

399
05:46:24,000 --> 05:47:09,000
Why don't you get your ass out of here
before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.

400
05:47:29,000 --> 05:47:58,000
What's wrong with him man?

401
05:48:44,000 --> 05:49:34,000
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing? What the hell?

402
05:49:38,000 --> 05:50:04,000
Get in a truck.

403
05:50:20,000 --> 05:51:13,000
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.

404
05:51:15,000 --> 05:52:04,000
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!

405
05:52:15,000 --> 05:52:41,000
You don't fucking listen, do you?

406
05:52:42,000 --> 05:53:19,000
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.

407
05:53:19,000 --> 05:54:01,000
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.

408
05:54:04,000 --> 05:54:35,000
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?

409
05:54:39,000 --> 05:54:58,000
You want to be superb page, or something

410
05:54:58,000 --> 05:55:23,000
These guy don't want to be your bro and I
don't blame them.

411
05:55:23,000 --> 05:55:59,000
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down
the road.

412
05:56:56,000 --> 05:57:21,000
Take care now.

413
05:57:45,000 --> 05:58:06,000
You too.

414
05:58:35,000 --> 05:59:00,000
Oh, yeah.

415
06:00:37,000 --> 06:01:00,000
Why didn't you do nothing?

416
06:01:01,000 --> 06:01:15,000
Man you fucking!

417
06:01:16,000 --> 06:01:50,000
Shit man.

418
06:01:51,000 --> 06:02:26,000
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you
would do nothing.

419
06:02:29,000 --> 06:02:57,000
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?

420
06:03:03,000 --> 06:03:28,000
Trying to get yourself killed?

421
06:03:29,000 --> 06:03:57,000
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to
be smart.

422
06:03:57,000 --> 06:04:16,000
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that

423
06:04:16,000 --> 06:04:35,000
is the fast way to get
you in the obituaries.

424
06:04:35,000 --> 06:05:02,000
I know, I know. Take it easy.

425
06:05:03,000 --> 06:05:30,000
And what about that goofball guy you were
with.

426
06:05:31,000 --> 06:05:56,000
Is that a date or something?

427
06:05:59,000 --> 06:06:52,000
Yeah, kind of. His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.

428
06:06:53,000 --> 06:07:26,000
You should be hanging out with your
own people.  The other Hummongs.

429
06:07:26,000 --> 06:07:35,000
- You mean, Hmong?

430
06:07:36,000 --> 06:08:25,000
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.

431
06:08:30,000 --> 06:09:14,000
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?

432
06:09:23,000 --> 06:09:54,000
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?

433
06:09:54,000 --> 06:10:22,000
No, Hmong is not a place,
it is a people.

434
06:10:23,000 --> 06:11:06,000
My people come from different parts
of Laos, Thailand and China.

435
06:11:07,000 --> 06:11:52,000
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?

436
06:11:53,000 --> 06:12:09,000
It's Vietnam thing.

437
06:12:10,000 --> 06:12:39,000
We thought on your side
And when American quit ...

438
06:12:40,000 --> 06:13:03,000
... the communists started killing all the
Hmong.

439
06:13:04,000 --> 06:13:23,000
So we came over here.

440
06:13:24,000 --> 06:14:01,000
Yeah, well I don't know how
you ended up in Midwest.

441
06:14:01,000 --> 06:14:32,000
Snow on the ground six months in the year.

442
06:14:33,000 --> 06:15:06,000
What is it? Jungle people wanted to be
on great frozen tundra?

443
06:15:07,000 --> 06:16:02,000
Hill people. We are hill people. Not jungle
people. BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!

444
06:16:03,000 --> 06:16:29,000
Yeah, whatever ...

445
06:16:29,000 --> 06:16:53,000
Blame the Lutherans. They brought
us up here.

446
06:16:54,000 --> 06:17:31,000
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

447
06:17:32,000 --> 06:18:25,000
Well,  you'd think the cold will keep all
the idiots out.

448
06:18:36,000 --> 06:18:57,000
Thanks for the ride.

449
06:18:58,000 --> 06:19:27,000
You know something kid, you are all right.

450
06:19:28,000 --> 06:20:12,000
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?

451
06:20:13,000 --> 06:21:15,000
Tao is actually really smart. He just
doesn't know what direction to go in.

452
06:21:19,000 --> 06:21:49,000
Poor toad.
- It is really common.

453
06:21:50,000 --> 06:22:09,000
Hmong girls over here fit in better.

454
06:22:10,000 --> 06:22:46,000
The girls go to college
and the boys go to jail.

455
06:25:04,000 --> 06:25:39,000
That old hag hates my ass.

456
06:27:09,000 --> 06:27:43,000
Your birthday today, Daisy.

457
06:27:44,000 --> 06:28:26,000
This year you have to make a choice between
two life paths.

458
06:28:27,000 --> 06:28:48,000
Second chances come your way.

459
06:28:49,000 --> 06:29:40,000
Extraordinary events culminate in what
might seem to be an anticlimax.

460
06:29:41,000 --> 06:31:07,000
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and
99.

461
06:31:13,000 --> 06:31:42,000
What a load of shit.

462
06:31:58,000 --> 06:32:17,000
Yea.

463
06:34:37,000 --> 06:35:10,000
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?

464
06:35:26,000 --> 06:35:45,000
All right.

465
06:35:46,000 --> 06:36:36,000
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.

466
06:37:06,000 --> 06:37:27,000
How about that?

467
06:37:31,000 --> 06:37:58,000
How about that, Daisy?

468
06:39:43,000 --> 06:40:18,000
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.

469
06:41:49,000 --> 06:42:30,000
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.

470
06:42:44,000 --> 06:43:21,000
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.

471
06:43:22,000 --> 06:44:00,000
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.

472
06:44:07,000 --> 06:44:31,000
This is from me.

473
06:44:32,000 --> 06:45:00,000
It's a phone.

474
06:45:07,000 --> 06:45:26,000
Oh, I can see that.

475
06:45:26,000 --> 06:46:08,000
I just thought...well, we thought
that it would make things easier.

476
06:46:09,000 --> 06:46:21,000
Thank you, Karen.

477
06:46:22,000 --> 06:46:52,000
There?s nothing wrong with making
things less hard on yourself.

478
06:46:52,000 --> 06:47:18,000
You know Karen?s right, Dad. You?ve worked
hard your whole life.

479
06:47:18,000 --> 06:48:05,000
Maybe it's time you start thinking about
taking it a easier?

480
06:48:17,000 --> 06:48:59,000
And some other thing, Dad. You really
should get rid of the coffin nails.

481
06:49:02,000 --> 06:49:28,000
We were thinking about the house.

482
06:49:29,000 --> 06:50:05,000
You know, when Mom?s gone, it?s got to be a
lot to maintain around here.

483
06:50:06,000 --> 06:50:51,000
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...

484
06:50:52,000 --> 06:51:33,000
Yeah, you know, there?s these great places
now, you know, these communities

485
06:51:33,000 --> 06:52:06,000
Where you don?t have to worry about mowing
the lawn or shoveling snow.

486
06:52:07,000 --> 06:52:58,000
You know, People who are like you, active
and alert, but are alone.

487
06:52:58,000 --> 06:53:34,000
And would benefit from being around folks
their own age.

488
06:53:35,000 --> 06:54:09,000
Yeah Dad, look. You got to check it out. We
brought some brochures.

489
06:54:09,000 --> 06:54:43,000
These places are nothing like that you
think they would be. They are great.

490
06:54:43,000 --> 06:54:55,000
- No, they are beautiful.

491
06:54:56,000 --> 06:55:26,000
They are really nice
They really are.

492
06:55:27,000 --> 06:55:51,000
These are top-notch like resorts.

493
06:55:52,000 --> 06:56:25,000
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.

494
06:56:26,000 --> 06:56:38,000
They really are.
- Yeah.

495
06:56:39,000 --> 06:57:15,000
They care of everything.
They clean up. They're really nice.

496
06:57:16,000 --> 06:57:43,000
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you
can buy new shoes.

497
06:57:43,000 --> 06:57:57,000
They are amazing, they really are.

498
06:57:57,000 --> 06:58:38,000
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.

499
06:58:39,000 --> 06:59:02,000
Meet other people.

500
06:59:12,000 --> 06:59:48,000
Son of a bitch. Kicked us out on his
birthday. I've told you that was a bad idea.

501
06:59:48,000 --> 07:00:16,000
I know, you were right
- He  won?t let anybody help him.

502
07:00:16,000 --> 07:00:35,000
Well, we tried. Now can we just drop it?

503
07:00:36,000 --> 07:00:54,000
No one can say we didn?t try

504
07:00:54,000 --> 07:01:20,000
What the hell with him,
we shouldn't have done it.

505
07:01:21,000 --> 07:01:41,000
We should?ve stayed home with Josh and
Ashley.

506
07:01:41,000 --> 07:02:09,000
At least they were smart
enough to not come here.

507
07:02:09,000 --> 07:02:35,000
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.

508
07:02:46,000 --> 07:03:17,000
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?

509
07:06:31,000 --> 07:07:07,000
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?

510
07:07:23,000 --> 07:07:48,000
We?re having a barbecue. You want
to come over?

511
07:07:49,000 --> 07:08:26,000
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.

512
07:08:27,000 --> 07:09:25,000
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries. We only eat cats.

513
07:09:26,000 --> 07:09:54,000
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.

514
07:09:55,000 --> 07:10:42,000
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.

515
07:10:50,000 --> 07:11:09,000
Yeah ...

516
07:11:21,000 --> 07:12:16,000
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?

517
07:12:20,000 --> 07:13:06,000
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.

518
07:13:07,000 --> 07:13:51,000
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.

519
07:14:07,000 --> 07:14:24,000
Well ...

520
07:14:25,000 --> 07:15:35,000
I might as well drink with strangers better
than drinking alone. It is my birthday.

521
07:15:36,000 --> 07:16:26,000
Really. Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.

522
07:17:33,000 --> 07:18:41,000
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."

523
07:18:47,000 --> 07:19:30,000
What am I doing wrong? Every time I look at
somebody they always look at the ground.

524
07:20:34,000 --> 07:20:57,000
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.

525
07:20:57,000 --> 07:21:29,000
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.

526
07:21:32,000 --> 07:22:05,000
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.

527
07:22:07,000 --> 07:22:26,000
Okay.

528
07:23:32,000 --> 07:24:11,000
What?! What are all you fish heads looking
at anyway?

529
07:24:12,000 --> 07:25:00,000
I think we should go to other room. Sorry.

530
07:25:39,000 --> 07:26:02,000
All the people in this house are very
traditional.

531
07:26:02,000 --> 07:26:31,000
Number 1. Never touch a Hmong person on the
head,

532
07:26:32,000 --> 07:27:14,000
not even a child.. Hmong-people
believe that the soul resides on the head.

533
07:27:15,000 --> 07:27:51,000
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.

534
07:27:52,000 --> 07:28:40,000
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking
at someone eye to be very rude.

535
07:28:41,000 --> 07:29:19,000
That's why they look away, when you look at
them. - Anything else?

536
07:29:20,000 --> 07:30:12,000
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or
grin when they?re yelled at.

537
07:30:13,000 --> 07:30:35,000
It's a cultural thing.

538
07:30:36,000 --> 07:31:00,000
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity,

539
07:31:00,000 --> 07:31:28,000
it's not that they?re laughing
at you, really.

540
07:31:29,000 --> 07:31:54,000
You people are nuts

541
07:32:16,000 --> 07:32:36,000
But the food..

542
07:32:37,000 --> 07:33:27,000
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.

543
07:33:29,000 --> 07:34:06,000
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.

544
07:35:36,000 --> 07:36:01,000
Here you go.
- Thanks. You mentioned about..

545
07:36:02,000 --> 07:36:36,000
looking at people, he's been staring at me
the whole evening.

546
07:36:37,000 --> 07:37:06,000
That's  Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.

547
07:37:07,000 --> 07:37:40,000
What's that some sort of witch doctor or
something. -  Something like that.

548
07:37:41,000 --> 07:38:25,000
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.

549
07:40:54,000 --> 07:41:20,000
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.

550
07:41:21,000 --> 07:41:34,000
He would like to read you.

551
07:41:35,000 --> 07:42:12,000
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.

552
07:42:14,000 --> 07:43:01,000
Yeah sure. It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.

553
07:45:50,000 --> 07:46:34,000
He says people do not respect you. They
don't even want to look at you.

554
07:47:34,000 --> 07:48:20,000
He says the way you live, your food has no
flavor. You wearied by your life.

555
07:49:46,000 --> 07:50:22,000
You made a mistake. And you past life
is like a mistake what you did.

556
07:50:22,000 --> 07:50:37,000
You are not satisfied with.

557
07:51:37,000 --> 07:52:35,000
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.

558
07:56:43,000 --> 07:57:06,000
Are you all right?

559
07:57:12,000 --> 07:57:47,000
Yeah, I am fine.

560
07:57:48,000 --> 07:58:22,000
Fine, I am fine.

561
08:01:46,000 --> 08:02:10,000
God,  I?ve got more in common with these

562
08:02:10,000 --> 08:02:41,000
gooks than I have with my
own spoiled-rotten family.

563
08:02:42,000 --> 08:03:09,000
Jesus Christ ...

564
08:03:31,000 --> 08:03:58,000
Happy Birthday.

565
08:04:09,000 --> 08:04:51,000
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.

566
08:04:56,000 --> 08:05:35,000
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.

567
08:05:36,000 --> 08:05:47,000
It's nothing.

568
08:05:48,000 --> 08:06:33,000
Why don't we get down and get some of that
good gook food. I am starving.

569
08:06:33,000 --> 08:06:53,000
Okay.

570
08:07:56,000 --> 08:08:21,000
You ladies are wonderful.

571
08:08:21,000 --> 08:08:47,000
That stuff is really good.

572
08:10:06,000 --> 08:10:32,000
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?

573
08:10:33,000 --> 08:10:58,000
Let's go.
- What for?

574
08:10:59,000 --> 08:11:40,000
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.

575
08:11:41,000 --> 08:12:16,000
No. You told me not to leave you alone.

576
08:12:47,000 --> 08:13:23,000
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.

577
08:13:37,000 --> 08:14:16,000
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .

578
08:15:59,000 --> 08:16:47,000
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.

579
08:16:48,000 --> 08:17:38,000
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.

580
08:22:40,000 --> 08:23:23,000
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.

581
08:28:19,000 --> 08:28:31,000
What's this?

582
08:28:32,000 --> 08:29:02,000
Little rice liquor
Here, try it.

583
08:29:03,000 --> 08:29:23,000
All right.

584
08:33:17,000 --> 08:33:44,000
My friends and I were just
wondering what you?re doing here?

585
08:33:45,000 --> 08:34:20,000
That's a good question. What am I doing
here?

586
08:34:25,000 --> 08:34:55,000
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt. I am Wa Xam.

587
08:34:56,000 --> 08:35:35,000
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.

588
08:35:37,000 --> 08:36:27,000
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?

589
08:36:28,000 --> 08:36:59,000
I fix things. Stuff like that.
- Like what?

590
08:37:00,000 --> 08:37:32,000
I've just fixed that dryer over there.

591
08:37:33,000 --> 08:38:04,000
I fixed my wife's friend sink.

592
08:38:05,000 --> 08:38:55,000
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a
prescription. Fixed up.

593
08:38:56,000 --> 08:39:34,000
I've even the fixed the door, what had't
even broken yet.

594
08:39:35,000 --> 08:39:52,000
You're funny

595
08:39:53,000 --> 08:40:26,000
I've been called a lot of things, but never
funny.

596
08:40:27,000 --> 08:41:22,000
Well, I have to take off. Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum. Later.

597
08:41:59,000 --> 08:42:26,000
Come on.

598
08:43:06,000 --> 08:43:49,000
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.

599
08:43:55,000 --> 08:44:27,000
I'd look down too if
I was you.

600
08:44:27,000 --> 08:44:53,000
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the
first time I ever saw you.

601
08:44:53,000 --> 08:45:56,000
You?re worse with women than
you are with stealing cars, Toad.

602
08:46:03,000 --> 08:46:32,000
It's  Tao.
- What?

603
08:46:33,000 --> 08:47:03,000
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.

604
08:47:04,000 --> 08:47:27,000
You were blowing it with that girl who was
there.

605
08:47:28,000 --> 08:48:00,000
Not that I give two shits about a Toad
like you.

606
08:48:01,000 --> 08:48:18,000
You don't what you are talking about.

607
08:48:19,000 --> 08:48:51,000
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.

608
08:48:52,000 --> 08:49:15,000
I may not be the most
pleasant person to be around.

609
08:49:16,000 --> 08:49:52,000
But I got the best woman who was ever
on this planet to marry me.

610
08:49:52,000 --> 08:50:24,000
I had to work at it. That was the best
thing that ever happened to me. Hangs down.

611
08:50:24,000 --> 08:50:37,000
But you ... you know

612
08:50:38,000 --> 08:51:31,000
You let Click Clack,  Ding Dong and Charlie
Chan just walk out with what?s-her-face.

613
08:51:32,000 --> 08:52:08,000
She likes you, you know. I don't know why.

614
08:52:11,000 --> 08:52:33,000
Who?

615
08:52:38,000 --> 08:52:55,000
Yum yum!

616
08:52:56,000 --> 08:53:50,000
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.

617
08:54:01,000 --> 08:54:39,000
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.

618
08:54:40,000 --> 08:55:18,000
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.

619
08:55:19,000 --> 08:55:54,000
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.

620
08:55:55,000 --> 08:56:29,000
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.

621
08:56:46,000 --> 08:57:07,000
Well ...

622
08:57:09,000 --> 08:58:01,000
I gotta go. Good day. Puss cake.

623
09:00:12,000 --> 09:00:39,000
No, no more.

624
09:01:02,000 --> 09:01:29,000
Okay, put them over there.

625
09:03:51,000 --> 09:04:30,000
No. No. No more
No more. No more.

626
09:04:49,000 --> 09:05:15,000
No more, please ...

627
09:05:23,000 --> 09:05:53,000
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought
before?

628
09:05:53,000 --> 09:06:14,000
Alright.

629
09:07:09,000 --> 09:07:41,000
Better than beef jerky all the time.

630
09:09:47,000 --> 09:10:09,000
What's going on?

631
09:10:21,000 --> 09:10:45,000
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.

632
09:10:45,000 --> 09:11:15,000
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.

633
09:11:16,000 --> 09:11:41,000
He's not gonna work for me.

634
09:11:42,000 --> 09:12:20,000
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.

635
09:12:21,000 --> 09:12:48,000
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.

636
09:12:49,000 --> 09:13:30,000
I don't even want him on my property
I thought we went over all that.

637
09:13:39,000 --> 09:14:01,000
It is very important to my mom that you
accept.

638
09:14:01,000 --> 09:14:20,000
And that would be an insult if you refuse.

639
09:14:21,000 --> 09:15:01,000
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ...

640
09:15:02,000 --> 09:15:25,000
all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this
thing.

641
09:15:26,000 --> 09:15:50,000
Look my family is very traditional

642
09:15:51,000 --> 09:16:20,000
and would be very much upset if you don't
let Tao repay.

643
09:16:21,000 --> 09:16:48,000
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's
just go.

644
09:16:49,000 --> 09:17:22,000
Shut up!

645
09:17:33,000 --> 09:18:00,000
Yeah, shut up.

646
09:18:00,000 --> 09:18:56,000
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.

647
09:19:01,000 --> 09:19:21,000
Thank you.

648
09:19:31,000 --> 09:20:25,000
Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads
are like badgers.

649
09:21:10,000 --> 09:21:44,000
Son of a bitch. I never thought he'd show.

650
09:22:51,000 --> 09:23:20,000
All right, what are you good at?

651
09:23:27,000 --> 09:24:10,000
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.

652
09:24:17,000 --> 09:24:41,000
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what
you are good at.

653
09:24:42,000 --> 09:25:26,000
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.

654
09:25:28,000 --> 09:26:02,000
That's kind of half way what I expected you
to say.

655
09:26:10,000 --> 09:27:01,000
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.

656
09:27:03,000 --> 09:27:40,000
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?

657
09:27:41,000 --> 09:28:17,000
All you slopes are supposed to be good at
math, right?

658
09:28:19,000 --> 09:28:49,000
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.

659
09:29:50,000 --> 09:30:22,000
One, two ...

660
09:30:59,000 --> 09:31:39,000
So, what do you have for me to do?  You
want me to watch paint dry

661
09:31:39,000 --> 09:32:01,000
or maybe count the clouds that pass by?

662
09:32:02,000 --> 09:32:28,000
Don't get flip with me, boy.

663
09:32:32,000 --> 09:33:06,000
I am not the one who is trying to steal,
don't you forget that.

664
09:33:24,000 --> 09:33:38,000
Go ahead.

665
09:33:39,000 --> 09:34:02,000
I don?t care if you insult me and say
racist things.

666
09:34:02,000 --> 09:34:41,000
Cause you know what? I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.

667
09:34:42,000 --> 09:35:14,000
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls,
kid.

668
09:35:30,000 --> 09:36:32,000
Look, I am stuck here. Why don't you find
something useful for me to do.

669
09:36:36,000 --> 09:37:25,000
Unlike you, I am not useless. And I
maintain my own property.

670
09:37:28,000 --> 09:38:11,000
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you
just can help it.

671
09:38:25,000 --> 09:38:54,000
How long do I have you for?

672
09:39:17,000 --> 09:39:47,000
Toad, how long?

673
09:39:47,000 --> 09:40:11,000
Till next Friday.

674
09:40:42,000 --> 09:41:32,000
All right. Go get the ladder out of the
garage.

675
09:41:56,000 --> 09:42:21,000
When you got finished with that roof there.

676
09:42:21,000 --> 09:42:48,000
You can take that gutter,
and nail it back up.

677
09:42:49,000 --> 09:43:21,000
I am tired looking at it for the last three
years.

678
09:44:36,000 --> 09:45:02,000
Yeah, you said it, brother.

679
09:55:51,000 --> 09:56:06,000
Hello.

680
09:56:07,000 --> 09:56:24,000
Grandpa says he want to know if

681
09:56:25,000 --> 09:57:31,000
you can have Tao clear out the big
wasp nest under our porch?

682
09:57:32,000 --> 09:58:13,000
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.

683
09:58:21,000 --> 09:58:51,000
I think we can handle that after the lunch.

684
10:04:56,000 --> 10:05:24,000
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.

685
10:05:25,000 --> 10:06:07,000
It's my last day. What else do have for me
do?

686
10:06:27,000 --> 10:07:03,000
Take a day-off. You did enough.

687
10:07:53,000 --> 10:08:12,000
Toad!

688
10:08:46,000 --> 10:09:15,000
Nothing.
Nevermind.

689
10:13:26,000 --> 10:13:47,000
Kowski?

690
10:14:03,000 --> 10:14:25,000
Kowski?

691
10:14:35,000 --> 10:14:55,000
Kowski?

692
10:15:59,000 --> 10:16:27,000
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.

693
10:16:28,000 --> 10:16:53,000
I looked over your paperwork and I think we

694
10:16:53,000 --> 10:17:21,000
should immediately start
a full battery of tests

695
10:17:22,000 --> 10:17:48,000
I feel that this would be the best way to go

696
10:17:48,000 --> 10:18:15,000
about checking all the
issues that you've had.

697
10:18:16,000 --> 10:19:03,000
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my
regular doctor?

698
10:19:04,000 --> 10:19:56,000
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago. I am
his replacement Dr. Chang.

699
10:21:12,000 --> 10:21:30,000
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.

700
10:21:30,000 --> 10:21:57,000
You talk to him!
Mitch.

701
10:22:01,000 --> 10:22:46,000
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.

702
10:23:30,000 --> 10:23:43,000
Hey, Dad.

703
10:23:44,000 --> 10:24:27,000
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.

704
10:24:28,000 --> 10:24:51,000
Yeah, I know.
What's up?

705
10:24:52,000 --> 10:25:21,000
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.

706
10:25:26,000 --> 10:25:39,000
How is everything going?

707
10:25:40,000 --> 10:26:07,000
I am fine, fine.

708
10:26:14,000 --> 10:27:08,000
How about Karen and the kids?

709
10:27:10,000 --> 10:27:47,000
Fine, everybody is great. Doing fine.

710
10:27:48,000 --> 10:28:22,000
Good. How about work?

711
10:28:23,000 --> 10:28:55,000
Busy.

712
10:28:55,000 --> 10:29:19,000
Yeah, I suppose...

713
10:29:20,000 --> 10:29:41,000
In fact, um, speaking of busy.

714
10:29:41,000 --> 10:30:31,000
I got a lot on my plate right now,
so if it is not something pressing.

715
10:30:39,000 --> 10:31:20,000
No, not it all.

716
10:31:21,000 --> 10:31:38,000
Why don't you call me this weekend?

717
10:31:39,000 --> 10:31:57,000
Sure.

718
10:31:58,000 --> 10:32:27,000
Ok, It was nice talking to you. Thanks for
talk.

719
10:32:28,000 --> 10:33:03,000
Thanks.

720
10:40:24,000 --> 10:40:57,000
This kid doesn't have a chance.

721
10:43:19,000 --> 10:43:43,000
What do you know about faucets?

722
10:43:44,000 --> 10:44:10,000
I know a lot about them, boy.

723
10:44:13,000 --> 10:44:38,000
Tender side.

724
10:44:39,000 --> 10:45:14,000
Jesus. For the love of Pete.
- What?

725
10:45:15,000 --> 10:46:03,000
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.

726
10:47:30,000 --> 10:48:00,000
This place is wobbling apart.

727
10:48:35,000 --> 10:49:03,000
Where did you get all the stuff?

728
10:49:03,000 --> 10:49:44,000
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.

729
10:49:52,000 --> 10:50:26,000
Well, may come as surprise to a thief,

730
10:50:27,000 --> 10:51:01,000
but I bought this stuff. Everything in here
with my own money.

731
10:51:02,000 --> 10:51:48,000
Yeah, yeah. This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.

732
10:51:48,000 --> 10:52:49,000
Yeah, well. Every tool in here has a
purpose. Everything has a job to do.

733
10:52:49,000 --> 10:53:36,000
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?

734
10:53:37,000 --> 10:54:00,000
it is a post hole digger.
- That

735
10:54:01,000 --> 10:54:21,000
Vice-grips.

736
10:54:21,000 --> 10:54:54,000
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.

737
10:54:55,000 --> 10:55:15,000
There is shears right there,
and that's a saw.

738
10:55:16,000 --> 10:55:48,000
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.

739
10:56:13,000 --> 10:56:40,000
Alright, what's on your mind.

740
10:56:44,000 --> 10:57:23,000
It's just.. I can't afford to buy all this
stuff.

741
10:57:24,000 --> 10:58:03,000
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you,
could understand...

742
10:58:04,000 --> 10:58:36,000
that a man acquires it over the period of
50 years.

743
10:58:37,000 --> 10:59:23,000
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.

744
10:59:29,000 --> 11:00:01,000
These three items right here, you can have
this.

745
11:00:02,000 --> 11:00:57,000
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.

746
11:00:58,000 --> 11:01:17,000
Any man who is worth his salt,

747
11:01:17,000 --> 11:01:54,000
can do half of the house chores
with just those three things.

748
11:01:55,000 --> 11:02:19,000
Anything else you need you just borrow it,
that's all.

749
11:02:19,000 --> 11:02:50,000
Ok, cool.

750
11:04:19,000 --> 11:04:44,000
Fuck me.
- What's with that?

751
11:04:45,000 --> 11:05:08,000
Nothing.
What?

752
11:05:09,000 --> 11:05:38,000
Nothing, huh? I just saw
you've coughed out blood.

753
11:05:38,000 --> 11:06:07,000
That's not good. You should
really see a doctor.

754
11:06:44,000 --> 11:07:05,000
Look..

755
11:07:08,000 --> 11:07:41,000
Those guys over here, the other night ...

756
11:07:44,000 --> 11:08:32,000
on my lawn, what a bout them? - Just a
gang. A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.

757
11:08:33,000 --> 11:09:00,000
I assume that.
What they were doing here?

758
11:09:01,000 --> 11:09:22,000
They were going to take me away.

759
11:09:22,000 --> 11:10:03,000
They were kind of pissed, that
I blew my first initiation.

760
11:10:04,000 --> 11:11:05,000
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy. You
wanna hang out with guys like that.

761
11:11:06,000 --> 11:11:38,000
What was your initiation supposed to be?

762
11:13:06,000 --> 11:13:31,000
My Gran Torino?

763
11:18:11,000 --> 11:18:35,000
Toad, you got a minute?

764
11:19:04,000 --> 11:19:23,000
Here it is.

765
11:19:24,000 --> 11:19:38,000
Here is the deal.

766
11:19:39,000 --> 11:20:07,000
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.

767
11:20:08,000 --> 11:20:50,000
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.

768
11:20:51,000 --> 11:21:09,000
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.

769
11:21:10,000 --> 11:21:26,000
No, no, I've got a top.

770
11:21:27,000 --> 11:21:46,000
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.

771
11:21:47,000 --> 11:22:08,000
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.

772
11:22:09,000 --> 11:22:42,000
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping. I will go back home.

773
11:22:42,000 --> 11:23:07,000
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!

774
11:23:08,000 --> 11:23:29,000
I am here because you need help.

775
11:23:30,000 --> 11:23:57,000
So it is either top of I am
out of here.

776
11:24:26,000 --> 11:25:21,000
All right, you take the top and I'll push.

777
11:25:22,000 --> 11:26:14,000
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands
and crush me.

778
11:26:19,000 --> 11:26:48,000
Don't give me any ideas.

779
11:28:16,000 --> 11:28:45,000
That thing weighs a ton.

780
11:28:46,000 --> 11:29:25,000
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.

781
11:29:25,000 --> 11:30:25,000
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.

782
11:30:31,000 --> 11:31:10,000
How much?
- 60 bucks.

783
11:31:11,000 --> 11:31:59,000
I am tired of having this sit around down
in the basement there.

784
11:32:00,000 --> 11:32:34,000
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?

785
11:32:35,000 --> 11:33:26,000
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.

786
11:33:27,000 --> 11:33:50,000
25?
You've just said 60.

787
11:33:51,000 --> 11:34:21,000
I know, it will save me money putting an ad
in the paper.

788
11:34:22,000 --> 11:34:57,000
Come on, let haul it over your place.

789
11:35:47,000 --> 11:36:15,000
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?

790
11:36:15,000 --> 11:36:54,000
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from
you.

791
11:36:55,000 --> 11:37:33,000
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.

792
11:37:34,000 --> 11:37:57,000
It is nice of you to kind
look after him like this.

793
11:37:57,000 --> 11:38:19,000
He doesn't have any real
role models in his life.

794
11:38:20,000 --> 11:38:56,000
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.

795
11:38:57,000 --> 11:39:32,000
I wish our father would have been more like
you. Don't go calling me Wally.

796
11:39:33,000 --> 11:40:11,000
No, I am serious. He was really hard on us.
Really traditional...

797
11:40:12,000 --> 11:40:46,000
and really old school.
Well, I am old school.

798
11:40:46,000 --> 11:41:24,000
yeah, but you an American.

799
11:41:26,000 --> 11:41:49,000
What's that supposed to me?

800
11:42:22,000 --> 11:42:48,000
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?

801
11:42:49,000 --> 11:43:12,000
He tried to steal my car.

802
11:43:13,000 --> 11:43:39,000
And you spend time with him,
teaching him how to fix things.

803
11:43:39,000 --> 11:44:21,000
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.

804
11:44:21,000 --> 11:45:08,000
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.

805
11:45:09,000 --> 11:45:50,000
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.

806
11:46:53,000 --> 11:47:33,000
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a
woman's work.

807
11:47:40,000 --> 11:48:20,000
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden
over there all the time.

808
11:48:21,000 --> 11:49:04,000
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.

809
11:49:26,000 --> 11:49:49,000
You know you should quit.

810
11:49:50,000 --> 11:50:46,000
That's bad for you.
Yeah? So it is being in a gang, dipshit.

811
11:50:48,000 --> 11:51:09,000
Didn't you hear what I've just said?

812
11:51:10,000 --> 11:51:55,000
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.

813
11:52:16,000 --> 11:53:02,000
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?

814
11:53:07,000 --> 11:53:40,000
1'st cavalry. I've had it since 1951.

815
11:53:50,000 --> 11:54:20,000
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.

816
12:00:00,000 --> 12:00:58,000
So you wanna be in sales? What about going
to school, maybe.

817
12:00:59,000 --> 12:01:47,000
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.

818
12:01:48,000 --> 12:02:38,000
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden for the rest of your life.

819
12:02:41,000 --> 12:03:18,000
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.

820
12:03:28,000 --> 12:04:30,000
What kind of job could I ever get? - Yeah
you're right, nobody would ever hire you.

821
12:04:39,000 --> 12:05:08,000
Look I am just kidding zip... I mean.

822
12:05:09,000 --> 12:05:43,000
You can get a job. You can get a job
everywhere.

823
12:05:44,000 --> 12:05:57,000
Like what?

824
12:05:58,000 --> 12:06:21,000
How about construction?
- Me?

825
12:06:22,000 --> 12:06:39,000
Yeah.
- Construction?

826
12:06:39,000 --> 12:06:58,000
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer?s or something?.

827
12:06:58,000 --> 12:07:41,000
No, get a job in the construction. I know
people in the trades.

828
12:07:42,000 --> 12:08:25,000
Of course I have to make a little
adjustment and man you up a little bit.

829
12:08:26,000 --> 12:08:48,000
Man me up?
- Yeah.

830
12:08:49,000 --> 12:09:30,000
And I think you ought to date
Miss Yum Yum too.

831
12:09:34,000 --> 12:09:57,000
Do you little good.

832
12:10:19,000 --> 12:10:30,000
Get carbon off the vaults.

833
12:11:23,000 --> 12:11:52,000
Now you just gonna learn,
how guys talk.

834
12:11:53,000 --> 12:12:31,000
You just listen the way Martin and I banter
back and forth.

835
12:12:32,000 --> 12:12:54,000
You okay? You are ready?
- Sure.

836
12:12:55,000 --> 12:13:27,000
Let's go in.

837
12:13:40,000 --> 12:14:22,000
Perfect. A pollack and a chink.

838
12:14:22,000 --> 12:14:50,000
How are you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick.

839
12:14:50,000 --> 12:15:15,000
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have
known you?d come in,

840
12:15:15,000 --> 12:15:40,000
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?

841
12:15:41,000 --> 12:16:03,000
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.

842
12:16:04,000 --> 12:16:29,000
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?

843
12:16:30,000 --> 12:17:30,000
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.

844
12:17:38,000 --> 12:18:14,000
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .

845
12:18:16,000 --> 12:18:37,000
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?

846
12:18:38,000 --> 12:19:19,000
Now go out and come back in and talk to him
like a man.

847
12:19:20,000 --> 12:19:35,000
Like a real man.

848
12:19:36,000 --> 12:20:10,000
Come on. Get your ass out of here.

849
12:20:11,000 --> 12:20:38,000
Come on back now. Sorry about this.

850
12:20:39,000 --> 12:20:58,000
That's ok.

851
12:21:49,000 --> 12:22:14,000
What's up you old Italian prick?

852
12:22:15,000 --> 12:22:53,000
Get out of my shop before I blow your head
off you goddamn dick smoker.

853
12:22:54,000 --> 12:23:26,000
Jesus Christ.
Shit.

854
12:23:29,000 --> 12:24:15,000
Take it easy. What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

855
12:24:15,000 --> 12:24:42,000
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.

856
12:24:43,000 --> 12:25:25,000
You don't just come in and insult a man in
his own shop.

857
12:25:26,000 --> 12:25:45,000
What happens if you meet some stranger?

858
12:25:45,000 --> 12:26:16,000
If you get the wrong one he's gonna
blow you gook head right off.

859
12:26:17,000 --> 12:27:04,000
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.

860
12:27:05,000 --> 12:27:42,000
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a
haircut if you have a time'

861
12:27:43,000 --> 12:28:04,000
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.

862
12:28:05,000 --> 12:28:34,000
In fact you can talk about the construction
job you just came from.

863
12:28:35,000 --> 12:29:04,000
And bitch about your girl friend in your
car.

864
12:29:05,000 --> 12:29:29,000
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed

865
12:29:30,000 --> 12:30:06,000
and those sons of the bitches really nailed
me. They screwed right in the ass.

866
12:30:06,000 --> 12:30:48,000
Yeah, don't swear at the guy. Just talk
about people who are not in the room.

867
12:30:49,000 --> 12:31:31,000
You can bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it is bowling night.

868
12:31:32,000 --> 12:32:18,000
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn
hours about how..

869
12:32:18,000 --> 12:32:42,000
they don't take expired coupons at the
grocery store.

870
12:32:42,000 --> 12:33:28,000
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she
starts crying we never talk.

871
12:33:29,000 --> 12:33:52,000
See now go out, come back and talk to him.

872
12:33:53,000 --> 12:34:24,000
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ
sake.

873
12:34:25,000 --> 12:35:15,000
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a
girlfriend.

874
12:35:16,000 --> 12:35:45,000
Jesus, I should have blown his head off
when I had a chance.

875
12:35:46,000 --> 12:36:31,000
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go
outside

876
12:36:32,000 --> 12:37:03,000
and come back and don't talk about having
no job,

877
12:37:04,000 --> 12:38:23,000
no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.

878
12:40:44,000 --> 12:41:15,000
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you
ain't too busy.

879
12:41:16,000 --> 12:41:58,000
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.

880
12:42:03,000 --> 12:42:48,000
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at
my construction job.

881
12:43:32,000 --> 12:44:14,000
Fuck me.

882
12:45:53,000 --> 12:46:25,000
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

883
12:46:25,000 --> 12:47:10,000
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say: Yes sir and I'll do my best.

884
12:47:11,000 --> 12:47:41,000
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody

885
12:47:42,000 --> 12:48:18,000
that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.

886
12:48:19,000 --> 12:48:45,000
No I am good. Totally into this.

887
12:48:45,000 --> 12:48:58,000
Don't lay down either.

888
12:48:58,000 --> 12:49:49,000
Just look em straight in the eye. And a man
can tell a lot by your handshake.

889
12:49:50,000 --> 12:50:28,000
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.

890
12:50:29,000 --> 12:50:53,000
Don't blow this.

891
12:50:59,000 --> 12:51:37,000
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?

892
12:51:38,000 --> 12:52:16,000
I am shitty. But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.

893
12:52:17,000 --> 12:52:58,000
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.

894
12:53:04,000 --> 12:53:29,000
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.

895
12:53:30,000 --> 12:54:12,000
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy,
he is super on this job.

896
12:54:17,000 --> 12:54:45,000
What we got here, Walt?

897
12:54:51,000 --> 12:55:32,000
Well he knows construction and he is a
smart kid.

898
12:55:33,000 --> 12:55:52,000
He'll do anything you need him for.

899
12:55:53,000 --> 12:56:15,000
You sure?
- Yeah.

900
12:56:16,000 --> 12:56:47,000
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

901
12:56:48,000 --> 12:57:11,000
Were you born here?
- You bet.

902
12:57:12,000 --> 12:57:44,000
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?

903
12:57:45,000 --> 12:58:33,000
Not at the moment. Taking a bus for now.
- Bus? Jesus Christ. You don't have a car?

904
12:58:34,000 --> 12:58:55,000

909
13:01:14,000 --> 13:02:10,000
Come on in on Monday and we?ll find
something for you to do.

910
13:02:11,000 --> 13:02:27,000
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.

911
13:02:28,000 --> 13:03:04,000
That's Tim, and what's you name again?

13:04:15,000 --> 13:04:28,000
Fuck a fruit cake.

915
13:04:29,000 --> 13:05:10,000
How about you just hand over the keys to
that Gran Torino.

916
13:05:11,000 --> 13:05:51,000
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.

917
13:05:52,000 --> 13:06:33,000
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.

918
13:06:36,000 --> 13:07:21,000
Let the Mick stay here and play with
himself.

919
13:10:41,000 --> 13:10:58,000
What are we doing?

920
13:10:58,000 --> 13:11:41,000
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?

921
13:13:08,000 --> 13:13:40,000

You can use one of these ...

922
13:13:44,000 --> 13:14:13,000
and you'll need one of this here.

923
13:14:22,000 --> 13:14:38,000
I can't afford any of this.

924
13:14:39,000 --> 13:15:09,000
I'll cover it. You can pay me back with
your first pay check.

925
13:15:10,000 --> 13:15:46,000
Cool

13:16:25,000 --> 13:16:37,000
There you go.

928
13:16:38,000 --> 13:17:02,000
Not to bitch. But won't I be needing some
tools.

929
13:17:02,000 --> 13:17:25,000
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend
you my tool belt.

930
13:17:25,000 --> 13:17:51,000
You can pick up tools as you go.

931
13:17:54,000 --> 13:18:16,000
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.

932
13:18:17,000 --> 13:18:50,000
No, I really do
Thank you.

933
13:24:50,000 --> 13:25:08,000

- I am coming

938
13:27:21,000 --> 13:27:50,000
Home from work
I know you guys don't know much about that.

939
13:27:51,000 --> 13:28:19,000
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?

940
13:28:19,000 --> 13:28:41,000
What?

941
13:29:01,000 --> 13:29:12,000
He is scared, huh?

942
13:29:12,000 --> 13:29:37,000
Who bought this shit for you? Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?

943
13:29:37,000 --> 13:29:57,000
Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.

944
13:29:57,000 --> 13:30:41,000
What's the fuck is that shit?

13:32:26,000 --> 13:32:53,000
Let me go.

949
13:32:54,000 --> 13:33:20,000
Give me that, man.
Give me that.

950
13:33:41,000 --> 13:34:08,000
What's the phrase I am looking for?

951
13:34:09,000 --> 13:34:45,000
Oh yeah, 'saving face'

952
13:35:50,000 --> 13:36:08,000
Hey, there.

953
13:36:09,000 --> 13:36:37,000
Hey.
I gotta run.

954
13:36:38,000 --> 13:37:07,000
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?

955
13:37:08,000 --> 13:37:29,000
Been busy.

956
13:37:36,000 --> 13:37:56,000
Busy, huh?

957
13:38:28,000 --> 13:38:59,000
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.

958
13:38:59,000 --> 13:39:28,000
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.

959
13:39:28,000 --> 13:39:55,000
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.

960
13:39:56,000 --> 13:40:15,000
When?

961
13:40:16,000 --> 13:40:53,000
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after
I go off work.

962
13:40:54,000 --> 13:41:12,000
Cowards.

963
13:41:12,000 --> 13:41:36,000
I did everything I can possibly do.

964
13:41:36,000 --> 13:42:05,000
But they broke some of your tools.

965
13:42:06,000 --> 13:42:48,000
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.

966
13:43:18,000 --> 13:43:42,000
Where is your cousin lives?

967
13:44:05,000 --> 13:44:39,000
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.

968
13:44:40,000 --> 13:45:21,000
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.

969
13:45:29,000 --> 13:46:17,000
You could need extra tools, you just let me
know.

970
13:46:22,000 --> 13:47:34,000
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.

971
13:53:20,000 --> 13:53:48,000
This should be the last stop.

972
13:57:59,000 --> 13:58:40,000
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?

973
13:58:41,000 --> 13:59:14,000
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.

974
13:59:14,000 --> 13:59:44,000
You want to fight with us than I could
sound don't want to see him anymore.

975
13:59:44,000 --> 14:00:02,000
That's it, got it?

976
14:00:03,000 --> 14:01:01,000
I'll take that as yes. Cause if I have to
come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.

977
14:05:00,000 --> 14:05:25,000
Get off of my way.

978
14:08:22,000 --> 14:09:03,000
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?

979
14:09:04,000 --> 14:09:50,000
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.

980
14:10:16,000 --> 14:10:35,000
I've never seen you like this before.

981
14:10:36,000 --> 14:11:07,000
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.

982
14:11:08,000 --> 14:11:40,000
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.

983
14:11:41,000 --> 14:12:02,000
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.

984
14:12:03,000 --> 14:12:18,000
And it never ends.

985
14:12:19,000 --> 14:12:52,000
What happened to your knuckles anyways?

986
14:12:58,000 --> 14:13:24,000
I slipped in a shower. No big problem.

987
14:13:25,000 --> 14:14:14,000
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I
will ask you out.

988
14:14:15,000 --> 14:14:55,000
Wa Xam, don't listen to him. He is a white
devil.

989
14:14:56,000 --> 14:15:15,000
Yeah, I am. I am a white devil.

990
14:15:15,000 --> 14:15:46,000
I've loved to Walt,
but he beat you to it.

991
14:15:47,000 --> 14:16:34,000
Really? No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?

992
14:17:04,000 --> 14:17:37,000
Yeah, they are taking a bus.

993
14:17:38,000 --> 14:18:26,000
No, you can't take a bus. You gonna get you
something more stylish that that.

994
14:18:27,000 --> 14:18:58,000
Like what? Take a limo?

995
14:19:00,000 --> 14:19:24,000
How about that?

996
14:19:47,000 --> 14:20:11,000
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.

997
14:20:12,000 --> 14:21:00,000
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.

998
14:21:01,000 --> 14:21:22,000
Really?

999
14:21:27,000 --> 14:21:49,000
Yeah, really.

1000
14:29:37,000 --> 14:30:00,000
Is everybody all right?

1001
14:30:37,000 --> 14:31:02,000
Tao!

1002
14:31:13,000 --> 14:31:49,000
It's all right.
Where's grandma?

1003
14:32:04,000 --> 14:32:25,000
Where is Sue?

1004
14:32:26,000 --> 14:32:47,000
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.

1005
14:32:47,000 --> 14:33:10,000
To her aunts? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1006
14:33:10,000 --> 14:33:39,000
Get on the phone and call her right now.

1007
14:38:33,000 --> 14:38:53,000
Sue ...

1008
14:38:54,000 --> 14:39:27,000
I knew, this was gonna happen.

1009
14:39:32,000 --> 14:40:04,000
What the hell am I doing here?

1010
14:40:05,000 --> 14:40:46,000
Maybe some of her friends called her and
she changed her plans.

1011
14:40:47,000 --> 14:41:07,000
Yeah.

1012
14:41:27,000 --> 14:42:31,000
At the war we just  all of us lost a lot of
friends but you gotta stand for it.

1013
14:42:32,000 --> 14:42:51,000
You can care to it.

1014
15:03:26,000 --> 15:03:50,000
Mr. Kowalski?

1015
15:05:26,000 --> 15:05:42,000
Are you Ok?

1016
15:05:43,000 --> 15:06:22,000
Yeah, I am Ok.

1017
15:06:23,000 --> 15:07:04,000
Police finally left, no one is talking.

1018
15:07:06,000 --> 15:07:36,000
One thing about Hmong, they keep their
mouths shut.

1019
15:07:37,000 --> 15:08:04,000
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1020
15:09:09,000 --> 15:10:04,000
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find
peace in this world

1021
15:10:04,000 --> 15:10:33,000
as long as those gangs around.

1022
15:10:36,000 --> 15:11:18,000
Until they go away. You know forever.

1023
15:11:38,000 --> 15:12:03,000
What are you saying?

1024
15:12:06,000 --> 15:12:32,000
You know what I am saying.

1025
15:12:42,000 --> 15:13:05,000
I took Sue to the hospital.

1026
15:13:08,000 --> 15:13:29,000
She is scared.

1027
15:13:29,000 --> 15:14:12,000
They are all scared..
Yeah

1028
15:14:23,000 --> 15:15:13,000
Tao especially. He?s sitting out there
right now staring at your front door.

1029
15:15:25,000 --> 15:15:58,000
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.

1030
15:16:04,000 --> 15:16:24,000
What would you do?

1031
15:16:31,000 --> 15:17:22,000
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.

1032
15:17:24,000 --> 15:18:09,000
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really

1033
15:18:10,000 --> 15:18:43,000
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.

1034
15:18:47,000 --> 15:19:24,000
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder
with you and kill those guys.

1035
15:19:31,000 --> 15:20:13,000
And you?
- What would I do?

1036
15:20:39,000 --> 15:21:10,000
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.

1037
15:21:20,000 --> 15:22:05,000
I know you are close with these people, but
this pisses me off too. Mr.Kowalski.

1038
15:22:27,000 --> 15:23:03,000
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.

1039
15:23:04,000 --> 15:23:42,000
There some in the chest, right over there
behind you.

1040
15:27:50,000 --> 15:28:11,000
Damn all this.

1041
15:28:21,000 --> 15:29:08,000
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.

1042
15:29:36,000 --> 15:30:02,000
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?

1043
15:30:17,000 --> 15:30:41,000
Call me Walt.

1044
15:30:48,000 --> 15:31:08,000
All right.

1045
15:31:16,000 --> 15:31:39,000
What you gonna do,  Walt?

1046
15:31:42,000 --> 15:32:06,000
I don't know.

1047
15:32:08,000 --> 15:32:32,000
But I'll think of something.

1048
15:32:39,000 --> 15:33:20,000
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.

1049
15:35:13,000 --> 15:35:32,000
What are you doing?

1050
15:35:37,000 --> 15:35:52,000
Thinking.

1051
15:35:53,000 --> 15:36:22,000
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.

1052
15:36:23,000 --> 15:36:52,000
Now it's time to knock shit out of these
pricks.

1053
15:36:57,000 --> 15:37:34,000
I know you don't want to hear this, but now
it's the time to stay calm.

1054
15:37:35,000 --> 15:37:59,000
Calm? You want me to be calm?

1055
15:38:00,000 --> 15:38:28,000
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.

1056
15:38:29,000 --> 15:38:58,000
We have to step back from this thing.

1057
15:38:59,000 --> 15:39:33,000
No, don't let me down Walt. Not you.

1058
15:39:34,000 --> 15:39:57,000
This is gonna end today.

1059
15:40:00,000 --> 15:40:12,000
Sit down.

1060
15:40:13,000 --> 15:40:49,000
I don't want to sit. I said sit down.

1061
15:41:23,000 --> 15:41:41,000
Now, listen to me.

1062
15:41:41,000 --> 15:42:11,000
We gotta plan this and plan it very
carefully.

1063
15:42:12,000 --> 15:42:31,000
Can't make any mistakes.

1064
15:42:31,000 --> 15:43:05,000
You know I am the right man for this job.

1065
15:43:06,000 --> 15:43:59,000
I want to go home and stay calm, and come
back here at 4 this afternoon.

1066
15:44:01,000 --> 15:44:48,000
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.

1067
15:44:48,000 --> 15:45:19,000
And what? Kill that cousin of yours and the
rest of those zips.

1068
15:45:20,000 --> 15:46:19,000
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the
sudden. I know nothing about it.

1069
15:46:46,000 --> 15:47:12,000
Now go home.

1070
15:47:17,000 --> 15:48:14,000
You stay calm come back here at 4.

1071
15:48:15,000 --> 15:48:40,000
Ok?

1072
15:48:59,000 --> 15:49:21,000
Okay.

1073
15:54:20,000 --> 15:54:40,000
I know, I know. Give me a break,

1074
15:54:40,000 --> 15:55:18,000
please,  it?s the first time
I?ve ever smoked in the house.

1075
15:55:36,000 --> 15:56:22,000
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.

1076
15:56:49,000 --> 15:57:14,000
All finished. 10 dollars American.

1077
15:57:14,000 --> 15:57:36,000
I don?t suppose your guinea  hands are
steady enough

1078
15:57:36,000 --> 15:58:00,000
to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?

1079
15:58:00,000 --> 15:58:17,000
You've never asked about straight shave
ever.

1080
15:58:17,000 --> 15:58:36,000
I know but I always wondered about it.

1081
15:58:37,000 --> 15:59:24,000
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.

1082
15:59:25,000 --> 15:59:45,000
Here is 20.

1083
15:59:45,000 --> 16:00:33,000
Keep the change. It is just in case you hit
my jugular.

1084
16:01:53,000 --> 16:02:49,000
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour. We
gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.

1085
16:02:53,000 --> 16:03:19,000
Gonna fix at the shoulder.

1086
16:03:20,000 --> 16:03:49,000
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.

1087
16:03:49,000 --> 16:04:12,000
Yes, sir.

1088
16:04:17,000 --> 16:04:40,000
Look very good.

1089
16:05:52,000 --> 16:06:39,000
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.

1090
16:06:40,000 --> 16:07:16,000
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.

1091
16:07:16,000 --> 16:08:00,000
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?

1092
16:08:30,000 --> 16:08:56,000
How long has it been since your last
confession?

1093
16:08:57,000 --> 16:09:18,000
Forever.

1094
16:09:34,000 --> 16:10:29,000
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?

1095
16:10:59,000 --> 16:11:57,000
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski
at the factory Christmas party.

1096
16:11:58,000 --> 16:12:31,000
Dorothy was in the other room with the
other wives.

1097
16:12:35,000 --> 16:12:55,000
it just happened.

1098
16:12:59,000 --> 16:13:17,000
Yes, go on.

1099
16:13:18,000 --> 16:14:03,000
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a
boat and motor.

1100
16:14:06,000 --> 16:14:45,000
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as
stealing.

1101
16:14:49,000 --> 16:15:12,000
Yes, fine.

1102
16:15:17,000 --> 16:15:41,000
Lastly...

1103
16:15:49,000 --> 16:16:28,000
I was never very close with my two sons.

1104
16:16:30,000 --> 16:17:13,000
I don't know them. I didn't know how.

1105
16:17:27,000 --> 16:18:03,000
That's it?
- That's it.

1106
16:18:05,000 --> 16:18:41,000
It's bothered me most of my life.

1107
16:18:50,000 --> 16:19:23,000
Say 10 "Hail Maries"
and 5 "Our fathers".

1108
16:19:24,000 --> 16:20:06,000
God loves and forgives you and absolves you
of all your sins.

1109
16:20:07,000 --> 16:20:55,000
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy
Spirit.

1110
16:21:03,000 --> 16:21:31,000
Thank you padre.

1111
16:22:02,000 --> 16:22:29,000
Are you going to retaliate for what
happened to Sue.

1112
16:22:39,000 --> 16:23:02,000
I?m going over to that house today, Mr.
Kowalski.

1113
16:23:03,000 --> 16:23:29,000
Is that so?
- It is.

1114
16:23:29,000 --> 16:23:59,000
And every other day until you see the folly
of what you are planning.

1115
16:23:59,000 --> 16:24:43,000
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.

1116
16:24:57,000 --> 16:25:26,000
Oh I am at peace.

1117
16:25:46,000 --> 16:26:12,000
Jesus Christ.

1118
16:28:26,000 --> 16:28:51,000
So which one is mine?

1119
16:29:00,000 --> 16:29:54,000
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No

1120
16:30:12,000 --> 16:30:38,000
Why don't you put that one down.

1121
16:30:39,000 --> 16:31:04,000
I got something more to show you.

1122
16:31:05,000 --> 16:31:25,000
What?

1123
16:31:58,000 --> 16:32:50,000
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink
machine gun nest.

1124
16:32:51,000 --> 16:33:33,000
They trod us up pretty good. I was the only
one who came back out there.

1125
16:33:34,000 --> 16:34:18,000
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.

1126
16:34:35,000 --> 16:35:05,000
Here I want you to have it.

1127
16:35:10,000 --> 16:35:31,000
Why?

1128
16:35:36,000 --> 16:36:11,000
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.

1129
16:36:12,000 --> 16:36:36,000
That's the way it might be tonight.

1130
16:36:37,000 --> 16:37:12,000
There is always a chance you don't come
back. The hell we won?t.

1131
16:37:13,000 --> 16:37:30,000
We?re will  roll in there and tear ass.

1132
16:37:31,000 --> 16:38:15,000
Yeah, that's foolish. That's the exact
reaction they are waiting for.

1133
16:38:16,000 --> 16:38:34,000
Come on and close this up.

1134
16:38:35,000 --> 16:39:09,000
How many?
- How many what?

1135
16:39:13,000 --> 16:39:42,000
How many men did you kill in Korea?

1136
16:39:44,000 --> 16:40:33,000
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.

1137
16:40:41,000 --> 16:41:11,000
You don't want to know.

1138
16:41:12,000 --> 16:41:39,000
Now close it up.

1139
16:44:06,000 --> 16:44:45,000
Walt! Walt!
What are you doing?

1140
16:44:47,000 --> 16:45:08,000
What are you doing?

1141
16:45:09,000 --> 16:45:42,000
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !

1142
16:45:43,000 --> 16:46:17,000
Let me out. You fuck let me out, I'll
fucking kill you.

1143
16:46:18,000 --> 16:46:31,000
Shut the fuck up!

1144
16:46:32,000 --> 16:46:55,000
You want to know what is like to kill a man?

1145
16:46:56,000 --> 16:47:20,000
Well, that's goddamn awful.

1146
16:47:20,000 --> 16:47:51,000
The only thing worse is get a medal of
valor for killing some poor kids..

1147
16:47:51,000 --> 16:48:21,000
that wanted just to give up that's all

1148
16:48:22,000 --> 16:48:49,000
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.

1149
16:48:50,000 --> 16:49:30,000
I shot them right in a face with that rifle
you were holding in there a while ago.

1150
16:49:30,000 --> 16:50:16,000
So if the day goes by that I don't think
about it. You don't that on your soul.

1151
16:50:21,000 --> 16:50:49,000
I got blood on my hands. I am soiled.

1152
16:50:50,000 --> 16:51:22,000
That's why I am going alone tonight.

1153
16:51:23,000 --> 16:52:03,000
Walt you take me with you right now,
let me out.

1154
16:52:04,000 --> 16:52:32,000
Look, you've come a long way.

1155
16:52:33,000 --> 16:53:10,000
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.

1156
16:53:11,000 --> 16:54:11,000
But me, I finished things.  That's what I
do and I am going alone.

1157
16:54:12,000 --> 16:54:44,000
No, wait. Walt! Walt!

1158
16:57:56,000 --> 16:58:24,000
I need you to watch my dog.

1159
16:58:45,000 --> 16:59:09,000
Yeah I love you too.

1160
17:00:00,000 --> 17:00:30,000
Yeah, she is old too.

1161
17:01:00,000 --> 17:01:28,000
Her name is Daisy.

1162
17:04:11,000 --> 17:04:28,000
Hello.
- It is Walt.

1163
17:04:28,000 --> 17:05:03,000
The keys to my house are under the ceramic
turtle on the from porch.

1164
17:05:04,000 --> 17:05:53,000
Let yourself in. Your brother is in the
basement. I gotta go.

1165
17:08:29,000 --> 17:08:54,000
Sorry father, we have to go.

1166
17:08:58,000 --> 17:09:33,000
I am telling if we are not here there will
be a bloodshed.

1167
17:09:34,000 --> 17:09:49,000
We've been here for hours.

1168
17:09:50,000 --> 17:10:16,000
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to
one location.

1169
17:10:17,000 --> 17:10:38,000
I am bagging you to stay.

1170
17:10:39,000 --> 17:11:13,000
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're
pulling the plug.

1171
17:11:15,000 --> 17:11:46,000
I am staying. No you aren't.

1172
17:11:58,000 --> 17:12:38,000
We have specific orders you came with us,
you are leaving with us.

1173
17:12:39,000 --> 17:13:00,000
Watch your head.

1174
17:14:31,000 --> 17:15:01,000
Sue, over here, over here.

1175
17:15:01,000 --> 17:15:16,000
Unlock this right now.

1176
17:15:17,000 --> 17:15:32,000
He left without me.

1177
17:15:33,000 --> 17:15:58,000
He went to Smokie without me.

1178
17:16:09,000 --> 17:16:30,000
Tao!

1179
17:21:26,000 --> 17:21:56,000
Any swamp rats in there.

1180
17:22:01,000 --> 17:22:36,000
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.

1181
17:22:42,000 --> 17:23:27,000
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick,
lizard like you.

1182
17:23:54,000 --> 17:24:36,000
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead watch out for your
boyfriend.

1183
17:24:36,000 --> 17:25:26,000
Cause it was either he or you or something
who raped one of their own family.

1184
17:25:27,000 --> 17:25:55,000
You own blood, for Christ sake.

1185
17:25:55,000 --> 17:26:34,000
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like
miniature cowboys.

1186
17:26:34,000 --> 17:26:51,000
Go ahead.

1187
17:26:51,000 --> 17:27:20,000
So where's Tao at? That pussy motherfucker
not gonna come.

1188
17:27:20,000 --> 17:27:41,000
Don't worry about Tao.

1189
17:27:42,000 --> 17:28:15,000
Tao's got not one second for you.

1190
17:28:17,000 --> 17:28:54,000
Says who?
You?

1191
17:29:01,000 --> 17:29:31,000
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?

1192
17:29:52,000 --> 17:30:18,000
What are you gonna do? You bitch.
-

1193
17:30:29,000 --> 17:30:58,000
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.

1194
17:30:59,000 --> 17:31:30,000
You should the fuck up!

1195
17:33:14,000 --> 17:33:40,000
Got a light?
- What the fuck?

1196
17:34:23,000 --> 17:34:46,000
No

1197
17:34:47,000 --> 17:35:36,000
Me.. I've got a light...

1198
17:36:01,000 --> 17:36:38,000
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'

1199
17:47:27,000 --> 17:47:41,000
Yes, sergeant.

1200
17:47:42,000 --> 17:48:01,000
What happened?
- You need to step back.

1201
17:48:02,000 --> 17:48:35,000
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.

1202
17:48:51,000 --> 17:49:08,000
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.

1203
17:49:09,000 --> 17:49:35,000
What happened?
- Hey, step back.

1204
17:49:36,000 --> 17:49:57,000
He is my friend.

1205
17:52:31,000 --> 17:53:14,000
Officer Chang! get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.

1206
17:56:28,000 --> 17:57:00,000
Get the fuck out of here!

1207
18:13:16,000 --> 18:14:00,000
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't
know anything about life or death.

1208
18:14:01,000 --> 18:14:23,000
Because I was an overeducated,

1209
18:14:23,000 --> 18:15:13,000
27-year-old virgin who held the hands
of superstitious old women and

1210
18:15:14,000 --> 18:15:43,000
promised they eternity.

1211
18:15:46,000 --> 18:16:22,000
Walt definitely had no problem calling
it like he saw it.

1212
18:16:23,000 --> 18:16:46,000
But he was right.

1213
18:16:46,000 --> 18:17:44,000
I knew really nothing about life or death,
until I got to know Walt.

1214
18:17:49,000 --> 18:18:16,000
And boy did I learn.

1215
18:19:15,000 --> 18:20:06,000
And I want to leave my house  to the church
becouse Dorothy would've liked it...

1216
18:20:28,000 --> 18:21:15,000
... now which brings to out last item . And
again please excuse the language.

1217
18:21:16,000 --> 18:21:59,000
in  Mr. Kowalski's will,  I?m simply
reading it as it was written.

1218
18:22:10,000 --> 18:23:09,000
<i>And I'd like to leave my 1972
Gran Torino to ...</i>

1219
18:23:49,000 --> 18:24:13,000
my friend ...

1220
18:24:23,000 --> 18:24:57,000
<i>Tao Vang Lor.</i>

1221
18:24:58,000 --> 18:25:16,000
<i>Under the condition that you don?

one of those beaners</i>

1223
18:25:43,000 --> 18:26:31,000
<i> don?t paint any idiotic flames on
it like some white-trash hillbilly </ i></i>

1224
18:26:32,000 --> 18:26:57,000
<i> and don?t put a big gay
spoiler on the rear end

zipper heads? cars </ i></i>

1226
18:27:28,000 --> 18:27:44,000
<i>It just looks like hell</i>

1227
18:27:45,000 --> 18:28:37,000
<i>If you If you can  refrain from doing
any of that, it?s yours</i>
